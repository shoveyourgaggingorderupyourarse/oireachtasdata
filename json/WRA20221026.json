A further reduction of 1 cent per litre (VAT inclusive) applied from 1 April 2022 to offset the impact of anticipated increased prices as a result of the increase in the Biofuel Obligation Scheme administered by my colleague, the Minister for Transport and Environment, Climate and Communications.

The Scheme was administered by the Department of Transport and provided a temporary financial support of &euro;100 per week, for eight weeks, for each eligible heavy goods vehicle authorised on the licence of a road haulage operator as of 11 March 2022. There was good uptake of the scheme, with over &euro;15.6 million paid out to c. 3,080 operators (approx. 80% of licensed operators.)<\/p>  <p>  - The Diesel Rebate Scheme (&lsquo;DRS&rsquo;) has been in operation since 2013 and remains available to qualifying road haulage and passenger transport operators. The DRS operates on a sliding scale basis, whereby the rebate kicks in when the retail price of diesel exceeds &euro;1.00 VAT exclusive and the repayment amount increases gradually as the retail price increases up to a maximum repayment amount of 7.5 cents per litre.

(Sisk) has been appointed as the main contractor for site enabling works and for the procurement, transportation and installation of 500 modular homes under the programme approved by the Government as part of the State&rsquo;s humanitarian response to the Ukrainian crisis. The 500 homes will have the capacity to accommodate 2,000 Ukrainians (in family units of  4). Sisk has sub-contracted five companies spread across Ireland to build modular homes for the programme to the OPW&rsquo;s specification. An order for the manufacture of 250 modular homes for the first phase of the programme will be placed with the manufacturers imminently. The lead in-line for the manufacturing process is estimated at around 10 weeks. Further orders will be placed later this year for the balance of the homes required to complete the programme and for any further expansion of it that may be authorised by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  The timeframe for the installation of the modular homes has recently been recalibrated in the light of experience to date with evaluation and assessment of the suitability of sites, engagement with representatives of communities located adjacent to sites and the timescale for the manufacture of the homes required. Accordingly, It is now expected these homes will be installed on a phased basis during January and February 2023 as site enabling works across a range of locations are completed. All modular sites will have roads, footpaths, street lighting and community facilities, including a play area and green spaces fully in line with Local Authority planning guidance.  The modular homes will be well built, highly energy efficient, durable units. The development of the sites will be fully compliant with social housing regulations and conducted in an environmentally sustainable way to ensure that, post development, the site will enhance the local area.<\/p>  <p>   I visited several of the modular home manufacturers, as part of the early development phase, by my Office, of an exemplar model of the modular homes. This model was used to specify the required standards and inform the construction industry in advance of the appointment of the main Contractor. Sisk was subsequently appointed as the Main Contractor, and in a separate process the company has tendered to the market for the supply of the modular homes, using the specifications, quality and assurances developed by the OPW.<\/p>  <p>  A number of interrelated activities are taking place simultaneously relating to the selection, assessment and design development of a range of sites around the country.  Currently, sites in Cork, Cavan, Thurles and Sligo are being progressed.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, as the lead Department,  has engaged and continues to engage with local representatives in communities where modular housing is progressing.

The grant will benefit those who wish to turn a formerly vacant house or building into their principal private residence. A grant of up to a maximum of &euro;30,000 is available for the refurbishment of vacant properties for occupation as a principal private residence, including the conversion of a property which has not previously been used as residential. Where the refurbishment costs are expected to exceed the standard grant of up to &euro;30,000, a maximum top-up grant amount of up to &euro;20,000 is available where the property is confirmed to be derelict, bringing the total grant available for a derelict property up to a maximum of &euro;50,000.<\/p>  <p>  On 21 September, I launched the Ready to Build Scheme, also funded by the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund.

The NPF, together with the National Development Plan 2021, combine to form Project Ireland 2040 the overarching policy and planning framework for the social, economic and cultural development of Ireland.   <\/p>  <p>  The NPF strategy was incorporated into the associated Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSESs) of the Regional Assemblies in 2019 and 2020.  The subsequent review of individual city and county development plans to align with the NPF is ongoing by the local authorities, the majority of which will be adopted by the end of 2023.  When completed, it will be the first time that there has been an integrated hierarchy of statutory spatial plans in Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  While it is necessary to be cognisant of the emerging population information from Census 2022, it is also important to examine such information critically and in light of the wider planning policy and housing development framework that is in place. <\/p>  <p>  Planning authorities must determine the required housing supply for their administrative area in their statutory development plan process and ensure it is consistent with wider national and regional housing objectives. This approach is set out in Planning Guidelines issued under S.28 of the Planning &amp;amp; Development Act &ndash; the &lsquo;Housing Supply Target Methodology for Development Planning, Guidelines for Planning Authorities&rsquo; (December 2020) which specifies the agreed approach for a planning authority to determine a Housing Supply Target (HST) for its 6-year development plan. This methodology utilises the independent research undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute into structural housing demand in Ireland to 2040, which further developed their work completed for the NPF. <\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, a planning authority must determine an overall HST for new housing delivery consistent with the prescribed methodology and use this as the basis for the strategic decision-making in their development plan process, including its core strategy, settlement strategy and housing policies. <\/p>  <p>  It is also important to note the role of the Office of the Planning Regulator (OPR) in the overall plan making  process. One core function of the OPR is the independent assessment of all local authority and regional assembly statutory plans, including county and city development plans, local area plans (LAPs) and RSESs.<\/p>  <p>  The OPR provides observations during the drafting of statutory plans. In cases where the OPR finds that a local authority's plans are ultimately not consistent with relevant regional or national policies, the OPR can recommend the use of Ministerial powers of direction to bring plans back in line with statutory requirements and best practice. <\/p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that the Planning and Development Act, 2000 includes specific provisions to allow for the regular review and update of the NPF.  The Programme for Government commits to review the NPF by 2024.  This review will look at NPF implementation to date and be informed by the final results of Census 2022 when available next year.  The review will also consider a range of factors that will influence how we manage future growth in a planned, productive and sustainable way.  This will include consideration of Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the Climate Action Plan and the influence of geopolitical factors on future growth.  It is intended to publish a &lsquo;roadmap&rsquo; document by the end of 2022 that will address the review process in more detail. <\/p>  <p>  While the wider context and evolution of the NPF and Government Policy has implications for the formulation of such development plans, it is also worth noting that there is a mechanism available to vary a County or City Development Plan during its lifetime. During the lifetime of the development plan, planning authorities may wish to adjust the objectives and policies of the plan in order to take account of different circumstances or issues unforeseen at the time of the original making of the development plan. For these reasons, Section 13 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides for the making of a variation to the development plan. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600077#WRD01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electoral Commission","counter":153,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600077#WRD01012"},{"type":"question","counter":154,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[53813\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600077#WRD01025","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will provide an up-to-date timeline for the establishment of the Electoral Commission, along with expected budget and staffing requirements for 2023; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":155,"content":"<p>Awaiting reply from Department.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electoral Process","counter":156,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600077#WRD01050"},{"type":"question","counter":157,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[53814\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600077#WRD01075","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will provide an update on the implementation of the provision for a pending electors list for persons aged 16 and 17 years, as set out under the Electoral Reform Act 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":158,"content":"<p>Awaiting reply from Department.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":159,"content":"<p>Question No. 94 answered with Question No. 77.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wastewater Treatment","counter":160,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600077#WRD01200"},{"type":"question","counter":161,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[53888\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600077#WRD01300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the steps that he is taking in response to the EPA finding that just 51% of Ireland&rsquo;s sewage was treated to the European Union standards set to protect our environment, well below the EU average of 90%.","asker":"1525","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":162,"content":"<p>Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels.

Many serious challenges do remain which will take significant investment and the EPA in its report has identified the priority areas where Irish Water should target their available resources to deliver improvements where they are most needed and will bring the greatest environmental benefits.<\/p>  <p>  The overall investment will deliver significant improvements in our public water and waste water services, support improved water supplies right across Ireland, including rural Ireland, and support a range of programmes delivering improved water quality in our rivers, lakes and marine area. It is key to addressing Ireland's shortcomings in water and waste water infrastructure including compliance with the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. <\/p>  <p>  The vast majority (90%) of the total waste water load that is not yet in compliance with the Directive requirements is represented by one treatment area: the Ringsend agglomeration serving Dublin and the surrounding area. Irish Water is currently investing over &euro;500 million in the staged upgrading of Ringsend Wastewater Treatment Plant which will deliver the capacity to treat the wastewater for a population equivalent of 2.4 million while achieving the standards of the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive by 2025. Irish Water also has plans in place to address any outstanding issues at the remaining non-compliant plants.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives. The team can be contacted via email to oireachtasmembers@water.ie or by telephone on a dedicated number, 1890 578 578. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600077#WRD01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":164,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600077#WRD01600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":163,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600077#WRD01500"},{"type":"question","counter":164,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[53623\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600077#WRD01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the way that a child (details supplied) can obtain an Irish passport.","asker":"1564","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":165,"content":"<p>With regard to the specific application about which the Deputy has enquired, the Passport Service has contacted the Deputy directly to follow up on this inquiry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600077#WRD01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":167,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[53725\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600077#WRD01900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the systems that are in place in for people with disabilities who find it extremely difficult to get a photograph taken, to meet Department standards when applying for a passport; if there is not a system in place, the reason; if this issue was ever raised at committee level, if not, the reason for same; if this issue was raised, the reason that a system was not implemented to cater for people with disabilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":168,"content":"<p>The Passport Online website has been designed to be very accessible.

My Department oversees this process, through which local City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) and Pobal work together to assess and provide support to ELC and SAC services experiencing difficulties. <\/p><p>CCCs administer on-the-ground case management assistance, co-ordinated by Pobal. This can include help with completing and interpreting analysis of staff ratios and cash flow, as well as more specialised advice and support appropriate to individual circumstances.<\/p><p>To date, the total number of services which engaged in Case Management for financial sustainability reasons in 2022 is 115. This is made up of:<\/p><p>- 66 services where financial sustainability was the main concern; and<\/p><p>- 49 cases where financial sustainability was one element of concerns about a service.<\/p><p>In 2022, my Department has received four completed funding requests through the Sustainability Funding available in Case Management. These four requests originated from two services in total. All four requests have been approved.<\/p><p>Given that Core Funding is in operation less than six weeks, it is important to note that these services availing of case management supports and sustainability funding relate primarily to issues arising from the old funding model rather than the new arrangements.  Recent engagement with CCCs confirms that they are not picking up evidence of sustainability difficulties for any service type related to Core Funding or any indications to suggest that services will face closure as a result of Core Funding.<\/p><p>This continues the trend of the last two years or more with very limited call on the strands of sustainability funding, largely due to the very significant investment in the sector through Covid-19 funding arrangements.<\/p><p>In some instances, financial supports may be appropriate, in tandem with the case management process. Prior to 2020, these financial supports were only available for community (not-for-profit) services presenting with sustainability issues following a financial assessment by Pobal.  However, an additional strand of sustainability funding was established to provide support to services requiring it due to the impact of Covid-19 which was open to both private (for-profit) and community (not-for-profit) services.<\/p><p>As a new development to the suite of supports available, a further stand of sustainability funding is being made available to Core Funding partner services, both community and private, who are experiencing financial difficulty.  This is part of the partnership relationship with the sector that has been established under the new funding model, <i>Together for Better<\/i>.  As with previous strands of the Sustainability Fund, it will focus on operational as well as financial supports to assist services to manage their immediate difficulties and transition to sustainability.  Sustainability funding will provide for a further safety net for partner services who do experience financial difficulty and to assist them for a period of time to allow them to become more sustainable. Given the very substantial additional resourcing that Core Funding is providing to the sector, we do not expect to see much demand for this funding, except for a small number of outlier cases.<\/p><p>Services that are experiencing difficulty and who would like support are encouraged to contact their CCC to access case management supports.

This new funding model supports the delivery of early learning and childcare for the public good, for quality and affordability for children, parents and families as well as stability and sustainability for providers. Together for Better brings together three major programmes, the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, including the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM), the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) and the new Core Funding scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Under Together for Better, ECCE sessional services who operate for 15 hours per week over 38 weeks per year can avail of ECCE capitation at a rate of &euro;69 per registered child per week plus Core Funding at a rate of &euro;9.75 per child place per week.  Core Funding is payable whether or not the place is filled.  The statutory regulations that apply for ECCE sessional services allow for a ratio of up to 11 children per adult.  The ECCE scheme rules allow for up to 22 children (and two adults) in a session.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, if a lead educator of an ECCE session is a graduate with a relevant qualification and the necessary experience, an additional amount of &euro;66.60 will be paid to the service per week.  If there is a separate manager who is a graduate with a relevant qualification and the necessary experience a further &euro;66.60 if available to the service per week. <\/p>  <p>  AIM provides further investment in ECCE.  Under AIM, a fully qualified Inclusion Co-ordinator (InCo) in an ECCE service receives an increase in the rate of capitation payable to the service of &euro;2 (pro-rata), per ECCE registered child per week. For the programme call 2022\/2023 to date (October 2022), 53% (2,063) of services delivering ECCE receive capitation for InCos.<\/p>  <p>  Additional capitation is also paid to ECCE providers under AIM Level 7 to support inclusion of children by reducing the adult-child ratio within the ECCE room.  In January 2021, the payments increased by 7% from &euro;195 per week to &euro;210 per week.  A further increase of 7% in September 2022 increased AIM Level 7 capitation from &euro;210 to &euro;240 per week. For the programme call year 2022\/2023 to date (October 2022), 53% (2,079) services delivering ECCE were paid for additional assistance, with a number of these services receiving more than one additional capitation. <\/p>  <p>  ECCE-only services across the country form an integral part of the early learning and childcare system. Their exact operations can vary but typically, they open to children for 15 hours per week, 38 weeks per year. <\/p>  <p>  Since the programme began in 2010, various developments to the ECCE programme between up to 2022 (related to capitation, ratios and non-contact time\/programme support payments), demonstrate an increase in income of up to 22.6% for services without a graduate lead educator and 22% for services with a graduate lead educator.  The introduction of Core Funding on top of ECCE standard capitation means up to &euro;866.25 per week is now available for a session without a graduate lead educator (34.3% higher than in 2010) and up to &euro;932.85 per week is now available for a session with a graduate lead educator (24.4% higher than in 2010).<\/p>  <p>  The funding model for sessional services is now primarily a combination of the ECCE capitation they receive per child registered with them, including AIM, and the Core Funding grant services receive based on the capacity of their service and the qualifications levels of staff, as well as any optional extras they may charge parents such as an additional 30 minutes.   A number of models of ECCE services and their associated funding are presented here: <\/p>  <p>  first5fundingmodel.gov.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Early-Years-Draft-EROs_Implications-for-ECCE-sessional-services.pdf <\/p>  <p>  Under Core Funding, the overwhelming majority of services will see an increase in their funding, most will see very substantial increases, and no services will see a decrease in funding if their circumstances remain the same. ECCE services without a graduate lead educator will see capitation increase by at least 9.5% through Core Funding. ECCE services with a graduate lead educator will almost all see increases in income, although it may be smaller proportionally given the significant level of funding available under the old funding model. <\/p>  <p>  A very small number of services, less than 100 of the over 4,000 signed-up, will see no increase with their income matched to 2021\/2022. For this small number of services who do not experience an increase, a Funding Guarantee will apply. This will top-up Core Funding payments to match the difference in ECCE higher capitation and PSP from last year, provided they offer the same amount of graduate led provision as last year. These are larger ECCE-only services &ndash; with 20+ children in a session.<\/p>  <p>  With regards to financial viability, there is no evidence that the new funding model will render ECCE services unsustainable. My Department has extensive data on providers&rsquo; existing and projected income and delivery costs through data from Revenue, surveys and demographic and macro-economic information and has extensively analysed the question of sustainability. <\/p>  <p>  Data available prior to the additional investment of Core Funding in the sector showed that the median surplus (income in excess of cost) for sector as a whole of 4%. However, services with the characteristics correlated with ECCE-only provision had higher levels of surplus than other types of provision &ndash; ranging from 14% to 23% depending on the characteristic.<\/p>  <p>  - Do not offer full day: 17% income in excess of cost<\/p>  <p>  - Do not offer wrap-around care: 16% income in excess of cost<\/p>  <p>  - Open exactly 38 weeks each year: 19% income in excess of cost<\/p>  <p>  - Low total numbers of childcare hours: 23% income in excess of cost<\/p>  <p>  - Single-site services: 14% income in excess of cost<\/p>  <p>  - Those whose only income source is ECCE funding: 19% income in excess of cost<\/p>  <p>  Separately Sole Traders, which constitute a large proportion of ECCE-only provision had an average income in excess of costs of 23%.<\/p>  <p>  This evidence suggests that ECCE-only services had the highest levels of income in excess of costs compared to other types of provision.<\/p>  <p>  The collection of information on income and costs is essential for the full understanding of this complex and diverse sector in order to inform the development of policy. As recommended by the Expert Group, there needs to be full visibility and understanding of financial information in the sector in order to better understand the impact and interaction of income, costs, surplus and profit in the sector.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased therefore that the recent data collection for the 2021\/2022 Annual Sector Profile, including questions on income and costs, has been completed by 93% of services. This new and emerging data will allow the Department to rerun income and cost analysis and ascertain the latest available financial position to inform the next policy developments.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2023 allocates &euro;1,025m to early learning and childcare &ndash; a clear demonstration from Government of the value of the sector. Further interrogation of the new Core Funding application and income and cost data is required in order to most effectively design developments in Year 2 of Core Funding.<\/p>  <p>  For any services that are experiencing difficulty and who would like support can contact their City\/County Childcare Committee (CCC) to access case management supports. Services can be assisted on an individual basis through this route and it also allows for trends and themes across the country to be identified that can inform a more systematic response if necessary. My officials are not receiving any indications from CCCs that there have been providers reporting financial difficulties and in need of support. This case management process through the CCCs is the route to access additional sustainability funding if required. <\/p>  <p>  Together for Better aims to transform the sector and my Department and I are committed to working constructively, collaboratively and positively with Partner Services towards a goal of delivering early learning and childcare for the public good. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600079#WRF02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":293,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[53798\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600079#WRF02300","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if his attention has been drawn to a letter from a ECCE provider (details supplied); if he will review the core funding policy in view of the contents of the letter; his plans to increase capitation; and if he has conducted and or if he will conduct a sectoral impact review regarding the introduction of his core funding policy change.","asker":"1489","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":294,"content":"<p>I have become aware that some Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) providers intend to fully close, or reduce their service provision by closing their ECCE room\/s, on 11 and 25 November 2022.<\/p><p>I do not believe that closures are justified, given the very significant additional investment secured for the sector in recent years, with funding in 2023 to exceed &euro;1 billion. These closures will be disruptive for young children and their families and will undermine confidence in the sector. <\/p><p>I note that those protesting are seeking an increase in the weekly ECCE capitation from &euro;69 to &euro;76 per child. This level of funding is already available. Through a combination of ECCE capitation and Core Funding, ECCE providers can already avail of weekly funding of <i>at least<\/i>&euro;78.75 per child (&euro;69 ECCE capitation plus &euro;9.75 per ECCE child place per week in Core Funding base rate).  Where services have less than full occupancy, the effective increase on a per child basis is greater.<\/p><p>I would also like to clarify that, while the Higher Capitation and Programme Support Payments have been subsumed into Core Funding, no service loses out under Core Funding. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of providers substantially benefit financially from Core Funding.<\/p><p>I think it is also important to refute the claim of there having been only one increase in the level of ECCE capitation since the programme started in 2010.  The various developments to the ECCE programme between 2010 and 2022 (related to capitation, ratios and non-contact time\/programme support payments), demonstrate an increase in income of up to 22.6% for services without a graduate lead educator and 22% for services with a graduate lead educator.  The introduction of Core Funding on top of ECCE standard capitation means up to &euro;866.25 per week is now available for a session without a graduate lead educator (34.3% higher than in 2010) and up to &euro;932.85 per week is now available for a session with a graduate lead educator (24.4% higher than in 2010). The excludes other funding for ECCE providers, attached to the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) as well as significant supports for ECCE and other providers over the course of the pandemic - estimated to cost in excess of &euro;1 billion.<\/p><p>It is also important to address the issue of the fee freeze condition which has been introduced with Core Funding.  This is an essential step in the implementation of the new funding model to ensure that parents are not faced with further additional costs and that the developments to the National Childcare Scheme are felt by parents rather than being absorbed by fee increases.  The substantial additional investment available through Core Funding adequately compensates for this condition. <\/p><p>ECCE-only services across the country form an integral part of the Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC) system. Their exact operations can vary but typically, they open to children for 15 hours per week, 38 weeks per year.  Core Funding is distributed in a fair, reasonable and transparent manner that is related to services&rsquo; costs of delivery, contributing to both staff costs, including administration staff\/time, and non-staff overheads. Consequently, services opening longer hours or offering more places will receive a higher value of Core Funding than other services as they have higher delivery costs. This is connected to the staffing requirements of ELC and SAC as set out in Regulations.<\/p><p>There is a need for greater visibility and understanding of financial basis on which ELC and SAC services operate, in the context of a complex and diverse sector, in order to better understand the impact and interaction of income, costs, surplus and profit. I am pleased therefore that the recent data collection for the 2021\/2022 Annual Sector Profile, including questions on income and costs, will allow the latest available financial position to inform the next policy developments. <\/p><p>The new funding model was designed with extensive stakeholder consultation and engagement, reports of which are published. Since Core Funding was announced last year as part of Budget 2022, the Department has hosted eight meetings of the Early Learning and Childcare Stakeholder Forum (ELCSF), and several Core Funding specific meetings with the ELCSF and provider representatives. The ELCSF includes multiple sectoral organisations and representative groups, including provider representatives, such as the Federation of Early Childhood Providers (FECP), Early Childhood Ireland (ECI) and the Association of Early Childhood Professionals (ACPI). In particular, during August, September and October, there have been frequent meetings with provider representative groups in preparation for the commencement of Core Funding and to support the initial implementation of the scheme, with the most recent meeting of the provider representative groups held on 20 October. There has also been a number of formal correspondence to and from provider representative groups, as well as individual contacts. I will continue to engage with provider representative groups through the ELCSF. <\/p><p>ELC and SAC providers are fundamental partners in the delivery of the new funding model which is intended to improve quality for children, including through improved terms and conditions for staff; affordability and accessibility for parents; and stability and sustainability for services.  As noted by an Expert Group on funding for the sector, there can be an absence of a strong parental voice in the sector and the new funding model aims to balance the interests of parents, providers, the workforce, and the State, where there is significant public investment in a privately delivered system. The new funding model has been approved by Government and is widely welcomed by sectoral representative groups advocating for parents, children, the workforce and providers. To date, 93% of providers nationally have signed up to Core Funding and this Scheme remains open to all remaining providers who wish to deliver early learning and childcare for the public good.<\/p><p>Together for Better, the new funding model, is about getting the most out of the three early learning and childcare programmes, ECCE including AIM, NCS and Core Funding, working together and ensuring stability and sustainability in the sector. I have been unequivocal that I do not want any services to be faced with financial sustainability issues and I am fully committed to working with any such service to support them in delivering early learning and childcare for the public good. This means accepting new responsibilities including greater public management in relation to fee management, quality improvements, and transparency in relation to operations. <\/p><p>Services that are experiencing difficulty and who would like support are encouraged to contact their City\/County Childcare Committee (CCC) to access case management supports. The Department, Pobal and the CCCs continue to closely monitor trends concerning services entering case management and will continue to maintain the availability of Sustainability Funding for individual services at risk. <\/p><p>I have acted in good faith to ensure that an appropriate funding model is now in place to support the sector in a sustainable way into the future, and which can be further developed in response to analysis of emerging evidence.  Significant additional investment is being made in the sector and a number of supports and safety nets are available for the small number of providers who may experience financial difficulties due to a range of factors.  Together for Better, the new funding model, is already delivering substantial benefits for children, parents, staff and providers.  I hope that providers who are contemplating closures will reconsider their position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600079#WRF02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ukraine War","counter":295,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600079#WRF02500"},{"type":"question","counter":296,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[53799\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600079#WRF02600","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the number of modular units that will be delivered and in place by the end of 2022 to house Ukrainian refugees","asker":"1610","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":297,"content":"<p>Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine on 24 February, and the invoking of the Temporary Protection Directive by the European Union shortly afterwards, my Department has worked intensively as part of the cross-governmental response to the Ukraine crisis. <\/p>  <p>  The operational challenges brought about by responding to the conflict are significant.

One of the conditions for naturalisation is that the person who makes the application on the minor&rsquo;s behalf, must be a parent or guardian of the minor or a person in loco parentis to the minor. Prior to making any application the child must have had one year&rsquo;s continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of the application and four years residence during the eight years preceding that.<\/p>  <p>  On 13 September 2022, I published the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022, which has recently completed Second Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.

This will allow children who are currently on a pathway to Irish citizenship to attain this status at an earlier stage. With this proposed amendment, Ireland will be one of the most generous in the EU in terms of the years of residence required for foreign national children born here to gain citizenship by naturalisation.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of difficulties that have arisen in cases where applications for naturalisation have been sought to be made in relation to children in the care of the Child and Family Agency (Tusla).

I fully appreciate the strong emotional attachment we all have to our pets and that theft not only leads to their loss in our lives, but also a high level of concern for their welfare. It is also a crime which often affects, and is indeed often targeted against, older and particularly vulnerable people, for whom their pet is of huge emotional importance.<\/p><p>It is important to emphasise that theft offences already apply to this crime, and can carry very heavy penalties. The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 provides for a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment in the case of offences of theft and handling of stolen property; while a maximum sentence of 5 years imprisonment is provided for the offence of possession of stolen property.<\/p><p>When imposing sentence, judges are not limited to considering the monetary value of a pet. The emotional distress to the victim caused by the offence is absolutely relevant and can be taken into account when appropriate.  <\/p><p>From an enforcement perspective, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na takes this issue very seriously and has conducted several important actions against those responsible. Garda&iacute; have also disseminated information through the national Crime Prevention Officer Network regarding keeping animals secure and preventing these forms of theft. The Garda National Crime Prevention Unit's advice on pet safety, which is in line with the advice from animal welfare groups and animal insurance companies about keeping animals safe, can be viewed on the Garda website.<\/p><p>It is important to note that such incidents are rare and there is no evidence, from the data to hand, of a so-called &lsquo;epidemic&rsquo; of pet\/dog theft. Whilst there was an increase in reported incidents to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the initial periods of the Covid pandemic, these reports have reduced significantly this year and are returning to pre-pandemic levels.<\/p><p>The Government is very conscious of the special place that pets hold in people&rsquo;s lives, as companions and as a comfort to many. I want to assure you that the Government and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are dedicated to preventing the theft of companion animals through a range of measures, including microchipping and awareness campaigns.<\/p><p>The below table, provided to me by the Garda authorities, provides the number of incidents of dog theft reported to Garda&iacute; nationally over the previous years.

Every dog must be microchipped by the time it reaches 12 weeks of age, or earlier if it is sold or moved from its place of birth (Microchipping of Dogs Regulation 2015), and the microchip must be registered with an authorised database. Microchipping of all dogs protects the animals&rsquo; welfare, and assists with speedy identification of lost or stolen dogs and their owners. It is an offence to keep a dog over 12 weeks that has not been chipped and it is an offence to sell such a dog. Microchips can be easily checked at vets and by Garda&iacute;. They are by far and away the most effective means of tracking and identifying dogs.<\/p><p>The Department of Agriculture have also made regulations covering the advertising for sale of animals under the Animal Welfare (Sale or Supply of Pets) Regulations 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600080#WRG02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1618"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":359,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600080#WRG03000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","counter":358,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600080#WRG02900"},{"type":"question","counter":359,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[53607\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600080#WRG03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a disability manager from CH07 disability services in the primary care critical support team can provide ongoing and necessary supports to persons (details supplied);

Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.<\/p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. Medical card eligibility is primarily based on an assessment of means and is not granted on the basis of any particular condition.<\/p>  <p>  In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. The HSE afford applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting documentation to determine whether undue hardship exists and to fully take account of all relevant circumstances that may benefit them in assessment, including medical evidence of costs and certain expenses.<\/p>  <p>  In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.<\/p>  <p>  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses, including medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600080#WRG04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","counter":373,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600080#WRG04400"},{"type":"question","counter":374,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[53624\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600080#WRG04500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason for the ongoing delay in the provision of promised therapists to a school (details supplied); and when they will finally be in place.","asker":"1485","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":375,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to a service issue, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600080#WRG04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"question","counter":377,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[53626\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600080#WRG04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the breakdown of the staff in terms of roles and number at the Armagh Road and Cork Street children's disability network teams.","asker":"1485","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":378,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600080#WRG04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":379,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600080#WRG05000"},{"type":"question","counter":380,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[53630\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600080#WRG05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he intends to respond to the recommendations related to his Department and the HSE in the Ballymun A Brighter Future Report commissioned by Dublin City Council and presented to An Taoiseach at the Dublin north west area joint policing committee in July 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1568","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":381,"content":"<p>The report 'Ballymun-A Brighter' by Andrew Montague sets out a plan to tackle the underlying causes of addiction, crime and open drug dealing in the Ballymun area.<\/p><p>A key recommendation in the report is for Dublin City Council to lead and coordinate with local agencies, relevant government departments, and the local community, in drawing up and implementing a comprehensive approach for dealing with criminality in Ballymun.<\/p><p>Specific recommendations in the report are directed at a number of organisations including Dublin City Council, Department of Justice, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, TUSLA, HSE and the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p>The key recommendation relating to Health is the provision of Multisystemic Therapy for young people in Ballymun.

In accordance with the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. The HSE assesses each application on a qualifying financial threshold. This is the amount of money that an individual can earn a week and still qualify for a card and is specific to the individual&rsquo;s own financial circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  Regarding persons aged 70 or older, the medical card assessment is based on gross income. The weekly gross income thresholds for eligibility to a medical card for those aged 70 and over were increased in November 2020 and are currently &euro;550 per week for a single person and &euro;1,050 for a couple. However, It should be noted that those aged over 70 can also be assessed under the general means tested scheme where there are particularly high costs, e.g., medication, nursing home fees. Furthermore, the Deputy may be aware that, since 2015, every individual aged 70 and over has automatic eligibility for a GP visit card.<\/p>  <p>  Persons aged 69 and under are assessed under the general means tested medical card thresholds which are based on an applicant&rsquo;s household income after tax and the deduction of PRSI and the Universal Social Charge. The means assessment determines an applicant&rsquo;s eligibility allowing for taking account of one&rsquo;s eligible expenses from their income. Given that this is a net assessment, it means that where one&rsquo;s income or allowable expenses change there will be an impact on the decision about one&rsquo;s eligibility. Examples of allowable expenses include rent, mortgage, insurance, childcare, maintenance, nursing home costs, (detailed guidelines are available at: www2.hse.ie\/file-library\/medical-cards\/medical-cards-national-assessment-guidelines.pdf). <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that certain social welfare payments are not included in the means assessment for a medical card.  Changes to the rates in Budget 2023 include changes to these non-assessed payments and, therefore, changes will not have any bearing on the outcome of a medical card assessment. For other social welfare payments that are assessed as income for a medical card, it is noted that the increase in the rates in Budget 2023 would not be expected to make a substantial difference to the outcome of the assessment process.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that, to ensure the medical card system is responsive and sensitive to people's needs, my Department keeps medical card issues, including the current medical card income thresholds under review and any changes are considered in the context of Government policy and other issues which may be relevant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600081#WRH05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":437,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600081#WRH05300"},{"type":"question","counter":438,"qnumday":188,"qnumall":"[53816\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600081#WRH05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the supports that are being provided to a family (details supplied).","asker":"1485","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":439,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600081#WRH05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products","counter":440,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600081#WRH05550"},{"type":"question","counter":441,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[53817\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600081#WRH05575","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to reports (details supplied) of increasing misuse of fentanyl; the steps that his Department is taking to combat abuse of this drug and the expected rise in misuse; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":442,"content":"<p>Awaiting reply from Department.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Reviews","counter":443,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600081#WRH05600"},{"type":"question","counter":444,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[53885\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600081#WRH05700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will publish an independent review (details supplied) conducted as part of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 review.","asker":"1525","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":445,"content":"<p>The Review of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 commenced in line with statutory and Government commitments in December 2021.

In essence this means that all calves that are born on or after 1st July 2022 must be identified with 2 official identification tags one of which contains an electronic component.

When new forests are considered, it is important that we ensure the overall impact is positive for nature as well as climate change mitigation.    <\/p>  <p>  Expanding Ireland's forest estate will require significant areas of land and the Programme for Government has committed to a Land Use Review which will examine a range of objectives which will help inform land use policy in Ireland. This work is well progressed and will be completed next year. I would also like to point out that planting forests can have a significant beneficial impact for nature restoration. The Nature Restoration law will have specific targets for forest ecosystems and urban areas where planting trees will be hugely beneficial. My Department look forward to ensuring that our forests play a positive role in nature restoration in any targets agreed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600082#WRJ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":468,"content":"<p>Question No. 198 answered with Question No. 195.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Live Exports","counter":469,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600082#WRJ02100"},{"type":"question","counter":470,"qnumday":199,"qnumall":"[53783\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022102600082#WRJ02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will adopt recommendations by the veterinary official who accompanied a livestock shipment and the recommendations highlighted in the recently published scientific opinion of the European Food Safety Authority and will not authorise future shipments of livestock when sea temperatures of 25 degrees or above are predicted in view of the extremely high temperatures and humidity during recent shipments to Egypt; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1594","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":471,"content":"<p>This Government supports the live export of animals as it is an important feature of normal activity in Ireland's agri food sector.
