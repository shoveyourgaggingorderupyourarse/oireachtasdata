We should always remind ourselves that the withdrawal treaty is the end of the beginning.  It is no substitute for a full, mature relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union.  In the meantime, relationships on all fronts have been damaged as a result of Brexit - North-South relations and the UK-Ireland relationship and there has been polarisation in the North.<\/p>  <p>  The incoherence of British politics has exacerbated the situation, with the failure of the British Parliament to lay out a coherent blueprint as to what it wants.  I believe the British Prime Minister has demonstrated good faith in terms of upholding the Good Friday Agreement and avoiding a hard border.  The documentation published last evening reflects that, as does the withdrawal agreement itself.  It is important to point out, and I am sure the T&aacute;naiste will agree, that a no-deal Brexit would be devastating for the United Kingdom, Ireland and the European Union and must be avoided.  Its impact on livelihoods and businesses, particularly the agrifood industry, would be very damaging.  Given the crisis in our beef industry, a no-deal Brexit, if it were to happen, would essentially wipe out the sector.<\/p>  <p>  A no-deal Brexit would also represent a monumental failure of politics on all sides.  That is why it was important to compromise and agree to some changes.  Taken together, the documentation agreed yesterday, namely, the joint instrument and the unilateral declaration concerning the withdrawal agreement, represents movement on the European Union side.  It potentially allows the UK to wriggle out of the withdrawal agreement, albeit in a convoluted and long legal journey.  The legal opinion of the United Kingdom's Attorney General is worth reading in full.  He makes the point that there is new material and new legal obligations on the EU in terms of the speed at which negotiations should be concluded and that the risk is reduced on the UK side.<\/p><p>However, a legal opinion is one thing, a political decision is another.  This is a fundamentally political issue, with which the British Parliament has to grapple.  I will not speculate on that.  The question I want to ask the T&aacute;naiste is this.  In the event of the agreement being rejected, what happens next in terms of developments?  Does the T&aacute;naiste agree that yesterday's agreement marks a significant development from December's agreement?  In the event of a negative vote in the House of Commons this evening, does the Government support an extension to facilitate further reflection?  Is the T&aacute;naiste of the view that every effort must be made to avoid a no-deal Brexit? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552399500,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  As the House knows, Prime Minister May met with President Juncker in Strasbourg last night.  They announced at a joint press conference that they had agreed on a number of things - an interpretive instrument on the withdrawal agreement that has legal effect, and a joint statement on the political declaration on the future relationship between the EU and the UK.  Those documents were published last night.  The documents are complementary to the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration, and aim to provide an additional layer of interpretation, clarification and reassurance to the United Kingdom ahead of the vote in Parliament this evening.  We are also aware that the UK Government has published a unilateral declaration alongside the two joint documents that were agreed.<\/p>  <p>  The UK asked for further legal clarity on how the backstop would effectively not be indefinite.  We were very glad to support providing that clarity yesterday evening.  The further texts that were agreed last night provide additional clarity, reassurance and guarantees that were sought by some in Westminster to eliminate doubts and fears, however unreal they may have been, that the goal of the EU, or of Ireland for that matter, was to trap the UK in a backstop indefinitely.  This has never been the case and it is still not the case.  The reason we were happy to support the wording last night was to try to provide more reassurance in a very real way that puts a legal obligation on the EU to put processes in place that are convincing and that we will work in good faith with the United Kingdom to ensure that the backstop is never used and that if it is ever triggered that it will be temporary.  For the first time, there is a clear commitment in a legal document as to how that will be done and the timeframes for it.  Also, if one side is not acting in good faith and if there are not best endeavours - in other words, if the EU decides to simply allow the backstop to be the only serious consideration - the UK can trigger a mechanism through arbitration that would have consequences that could potentially lead to the suspension of the use of the backstop.<\/p>  <p>  What is being presented to Westminster this evening is different from the last meaningful vote.  That being said, from an Irish perspective the text and content of the withdrawal agreement has not changed.  What has changed is the extra language which commits the EU and the UK in a legal document to clear procedures ensuring they work together to try to avoid using the backstop and to ensure that it is temporary if it is ever required.  We will have to wait and see, and give the British Parliament the time and space to consider the documents that were signed off on last night.  Like others, I have been listening closely to the debate in London so far today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200004#B00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1552399800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The question I put to the T&aacute;naiste is whether he agrees that yesterday's agreement marks a significant development on that reached in December.  I think he used the phrase, \"It is different\".  I am of the view that it is a significant development.  Whether it is significant enough or goes far enough remains in question but it is a legal document in itself.  I say that because sometimes we have to stand back.  What has the argument been about recently?  Essentially, people are arguing about how temporary is something that we all agree should be temporary.  That is the essence of where matters stand.  How can we respect good faith on both sides?  It seems that there has been a fundamental absence of trust when we get down to arguing minute points like this in legal documentation.  Trust must be restored.  I have some sympathy with Kenneth Clarke's view that the real meat will be in the discussions relating to the full agreement and that this, ultimately, will or will not determine the nature of a border.  In essence, it is about the trading relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, which is so essential to Ireland and to livelihoods and jobs here, and ensuring that the east-west relationship is as close as possible.  Ultimately, that has to be our desired outcome, and the avoidance of no deal.  In the eventuality of a rejection this evening, does the Government favour acceding to an extension on behalf of the UK, if it applies for an extension, in order to give more time for reflection?  It is very important that it is clear on all sides that no deal will be ruinous for everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200005#C00100","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1552399800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy that in a no-deal scenario, everybody loses.  It would be hugely damaging to the United Kingdom on many levels but also it would be hugely challenging for us.  We have spent many, many months putting contingency plans in place.  We will be finalising the legislation, hopefully with the support of other parties, in the Seanad this week.  We continue to work with the European Commission to plan for how Ireland can respond to a no-deal scenario should it happen but all of us need to do everything we can to prevent that happening.  That is the reason the EU came forward with a package that is different last night and why I believe the Prime Minister and many others will recommend that the Westminster Parliament support the meaningful vote this evening.<\/p>  <p>  I do not want to speculate on what will happen beyond that because I do not believe that is helpful.  However, Ireland has always stated that if the UK looks for more time and if there is a plan to go with that request, it will not be the obstacle to granting more time, should it be necessary, and if there is a plan to try to finalise arrangements during that period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200005#C00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1552399800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Since the Brexit referendum result became clear almost three years ago, Sinn F&eacute;in has been crystal clear in stating that the approach from the Government and the European Union has to be guided and underpinned by the very obvious fact that people in the North voted to stay in the European Union.  That vote has to be recognised and, in our view, respected.  My party's approach to Brexit has always been based on ensuring that there is no hard border on the island of Ireland, that the rights of citizens and people, North and South, are fully protected and that the Good Friday Agreement is upheld in all its parts.<\/p>  <p>  The withdrawal agreement that has been negotiated - we would say very carefully and, at times, very painfully - between the European Union and the British Government could not be described by anybody in this House as a perfect deal.  The Government would say the same because no Brexit is good for Ireland.  Any Brexit will have disastrous consequences for people, North and South, socially, politically and economically.  That needs to be made clear again today in the context of the withdrawal agreement.  No right-thinking person on this island could argue that Brexit is good for the people who live on the island of Ireland.  However, the withdrawal agreement and the backstop, or the Irish protocol, go some way towards ensuring that there will be no hardening of the Border, that the interests of citizens will be protected and that the Good Friday Agreement will be protected in all its parts.  In fact, it is the bare bones of what is necessary to ensure we protect the Good Friday Agreement.  In December, the British Government accepted that position and signed up to the agreement and the backstop and what is known as the Irish protocol, or the insurance policy.  Despite what we would argue is the reckless and irresponsible position of some in the Tory Party and the DUP, the fact remains that the agreement must be honoured and a deal that recognises the unique circumstances for our island must be acted upon.<\/p><p>The backstop, in our view, remains the only way to ensure that this is made a reality.  It is our insurance policy and cannot be tweaked or nuanced.  That is what is required and nothing less is acceptable.<\/p> <p> Last night, following talks in Strasbourg, Britain secured additional legal assurances in respect of the withdrawal agreement and the backstop.  It is the view of Sinn F&eacute;in that those assurances do not alter the terms of the withdrawal agreement and that the agreement agreed by this D&aacute;il in November still stands.  That is an important point.  The D&aacute;il voted for the withdrawal agreement alone.  Is it the T&aacute;naiste's view that there have been no legal changes to the withdrawal agreement?  Is it his view that the backstop remains intact?  Is it his view that the North cannot be unilaterally taken out of the customs union or Single Market by any British Government in the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200005#C00300","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552400400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I am grateful to the Deputy for the support of his party and, indeed, the support of other parties for the decisions the Government has had to make, working with the European Union to try to protect the interests of Irish people and Ireland, but also to protect the relationship we have with our closest neighbour, the United Kingdom.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear from the text agreed last night that the withdrawal agreement itself is not being changed.  That is understood.  What we have is a new legal instrument which requires of the UK and the EU a series of processes that reassure everybody that there is good faith on both sides to work towards preventing the use of the backstop in the first place or, if it is ever triggered, that it is temporary.<\/p>  <p>  There are, effectively, four ways of preventing the backstop being used.  If the future relationship is comprehensive enough to mean we do not need border infrastructure between the EU and the UK, the backstop will be redundant and will never be triggered.  If the alternative arrangements considered under the new mechanisms agreed last night result in an acceptance by both sides that an alternative arrangement can replace the backstop, in full or in part, that can happen.  However, those alternative arrangements have to do the same job as the backstop.  They do not have to look the same but they have to do the same job in terms of border infrastructure and commitments.  There are also review mechanisms if the backstop is ever triggered.  Those can be triggered by either side if alternative arrangements come to light that can replace, on a permanent basis, a temporary backstop.  That would require to be agreed under the review mechanism in the withdrawal agreement.  There is also an arbitration process which the document agreed last night considered in considerable detail.  The UK can trigger this if it believes that the EU is not acting in good faith on its commitments around the temporary nature of the backstop or not triggering it in the first place.  That arbitration process, which is consistent with the arbitration process in the withdrawal agreement, can be the basis of requiring the EU to either respond in good faith or, ultimately, for the backstop to be suspended should that happen. <\/p>  <p>  There are, therefore, clear ways in which the backstop can be avoided or replaced by both sides working together or, if both sides are not working in good faith, one can challenge the other through the arbitration process to force that.  That reinforces the case that the UK and the EU, working together, accept that the backstop is not to be a permanent arrangement but a temporary insurance mechanism that, should it be triggered, would be replaced by something more permanent over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200006#D00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1552400400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste quite rightly described the joint instrument as a legal instrument which has a legal effect and impact.

What is significant and different and has legal effect is the reassurance - and the processes which deliver that reassurance - on the temporary nature of the backstop.  This is an insurance mechanism that nobody wants to use.  If, however, it is ever used, both sides will use their best endeavours to ensure that it is temporary.  On the first of those commitments, there is now a clear mechanism, with a timeline of one year, for both sides to use their best endeavours to consider alternative arrangements seriously in order to see whether they can replace the backstop.  If they stack up, it will be agreed; if they do not, alternative arrangements will need to be continued to be worked on.  The test in terms of the replacement of the backstop is still an actions-based test.

He concluded by stating, \"for the remains of the day we need to give MPs in Westminster the time and space to consider what is now on the table.\"  That could never be acceptable.  We have to be able to scrutinise and debate the new legal documents in order that the Government does not sleepwalk into agreeing a text that could be in any way problematic.  That is our job.  Just as the British Parliament does its job, we have to do ours.  The Labour Party has concerns about the documents agreed last night by the EU and UK negotiators and about the interpretation of the new legal text by the British Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox.  In my judgment, and the T&aacute;naiste will agree, it is certain that we will not have a comprehensive trade agreement by the end of next year.  Even by the maximum end date of the December 2022, it is quite likely that a future relationship agreement will not have been concluded and that, legally, the backstop will have to be triggered.<\/p>  <p>  I have a number of questions for the T&aacute;naiste about the legal certainty and the guarantees on which we want to be really clear regarding an open border.  Does the Government acknowledge that the legal text would require the EU to entertain a range of proposals from the UK Government, including alternative arrangements to replace the backstop, or else face the possibility that the UK might unilaterally break the withdrawal agreement?  We have gone through all of these technological issues in the past but now we have a legal basis for the British to act if we do not accept them.  Does the Government agreed that the extent of the British Government's legal commitment to ensure an open border in Ireland is only to the extent that is required in the text of the Good Friday Agreement and not the spirit of the peace process nor the existing unfettered trade on the island of Ireland?  Does the Government accept the legal text allows for the implementation of alternative arrangements to the backstop on a piecemeal basis?  The T&aacute;naiste has said it can be done bit by bit.  This would have the unintended consequence of ultimately diluting the efficacy of the legal guarantee of an open border upon which we have relied?  There is clear indication in the new documents that any new European law would not apply to the UK, including Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>Does the Government accept that if a new area of European law were to be created which had, for example, implications for the labelling of goods, the UK would be under no obligation to adopt that law?

First, however, I wish to address the Taoiseach's comments this morning.  He stated that for the remainder of the day the Houses should be conscious that another Parliament will vote on this deal this evening and Members should, therefore, be careful what we say.  He is correct in that regard.  I do not want to see debates in this House contributing negatively to the capacity for a fair deal to be ratified this evening in Westminster.  That could easily happen if the debate in this House were to exaggerate or emphasise elements of the deal that may suit our political arguments but may make the political arguments in Westminster far more difficult.  We need to deal with the facts rather than try to spin this in any direction.  I am not saying that anybody has done so, but that was the context of the Taoiseach's statement this morning.<\/p>  <p>  On whether the EU would give full consideration to alternative arrangements, we have always said we would.  That the EU does not accept alternative arrangements does not mean that it is not acting in good faith; it just means that the alternative arrangements do not do the job or stand up to full scrutiny.  It may be the case that convincing alternative arrangements will be developed and work.  If that is the case and they are agreed between the two sides, they can replace the backstop as long as that gives us the desired outcome of protecting the Good Friday Agreement, avoiding a hard border and so on.  We now have a clear structure and a timeline within which to consider those alternative arrangements during a transition period before a backstop would ever be triggered.  In addition, of course, we have the good faith of both sides to continue to work on those alternative arrangements - potentially as technology changes in the future and so on - should the backstop ever be triggered and need to be replaced over time.  Of course, the EU will act in good faith, work with the UK side and consider fully alternative arrangements.  I suspect it may offer ideas, as it should.  However, at the moment, after two years of negotiation, the only backstop, guarantee or insurance mechanism that really works to reassure people on this island that there will not be border infrastructure as an unintended consequence of Brexit is the backstop.  That does not mean that alternative arrangements cannot necessarily be found.<\/p>  <p>  On the Good Friday Agreement, the text and the backstop, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin earlier referred to the Prime Minister's good faith towards the Good Friday Agreement.  It is important to state that the UK's unilateral declaration is very clear in its final lines about the obligations of the UK under the 1998 agreement in all its dimensions and under all circumstances to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.   That is in the context of trying to get out of a backstop through an arbitration process.  It is important to recognise that because it is of great importance to this House.<\/p>  <p>  On whether it is possible under the existing arrangements and the declarations made last night to replace parts or elements of the backstop, yes, it is.  That is already catered for clearly in the withdrawal agreement whereby a backstop can be replaced in full or in part as long as the outcome of that change continues to deliver the desired effect, which is the avoidance of a hard border.  That is already catered for in some detail in the existing text of the Irish protocol of the withdrawal agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200008#F00200","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1552401300,"counter":20,"content":"<p>By way of observation, I cannot imagine a British Prime Minister proposing to Westminster that debate there should be curtailed by considerations of what is happening in another parliament.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200008#F00300","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1552401300,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I did not use the word &quot;curtailed&quot;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200008#F00400","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1552401300,"counter":22,"content":"<p>It is ridiculous that statements on Brexit will not take place until 7 p.m. tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200008#F00500","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1552401300,"counter":23,"content":"<p>As the T&aacute;naiste stated last week, we need to accelerate our preparation for the profoundly unwelcome eventuality of a no-deal Brexit.

I agree with what she said about climate change.  Many people are ahead of the Government and this House on climate change, in particular young people.  It does not surprise me that many of them will want to ensure their voices are heard on the need for the prioritisation of a more urgent response to the challenge of climate.  We hear that, from a Government perspective, and that is the reason the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, is working on an all-of-Government plan to set out the actions that must be taken by every Department and body.  The plan should be ready before Easter.  For the first time, we will have a climate change plan with real targets that apply to every sector.  The Minister is working with colleagues across Government to develop new initiatives in electricity generation, transport, heating and a range of other sectors.  That will build on initiatives that have already been introduced.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, &euro;116 billion of expenditure has been committed over the next ten years.  Of the money we have committed to spend on capital infrastructure, one in every five euro relates to climate mitigation.  We have also launched a &euro;500 million climate action fund for the best projects that generate significant CO2 reductions.  The all-party Oireachtas committee on climate change will report next week.  The Government will study the recommendations closely and try to factor them into Government planning and try to get agreement on a cross-party level on many of those recommendations, which will be challenging and will pose some difficult choices for this House.  We will then be tested on whether the people are ahead of us on some of the difficult choices around the value of carbon and related issues in the future.<\/p>  <p>  I know Galway well, having been Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, and traffic is a significant issue for the city.  We are planning to grow the population of the city by another 50% in the next two decades.  It is clear that we need to invest heavily in public transport to be able to replace the need for cars with sustainable public transport infrastructure.  That is the reason we have committed a significant amount of money to the BusConnects programme for Galway, which will rationalise five high-performing cross-city routes and prioritise bus lanes as well as providing for segregated cycle lanes, which are badly needed in Galway.

We have a new Minister in this area who is preparing to bring recommendations to the Government.  We have an all-party Oireachtas committee which will bring recommendations to the House.

My concern is that we keep adding new plans but are not actually delivering on previous ones.  The Deputy and I know of the frustrations in Galway with regard to housing in particular.

To discharge her duties, she had to display incredible patience, tolerance and indulgence of the most appalling attempts by Members of the House to get around procedures.  Sometimes when we would see her looking back at the Ceann Comhairle to give a bit of an instruction, one would have a sinking feeling that one's attempt was going to be dashed without a doubt, and that would turn out to be the case.

I have raised this matter with the Taoiseach and the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Kehoe.  It is appalling that members of the Defence Forces and officers who have pursued a vocation and spent years in training and education, making substantial personal and professional sacrifices to honourably serve our State, are so desperate to get out of our Defence Forces.

This demonstrates again that Fine Gael sides with banks and it will always side with the cosseted privileged class in this State.  Time would have been better spent by the Minister and the Government if they had amended the Private Security Services Act 2004 to ensure proper regulation and oversight in the area.  Of course, Fine Gael does not do this but instead it sends cosy letters and has cosy meetings with bank officials to reassure them that everything is okay as they try to brutally evict families from homes.  It is wrong and the meeting should not have taken place in the way it did.

This Bill would regulate for the issue of abnormally low bids for capital projects.  Members will be aware of the recent controversy around the national children's hospital.  Sinn F&eacute;in has looked at low bids which have been submitted for several capital projects.  We submitted parliamentary questions to all of the Departments about overruns in their respective areas.  In the Department of Justice and Equality, two particular projects had cost overruns of 47% and 39%.  In the Department of Education and Skills there is an average overrun of 6% across all capital projects.  That may not seem like much, but the combined figures show a significant cost overrun for capital projects.  These overruns arise for various reasons.  I am not saying it is due to any one particular reason.  There were changes to some of the contracts as they were rolled out.  However, there is no doubt that there is a growing concern here.  There are more and more instances where abnormally low contract bids are an issue.<\/p><p>This Bill seeks to rectify that.  It is based on EU regulations which are already in existence.  It identifies what an abnormally low bid would be by providing that where four or more tenders for a public capital works contract are submitted, an abnormally low bid is one that falls 15% below the adjusted average.  Whatever the average of the four bids is, if a bid is 15% below that it is considered an abnormally low contract bid.<\/p><p>There is no onus on the contracting authority to reject that bid automatically.  That is not what we are suggesting.  We are putting in place a mechanism by which the contracting authority can discuss the tender and examine all of the issues.  If there is a valid reason for the bid to be so low, the contracting authority can accept it.  We are only proposing that if this is done the bid must be registered with the Office of Government Procurement and the contracting party must state its reasons for accepting an abnormally low bid.  In recent weeks a Secretary General actually stated in one of the Oireachtas committees that there is a difficulty around not accepting the lowest bid for fear of litigation and ending up in the Four Courts.  By putting this into primary legislation we are providing a mechanism by which we can reject abnormally low contract bids.<\/p><p>The Bill's other proposal, in section 3, is to introduce a mechanism to examine the past performances of companies which have successfully bid for public works contracts.  If a company has consistently been unable to meet the tender price it has originally submitted for capital projects, this can be taken into consideration when the bids are adjudicated.<\/p><p>This is a system which works in other jurisdictions.  It is currently in place in the North.  The provisions for abnormally low contracts work very well up there.  This primary legislation is based on the European regulations which currently exist to deal with abnormally low contracts.<\/p><p>I recognise that the European regulations were transposed into Irish law through a statutory instrument.  I believe Deputy Howlin was the Minister in charge when we brought that in but it is clear that the current European regulations are not being implemented.  There is a major fear on the part of contracting authorities not to accept the lowest bid under any circumstances for fear of litigation.  We have seen where some companies have taken contracting authorities to court and have been successful, therefore, we are seeking leave to introduce this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200018#Q01100","speaker":"1280","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552407300,"counter":117,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200019#R00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1552407300,"counter":118,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200019#R00300","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"speech","time":1552407300,"counter":119,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200019#R00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1552407300,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200019#R00500","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1552407300,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Credit Union (Amendment) Bill 2019: First Stage","time":1552407300,"counter":122,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200019#R00700"},{"type":"speech","time":1552407300,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 to make provision for the establishment of an independent appeals mechanism to enable Credit Unions to appeal decisions of the Central Bank on regulatory decisions and to provide for related matters.<\/blockquote><p>I am pleased to have the opportunity of introducing the Credit Union (Amendment) Bill 2019.  As all Members of the House will know, credit unions have existed in Ireland and served communities for over 50 years offering a crucial service in towns and villages throughout the country.  They offer a viable and local alternative to the main retail banks.  Credit unions are owned by their members, are supported by volunteers and are underpinned by the common bond.<\/p><p>Over the past number of years credit unions have faced very significant challenges.  The other credit union Bill we will be discussing later today or tomorrow seeks to dissolve the Credit Union Restructuring Board or ReBo.  Over its lifetime there have been 82 restructuring projects involving 156 credit unions across 24 counties.  As a result, the number of credit unions has dropped by one third in its lifetime.  This trend, if it continues, will result in credit unions playing a diminished role in local communities.  We cannot allow this to happen.<\/p><p>It is simply too difficult for many credit unions, either by themselves or collectively, to lend money on longer and more viable terms.<\/p><p>It is estimated that credit unions collectively have over &euro;8 billion held in investments and the return on these investments is insignificant.  Some credit unions are now refusing deposits because it is costing them too much to hold those deposits.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il has long been calling for the credit union movement to be used to assist in the building of social and affordable housing.  While the Central Bank has changed the rules to permit that the Government has not made any move to make this a reality in practice.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il has been calling for the credit union movement to be allowed to enter the mortgage market in a more substantial way.  This would increase the revenue for credit unions and it would add much needed competition in the mortgage market and potentially push down mortgage rates which are among the highest in Europe.<\/p><p>The purpose of this Bill is to provide an appeal mechanism for credit unions or groups of credit unions against regulatory decisions.  This would better enable credit unions to appeal decisions made by their regulator in the Central Bank, known as the registrar for credit unions.

That is why my Department and I are closely monitoring developments in other jurisdictions, particularly in England and Wales.  In those jurisdictions, a domestic homicide review is a locally conducted, multi-agency review of the circumstances in which the death of a person aged 16 years or over has, or appears to have, resulted from violence, neglect or abuse.  These reviews were introduced in legislation in Britain which came into force in April 2011.

The 27 cases of familicide that the Minister and Deputy Collins referred to are to the fore of our minds but they cannot be separated from a wider picture of serious issues of domestic violence and murders.  Nine of ten murdered women are killed by someone who knows them.  Half of them are killed by a current or former partner.  Some 61% are killed in their homes and there have been 225 of those cases since 1996 as of November last.<\/p>  <p>  This is a serious issue and I hope the Minister recognises there is a need for legislation in this area.

Nonetheless, in view of the ongoing uncertainty in the UK, my Department has been planning for every scenario, but particularly for a no-deal or worst-case scenario of the type to which the Deputy refers.<\/p>  <p>  By way of background, there are a number of EU regulations that set down the jurisdiction rules which apply in the civil and commercial area.

In the event of a disorderly Brexit, the Brussels I rules would no longer apply as between the EU 27 and the UK.  The governing legal framework would then be a mix of domestic law and international agreements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200021#T00400","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1552408500,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  We all know and accept that Ireland did not vote for Brexit but we must deal with the consequences.  If the UK is no longer a party to the recast Brussels regulation or is not a signatory to similar conventions, such as the Lugano Convention, it will be more difficult for judgments in Ireland to be enforced in the UK or vice versa.  There is also potential for conflict regarding which court will have jurisdiction on cross-border UK-EU disputes.  Brexit will mean an additional court process will be required to be undertaken before suing defendants who reside in the UK, as leave of the Irish High Court will have to be obtained.  The Minister stated that this is complex, and we all know and appreciate this, and that the entire situation is fluid given that Westminster is debating it today and there will be a number of votes on it this week.

I met the Secretary of State for Justice, David Gauke, on a number of occasions and we have discussed how best to deal with these issues.  However, I need to make clear that the general enforcement of UK judgments in Ireland will be governed by the rules that apply to third countries because the UK will be out of the European Union.  In practice, therefore, application of these common law rules will mean that UK parties seeking enforcement of judgments will have to issue proceedings seeking an Irish judgment in the terms of the foreign judgment before being able to obtain any enforcing measure.  This is technically challenging.  While many Government agencies have been most active in ensuring that our large and small commercial entities are Brexit ready, it is an inevitable consequence of a disorderly Brexit that litigation in the civil area may become more difficult for such entities.  This is a matter over which the Government has very little control because Ireland is not free to enter bilateral arrangements with the UK on jurisdiction rules that will apply between ourselves in civil and commercial matters.  As stated, it would be prudent for anybody contemplating litigation against a UK defendant to seek legal advice on the options available to him or her in the event there is a disorderly Brexit on 29 March.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200021#T00600","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1552408500,"counter":164,"content":"<p>As Ireland has a land border between the UK and the EU, this will create problems unique to the island, which the Minister will appreciate.

As a result, these issues are likely to be prioritised following the UK's departure.

It will be necessary, for example, to seek leave of the High Court or Circuit Court, as appropriate, to have proceedings served in another jurisdiction.  Such cases would include those where the action relates perhaps to land in Ireland, in the Border area or any area, and the action is founded on a tort committed in Ireland or the action affects a contract made in Ireland and, of course, governed by Irish law.  In other cases it may be necessary to bring the action before a court in the United Kingdom, including in Northern Ireland.  This is not an area in which the EU has exclusive competence and it is not possible to enter into a bilateral agreement with the UK as regards arrangements for jurisdiction.

The objective is to prevent crime before it occurs, as well as supporting and vindicating the rights of victims when a crime occurs.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of people with disabilities, there are tailored responses to how such crimes are addressed.  For example, the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017 includes specific provisions requiring garda&iacute; to carry out special measures in their assessment of victims, including victims with a disability.  The Act also provides that any communication with a victim must be in simple and accessible language and take into account the personal characteristics of the victim, such as, for example, disability, which may affect his or her ability to understand or be understood.  There is also provision for persons with an intellectual disability to give evidence to the court through an intermediary.  <\/p>  <p>  In general, criminal offences such as assault committed against any person, including a person with a disability, are prosecuted as generic offences under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  However, in sentencing a person for the offence, a judge may take any aggravating factors into account.  Such factors may include the vulnerability of the victim, encompassing matters such as disability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200022#U00900","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1552409100,"counter":179,"content":"<p>The National Disability Authority states that research from other countries suggests that people with disabilities are more likely than other people to be the victim of general crime, including theft or break-ins at the person's home, or, indeed, physical or sexual abuse.

The authority states that research carried out in London found that in several cases harassment was specifically related to the person's disability.

For example, I am informed that improvements were made to the Garda PULSE system a number of years ago that included the introduction of a victim assessment screen.  This requires mandatory recording of data relating to the apparent motive for a crime incident, such as whether that crime was motivated by discrimination on specific grounds, including age, disability, race, religion, gender or sexual orientation.  As part of the Garda policing plan for 2019, work is well under way within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the development of a definition and procedures to record hate crimes.  Once this is agreed, the Garda intends to run a nationwide campaign to encourage the reporting of such crimes to An Garda.<\/p>  <p>  I am mindful that there has been much discussion recently on whether legislation specifically addressing crimes of this nature should be introduced.

Training has been provided at Templemore Garda College to members of the divisional protective services unit and inspectors nationwide with the domestic abuse portfolio by an international expert from the UK, in relation to domestic homicides and their link to coercive control.  The UK was one of the first countries to introduce the offence of coercive control.  This was part of a three day domestic abuse modular training programme that took place in the Garda College in February of this year.  Train-the-trainer training for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the area of coercive control, developed in conjunction with the Garda National Protected Services Bureau, will aid in the creation and delivery of organisation-wide training.  Domestic abuse response, including the Domestic Violence Act 2018, is included in the continuous professional development training programmes for this year in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Foreign direct investment is important but it is seen by this Government as the glamorous side of enterprise policy while small to medium-sized businesses are worthy but are treated like the poor relation.  Plenty of lipservice is given to them but all it really amounts to is platitudes with no real support or help.  Indigenous SMEs are represented by a junior Minister without the necessary supports or policy initiatives.  Ireland has made very little effort to create a Mittelstand-type of enterprise that is indigenous but is able to compete with international firms.  SMEs in this country are struggling for a number of reasons.  They are struggling because of creaky or non-existent infrastructure, because business rates do not take the profits of a business into consideration and because retail is migrating to the Internet and they are not getting the proper supports with regard to it.<\/p>  <p>  One of the reasons most businesses tell me they are struggling is that input costs are going through the roof.  One of those input costs is insurance.  Frustration is building up in the SME sector because the Government has given up on insurance reform.  I have some experience of this.  I was involved in a car accident about two years ago.  After the accident, a solicitor said to me \"Why not put in a claim as I can you ten grand for everybody who was in the car?\"  That worked out at &euro;60,000 and I would not even have had to turn up at whatever decision-making process was involved.  That would be very tempting for any family in the country but that money does not come from thin air.  It comes from somebody's pocket.  It is the process that is putting drivers, particularly young drivers in rural areas, off the road and putting businesses out of business on a regular basis.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has spent the past two years doing sweet damn all on this issue.  Reform has stopped dead.  It is not just me saying that.  ISME, which is the representative organisation for SMEs, has stated that Government reform of insurance has stopped dead.  I have been told by a number of representatives that businesses simply will not last to the end of the year and that thousands of jobs are in danger of being lost.  The Minister of State has met one business owner, Linda Murray, a number of times.  She is involved in the Alliance for Insurance Reform and owns a small business - a play centre - in County Meath.  Her insurance costs have spiralled from &euro;2,500 to about &euro;16,000.  She represents about 60 such play areas in the country, three of which have gone bust this year.  She has stated that small businesses are simply being crucified by insurance costs.  Many small businesses are not having their insurance renewed even though they have made no claims while equivalent companies in Great Britain see no difference in their insurance costs.  Linda Murray has told me that she knows of a play centre that is paying &euro;50,000 for insurance.  One such business in this city is paying &euro;135,000 per year.  One insurance company has stated that any business that caters for children of a certain age will soon be obsolete.  Another large insurance firm has stated that it will no longer insure dance classes and outdoor playgrounds and is considering not insuring sports.

He does not know what he is talking about.  I thank Members of the House who have facilitated me in terms of insurance legislation passed last year.  It includes the Insurance (Amendment) Act to give effect to the Supreme Court decision regarding Setanta and the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is responsible for the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act, which was also passed.  I compliment and thank all Deputies and Senators for getting that through.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the Deputy's comments about the hospitality sector and, in particular, play zones, I have met with many people in those sectors and there are issues.  The issue is the levels of award.  It is as simple as that.  A bang, scratch or cut can get &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000, which is outrageous.  The companies are paying these sums rather than presenting in court because it is a good commercial decision on their part.  If they go to court, they present in front of a judge, the case involves a child and the award is paid at that level plus costs.  The insurance company has the commercial decision to make.  Does it pay this, get it over with, take the pain early and get out the door?  What does it then do?  It passes on the increased premium to its customers.  This is what it comes back to.<\/p>  <p>  Two issues arise here.  If the Deputy wants to be helpful and facilitate me, we must pass the Judicial Council Bill as soon as it is presented.  I was not to know that this Bill would get stuck behind the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill in Seanad &Eacute;ireann with a filibuster.  I had hoped and anticipated that this legislation would been concluded in 2018 along with the Insurance (Amendment) Act, the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act.  If the Deputy wants to be positive, he should come on board and support that Bill.  What that Bill will do is present, in line with the Personal Injuries Commission, the opportunity for members of the Judiciary to put in place new guidelines for levels of awards.  I am challenging the Deputy to come on board and facilitate that legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Another Bill I want to get through the House as soon as possible is the Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill, which is a Sinn F&eacute;in Bill.  The Deputy may be aware of it.  I am not satisfied with the interaction between insurance companies and their customers.  The customers of insurance companies buy their product and subsequently are being badly treated because, as I said earlier, there is nothing easier than to pay the award and upload the premium on the person buying insurance.  <\/p>  <p>  Insurance companies cannot have it every way.  We have worked hard to put a better structure in place to ensure that companies are profitable and that we have a sustainable insurance sector but we are not getting fair play from the companies.  They are increasing premiums and are now very profitable.  Aviva had profits &euro;113 million, FBD had profits of &euro;15 million while RSA had profits of &euro;35 million - over &euro;200 million between them.  That is not fair play at all when it comes to the customers of these companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200029#BB00800","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1552413300,"counter":250,"content":"<p>For the record, it is not just me who is saying the Government is sitting on its hands with regard to insurance reform and that insurance reform is dead in this country.

It always interests me that Fine Gael likes to give the impression that it is the party of small business yet it stands over the distorted market that exists.  It is interesting that the Minister of State said that it is not his fault but the fault of the insurance companies.<\/p><p>The insurance companies operate under the legislative environment the Minister of State creates.  He is unwilling to take on the vested interests, and I will give him one example of this.  He is unwilling the deal with the legal lobbies.  One way in which he could do so would be to deal with the caps on damages.  He mentioned how shocking it is that people with soft tissue injuries can get massive payouts on claims.  In his own words, however, when talking to some of these representative groups, his view was that the average payout for soft tissue injuries should perhaps be reduced from &euro;30,000 to &euro;20,000.

I do not know how this can be done, but that is what appears to have been done to try to solve problems.  Where is the HSE in all this?  Will this situation be sorted out?  Regardless of who manufactures or delivers a product, it is the people at the end who need the product who are of the utmost importance, and it needs to be delivered on time.

Many of the solutions now commonplace across the city came from this community in the south-west inner city.  That happened because the community understood how to address issues it faced.  It knew how to address the needs of some of the young people caught up in the drugs culture present in the past 20 years in many local authority housing complexes and in many of our cities.  The programme determined how to address those needs and ensure that young people are not involved.<\/p>  <p>  The TRY programme, and the Donore community drugs team, ran a pilot scheme that was very successful.  This was proven by the evaluation of the programme.  The problem is that funding for the programme has ended.  Dublin City Council, in fairness, understood that what is needed is not just a regeneration of houses and apartments.  Sometimes part of the community also has to be regenerated.  It funded the programme on a once-off basis.  The understanding was that the Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills or the Government would address the need to fund this organisation.  What is being proposed is an outreach programme.  It deals with young people and their families.  Those young people are sometimes in a situation where other drugs workers would not engage with them.<\/p>  <p>  The outcome of the programme to date has been very encouraging.  Of the last 18 young people who were part of the programme, nine have gone on to mainstream services.  They were not engaging with those services previously.  Those young people can now be further stabilised and encouraged to go back to education or into some type of employment.  One young person on the programme previously has gone on to college.  Another was engaged with one of the larger contractors in the area.  There have, therefore, been successes and those are measurable because the people in question are identified.  What is being sought, as far as I know, is &euro;150,000 to allow the continuing employment of staff.  There are only two part-time youth workers holding the fort at present.  It is being requested that there be three full-time staff and that funding continue for two years.  That would give some consistency to the programme and address one of the pockets of major anti-social behaviour and violence identified, not just by the community, but also by youth workers and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200031#DD00500","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"speech","time":1552414500,"counter":292,"content":"<p>Last week, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, announced additional funding of &euro;1 million for the implementation of the national drugs strategy.  The funding will be provided on a recurring multi-annual basis will address the priorities set out in the strategy.  Those will include early harm reduction responses, emerging trends in substance misuse, including polydrug use and crack cocaine and improving services for at-risk groups.  Government policy in relation to drug and alcohol addiction services is set out in the national drugs strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery: A Health-led Response to Drug and Alcohol Use in Ireland 2017-2025.<\/p>  <p>  Drug and alcohol task forces play a key role in assessing the extent and nature of substance misuse in their areas, and in supporting community responses, as part of a co-ordinated approach involving all sectors at local and regional levels.  A total of &euro;27.645 million was allocated to the drug and alcohol task forces by the Department and the HSE in 2018.  This level of funding has been maintained for the past number of years.  This funding is used to support community drug projects to deliver services which meet local priorities.  The Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, is very familiar with and greatly appreciates this valuable work in local communities.<\/p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE allocate over &euro;2 million to the south inner city local drug and alcohol task force each year to fund 23 projects in the area.  The Donore community drug team receives in the region of &euro;178,000 from the allocation to the south inner city's local drug and alcohol task force, LDTF.  The HSE has monitoring and oversight responsibilities of drug and alcohol task forces under its section 39 governance framework.  This is to ensure that service provision is meeting identified needs and there is accountability and transparency for public monies provided by the Department of Health.  The HSE has advised that the task force co-ordinator for the south inner city task force, the LDTF, has had several meetings with the Donore community drug team in respect of the TRY programme.  It is working with it on structural development and financial issues.<\/p>  <p>  I also understand that the youth programme will be the subject of discussion at a meeting of HSE senior management next week.  Measuring the overall effectiveness of the response to the drug problem is an important objective of drug policy.  Resources are best directed towards interventions and strategies which are most likely to lead to a reduction in problem substance use and an improvement in public health, safety and well-being.<\/p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, is committed to developing a performance measurement system by 2020 which will improve accountability and strengthen the task force model.  The funding will complement enhancements in drug and alcohol treatment services related to mental health and homelessness under the 2019 HSE national service plan.  The Minister of State will be consulting with the drug and alcohol task forces, including that of the south inner city, and the HSE on how best to target this new funding.  The Minister of State has invited the task forces to a meeting in the Department of Health at the end of March to begin this process. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200031#DD00600","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552415100,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I was aware of the Minister's announcement last week of funding for several local drug and alcohol task forces.  I raise this because the current funding runs out in July, which is in the middle of the summer.  This urgently needs to be presented to the Minister of State and to those who are engaging with the Donore community drug and alcohol team.  They must look properly at the previous pilot, the evaluation of that pilot and the work that has been done on a shoestring budget since then.  If that does not happen, the community and the Donore community drug and alcohol team are afraid that some of the individuals the team has managed to identify in its outreach work will revert to type without intervention.  The intervention is not always based on age.  Sometimes people are slightly older than these youth workers would normally deal with.  It is not based on vicinity.  If some of the characters the team deals with move out of the vicinity, the team tracks them and tries to keep them engaged.  It attempts to ensure that their behaviours and challenges are addressed and tries to guide them towards a more positive role.  The team has been successful despite the fact that some questioned this initiative when it was first introduced.  Those of us who were sceptical in the first place have been proved wrong, which is a great thing.  That is why I champion it.  In its own small way, it has managed to address some of the major anti-social behaviour problems in the vicinity.  It is not a panacea for all the problems, but this is a regeneration area.  Plans for houses have just gone ahead.  We do not want this behaviour to reappear in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200032#EE00200","speaker":"1305"},{"type":"speech","time":1552415100,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his contribution and for refocusing attention on this issue, which is always very welcome.

I would like to see if we can progress things.  The hospital offers great care.  It is well recognised by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, the HSE and the locals.  One can see that by the demand for places.  However, there are issues with the building.  They have been identified for many years now.  There has been a repeated cycle of plans and commitments and non-delivery and of further plans and commitments and non-delivery, and this goes on.  We need to see progress on this.  We have seen other community hospitals in similar positions make progress but Macroom Community Hospital has slipped behind.<\/p>  <p>  There is concern among residents, staff and the wider community.  People are asking if the national children's hospital's demand for additional funding is going to have some impact on Macroom.  As far back as 2008 and 2009, there were plans to carry out development.  The HIQA report highlighted the great care, but it also pointed out issues with the building concerning privacy, storage space for residents and the need to move away from the open-ward model to more private rooms.  The subsequent HIQA licences were granted on the condition of works being carried out or plans being advanced.  That was in 2017 and 2018.  I am delighted the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, is taking this Topical Issue matter because I know he has been there and has seen the situation on the ground and the wonderful care provided.  He has also seen the need.  According to media reports, the Minister of State said that planning permission would be advanced by October of last year.<\/p>  <p>  October came and went, as did November, December, January and February.  It is now March and there is still no plan.  Members should bear in mind that there was planning permission as long ago as 2008 and 2009.  That was allowed to lapse in 2013.  We need to get to the stage where there planning application is secured, funding is committed, works are under way and real commitment is shown to Macroom Community Hospital.  I discovered when talking with the HSE late last year that &euro;5.8 million was needed for it.  Even at that stage, the HSE was expecting planning permission in the first quarter of this year, that is, about March.  We have reached that point and there has still been no planning application.  We need something definite.  We need works on the ground so that residents, their families and the wider community know there is a commitment to Macroom Community Hospital and that the residents are to have the greatest possible comfort.  These are basic and fundamental issues, namely, storage space for residents' clothes, privacy and closing off the current open wards.  These are practical matters of day-to-day dignity.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016, when there was a demand for the commercial outfits to deliver, they had to deliver within a deadline.  However, the hospitals were given an extra five years.  That deadline is approaching and the work does not seem to have been done for Macroom Community Hospital, although it was in other cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200032#EE00600","speaker":"1284"},{"type":"speech","time":1552415100,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Teachta as ucht deis a thabhairt dom labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar seo sa Teach inniu.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s core stated objective is to promote care in the community so that people can continue to live with confidence, security and dignity in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  This is clearly what older people want and what everybody in this House wants.  We also have patients who are in genuine need of residential care, either on a long-stay or a short-stay basis, and their safety and well-being is of paramount concern.  Residential care is provided through a mix of public, voluntary and private provision.  It is worth highlighting that the budget for long-term residential care in 2019 is &euro;985 million, and at any one time an average of more than 23,000 clients will be in receipt of financial support.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including those at facilities such as Macroom Community Hospital.  Operating a 24-hour care service seven days a week, the hospital provides support to the elderly population of Macroom town and neighbouring parishes in North Lee West.  There is a multidisciplinary team which looks after the needs of the residents, providing long-stay care, convalescence, respite and palliative care.  The maximum number of residents which can be accommodated is 38.  The existing residential care setting provides multi-occupancy shared bedroom accommodation, where highly dependent residents who are in need of 24-hour high-support nursing care or are in transition from hospital to nursing home care are accommodated together.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, community hospitals like Macroom are an essential part of our national infrastructure and we are determined to maintain our public stock.  The standard of care delivered to residents in these units is generally very high, but we recognise that many public units are housed in buildings that are less than ideal in the modern context.  Without these units, however, many older people would not have access to the care that they need.<\/p><p>On that basis, we need to upgrade our public bed stock and this is the aim of the five-year capital investment programme for community nursing units announced in 2016.  The programme provides the framework to replace, upgrade and refurbish these care facilities, as appropriate.<\/p> <p> Significant work was undertaken to determine the most optimum scheduling of projects within the phased provision of funding to achieve compliance and registration with the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  This programme includes a number of facilities in Cork, including Macroom Community Hospital.  The Deputy will appreciate that all healthcare infrastructure developments require a lead-in time to complete the various stages.  These stages include appraisal, project brief, design feasibility, a review of costing estimates and finalisation of financing.<\/p> <p> I have visited Macroom hospital and updated the staff and management to the effect that the project was at design stage and planning permission is due to be lodged shortly with a view to completion by 2021.  There was considerable change in the project scope which required recommencing the approval process.  The project will proceed under the capital investment programme, which is part of Project Ireland 2040.  Further progress will be subject to the granting of planning permission and the availability of funding for capital projects.<\/p> <p> The HSE capital plan for 2019 is being finalised and will be submitted for approval to the Minister for Health very shortly.  This will propose the projects that can progress in 2019 and beyond, having regard to the total available capital funding.  All health capital projects currently at various stages of development are considered as part of this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200032#EE00700","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552415700,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the update.  While I appreciate that there is a long lead-in time for capital projects, Macroom Community Hospital has been identified as a need and planning permission was granted for the project almost ten years ago.  How long is a long lead-in time for an extension to a hospital?  Two and possibly three generations of people have moved through the hospital in that time.  It is in the interests of the dignity and privacy of those who will next use the hospital that these essential works are carried out.  I note the Minister of State visited the hospital and indicated that works would be carried out shortly.  It was stated at that time that planning permission would be granted in October 2018.  As such, there has been further slippage, even in the past year.<\/p>  <p>  I note what the Minister of State said on funding.  We understand that funding of some &euro;5.8 million was allocated previously but staff and families are concerned that the demand for money for the national children's hospital will challenge that in some way.  We need to address that issue as well.  Those involved in Macroom Community Hospital do not feel the project is a priority.

I have assured the Minister, Deputy Creed, that the project will be delivered and it will be delivered.

I cannot give an absolute commitment to a deadline of one day, one week or one month because if the deadline were then to move, the Deputy would be the first to start jumping up and down.

I hope it can be enacted speedily given the overwhelmingly positive support which it has attracted to date.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to outlining the content of the Bill, I would like to put on record my acknowledgement of the work of Senators Colm Burke, Marie Louise O&rsquo;Donnell and Lynn Ruane in championing the need for reform in this area and in seeking to advance the proposals which were first put forward by the Law Reform Commission in 2013.  The Government decided not to oppose the Bill, initially presented as the Civil Law (Missing Persons) Bill 2016, when it was introduced in the Seanad but, rather, to work with Senator Colm Burke and his fellow Senators to bring forward a number of amendments to the Bill which were acknowledged as being necessary and to which I will return later.<\/p>  <p>  I am of course aware that Deputies Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien and Pearse Doherty have also tabled a Bill dealing with these matters and I also commend them for their work.<\/p>  <p>  The situation which the Bill seeks to address is, fortunately, not one which the vast majority of people will ever have to encounter.  As a society, we can do little to lessen the sense of loss which occurs when a loved one goes missing.  However, as legislators, we have the capacity to intervene in order to ease some of the more practical problems which confront those who are left behind.  The Government is very conscious of the fact that the current provisions in Irish law which relate to missing persons are of limited use to those who are left behind.  The rebuttable presumption at common law that enables a missing person to be presumed dead if missing for more than seven years is clearly inadequate given the need to deal in a more immediate way with the myriad consequences which may arise when a person goes missing and is in all likelihood dead.  It is true that the High Court may make a declaration of presumed death prior to the passage of seven years if there is sufficient circumstantial evidence to justify such a finding.  However, such a finding will not result in the missing person&rsquo;s death being registered on the Register of Deaths, and consequently no death certificate can be issued.  Furthermore, any marriage or civil partnership involving the missing person is not ended as a consequence of the declaration of presumed death.<\/p>  <p>  The provisions of the Coroner&rsquo;s Act 1962 which allow the Minister for Justice and Equality to direct a coroner to hold an inquest where a death has occurred and the body has been destroyed or is irrecoverable are also insufficient in this context, given that there is a geographic restriction that requires the belief of the coroner that a death has occurred in or near his or her district for the section to be effective.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding current limitations, the Government is also conscious that, in reforming this area of the law, there is a need for careful balancing between the need, on the one hand, to address the practical problems which face those left behind when a person goes missing and the need, on the other, to acknowledge the significant legal implications of declaring a missing person dead.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill, as originally presented, had a dual focus.  It proposed to deal with the civil law status of missing persons by putting in place a statutory framework to provide for the making of a presumption of death order in respect of two categories of missing persons.  The first category was where the circumstances of the disappearance indicated that death was virtually certain.  The second category was where both the circumstances and the length of the disappearance indicated that it was highly probable that the missing person had died and would not return, for example, where the disappearance occurred in dangerous circumstances in which loss of life might be presumed.  It also had the objective of establishing a regime to allow an interim manager to be appointed to manage the missing person&rsquo;s estate.<\/p>  <p>  In considering the Bill as presented the Government found that there were difficulties attendant on this dual focus in that it gave rise to a certain blurring of the boundaries between those who are missing and who are, in all probability dead, and those who are missing but still alive.  The legal issues attaching to the resolution of the difficulties presented by these two scenarios are not identical and, ideally, should not be conflated.  It was in that context that the Government proposed a number of amendments to the Bill which were endorsed by Seanad &Eacute;ireann, and which I will now outline.  <\/p>  <p>  The most significant amendments related to the scope of the Bill.  As I already said, the Bill as presented had a dual focus relating to status matters on the one hand and to the interim management of the missing person&rsquo;s property on the other.  The view was taken that the interim management issues were far more complex than those associated with the presumption of death issue in isolation and would require a regime more onerous in terms of oversight than originally proposed.  In particular, the proposal that an application for an interim management order might be made once a person had been missing for 90 days gave rise to real concern that a person who had merely gone missing, for whatever reason, but who was not dead, could return to find that their interests had been severely and adversely affected.  It was considered that, in the interests of granting some relief to the relatives of those who go missing, the focus of the Bill should, at least for now, be on the issues relating to status.  In consequence, all references to matters connected with the interim management of property were deleted.  Both the Long Title and the Short Title reflect these changes.  <\/p>  <p>  A further substantive amendment in the scope area concerned the definition of &ldquo;missing person&rdquo; which is set out in section 2.  As presented, the very broad definition encompassed all missing persons, including those stepping out of their lives for whatever reason but who subsequently return to that life.  The revised definition focuses on a narrower target group of persons whose death is either virtually certain or is highly probable.  The distinction between a death which is virtually certain and one which is highly probable allows for a differentiation in the time period after which an application can be made for a presumption of death order and gives the courts a degree of certainty that the person concerned is actually dead.  Given the profound legal consequences of such an order, I consider the distinction to be both necessary and appropriate.  The Bill in its current form - section 5 - reflects the recommendations of the Council of Europe in this regard.<\/p><p>There is no minimum waiting period where the missing person's death can be taken as certain but the body cannot be recovered.  For those whose death is likely, a minimum waiting period of a year is specified.<\/p> <p> Another significant issue, which was addressed during the debate in the Seanad, concerned the effect of a presumption of death order on a marriage or civil partnership involving a missing, presumed dead, person.  The policy of the Government is that a presumption of death order should be conclusive insofar as the end of a marriage or civil partnership is concerned.  This policy is reflected in section 6 of the Bill.  However, it is necessary to address unlikely or even improbable scenarios, which in this case are the implications of the return of a formerly missing person in respect of whom a presumption of death order had been made and who was married or in a civil partnership at the time of the making of that order.  The Bill, in section 8, now provides that either the formerly missing person or the person who was left behind can apply to the High Court for a declaration which, if granted, would have the effect of treating the marriage or partnership with a formerly missing person as one where a decree of divorce or a decree of dissolution had been granted.  The court is given a broad discretion in relation to modifying or restricting the effect of its order.  I must emphasise that any court order would not have the effect of reviving the marriage or partnership, nor would it have any impact on the status of any new marriage or partnership which might exist.  However, the provision will allow the parties to effectively plug into existing family law arrangements concerning matters such as maintenance and access.  Legal advice received was to the effect that a provision of this nature would make a successful constitutional challenge less likely than the more absolute approach of simply bringing the marriage or partnership to an end without any provision being made to address the consequences of that ending.<\/p> <p> Section 4 of the Bill lists those persons who may apply for an order under its provisions.  The same list of persons may also apply for a variation order under section 8 along with the missing person in respect of whom a presumption of death order was made.  Specific provision is made for a half-brother or a half-sister to be an applicant.  This coheres with the provision in the Northern Ireland legislation in relation to applicants who are close relatives in the context of the disappeared, and seems sensible in any event.<\/p> <p> Explicit reference to a \"creditor\" as an applicant has been deleted.  By way of background, in none of the legislation in comparable jurisdictions, including England and Wales, Northern Ireland and New Zealand, is there an explicit reference to a \"creditor\" as an applicant and I have formed the view that such a reference might be misinterpreted.  Deletion of the reference to creditor does not, of course, preclude a creditor who feels he or she can demonstrate a sufficient interest in the matter from making an application for an order if the creditor can demonstrate that he or she has a sufficient interest.  Provision has also now been made in section 9 for all affected parties to be put on notice as to the making of applications for presumption of death orders or variation orders in order to avoid any injustice which might ensue if an application were to be made and a presumption of death order or a variation order granted in the absence of such parties.<\/p> <p> A number of amendments were also made to ensure coherence with the existing arrangements which apply in respect of the registration of life cycle events in accordance with the Civil Registration Act 2004.  These amendments were developed in close co-operation with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and will facilitate registration of a presumed death in a new register of presumed deaths which is to be established under Part 3 of the Bill.  The new register will be part of the suite of civil registers maintained by the Registrar General.<\/p> <p> As part of these amendments, an obligation is placed on the court in section 5 to include, in the presumption of death order, the particulars available to it which are necessary for the registration of a presumed death in the new register.  Provision is also made for an entry in the register of presumed deaths to be removed or deleted in accordance with the terms of any variation order which may be granted.  The amendment also provides for the removal of an entry from the new register where the body of a person for whom an entry has been made on the register has been recovered and an entry has been made in the register of deaths or the record of deaths abroad in respect of that person.<\/p> <p> Deputies will have noted that the Bill, as presented, gave a role to both coroners and courts in relation to matters covered by it.  The Bill in its current form reflects the view that presumption of death orders should only be made by a court and that other, associated matters should also be dealt with by a court.  This is consistent with the position which has been taken in other jurisdictions.  Accordingly, I do not envisage any role for coroners in relation to the granting of presumption of death orders and all references to the Coroners Act 1962 or to coroners have been deleted from the Bill.<\/p> <p> The final substantive series of amendments which were accepted in Seanad &Eacute;ireann concern jurisdiction and are set out in section 10.  As I said, I am of the view that presumption of death orders should only be made by a court and that other, associated matters should also he dealt with by a court.  The Circuit Court will have concurrent jurisdiction with the High Court to deal with applications for presumption of death orders.  Once such an order has been made, and the time allowed for appeal has expired, the order has the same effect in law as arises from the registration of a death under section 13 of the Civil Registration Act 2004.  This means that a death certificate can be issued which, in turn, will allow for the distribution of the estate and the payment of any life assurance policy which may exist.  However, it is proposed that an application for an order varying a presumption of death order can be made to the High Court only.  The reason for this is that such cases are likely to be extremely rare and if they occur, they may well give rise to difficult and novel legal issues.  The High Court will also have jurisdiction where the Attorney General or a person acting on behalf of the State is the applicant, again because of the likely rarity and complexity of such cases.<\/p> <p> The jurisdiction provisions now also take account of the fact that, where land is concerned, the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is determined by market value rather than rateable valuation.  The monetary threshold of that market value is currently set at &euro;3 million.  The jurisdiction of the Circuit Court has also been expanded to allow for its exercise by a judge of the circuit in which the applicant ordinarily resides.  Previously, jurisdiction was confined to the circuit in which the missing person ordinarily resides.  This revised approach is consistent with that taken in other jurisdictions.  Finally as regards this matter, a residual jurisdiction criterion based on domicile is also provided to allow the High Court to take jurisdiction in an appropriate case when no other jurisdiction criteria exist.  There is also a jurisdictional rule to cater for the disappeared when no other rule is available to the applicant.  This might arise where the applicant had no connecting factor, whether by way of residence or domicile, with the State.<\/p> <p> I stated at the outset that I hoped to see the Bill enacted by the end of the year.  This is a sensitive topic which, fortunately, only affects a very small number of people.  However, the size of the affected group does not diminish in any way the pain and emotional distress for those who have to live with the disappearance of a loved one.  Their turmoil may well be compounded by the many practical difficulties which have to be faced in the aftermath of the person's disappearance.  The Seanad Stages of the Bill have demonstrated that there is a significant degree of support for legislation in this area.  We owe it to the small group of people who are affected by the disappearance of a loved one to advance this Bill as quickly as possible to do what we can to alleviate their pain, suffering and distress.<\/p> <p> At the core of the Bill is the ability to apply for a presumption of death order when a person goes missing.  The protection offered to a missing person who subsequently reappears is the ability to apply for a variation order.  The Bill is both balanced and compassionate.  I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies on its provisions and commend it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200035#NN00300","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552417500,"counter":318,"content":"<p>Before I speak about the provisions of the Bill, I am mindful of the plight of those whose loved ones have gone missing over the years.  I think especially of the families of Deirdre Jacob and Trevor Deely in County Kildare, my home county, and the pain, heartbreak and emotional stress they go through every day.  Every time we see a poster in a city or town here or abroad featuring photographs of people who are missing and pleas from families seeking information, we think of the hell the family is going through and how difficult it is to maintain some type of normal life.  It is important that families who find themselves in this position have a legal opportunity to get certain affairs in order.  That is where the Bill comes in.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il will support the Bill, as we supported a similar Bill in the Seanad in 2013.<\/p><p>The Law Reform Commission has highlighted the need for legislation in this area and we certainly should act on that.  I certainly support the Minister's comments in trying to bring this Bill into law before the end of the year.<\/p> <p> The purpose of the Civil Law (Presumption of Death) Bill 2016 is to make specific provision in law where a person who is observed to be missing from his or her normal patterns of life, where those who are likely to have heard from a missing person are unaware of his or her whereabouts and where the circumstances of the person missing raise concerns for the person's safety and well-being.  It puts in place a statutory framework providing for the making of a presumption of death order in respect of two categories of missing persons.  The first is where the circumstances of the disappearance indicate death is virtually certain and the second is where both the circumstances and the length of the disappearance indicate it is highly probable that the missing person has died and will not return.<\/p> <p> In 2013, the Law Reform Commission's report on Civil Law Aspects of Missing Persons made 19 recommendations for reform of the law.  It also contained a draft civil law (missing persons) Bill to implement the recommendations, so the commission did really good work.  In launching the report, the Law Reform Commission pointed out that between 7,000 and 8,000 people are reported missing every year in Ireland, or almost 20 every day, which is almost inconceivable.  We know most people turn up within a very short period and less than 1% remain missing for a long time.  In the recent years from 2014 to 2017, there was an increase to over 9,000 people per year being reported missing.  According to the most recent figures from the Garda missing persons bureau, between 2003 and 2018, there were 125,698 missing person reports and of those, 431 people remain missing.  This means 431 families are absolutely devastated, along with neighbours, extended families and communities.<\/p> <p> In the context of the violence in Northern Ireland from the 1970s to the late 1990s, there is the inclusion of the \"disappeared\", a group of 17 people presumed to have been killed but where bodies have not been found.  The Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains established after the 1998 Good Friday Agreement has to date located ten bodies so seven of the disappeared remain missing.  We certainly think of their families today.  Against this background, in 2009 the Northern Ireland Assembly passed the Presumption of Death Act (Northern Ireland) 2009, which allows relatives to apply to court for a presumption of death order.  The Law Reform Commission recommended that as far as possible, the law in this State should mirror the provisions of the 2009 Northern Ireland legislation so that any cases involving the disappeared that might be dealt with in the State could be based on a similar legal framework.<\/p> <p> Our current law is primarily based on a long-established rule that there is a presumption that a missing person is alive for up to seven years, with a presumption of death applying after seven years.  The current law is limited in that family members may apply to the High Court to have the estate of the missing person administered but this does not allow them to obtain a death certificate.  In some cases, an inquest can be held involving a missing person and if it is almost certain a missing person has died, a coroner may make a declaration of death under the Coroners Act 1962, which allows the family to obtain a death certificate.<\/p> <p> The commission's report recommends reform of the law on presumed death in particular to ensure families can deal as far as possible in the least expensive way with the emotional trauma of a loved one going missing.  When a person goes missing, more often than not it is completely unexpected and affairs are not usually in order.  Issues such as paying bills, access to bank accounts and renewing insurance fall to families, with many facing considerable difficulties as a result.  We are all too aware of those who remain missing in communities across this country.  The impact of these disappearances continues long beyond the initial occurrence.  This Bill can form a small but important role in easing the burden on a family when a relative goes missing.  On behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il, I commend the Bill and we fully support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200036#OO00200","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552418100,"counter":320,"content":"<p>Beidh Sinn F&eacute;in ag tac&uacute; leis an reachta&iacute;ocht seo.

The Minister acknowledged Senator Colm Burke for bringing forward this legislation but two of my colleagues, Deputies Jonathan O'Brien and Pearse Doherty, have proposed similar legislation.  We have long supported a move of this kind.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is designed to provide arrangements for the management of a missing person's property but also for processes where the circumstances of the person's absence leads to presumption of death.  This presumption would apply to persons where the death is virtually certain and where both the circumstances and the length of the disappearance indicate it is highly probable that the missing person has died.  For example, it might be where the disappearance occurred in dangerous circumstances or other circumstances where the loss of life might be presumed.  The law currently allows for the assumption that a person is alive for up to seven years after he or she goes missing but it is not conclusive.  Under the Coroners Act 1962, an inquest can be held where the body of a missing person has not been found.  If the inquest concludes that the missing person has died, the death may be registered as it would under normal circumstances.  This is a key matter for the families of many missing persons in Ireland today.<\/p>  <p>  T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhacht go dtugaimid aitheantas do na clanna, an pian at&aacute; &aacute; fhulaingt ag cuid maith daoine agus c&eacute; chomh deacair is at&aacute; s&eacute; do na teaglaigh sin go l&eacute;ir.

Ba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn, nuair is f&eacute;idir linn, an t-ualach a dh&eacute;anamh n&iacute;os l&uacute;.  While we are debating this legislation, we should reflect on and remember the significant loss suffered by many people throughout this State.  There are hundreds of families across the country missing family members or friends.  Between 7,000 and 8,000 people are reported missing every year.  In 2018 alone, the number of reports of missing persons to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was 8,215, with 45 of these people remaining missing at the end of the year.  Most missing people turn up within a very short time and less than 1% remain missing for a long time.  For the families and friends of those 1% who never return home, there is pain and drawn-out grief and uncertainty.  All the while these people fear the worst but cannot get closure, so it must amount to unimaginable torture.  For those people, the Bill can provide some practical and moral help.  It will bring this jurisdiction into line with the North and Scotland, as well as other jurisdictions, in allowing for an application to be made to a register of presumed deaths.  A presumed death will only be registered if it meets the strict criteria laid out in the Bill.<\/p><p>This Bill from a hope that when the worst must be presumed, family members of the missing person do not have to suffer more difficulty than necessary.  There is a gap in legislation that benefits nobody and compounds the tragedy of missing persons cases for families even further.  I note that proposals along these lines were proposed not only by this Bill and previous Bills but also by the Law Reform Commission on the issue of how our legal system deals with missing persons.<\/p> <p> Ba mhaith liom aitheantas a thabhairt d&oacute; sin agus an tuarasc&aacute;il a bh&iacute; aige i m&iacute; Ean&aacute;ir, 2013 faoin dl&iacute; sibhialta, agus gn&eacute;ithe a bhaineann le daoine at&aacute; ar iarraidh, a thugann anail&iacute;s agus pr&aacute;inn oibre do na fadhbanna at&aacute; ann &oacute; thaobh &aacute;r reachta&iacute;ochta faoi l&aacute;thair agus d&eacute;anann s&eacute; 19 moladh ar na feabhsuithe a d'fh&eacute;adfa&iacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an reachta&iacute;ocht agus an tsl&iacute; a dh&eacute;ile&aacute;lann an St&aacute;t leis na gn&eacute;ithe go l&eacute;ir a bhaineann leis na staideanna nuair at&aacute; duine ar iarraidh.<\/p> <p> In particular, I acknowledge the Law Reform Commission's report dated January 2013 entitled Civil Law Aspects of Missing Persons, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the drawbacks of our current legislative framework and makes 19 recommendations on the improvements that can be made in how the State responds to the many issues that arise from circumstances where a person is missing.  The Law Reform Commission's 2013 paper details how one of the greatest challenges to families having to cope with these situations is one of \"ambiguous loss\" where much of the emotional impact on those left behind can be attributed to the lack of information when a person goes missing.<\/p> <p> Is iad seo daoine at&aacute; faoi bhr&uacute; agus a d'fh&eacute;adfa&iacute; an-tionchar a bheith aige seo ar a saol.  Taobh amuigh den tionchar maidir lena gcuid moth&uacute;ch&aacute;n agus a gcuid meabhrach, t&aacute; impleachta&iacute; praitici&uacute;la agus airgead&uacute;la do na teaghlaigh ann freisin i dtaca le f&aacute;il a bheith acu ar chuntais bhainc, ar mhorg&aacute;ist&iacute;, ar airgead agus ar mhaoin, ar gach rud a bhaineann leis sin.  T&eacute;ann s&eacute; sin s&aacute;ch dian orthu, go m&oacute;r m&oacute;r nuair at&aacute; na ceisteanna f&oacute;s ann go pointe &aacute;irithe ina gcuid ceann. <\/p> <p> These are people who are often in a vulnerable situation and these circumstances can have a significant impact hugely on their lives.  Beyond the emotional impact, there are immediate practical and financial implications that families have to deal with such as accessing bank accounts, making mortgage repayments, settling affairs in other ways and other issues relating to property.  All these matters can make life more complicated.  If we can assist and lessen the burden in any way, that is an endeavour worth pursuing.  The fact that, under our current arrangements, families can be caught in this limbo for seven years is unacceptable and shows just how much we need to reform the system.<\/p> <p> Mar sin, mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute;, is d&oacute;igh liom go dt&eacute;ann an Bille seo cuid mhaith sa tsl&iacute; ba ch&oacute;ir d&oacute; a bheith ag dul chun feabhas a chur ar an bhfaill&iacute; agus an t-easnamh at&aacute; ann &oacute; thaobh na reachta&iacute;ochta faoi l&aacute;thair agus at&aacute; tar &eacute;is a bheith aitheanta ag an mBille seo agus an Bille cheana ag an gCoimisi&uacute;n um Athch&oacute;iri&uacute; Dl&iacute;.

I have just heard about the result from Westminster, which is a sad and bleak place at the moment.  At the outset, I commend the work that took place on this Bill in Seanad last year where the Bill originated and was debated.  I specifically note the work of Senator Colm Burke in this regard.  I was shocked to learn from the Seanad debates that the number of missing persons reported in Ireland increased from 5,000 in 2004 to 9,000 in 2014.  It is simply unimaginable to think about what these families and their loved ones suffer when a person goes missing.  As we know, the Law Reform Commission published a report on civil law aspects of missing persons in 2013.  It made a number of recommendations that have found their way into this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the aspects of this legislation are highly complex and require careful management and scrutiny.  As the Law Reform Commission has noted, the need to deal with the return of a missing person also arises because some adults who go missing do so voluntarily.  We must never forget that.  The commission's report noted that they may simply wish to break contact with family or friends, which can sometimes be connected with personal or emotional reasons.  In such an instance, the missing person may be unaware that the disappearance has resulted in the appointment of an interim manager or a declaration of presumed death.  It could also arise where fraud is involved, as in the case of John Darwin, the English man who faked his own death while out canoeing.  Is m&oacute;r an trua an rud sin.  There is also the matter of when an Irish citizen disappears abroad.  As far as the commission is concerned, if a person goes missing abroad in circumstances that indicate that death is virtually certain, a presumption of death order may be obtained in the courts immediately.  The current law is, however, unclear as to the position where a foreign court issues a declaration of death or presumed death for an Irish citizen who disappears while abroad.  The commission was of the view that in such a case, those left behind should not be at a disadvantage by virtue of the location of the disappearance.  This is a very interesting and fair comment.  The commission, therefore, concluded that where an Irish citizen disappears while abroad, an application may be made to the Circuit Court for any of the orders already provided for in this report.  The commission also recommends that any such application should be subject to the same criteria as apply where the court grants such orders in respect of a person who has gone missing in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The primary purpose of the Bill before us, however, is to deal with the civil law status of missing persons.  As the explanatory memorandum makes clear, it puts a statutory framework in place that would provide for the making of a presumption of death order in respect of two categories of missing persons.  The first category is where the circumstances of the disappearance indicate that death is virtually certain while the second category is where both the circumstances and the length of the disappearance indicate that it is highly probable that the missing person has died and will not return, which is where the disappearance occurred in dangerous circumstances or in other circumstances in which loss of life may be presumed.  In that regard, I certainly welcome the fact that the Bill is intended to clarify the legal position when a person is missing, who is entitled to apply to the court for an interim manager to be appointed to manage the missing person's estate and what procedures must be complied with before the courts will issue a presumption of death order.<\/p>  <p>  What is vital here is that we get the balance and that we do not enact legislation that will allow any unreasonable determinations to be made with regard to what has happened to the missing person.  Getting the right balance is vital with all legislation.  Often times we do not, which is why it is important that we have proper perusal and pre-legislative scrutiny and debate.  The very good debate in the Seanad pointed out a lot of issues for which I thank the Senators.  It is particularly vital in this area because the trauma visited on a family, loved ones or, in cases where the person is single and has no siblings and where his or her parents have died, friends, neighbourhood and community is significant.  On many occasions, voluntary groups such as the Irish Red Cross and Civil Defence Ireland assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in searching for the person.  It is vital that we explore all these issues and have an exhaustive search but it is also vital that we have a proper legal framework afterwards.  If it happens in a different jurisdiction, we must be sure we have robust legislation that can overrule that or have a second look at that so families and loved ones are satisfied that all eventualities are covered and are catered for in this legislation.<\/p><p>I look forward to seeing this legislation progress through the House.  I offer the Minister my assistance and that of the rest of the Rural Independent Group.  Losing a friend, a colleague or even a parishioner puts us in a lonely place.  The Minister knows this as he represents rural Ireland, but the same applies to urban Ireland.  A community of people will always be affected and impacted.  It is important they get solace and satisfaction and that, first, an exhaustive search is carried out and, second, there is robust legislation in place that can and will determine that all proper processes and steps have been gone through, rather than something over which there are question marks.  We have many missing persons.  I refer to Jo Jo Dullard and many others and the trauma these families go through.  I support this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200038#QQ00200","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1552419300,"counter":324,"content":"<p>Losing a loved one is one of the hardest things we have to cope with during our lives, but losing a loved one whose body is not recovered is a harrowing situation for anyone to be in and an extremely painful time.  Sadly, this situation is more common than people realise.  The records of the missing persons bureau of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na show that almost 26 people are reported missing every day and more than 9,000 people are typically reported as missing to the Garda every year.  With God's help, some of these people will be found well.  Sadly, however, for many more families, some people are never found.  This Bill will help families of missing persons who are presumed dead to settle their affairs sooner than they could have in the past.<\/p>  <p>  I come from a rural part of west Cork where we have a huge fishing community.  Sadly, in the fishing community many lives have been lost at sea over the years, and in many cases it can be some time before a body is recovered.  The grave reality is that some bodies are never recovered.  For the families this is an awful time in their lives.  Not only have they lost a loved one, but it is also very difficult for these families to find closure.  The emotional strain and stress these families endure is heartbreaking.  Not only do they have to deal with the emotional trauma, but they are also left trying to deal with the financial and legal situation.<\/p>  <p>  Families of missing persons currently face a long battle to settle the estate of a loved one who is presumed dead but whose body has not been found.  These families cannot obtain a death certificate when the loved one is missing, even if he or she is presumed dead - for example, when a person is lost at sea - and even though the family may have accepted that the loved one will never come home.  Under the current system, these heartbroken families cannot obtain death certificates for their loved ones.  The inability to obtain a death certificate creates huge legal obstacles for the families.  For example, they cannot claim on the life insurance policy of the holder, claim a pension or wind up a business.<\/p>  <p>  We must bear in mind that some of these families will find themselves in serious financial difficulty when a loved one is missing and presumed dead if they cannot access money from a life insurance policy, access a pension fund or wind down a business, etc.  This leaves these families struggling to survive financially.  In reality, it leaves them in limbo, unable to take any action in respect of their loved one's affairs.  It is important to me, especially coming as I do from a fishing community, as I said, where, sadly, I have seen first-hand so many families suffer the trauma of losing a loved one at sea, knowing in their hearts of hearts that their loved one will not return home, that these families are treated with compassion and understanding.  We need to do all in our power to help these heartbroken families and not to add in any way to their suffering.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome this Bill as it puts in place a statutory framework which will provide for the making of a presumption of death order when someone is missing and presumed dead.  The Bill is designed to assist the families of missing persons in dealing with the management of the missing person's estate and seeks to provide a clear pathway for families to overcome these challenges at what is already a very difficult time.  The Bill will bring a degree of certainty to the lives of the families of missing persons who are presumed dead by allowing these families to make legal and financial decisions in order for them to continue to survive after such a tragic event.<\/p>  <p>  It is important we mention death benefit, which helped many people with their funeral costs.  This benefit was once open to everyone who had lost a loved one to apply for but it is now gone and has been replaced by the occupational injuries benefit scheme.  However, this scheme is only available if someone dies due to a workplace accident.  I call for the death benefit to be made available again to everyone who wishes to apply for it, not only people who have lost their loved ones through workplace accidents.  When a person loses a loved one, it is an extremely difficult time, and we should be looking at ways to make this period of someone's life as stress-free as humanly possible.  Quite a lot of people in my constituency have come to me down through the years pleading for the death benefit grant to be brought back to the people.  The same is probably true of every other constituency.  This is a cruel cut at a very difficult time in people's lives.  The loss or death of a loved one can be a deeply distressing time.  It has been brought to my attention that when Irish people die abroad, their deaths cannot be registered in Ireland if their bodies are not found.  This is most heartbreaking for the family and the loved ones of the deceased.  As far as I know, a Bill dealing with this issue has been in the D&aacute;il for a number of years and needs to be passed but has not been passed.  I empathise with any family left in this situation.  This is such a difficult time for a family, and we need to look at ways of supporting bereaved families and allowing these deaths to be registered in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200039#RR00200","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1552419300,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I am glad to get the opportunity to say a few words in support of the Bill.  As we all know, for as long as we can remember, sadly, people have gone missing and at a certain stage can be deemed definitely dead or presumed dead.  I refer especially to those girls in the midlands and indeed the young child in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's county, Mary Boyle.  We all remember them and the people left behind.  Their loved ones suffer while they live with the suddenness of these people going missing and never returning home.<\/p>  <p>  Then there are people who go missing for various reasons and disappear practically off the face of the earth, and the figures in this regard have been given.  Their families are hurt and have been left behind, suffering anguish and pain daily.  We cannot imagine what these people go through.  When a partner in a marriage or a civil partnership goes missing, the person left behind needs at some stage to be allowed carry on his or her life and live it in some normal fashion.  I hope the Bill will give these people some rights and provide some light in terms of the way they will be allowed to go forward.  I refer to property rights, the determining of ownership of homes and land and dealing with mortgages, bank accounts and all the daily, mundane things families must go through, whether it be a man or a woman left behind.  If they have children, these children must be looked after, given the same chances as every other child, get schooling and go to college or whatever.  If the deceased had land, the children should have the chance at a later stage to operate it, put it in their names and work it like every other person of their age and in the same position.<\/p>  <p>  It is very important we get this right.  Examples have been given.  If an Irish person, let it be a man or a woman, perhaps goes missing abroad for a year and may have left for very good reasons, we cannot have the scenario that that person would come back to deal with their ownership of and rights in respect of whatever property, whether a house, a farm or land, and perhaps find some other head in the bed, whether a man or a woman, instead of the person they left.  We could not have that after a short period such as a year or so because people leave their homes and the places where they live and have been working for many reasons we may not understand.  However, the Law Reform Commission's draft civil law (missing persons) Bill 2013, states that \"the fact that for a period of 7 years or more the other party to the marriage has been continually absent from the applicant and the applicant has no reason to believe that the other party has been living within that time shall be evidence that the other party is dead until the contrary is proved\".<\/p><p>What is important for us, as Members, is that we get the balance right in cases where a person does not seem to be returning.  As Deputy Michael Collins said, we have to differentiate between cases.  For instance, there are cases where fishermen are lost at sea and their bodies are never found.  There is no question whatsoever of that person not being dead.  In those cases, people need to be allowed to carry on with their lives and should not have to wait a long time to get a death certificate.  They should be allowed deal with issues of property rights and benefits they may hope to receive from State.  Such a situation has to be treated differently from a person who may disappear in another fashion.

In summary, the Bill provides for the dissolution of the Credit Union Restructuring Board, transfer of certain functions of the Credit Union Restructuring Board to the Minister of Finance and makes the relevant amendments to the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012.  I will give some background on the establishment of the Credit Union Restructuring Board.  The 2011 to 2016 programme for Government set out the Government&rsquo;s position regarding the credit union sector at that time.  It recognised the important role of the sector as a co-operative movement and the distinction between credit unions and other financial institutions.<\/p><p>The Government agreed to establish a Commission on Credit Unions to bring forward recommendations on the future of the sector, recognising that credit unions have played, and can continue to play, an important role in the Irish financial sector.  In its March 2012 report, a co-recommendation of the Commission on Credit Unions was that the sector should be restructured on a voluntary, incentivised and time-bound basis.  It was further recommended that a new body, the Credit Union Restructuring Board, or ReBo, should be established on a short-term basis.  This body was intended to engage with credit unions on the ground and to oversee, facilitate and support the restructuring of credit unions to support their financial stability and long-term sustainability.  ReBo was established on an administrative basis in August 2012 and was put on a statutory footing on enactment of section 32 of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 on 1 January 2013.  As recommended by the commission, restructuring was carried out on a voluntary, incentivised and time-bound basis.  It was widely flagged to the sector that the Credit Union Restructuring Board was established on a temporary basis and would be wound down when the Minister for Finance was satisfied its work was completed.<\/p><p>Part 3 of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 provides the legal foundation for the restructuring process, including the establishment of ReBo on a time-bound basis and the dissolution of ReBo on completion of its work under section 43 of the 2012 Act.  When the Minister is satisfied ReBo has completed the performance of its functions under Part 3 of the 2012 Act, he can dissolve ReBo.  Before dissolving it, however, section 43(2) requires the Minister to conduct a review of the operation of Part 3 of the 2012 Act no later than January 2012.  The review is to determine whether ReBo, in the Minister&rsquo;s opinion, has completed the performance of its functions.  On this basis, the Minister carried out two sets of interim reviews.  The first was in October 2015 and the second was in October 2016.  There was also a final section 43 review in June 2017.  Both interim reviews noted ReBo's functions had been fulfilled insofar as they could be, given that at each point in time ReBo&rsquo;s work was still ongoing.  The second interim review, in October 2016, recommended ReBo be given until 31 March 2017 to complete any outstanding restructuring projects.  Following that, it was recommended ReBo be wound down in an orderly fashion.  The purpose of the final section 43 review in June 2017 was to assess the work of ReBo over its lifetime.  That was to determine whether its work was complete as well as to assist the Minister in making an informed decision regarding the restructuring process and on the term of ReBo.  The final report clearly demonstrates that ReBo worked methodically and diligently throughout its time-bound lifetime to maximise its potential in facilitating and overseeing restructuring of the credit union sector in Ireland.  In addition, ReBo completed its restructuring work with minimal call on Exchequer resources compared to original expectations.<\/p><p>Taking account of each aspect of ReBo's functions, and following due consideration, examination and detailed analysis of its work, the final review in June 2017, under section 43(2)(<i>b<\/i>) of the 2012 Act, concluded that ReBo had completed the performance of its functions to the highest standards.  The orderly wind down of ReBo&rsquo;s operations was, therefore, recommended.  I will briefly outline the extent of ReBo&rsquo;s work during its short lifetime.  After its establishment on a statutory basis under section 42 of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012, ReBo appointed a chief executive officer and relevant staff in the second half of 2013.  ReBo staff were employed on fixed-term contracts which expired on or before 31 July 2017.  Restructuring under ReBo was a once-off opportunity for credit unions in Ireland to avail of the significant experience of the staff and board of ReBo, led by its chair, Mr. Bobby McVeigh.<\/p><p>ReBo board members included representatives from credit union representative bodies, including the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Development Association and the Credit Union Management Association, a Central Bank non-voting member, a Department representative and independent members of the board appointed by the Minister of Finance.  When initially established, ReBo engaged extensively with individual credit unions and with the sector as a whole.  Such engagement helped raise its profile within the sector and provided a platform for the commencement of its restructuring work in order to carry out its main work in an effective manner.  ReBo also put a number of measures in place.<\/p><p>It developed a user-friendly website where credit unions could find information regarding all aspects of the restructuring process.  That included a merger process handbook, forms and templates with information on the process itself and updates on completed mergers.  In March 2014, ReBo published its strategic plan detailing its overarching vision for vibrant, sustainable credit unions which are credible and trustworthy providers of financial services to their members.  It also published its mission statement reaffirming that ReBo shall facilitate and oversee the restructuring of our credit unions on a voluntary, incentivised and time-bound basis to support the financial stability and long-term sustainability of credit unions generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019031200040#SS01200","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1552419900,"counter":338,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"}]
