I am sorry I cannot be there in person.  I am an earth systems scientist with a PhD awarded jointly by MIT and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.  I am the David R. Atkinson Professor of Ecology and Environmental Biology at Cornell University in New York State.  I have been a tenured professor at Cornell since 1985 and I have conducted research and taught on climate change since 1980.<br\/><br\/>I am an expert on the global methane cycle, on the role of methane as a driver of global climate change and on methane emissions from the oil and gas industry.  I am the lead author of the first ever peer-reviewed analysis of methane emissions from shale-gas development from fracking and I have published ten additional papers on this topic in the past eight years since my original paper was published in 2011.  My research on methane and shale gas is cited more in the peer-reviewed literature than that of any other research scientist, with more than 2,700 citations.  I have given hundreds of presentations on shale gas and climate change, including a briefing to senior staff in the White House.<br\/><br\/>Shale gas is a form of natural gas obtained from shale rock using high-volume hydraulic fracturing and high-precision directional drilling.  These technologies have only been used by industry in the past 15 years.  Virtually all of the shale gas ever produced has been produced in this century, largely in the past decade and almost entirely in North America.  Two thirds of the increase in production of all natural gas over the past decade globally has been shale gas development in the United States.  Natural gas production in the United States is now dominated by shale gas.  If Ireland were to import liquefied natural gas from the United States, it would largely be shale gas.<br\/><br\/>Methane is the major component of natural gas, including shale gas.  Methane is an incredibly powerful greenhouse gas, more than 100 times more powerful than carbon dioxide.  Of the current global warming we have experienced in the past decade or two, methane contributes approximately 1 watt per square metre compared to 1.7 watts per square metre for carbon dioxide.  It is important to note that the Earth's climate system responds more quickly to methane than to carbon dioxide and, therefore, reducing emissions of methane is critical to reaching the United Nations COP21 target of keeping the planet well below 2&deg;C compared to the pre-industrial baseline.  We simply cannot do that with CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions alone.  If we do not reduce methane emissions, the Earth will shoot through the 2&deg;C mark within the next 20 to 30 years, with devastating consequences.<br\/><br\/>Unfortunately, society has not so far acted to reduce methane emissions.  Rather, methane in the atmosphere has been increasing rapidly over the past decade.  My latest research, published in the journal <i>Biogeosciences<\/i>this summer, demonstrates that shale gas development in North America is the single largest driver of this increase in global methane.  Shale gas in the US accounts for one third of the increase in all global emissions from all sources.<br\/><br\/>In the US, approximately 3.5% of the shale gas that is developed is emitted to the atmosphere as unburned methane due to leaks all along the chain from wells to the final consumer and purposeful emissions as the gas is processed, stored and transported.  On account of these methane emissions, the use of shale gas in the United States has an even greater negative impact on the climate than coal, when we consider methane on the timescale of 20 years after it is emitted.<br\/><br\/>LNG imported to Ireland from the United States would have an even greater greenhouse gas footprint.  To liquefy and transport the gas requires a substantial volume of energy.  To import 1 cu. m of gas as LNG requires the production of 1.2 cu. m of gas with 0.2 cu. m of that gas burned to provide the energy for liquefication, etc.  With that we increase the CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions as well as methane emissions and, therefore, I estimate the use of shale gas imported as LNG to Ireland would create greenhouse gas emissions of 156g of CO<sub>2<\/sub>equivalents per megajoule, or a footprint that is 40% greater than that of coal.  My written testimony provides a figure that demonstrates this.  This is a minimum estimate, since it does not include the additional methane emissions associated with storing and transporting the LNG.  Few if any data are available on methane emissions during transport but they could be substantial.<br\/><br\/>From the standpoint of climate change, LNG is a poor fuel choice, worse than using shale gas in the US.  I urge Ireland to prohibit the importation of fracked shale gas from the US.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to contribute remotely today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019100900002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Robert Howarth"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Howarth.

I started Frack Action in 2010 because of the direct threat that fracking posed to my community.  For five years, we worked with other grassroots organisations and NGOs to educate the public and our elected officials about the harm that fracking was inflicting on our neighbours in Pennsylvania.  From New York, we were witnessing in real time a dramatic increase of pollution and sickness for people and the environment in the areas where fracking was taking place.  Our campaigners worked with health professionals, who were studying the impacts that fracking was having throughout the US.  Now the vast majority of more than 1,500 peer-reviewed scientific studies demonstrate that drilling and fracking cause serious risks and harm to public health and the environment.  In 2015, our governor, Andrew Cuomo, listened to the science and banned fracking based on the risks to public health and the environment.  Shortly thereafter, my organisation was invited to come here by local campaigners to share the reports on the impacts of fracking by the New York State Departments of Public Health and Environmental Conservation with the public, press and elected officials.<\/p><p>As a third generation Irish-American, I was relieved when my ancestral homeland banned fracking in 2017, thus protecting the people, water, air, land, animals and climate.  That courageous action made Ireland an international leader on this issue, although that is still under threat, with potential fracking licences being granted in the North.  I have been invited back by local campaigners to address the potential use of US fracked gas in Ireland and specifically the proposed Shannon liquefied natural gas, LNG, import terminal.<br\/><br\/>New York has had its own experience with LNG terminals.  In 2015 the Governor, Andrew Cuomo, rejected the permit for the Port Ambrose LNG terminal and instead granted licences for offshore wind energy projects in that area.  He said: &ldquo;My administration carefully reviewed this project from all angles, and we have determined that the security and economic risks far outweigh any potential benefits.&rdquo;  The state of New York has also denied permission for several massive fracked gas pipelines from Pennsylvania to run through New York because of the dangers they pose to water, rivers, streams and wetlands, as well as the climate.  This is important because New York&rsquo;s decision to deny permits for fracking pipelines is a factor in the decision the committee faces today.  Quite simply, there is a glut of fracked gas in Pennsylvania that cannot be brought to market.  In financial terms, this gas is referred to as a &quot;stranded asset&quot;.<br\/><br\/>The Taoiseach stated on 2 October during Taoiseach&rsquo;s Questions that the gas for the Shannon LNG terminal was not necessarily fracked gas.  Given what we know, this is a misleading statement.  According to New Fortress Energy&rsquo;s filing at the US Securities and Exchange Commission on 9 November 2018, two thirds of marketed gas production in the United States is from fracking.  It also states the gas intended for the Shannon LNG terminal is fracked gas from Pennsylvania.  On page 9 it states: &ldquo;We are an integrated gas-to-power company that seeks to use &ldquo;stranded&rdquo; natural gas to satisfy the world&rsquo;s large and growing power needs&rdquo;.  It details, on pages 9 and 14, how it is planning to build two plants to liquefy 3 million to 4 million gallons of fracked gas per day for export from Pennsylvania, with the potential to build more liquefier plants, with a 15-year contract to buy the fracked gas.  One liquefier plant that New Fortress Energy is building is in Bradford County, one of the most heavily fracked counties in Pennsylvania where many residents are suffering from health ailments as a result.  The liquefied natural gas will be transported by truck from Bradford County to a proposed LNG export terminal in Gibbstown, Pennsylvania, where there is enormous local opposition.  It is quite clear that it will be fracked gas.<br\/><br\/>As many people and Deputies have stated, getting fracked gas from the United States when there is law banning fracking in Ireland reeks of hypocrisy.  If Ireland imports fracked gas at the Shannon LNG terminal, it will be locking itself into more than a decade of complicity in harming the people and children of Pennsylvania.  In recent months the <i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette<\/i>has investigated and found at least 67 diagnoses of cancers, some of which are extremely rare, in children in just four rural, heavily fracked counties of the state.  Health professionals are alarmed by this.  As I previously stated, there are now more 1,500 scientific studies and reports in the United States which overwhelmingly show the harm caused by fracking.  It includes disastrous impacts on the climate caused by the release of methane.  As Professor Howarth stated, combined with the processes of fracking and the transport and distribution of LNG, methane leakages make fracked gas considerably worse for the climate than coal. <br\/><br\/>As we, in the United States, work to protect public health and the safety of Americans by having fracking banned nationally, I ask the committee, Members of the D&aacute;il and the public to, please, continue speaking out and working together to stop this project from gaining the final permits and to pass a law banning the use of all US fracked gas in Ireland.  Our health and well-being are at stake.  That is why I am here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019100900002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Julia Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for inviting us to present our research.  MaREI is a Science Foundation Ireland centre for energy, climate and the marine, based in UCC.  Analysis we undertook a number of years ago using our detailed European gas and electricity model examined the European energy system from a security of supply perspective.  We examined the effect a major supply interruption from Russia would have on Europe.  We found that Ireland could sustain an interruption period of up to ten months without the need for LNG infrastructure.  Ireland's gas system is strongly linked with the UK gas network.  To date in 2019 LNG imports, primarily from Qatar, Russia and Algeria which supply gas from conventional sources rather than fracking, have met approximately one fifth of the United Kingdom's full gas demand.  LNG imports of fracked gas from the United States have met approximately 1% of full UK gas demand to date in 2019.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to determine how many fracked gas molecules come into Ireland via the United Kingdom, just as it is impossible to determine how many electrons entering Ireland's power system from the United Kingdom derive from nuclear power generation.<\/p> <p>  Natural gas is used for electricity generation and heating in Ireland and meets one third of our energy needs.  Analysis undertaken with colleagues in Europe has found that the introduction of the Celtic interconnector from Ireland to France will further reduce Ireland's need for natural gas, cutting the volume of natural gas used by approximately 7%.  Analysis undertaken with colleagues in Europe examined 150 future visions of the full European electricity system.  We have found that, while demand for natural gas will reduce slightly in Europe, it provides an important backbone for the reliable and secure delivery of electricity, both in Ireland and elsewhere in Europe.<\/p> <p>  Indigenous natural gas production contributes to our energy security, but we do not know what the full implications will be of using indigenous gas, rather than imported gas or oil, from a greenhouse gas emissions perspective.  Using global average figures, we estimate the indirect greenhouse gas emissions from Ireland's gas imports, those associated with extraction and transportation, at approximately 1 million tonnes for 2017.  The comparable figure for oil is 2.7 million tonnes.  <\/p> <p>  Ireland has the potential to increase security of supply and produce clean renewable gas.  This will enhance our energy security and reduce emissions.  Colleagues in MaREI have demonstrated that this can meet strict new EU sustainability criteria when used for renewable transport.  The SEAI has also demonstrated that gas from animal manure, food waste and grass could provide up to one quarter of Ireland's gas needs, cutting emissions by 2 million tonnes and creating 3,000 permanent jobs.<\/p> <p>  As members will be aware, energy poverty is a significant issue in Ireland and across Europe.  Measures to address it will also address issues of security of supply and reduce Ireland's reliance on imported fossil fuels.  The gas demand of a typical Irish home, built in 2005 with a gas boiler, will reduce by one half if thermally insulated and upgraded to today's A-rated standard.  <\/p> <p>  MaREI's analysis of Ireland's energy security shows that, while its energy security was decreasing prior to 2017, it was primarily due to a decrease in the security of supply of imported fuels.  Most imported fuels come from the United Kingdom, but it is increasingly importing more oil and gas and the security of our primary energy supply has been declining.  Ireland's infrastructural and demand security is increasing, but this has not been sufficient to offset the decrease in fuel supply and security.  Looking ahead, diversification of fuel types and fuel suppliers and increasing the production of renewable energy will increase Ireland's energy security.  MaREI's analysis of future low carbon scenarios shows an increasing trend in energy security as energy efficiency and indigenous renewable energy production grows over time, thereby reducing our dependency on imported energy.<\/p> <p>  MaREI produced Ireland's first low carbon energy roadmap in 2013.  It initially focused on the challenges in meeting an 80% reduction and then a 95% reduction in CO2 relative to levels in 1990.  This analysis informed decisions as climate action legislation passed through its different stages.  MaREI also recently looked at emissions reductions scenarios that go well beyond the current national ambition of an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions.

As I have made a written submission, I will just try to pick out its key highlights.  I also express my personal appreciation for Professor Howarth's authoritative presentation.  I cannot compete with his expertise, on methane in particular.  I will briefly discuss the overall context of climate action, the general role of natural gas in the energy system and the specific question of the importation of liquefied natural gas.<\/p><p>The first questions are how urgent climate action is and what pathways are required to deal with it.  The best scientific understanding is that to hold the long-term global temperature rise to a specified level, the total cumulative release of carbon dioxide, in particular, must be capped.  Beyond that, we need to be at net-zero carbon dioxide emissions to stabilise the carbon dioxide concentration.  This means that there is a finite global CO<sub>2<\/sub>budget for further emissions of CO<sub>2<\/sub>.  The question then arises of who gets to emit it?  <br\/><br\/>In recent work at DCU, in collaboration with Trinity College Dublin, we have attempted to assess the equitable share of the remaining global carbon dioxide budget that is available to Ireland, aligned with the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement.  This yields a so-called national carbon dioxide quota.  We arrived at a prudent, minimally equitable, Paris Agreement-aligned national quota of just under 400 megatonnes of carbon dioxide from 2015.  Given that we emit approximately 40 megatonnes of carbon dioxide per year, this gives us a period of about ten years.  In other words, our quota will be exhausted around the middle of the next decade, in 2024 or so.  Climate action consistent with this quota will require the achievement of cumulative net-zero carbon dioxide emissions from 2025 onwards.  This should be contrasted with even the most ambitious mitigation action envisaged in the 2019 climate action plan which targets net-zero carbon dioxide emissions no earlier than 2050 and possibly significantly later.  The large discrepancy between these measures of the urgency of climate action may be accounted for by a variety of factors which I mention in my written submission.  While there is scope for some debate over exactly how severe the challenge is, it is clear that for relatively wealthy nations with high <i>per capita<\/i>CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions such as Ireland, net-zero annual CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions must be achieved much earlier than 2050 if the temperature and equity objectives of the Paris Agreement are to be respected.  Therefore, the talk of 2050 as being the timescale we have available is not compatible with the objectives to which we have signed up in the Paris Agreement if we are to be equitable in delivering climate actions.<br\/><br\/>Natural gas plays a central role in the energy system.  It is frequently asserted that natural gas has significantly lower CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions intensity than other fossil fuels and that it can, therefore, usefully function as a &quot;bridge&quot; or &quot;transitional&quot; fuel in overall energy system decarbonisation.  In the case of Ireland, it has been argued on this basis that, even under plans for deep decarbonisation, natural gas can and should continue to be used at significant scale, at least until 2050 and perhaps beyond, and that, even with the most rapid possible roll-out of wind and solar electricity generation capacity, natural gas will still be &quot;essential&quot; as a &quot;fuel of last resort&quot; to cover periods when these intermittent sources of energy are not available.  However, there are two key difficulties with this approach.  First, it assumes a relatively late net-zero CO<sub>2<\/sub>emmissions date of 2050 or beyond which, as I have just mentioned, is not compatible with our collective goals.  Second, the assessment of lower CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions intensity is strictly correct only at the point of combustion.  When the natural gas is burned, one gets more energy for a given amount of CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions at that point.  If &quot;upstream&quot; emissions in extraction, processing and transport are accounted for, the value of a switch to natural gas is much more complex to assess.  As Professor Howarth has discussed, particularly in the case of fracking but also for natural gas generally, any release of methane contributes disproportionately to the climate impact over and above the carbon dioxide on combustion.  Given that such releases of methane are a specific attribute of natural gas use, in particular, a &quot;substitution&quot; of other fossil fuels by natural gas does not necessarily yield nearly the degree of climate mitigation that is claimed on the narrow basis of combustion emissions only.  Furthermore, carbon capture and storage, typically cited as a mechanism that would allow much longer term combustion of natural gas, only happen at the point of combustion.  They do nothing whatsoever to mitigate upstream emissions of methane or carbon dioxide.  As to whether the use of natural gas is &quot;essential&quot; to reliable electricity generation, even under conditions of large-scale deployment of wind and solar energy generation, there are, in fact, multiple technologically feasible alternatives, but it would require another full session to unpack them in detail.<br\/><br\/>Regarding LNG, the general case for natural gas as a transitional lower intensity fossil fuel is relatively weak, but in the specific case of liquefied natural gas, it is undermined by two further critical factors.  First, as Professor Howarth has mentioned, liquefaction and liquefied transport are in themselves energy intensive processes which require continuous refrigeration at minus162&deg;C, which reduces the net energy yield and thus generally increases the emissions intensity compared with conventional, purely gaseous supply chains.  This is true of conventional natural gas, as well as of fracked natural gas.  Second, it is widely understood, as we have heard, that the primary source of LNG for importation to Ireland is likely to be gas extracted by way of fracking.  There are very strong indications that such extraction is significantly more vulnerable to methane release than even conventional extraction.  Again, it must be emphasised that such upstream emissions cannot be mitigated in any way by downstream interventions such as carbon capture and storage.<br\/><br\/>Like all industrialised countries, Ireland faces an acute challenge in rapidly decarbonising its energy system.  Their scale and urgency are not widely appreciated and there are no simple or easy solutions.  It appears clear, however, that deployment and the potential lock-in of additional fossil fuel infrastructure of any sort will not help and will most likely hinder an effective response.  <br\/><br\/>I commend the joint committee on its careful and reflective deliberations.  I will be happy to elaborate further on any of the points raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019100900002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Barry McMullin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>We will move on to Safety Before LNG.

We are very aware in County Leitrim that we live in a gas basin.  Our neighbours in County Fermanagh are again being subject to a licence application that may lead to fracking.<\/p> <p>  Prior to 2011, silent policy on fracking allowed the Government to avoid high level assessments of the cumulative impacts of exploiting shale gas.  Unfortunately, this is happening again with fracked gas imports.  The health of people who warned us about the harms of fracking in North America is at risk if we create a demand for fracked gas here.  From 2017 on, we knew that the United States planned to export its gas and take a 15% stake in the global LNG market.  It was talking about lending Europe its gas until we got over our fear of fracking.  Knowing this and seeing renewed interest in the Shannon LNG proposal, we became concerned and began engaging with people in counties Kerry and Clare.  President Juncker and President Trump announced a deal to bring what the latter called \"freedom gas\" to Europe in July 2018.<\/p> <p>  The public is becoming aware of this plan to import fracked gas into Ireland through the Shannon Estuary and Cork Harbour, mostly because of awareness-raising by environmental groups.  Anytime we alerted the Department to our concerns about fracked gas imports, we were told that the origin of the gas was a matter for the operators involved.  The Government would not acknowledge that the proposals to bring LNG into Ireland would introduce fracked gas into the energy mix here.  The planned Shannon LNG terminal alone has the capacity to satisfy half the current Irish demand for gas.<\/p> <p>  People are entitled to have a say in whether fracked gas is introduced into the energy mix.  This is acknowledged in the Lisbon treaty, in which we retained our right to determine choices between different energy sources.  No project can remain on the LNG list without the permission of the member state in which it is being constructed.  Last Friday we believe the Minister, Deputy Bruton, approved Shannon LNG's inclusion in the draft projects of common interest, PCI, list.  This decision sets the framework for developing consent.  The decision was taken without discussion of public policy on fracked gas in the Irish energy mix.  Major energy infrastructure needs public support.  To be successful, a project needs a social licence.  Prioritising trade over the climate through silent policy is not prudent and needs to be stopped.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019100900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eddie Mitchell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>It is against the backdrop of Mr. Mitchell and I interacting with the European Commission on the PCI issue directly, as members of civil society, that we speak to the joint committee about the matter.<\/p> <p>  Having an LNG terminal on the Shannon Estuary would be dangerous to people within a 3 mile radius, will sterilise the Shannon Estuary for future development owing to the exclusion zones that would be required around LNG tankers and be polluting.  In our eyes, having fracked gas in the energy mix is not acceptable owing to the climate and health issues associated with fracking.  LNG terminals are needed in order to import fracked gas into Europe from the USA on a massive scale.  We think the PCI approval process is really only motivated by the trade agreement between the United States and the European Union to flood Europe with US fracked gas over any climate consideration.<\/p><p>Project of common interest, PCI, status is effectively a declaration that it is in the national interest to plan, fund and permit the project.  Through our years of campaigning, we have maintained that we need proof that the project is genuinely in the national interest but that is still not forthcoming.  PCI status also means that the hands of the committee are tied and that we are locked into the fracked gas option before the committee can assess and choose from the best reasonable energy alternatives for the country.  This is neither legal nor right.  We have discovered that the European Commission only assesses gas projects under the three obligatory criteria of market integration, competition and security of supply.  However, by law it must also assess each gas project under a fourth criteria, namely, sustainability.  It is illegal not to so do.  The PCI regulation defines sustainability as &quot;the contribution of a project to reduce emissions ... taking into account expected changes in climatic conditions&quot;.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, seemed to accept he had knowledge of this in the D&aacute;il last Thursday evening when he stated: <\/p><blockquote>I have instructed my officials to ask the European Commission whether the implications of importing LNG, both conventionally and unconventionally extracted, into the European Union have been examined as to the sustainable, secure and competitive energy policy.

I agree with colleagues that we need to get a departmental overview.  Insofar as we can, we must take the heat out of this debate and discuss it on the science of the matter.  It would be useful for the Minister to appear in light of these discussions to talk through the matter with the committee.<\/p> <p>  For me, there are two issues.  First, there is the issue of energy security.  It is well accepted, based on our decisions to date, that we do not like fracked gas.  We have banned it and there is almost unanimous support for that.  We recognise there is a problem with fracked gas.  From a climate change perspective, we recognise that emissions from fossil fuels are problematic and are causing a very significant change in our climate and that we need to address that.  There are targets in place in that regard.  I am taken by what Professor McMullin's comment that he would like us to go further than we have agreed or, in meeting the targets to which we have signed up, he would like us to go further than the Government has.  We will have to consider that.  As we head in that direction, however, we will still need gas.  Everybody recognises that.  The issue comes down to energy security.  We must be satisfied that we will have an appropriate energy mix, involving other sources as well as gas.  Even if we stick to our current trajectory and aim to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, we must consider how the overall importation of gas from the existing interconnectors fits into the overall mix of energy we use.  Do we really need an LNG terminal on the west coast, whether it be fracked gas or other gas?  Consideration must be given to these issues.  The Department could advise us in that regard.  I suggest that any analysis be carried out independently.<\/p> <p>  I attended a briefing of the community in County Kerry.  Ms Walsh and several others who are present were also at the meeting.  Members are politicians who represent their communities and try to do right by them.  We have responsibilities in terms of climate change but we also have responsibilities in respect of the economic security of communities.  There is an historic dimension, which must be addressed.  I am sure Deputy Brassil will develop that point.  People bought into a particular project and, after 15 years of offering it very significant support and investment, they find that there is a very considerable lobby against it.  We must try to mollify that situation.  I am trying to do so by listening to the various experts.<\/p> <p>  It is clear that if one were starting today, one would not put an LNG terminal in that location or consider importing fracked gas at all.  It is the old story: we are not starting from today.  A company is in place, has invested a significant amount of money and has certain permissions and we must address that.  We must look at whether it makes sense to continue with that from an energy security point of view.  It all ultimately comes down to energy security.  I was interested by Dr. Deane's reference to potential insecurity based on a reduction in gas exploration in the North Sea, while recognising there are other interconnectors there.  I ask him to comment on that issue with regard to energy security.  He seems to have done a considerable amount of work on the matter.  I note the Celtic interconnector has received support to take electricity from France and there is potential for more gas to be harvested from the Corrib field without additional infrastructure.<\/p><p>Will Dr. Deane comment on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019100900002#E01300","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":30,"content":"<p>In essence, the question is whether we need LNG.  From the detailed modelling we have undertaken in UCC, it is not entirely obvious that LNG infrastructure will be required in Ireland.  We have modelled in detail supply interruptions coming from Russia and independently coming from Norway and north Africa.  The lights have remained on in Ireland in all our simulations, which points to the fact that LNG infrastructure may not be required within Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The Irish gas system is relatively secure and resilient.  It is worth bearing in mind that in the past four or five years, there has never been a supply interruption of gas coming into Ireland but there have been two supply interruptions on the electricity interconnectors - both Moyne and east-west.  We are very lucky to have a resilient gas infrastructure and the recent twinning of the gas pipes coming from Scotland to Ireland has increased that resilience even further.<\/p> <p>  What helps the lights to remain on in the event of a severe supply interruption from importing states are factors such as the existing LNG infrastructure in Europe.  There is abundant capacity for LNG in Europe, in Portugal, Spain and parts of France.  Traditionally, Europe has been good at moving gas from the east to the west but in recent years it has improved at moving it from the west to the east, accessing more liquid LNG markets.<\/p> <p>  Energy storage in the UK also plays an important role in providing resilience in Ireland.  Ireland has a long history of collaboration and gas-sharing with the UK that predates any of the impending Brexit issues.  In general, the Irish gas system appears to be very resilient in respect of a number of points of supply interruption.  As Professor McMullin mentioned, much of our gas is used to provide electricity, while the addition of the electricity interconnector between Ireland and France, which the Deputy mentioned, will further reduce Ireland's need for imported gas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019100900002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Deane"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":31,"content":"<p>In Dr. Deane's analysis, he considered the stability of the European market and resilience through diversification by virtue of access to LNG facilities in Portugal and Spain.

The majority of our guests are not in favour of the LNG facility.  For balance, I must point to some statements made by what I consider relevant bodies.  The Irish Academy of Engineering's report on the security of Ireland's gas supply of July 2018 stated:<\/p><blockquote>Relying on imported gas from Britain for all of Ireland&rsquo;s gas supply beyond 2030 is not advisable.  Alternative sources of supply and supply routes need to be developed.  Developing a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) import terminal in Ireland would enhance Ireland&rsquo;s security of gas supply and provide access to the increasingly competitive global LNG market. <\/blockquote> <p>The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, in its long-term resilience study conducted by Gas Networks Ireland and EirGrid in 2018, stated:<\/p><blockquote>A sustainable, secure gas supply is crucial for the long-term competitiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s economy, and is integral to Government energy policy ... Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) has the potential to offer a significant security of supply benefit as well as access to a diversified worldwide LNG market.<\/blockquote> <p>Finally, the Economic and Social Research Institute, in its liquefied natural gas storage valuation of March 2019, stated:<\/p><blockquote>The research shows that an Irish LNG facility would allow Irish consumers to benefit from highly competitive global LNG markets, thus bringing a reduction in their annual energy bill.  Ireland is currently partially dependent on the UK to meet its gas supplies.  However, this research shows that an Irish LNG facility can reduce this dependence. <\/blockquote> <p>Significant scientific evidence supports the provision of an LNG facility in this country.  I would like the committee to be offered such opinions in good time.  <\/p><p>Dr. Deane stated it is impossible to tell how many fracked gas molecules are imported from the UK, although there is an LNG facility there.  Whether that facility imports from Qatar, Australia or America, in time some fracked gas will be imported into the country.  He also stated energy will come from France through the development of a 700 MW interconnector, which will be predominantly produced by nuclear power.  There has been a ban on nuclear energy development in this country since 1999.

As the debate evolves, we will have clashes such as this involving a project that local people might see as important to the economic sustainability of an area versus national policy on climate action.

The views of people in local communities are clearly important as well.  I found the presentation and written submission from Professor McMullin very helpful.  He spoke about the general case for natural gas as a transitional lower intensity fossil fuel, which has already been shown as very weak.  He states that the specific case of LNG is undermined by two further critical factors.  The first is that liquefied transport is itself an energy intensive process, which reduces the net energy yield.  The second factor is that it is widely understood that the primary source of LNG for importation into Ireland is likely to be gas extracted by way of hydraulic fracturing, and there are strong indications that such extraction is significantly more vulnerable to methane release as opposed to conventional extraction.<\/p> <p>  This project first appeared on the scene in 2006 as a concept and planning was sought in 2008.

Professor Howarth is the expert on the role of methane, particularly methane from natural gas extraction through fracking.  Since the project was mooted, the science and understanding of the role of methane in general has advanced considerably, which is a significant change.  The specific understanding of the emissions for fracking, as compared with conventional natural gas extraction, has advanced considerably over that period.  We have a much better understanding now than we had when the project was first mooted that the damage would be much more significant.<\/p> <p>  We have also seen the International Panel on Climate Change special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5&deg;C, which demonstrates that the risks of climate change and temperature rise are substantially greater than had previously been understood.  In particular, there is a risk of triggering tipping points in this complex global system.  I raise this because methane and carbon dioxide do not have exactly the same effects in the dynamics of climate change and global warming.  Carbon dioxide primarily dictates the long-term warming and methane in the next couple of decades will strongly affect peak warming, or the peak temperature we get to before we finally manage to stabilise temperatures.  That peak temperature is critical in terms of the risks of triggering these potentially irreversible feedback processes that will get out of human control entirely.  The methane issue will be brought very starkly into focus over the next two or three decades, so action on methane that is separate from carbon dioxide is critical.<\/p> <p>  In a meaningful and rational engagement with the urgency of our climate predicament, any project premised primarily on natural gas, but especially fracked natural gas, is definitely not viable from that perspective.

In the case of Ireland, the biggest single opportunity is sourcing offshore wind energy, but also making that wind energy available on a firm dispatchable basis, which means energy storage systems.

Professor Howarth mentioned that only have ten years of research and we are only learning about the impacts of methane.

Professor Howarth stated that methane can be 100 times more powerful than carbon dioxide.  It makes up more than one third of the increase in watts per square meter in terms of global warming and the climate system responds more quickly to methane than carbon dioxide.  I ask Professor Howarth to address that.<\/p> <p>  Given that we have this new form of seemingly more dangerous energy being supplied into the market, is Professor Howarth concerned that it is acting as a accelerant in respect of climate change and global warming?

Is it the understanding of our guests that if this project were to go ahead, we would be tied for a decade into continuing to use methane, a fuel whose impacts we have only known for a short period?

From the first decade of this century, methane emissions were steady globally.  Methane concentrations in the atmosphere were steady.  However, over the past decade, methane emissions have been rising very rapidly.  Of course, we have had the warmest years ever in the history of human civilisation over this past decade and methane emissions are a definite contributor to that.  As for what is driving those methane increases over the past decade, as I stated, my research suggests that shale gas from the United States is responsible for one third of those global increases.  There are other things going on as well but as we in the United States understand that more, there will be a lot of pressure to decrease our reliance on shale gas.<\/p> <p>  The economics of shale gas have never worked.  It is a new industry and a new approach, which is built on huge debt.  No one in the United States has made any profit from selling this commodity over the past four or five years.  They are hoping to hold on in the hope that the price will eventually go up.  People, including people in Ireland, should think about what that means if they want to tie their fate to a source of gas in this country.<\/p> <p>  Here in New York State, our governor signed a law this summer committing us to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by 40% within the next ten years.  We are committed to doing that and we believe we can do it with renewable energy.  If we in New York State can do it, I am sure the people of Ireland can do it.<\/p> <p>  I agree totally with my colleague that Ireland has potential to develop offshore wind and support that and the related energy storage which will be required to make renewables really work.  That is the way I would go.<\/p> <p>  I might also add that the United States has a limited history of exporting natural gas as liquefied natural gas.  This is new for us.  In fact, until a few years ago, it was illegal for the oil and gas industry in the United States to export gas because we were worried about our own energy security.  That has changed over the past four or five years.  We have a glut of gas on the market in Pennsylvania and elsewhere.  That is part of the reason that policy has changed.  As the shale gas revolution continues to fizzle out, we can expect the oversupply to diminish and I can imagine that the United States will again look out for its own energy security.<\/p><p>It is dangerous to assume that our country will continue to export LNG ten or 20 years into the future.

We are using up all his time, which is precious but very useful.  I direct my first question to Dr. Deane from MaREI.  He claims that we do not know how much fracked gas we import, particularly from the UK.  However, on 1 October it was reported that fracking has now ended in the UK as the company that engaged in it ceased all activity after triggering a 2.9 magnitude earthquake near Blackpool.  We are, therefore, not currently importing fracked gas, unless it is lying in storage somewhere.  It will hopefully no longer come into Ireland in the future, which is good news.<\/p> <p>  There have been major campaigns across Britain to prevent shale gas being used, much like those in County Leitrim and the Shannon Estuary in Clare and Kerry.  If we were to import fracked gas from the US, despite the potential contradictions that may exist regarding the importation of nuclear power from France, all we would be doing is compounding one wrong with another.  We as a nation now have it within our power to stop this happening.  There is no need for it.  Does Dr. Deane agree?<\/p> <p>  I am interested in how his organisation has examined the carbon budget the Paris Agreement has imposed on us.  Has MaREI measured how that budget would be impacted if we were to import this liquefied natural fracked gas from North America?  Has MaREI calculated how much fracking itself would damage our emissions?<\/p> <p>  I ask Dr. Deane to also comment on the scientific facts Professors McMullin, Anderson, and Howarth have given us about gas not being a safe or acceptable transition fuel.  This is something we have not looked at.  Leaving fracking aside, gas as a transitional fuel has not been properly examined by this committee and we need to drill down into that - pardon the pun.  Dr. Deane also noted in his presentation that if we were to energetically, enthusiastically and correctly move to renewable fuels, approximately 28% of our electricity needs could be met by implementing the waste reduction referred to by the SEAI.  If we were to combine that with a massive investment in offshore wind energy, solar panels, and bog rehydration, in ten or 15 years, both our reliance on gas and the debate about energy security would look completely different.

Professor McMullin mentioned a carbon budget of approximately 400 million megatonnes of carbon dioxide.  We suggest about 440 megatonnes.  We have looked at a wide range of potential carbon budgets, ranging from 120 million megatonnes to 700 million megatonnes, which would mean reducing our emissions to zero within the next three to 15 years, depending on our level of ambition and transition speed.  However, some of those strict scenarios are infeasible and our current level of economic activity could not be maintained while achieving those emission reductions.<\/p> <p>  We do not examine emissions outside of our territorial emissions.  According to the UNFCCC, Ireland is only responsible for the emissions that occur within its territory.  Within our science, we do not assess emissions that come from outside Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I refer to gas as a transitional fuel.  Our research shows a number of clear pathways for the future, including those of low regret and least regret.  These would require massive energy efficiency, behavioural change and significant deployment of renewable and variable renewable resources.  It must be borne in mind that we are starting from a point where 5% of all our energy comes from wind, which is double the global average.  However, going from 5% to 80% or 90% in such a short a period would result in logistical issues and turnover challenges.  Ireland needs to massively increase the role of variable renewables, but doing that before 2050 will be very difficult.  That is where the role of gas as a transitional fuel comes in.  The gas itself must be linked to a technology such as hydrogen production, as Professor McMullin mentioned, which is what the UK is looking at for its 2050 strategy.  It seems unusual but it will use natural gas to produce hydrogen, break apart the natural gas molecules, use the hydrogen, and store the gas back in the ground.  This technology has not yet been commercially tested on a large scale, but neither has 100% deployment of widescale variable renewables.<\/p><p>In Ireland, a low-regrets or no-regrets policy will mean massive deployment of energy efficiency and variable renewables and greater interconnection.  That will get us so far.  It will probably get us to approximately 70%.  If we are to go beyond that, we have to examine some trickier choices.  For example, we will have to look at where we get the hydrogen from and how we provide back-up to ensure the electricity system is resilient and reliable on days when there is not enough weather over Norway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019100900002#J01900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Deane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":89,"content":"<p>Deputy Smith's time is up, but I will allow her to ask some brief final questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019100900002#K00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I ask Professor McMullin and Professor Howarth to comment on what Dr. Deane said.

Reduced methane emissions can slow the rate of global warming more quickly than reduced emissions of carbon dioxide, where there is a lag of several decades due to uptake and release by the oceans.

The only plausible routes are synthesising chemical fuels from electricity.

The natural gas route, including fracked gas, is too short so we have to proceed with all possible speed.  The basic technologies for producing hydrogen from electricity are well proven, well known and well established but the technologies for storing hydrogen at progressively larger scales, while the basic research is well developed, require pilot deployments before full-scale deployments.  Medium-scale to large-scale hydrogen synthesis facilities are already being built in northern Germany.  This could be rolled out in the next decade but it requires a policy imperative and we need to say it is a national priority.  It will involve projects of common interest and critical national importance and we should look in particular at chemical storage, particularly if we continue to say \"No\" to nuclear deployment.

We are all living on the same planet, however, so there is no such thing as somewhere else - the upstream emissions go into our atmosphere.  CCS for fossil fuel mitigation is not a good story, in my view, though we will need it, largely because we are going so fast in the wrong direction and we will end up having to suck carbon dioxide back out of the atmosphere.  CCS is a key enabling technology for that purpose although for continuing to burn fossil fuels it is not so positive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2019100900002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Barry McMullin"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":134,"content":"<p>The Climate Change Advisory Council is of the view that gas should be part of our backup fuel as we decarbonise.

Oversight is provided by local implementation teams working to national frameworks supported by the national office of NOSP.  While each local version was developed over a different time period from 2015 to 2018, all are now in full implementation mode.<br\/><br\/>I turn to young people.  While Connecting for Life adopted a whole-population approach, special consideration was given to priority groups at the development stage.  These are groups that always require specialised or targeted initiatives because they are known to be particularly vulnerable to suicide or where evidence shows a potential greater risk of suicide.  The priority groups identified in our strategy include stated demographic cohorts such as young people.  In the context of today's meeting, I draw attention in particular to strategic goal 3 of Connecting for Life and the related objectives and actions under that goal.  The overarching aim here is to target approaches to reduce suicidal behaviour and improve mental health among priority groups, including young people.  The highlights of the initiatives related to young people and Connecting for Life actions are outlined in our submission document from page 8.<br\/><br\/>It is important to speak to our understanding of suicide and self-harm statistics among young people in Ireland as there are often mixed messages on this issue.  Suicide data in Ireland are provided by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and it is important to note that the only official decision as to whether someone has died by suicide is a legal decision made by a coroner, not a medical decision made by doctors or the HSE.  There are many caveats attached to the information provided by the CSO and a significant time delay in receiving information on, for example, late registered deaths.  Currently, we have full sets of data, which include late registered deaths, only up to 2014.  Nevertheless, looking at provisional data for the most recent year available, which is 2018, we know that the highest rate of suicide in Ireland per 100,000 of population was among 45 to 64 year olds.  Among males, the highest rate was among 55 to 64 year olds.  Among females, the highest rate tends to be within younger groups, currently among 15 to 24 year olds.<br\/><br\/>Given that our European counterparts use varying systems to collect and report suicide data, it is not always advisable to compare countries on a like-for-like basis.  That said, our best understanding of how we compare with other countries comes from EUROSTAT.  The most recent comparisons from EUROSTAT show that in 2016, Ireland had the 11th lowest rate of suicide across 34 European countries among all age cohorts.  In 2015, Ireland had the ninth highest rate of suicide across 33 European countries for young people age 15 to 19.  This ranking has fluctuated widely in preceding years, from 12th lowest in 2014 to second highest in 2011.<\/p><p>Members can read further details of these statistics on page 14 of our submission but I would like to add that regardless of what the figures seem to indicate, we continue to be of the firm belief that co-ordinated, concerted, multi-sectoral approaches to suicide prevention must be in place across all sectors of society if a difference is to be made.<\/p><p> Data on self-harm presentations to emergency departments in Ireland is provided separately by the National Self-Harm Registry and the full data are in that.  My office provides funding to the NSRF.<\/p><p> It is important to note that recent studies show similar increases in England.  This coincided with the release of season two of the Netflix series \"13 Reasons Why\" and the high profile death of a DJ.  They all had implications.  We respond to self-harm through our emergency departments and we have clinical programmes related to young people which are set out on page 8 of our submission.<\/p><p> In regard to investment in suicide prevention, there also remains noticeable financial-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Meehan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I have to ask you to conclude.

The ISPCC is delighted to be in a position to present to the committee on the topic of youth mental health.  As the national child protection charity, I would like to present the ISPCC&rsquo;s insight which arises from listening to, and working directly with, children and young people.  The ISPCC&rsquo;s Childline service operates 24 hours a day and answers more than 1,000 contacts every day from children and young people up to the age of 18.  A high proportion of these engagements come at night, often when other services are unavailable.  In 2019 to date, 19% of Childline engagements with girls have focused on mental health and anxiety compared to 10% of engagements with boys.  Children and young people who contact Childline discuss issues, including depression and sadness, self-harm, suicidal thoughts and bullying.  Our childhood support services have received 341 new referrals to date in 2019.  Of these referrals, 42% have related to children experiencing mental health difficulties.  Typically, these young people present with anxiety, difficulty coping, school refusal, being socially isolated and having very low self-esteem.<\/p> <p>  The ISPCC&rsquo;s childhood support service received a referral for a young boy who was experiencing anxiety and was at the point where he felt he could not leave the house, even to go to school.  The boy and his family had refused previous supports.  The ISPCC support worker worked with the boy and his family, giving them the chance to talk about their concerns as well as what steps they could take.  The family appreciated that they could complete sessions in their own house as they had felt overwhelmed at the thought of meeting professionals at their offices.  Over the course of the ISPCC&rsquo;s engagement with the family, they agreed to work with CAMHS also.  The boy is now making positive progress in that he will leave the house for short periods of time and is talking to his parents about his worries and feelings of anxiety.<\/p> <p>  Of the families who have completed work with the ISPCC childhood support service this year to date, 96% have reported improved knowledge and understanding of the issue and 77% have reported a change in behaviour.  The ISPCC is aware from evaluating these service outcomes that community-based, strengths-focused therapeutic work can have lasting positive impacts on young people.<\/p> <p>  Through our work with children and young people, we know mental health is a key concern for that cohort.  Children and young people have been hugely impacted by delays in access and lack of resources in mental health services in Ireland, at a time when waiting lists for mental health services in this country are at an all-time high.  Families are left with very few service options available to them.  In the first quarter of this year, 365 young people were waiting for more than 12 months for their first appointment with CAMHS.  As my colleague mentioned, the suicide rate among young people aged 15 to 19 in Ireland is the seventh highest among 33 European countries.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has a population of 4.75 million people, of which over a quarter is aged under 18 years.  Despite this, the voice of the child is often forgotten in the process of developing and evaluating services.<\/p><p>While the implementation of the Pathfinder project ought to help ensure children&rsquo;s voices are heard, progress has been slow in this regard.<\/p><p> There is an acute need for 24-7 child and adolescent mental health services across Ireland.  In its absence, children often feel they have nowhere to turn.  In serious cases involving attempted suicide or self-harm, parents are forced to bring children to accident and emergency departments, which is a wholly inappropriate setting for any child in distress.  It is essential that no child is admitted to an adult unit in future, even in the short term.  Timely and appropriate early intervention support should be available to all children and young people, regardless of where they live in the country, when mental health issues arise.  They should not have to wait to experience a crisis before they can access support.  It is imperative that waiting lists are reduced and recommended resources and staffing for CAMHS are ensured.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Church","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I now invite Ms Kate Mitchell to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#G00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting Mental Health Reform to appear before it today to discuss youth mental health.  Mental Health Reform is Ireland&rsquo;s leading national coalition on mental health.  With over 75 member organisations, we work together to drive progressive reform of mental health services and supports in Ireland.  In partnership with our membership, many of which work in the area of child and youth mental health, including Jigsaw, SpunOut, the ISPCC, the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance, and Barnardos, we have consistently advocated for improvements in mental health services and supports for children and young people living in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  In recent years, Mental Health Reform sat on the national task force on youth mental health, developed evidence-based research and guidance on meeting the mental health support needs of children and young people in Ireland, actively campaigned on the need for investment in child and youth mental health services and supports, including with regard to budget 2020, and has delivered a dedicated campaign on the need for out-of-hours crisis services for children and young people in all communities across Ireland.<\/p> <p>  From the outset, it is important to acknowledge the progress that has been made in the provision of child and youth mental health services and supports.  This includes the expansion of Jigsaw youth mental health sites; the publication of CAMHS standard operating procedures, including a revised version; the development of digital technology mental health supports for children and young people; and the establishment of a mental health crisis text line.<\/p> <p>  Despite recent Government efforts, the reality is that significant challenges continue to exist for numerous families, children and young people who require mental health services and supports.  To start, there is no doubt that Ireland's child and adolescent mental health services are at breaking point.  Just over half of the required CAMHS staff are in post, which ultimately has a significant impact on access to and quality of services.  As of June 2019, there were almost 2,500 children on the waiting list for CAMHS, of which 10% were waiting more than a year to be seen.  There are ongoing practices of admitting children to acute adult services, with a total of 20% of all child admissions to adult inpatient units in 2018.  There continues to be a lack of out-of-hours crisis mental health services for children and young people, with many being unable to avail of such supports in their communities.  There are ongoing difficulties with the implementation of the CAMHS standard operating procedures, which seek to promote consistency and standardisation in services across the country, difficulties with transitions from child to adult mental health services, and continued gaps in mental health legislation, which fails to protect adequately the rights of children and young people when they go into hospital for mental health care and treatment.<\/p> <p>  This is further compounded by the continued absence of a national advocacy service for children and families engaged in mental health services, who may require support in having their voices heard.  Unmet mental health need is also evident in the lack of specialist mental health services to meet the needs of particular groups of individuals.  These include children with a mental health and intellectual disability, children with autism, children and young people from the deaf community, children with a dual diagnosis of addiction and a mental health difficulty, and children and young people in the care system.<\/p> <p>  There are significant shortfalls in supports outside of the specialist mental health services, including in primary care.  For example, there are more than 8,500 people on the waiting list for primary care psychology nationally, of which almost 25% are waiting more than a year to be seen.  It is important to recognise that the majority of individuals on this waiting list are under the age of 18 years.  In addition, there has been a lack of investment in enhancing the capacity and resources afforded to other primary care professionals to meet the mental health needs of children and young people adequately.<\/p> <p>  No doubt, there are myriad additional gaps in mental health service provision, including in perinatal and early years mental health supports, a lack of investment in community and voluntary organisations that provide essential mental health services to children and young people in communities throughout the country, a lack of focus in investment in prevention and early intervention, and of particular note, inadequate inter-agency collaboration.<\/p><p> Overall, there remain significant challenges to bring about the type of mental health supports for children and young people that fulfil national policy and international human rights obligations.  There are various measures that must be taken.  These include, to name a few, increased investment in child and youth mental health services; a national roll out of crisis out-of-hours services for children and young people; investment in primary care psychology; the implementation of the CAMHS standard operating procedures; the reform of Ireland&rsquo;s Mental Health Act 2001 to promote compliance with international human rights treaties, including the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child; the establishment of a national independent advocacy service for children, young people and families engaged in mental health services; the implementation of a nationwide schools programme on mental health promotion and well-being; the establishment of a universal approach to responding to perinatal and infant mental health needs; and a greater focus and investment on the prevention of mental health difficulties.<\/p><p> The prevalence of mental health difficulties among children and young people in Ireland is significant.  Almost 20% of young people aged 19 to 24 years of age and 15% of children aged 11 to 13 years have had a mental health disorder.  In July 2019, a report published by Eurofound showed that young Irish women are suffering the highest levels of moderate to severe symptoms of depression among their EU counterparts.  Demand for services is increasing substantially with a 40% increase in referrals to CAMHS from 2011 to 2019.  The cost of mental health difficulties is enormous.  The figures suggest that this may amount to as much as 4% or more of GDP in some countries equating to approximately &euro;12.4 billion each year based on Irish figures.<\/p><p> To enhance mental health services and supports for children and young people effectively, a cross-departmental agency approach is essential.  This must be complemented by the required investment and resourcing from prevention and early intervention to specialist mental health services.  This includes the full implementation of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, including its recommendations pertaining to child and youth mental health.  Mental Health Reform's specific appeal to the committee today is that it takes on the fundamental need to improve the mental health outcomes of children and young people living in Ireland as an immediate priority in terms of parliamentary oversight.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Kate Mitchell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Karla Charles to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#H00200","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":179,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it today and to be involved in what we hope will be the start of a fruitful dialogue where the voices of children in care will become a more prominent part of the ongoing discussion on youth mental health.  I am the policy manager in Empowering People in Care, EPIC.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Terry Dignan, CEO of EPIC.  We are delighted to see colleagues from across the sector here and would like to place on record our support for their work in this area.  For members who may not be familiar with our work, EPIC is the only independent voluntary organisation in Ireland that advocates with and on behalf of children and young people who are or have been in care.<\/p> <p>  EPIC acknowledges the progress that has been made since A Vision for Change, the recommendations of the national youth mental health task force report of 2017, and the excellent report entitled Someone to Care; the mental health needs of children and young people with experience of the care and youth justice systems.  It is widely accepted that significant challenges still exist in youth mental health, and one of the key priorities for mental health generally is the provision of additional appropriate supports for children and young people.  EPIC requests that recognition be given to children in care, and those with care experience, as a particularly vulnerable group in the sphere of youth mental health and that specific recommendations and a strategy be developed for children and young people in care and aftercare and with care experience within the youth mental health sector.<\/p> <p>  While there is a general absence of statistics on mental health outcomes for children in care and young people with care experience in Ireland, numerous studies carried out in the UK show that the outcomes for children in care, compared with their non-care counterparts, are stark.  Currently, half of all children in care in the UK meet the criteria for a possible mental health disorder compared with one in ten children in the general population.  The net result is as devastating as it is unsurprising.  Children in care, or who have been in care, are four times more likely to have a mental disorder than children in the general population.<\/p> <p>  An Irish study entitled Looked after children in Dublin and their mental health needs found that despite a higher prevalence of mental health difficulties among children in care, under 30% were attending CAMHS.  The low attendance rate at mental health services has been attributed to narrow CAMHS referral criteria; poor recognition by social workers; reluctance to pathologise children&rsquo;s behaviour, mobility and engagement difficulties; and general pessimism among social workers in accessing mental health services.<\/p><p>This is less surprising when we consider that children and young people who enter care do so because they have generally experienced trauma, often severe trauma, through neglect or abuse.  Being taken away from their family, regardless of the reasons for this, compounds this trauma for most children and, quite understandably, places them at greater risk of behaviour and mental health challenges and difficulties from early in their lives.  It must be acknowledged that there is an urgent need for every child entering the care system to have a mental health assessment and to be able to avail of support and intervention as and when they need it throughout their time in care and aftercare.<br\/><br\/>It is perhaps illustrative of why the mental health of children in care has been referred to as the silent crisis when we consider that children in care do not appear in the national youth mental health task force report of 2017.<b><\/b>We, therefore, call for a specific mental health strategy for children in care.<br\/><br\/>It is acknowledged by EPIC that over the past number of years, Tusla has made, and is continuing to make, improvements in the collation of data on children in care in Ireland.  However, we lag far behind the UK and other jurisdictions in this regard.  Ten years after the Ryan report recommended that a longitudinal study should be undertaken to follow young people who leave care and map their transition into adulthood, this work has still not been started.<br\/><br\/>Without such a study, benchmarked against the general population, we will continue to fall short in our understanding and, through this understanding, developing ways to optimise outcomes for children in care. <br\/><br\/>EPIC welcomes the committee's focus on youth mental health and would like to emphasise how often we see, through our work, the devastating social exclusion, discrimination, with both short and long-term consequences that the failure to address childhood mental illness brings.  The longer term economic and social costs of not addressing mental health issues among our children and young people, and particularly in our care population and care experienced young people, is a considerable drain on our system and our social capital.  This cannot be allowed to happen.  Vulnerable children and young people must be protected and given every opportunity to reach their full potential.<br\/><br\/>We have a number of recommendations to make to the committee.  More research is needed to collate data and on outcomes for children and young people in the care system generally, and mental health has to be a key focus within this.  Data on waiting times for children in care to first avail of mental health services, the regularity and variety of supports received and the overdue longitudinal study on children in care and leaving care must be collected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Karla Charles","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":181,"content":"<p>Ms Charles will have to shorten her recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#J00200","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I will shorten them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Karla Charles"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I feel for her, but I am being strict.

More services need to be developed.  We need to take an holistic and multidisciplinary approach.  We must look at trauma support earlier, as soon as children are able to involve themselves in this.<br\/><br\/>The provision of both universal and targeted measures to promote positive mental health among children and young people in the care system must take place.<br\/><br\/>Children in care should receive a level of priority for child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and adolescent community treatment schemes, ACTS.  There should be an opportunity for all children in care to have a dedicated service such as the Tusla national psychology service in special care, which should be open to all children in care.<br\/><br\/>We need more focus on behavioural issues because CAMHS will only work with a child if there is a diagnosed mental health issue.  We need to look at transfers from CAMHS to adult services, as has been mentioned.<br\/><br\/>We need to focus on advanced trauma informed training.  We wish to point out that no child in care should have to be placed out of state.  <br\/><br\/>Schools must be used more as a gateway to accessing and supporting children in care. We also stress the need for an independent advocacy that currently exists for adults admitted under the Mental Health Act.  The same provision should exist for children accessing mental health services.<br\/><br\/>Positive mental health is the cornerstone to positive lived experiences for children and youth.  Early intervention and prevention must be a priority in attaining this goal.  A root-and-branch review of CAMHS is now a priority.  Children in the care of the State are a particularly vulnerable group who need much more attention.<br\/><br\/>If time permits, I would like to read a quote from a young person in care who had direct experience of mental health services.  I acknowledge and thank the young person in question for sharing her experience with us.  She said:<\/p><blockquote>I did not have a good experience of CAMHS and anyone I talked to who had gone to CAMHS felt the same.  They just don&rsquo;t understand and the tactics they use just don&rsquo;t work.  They need to change how they work with children and young people, especially as it is the first interaction you have with therapeutic services, it would turn you off counselling in the future.  It is not child friendly - writing in their notebooks, all very daunting.<br \/><br \/>The only way to get seen by the CAMHS service is to be a danger to yourself and even at that you have to wait three weeks before you get an appointment.  You have to be literally in intensive care to get an appointment with CAMHS. <br \/><br \/>In relation to CAMHS and the care system, I felt they had no understanding of the care system, the terms, how the system works.  No understanding that a huge amount of young people in care experience attachment issues, they don&rsquo;t understand this and just see you as acting out and work on trying to fix you.<br \/><br \/>The effect being in care has on children needs to be explained to children at a young age as they don&rsquo;t understand what they are going through and they compare themselves to their friends who have come from a stable home.  They need to be helped to understand at a young age why they are feeling the way they are feeling.  It is not a mental health illness, they just can&rsquo;t regulate their emotions because of attachment issues.<\/blockquote> <p>I thank the committee very much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Karla Charles"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":187,"content":"<p>Ms Charles took three minutes more than the time allowed.

We represent and support the interests of our member organisations and use our collective experience to act on issues that impact on young people.<br\/><br\/>The national youth health programme is a partnership between the council, the HSE and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs with a vision for Ireland to be a country where all young people can experience positive health and well-being.<br\/><br\/>As outlined in our submission, youth mental health is a specialist area of work for the health programme, working in partnership with the HSE, the youth sector, education and training boards, ETB, youth officers and numerous children and young people&rsquo;s services committees, CYPSC, co-ordinators to facilitate training and aid in meeting the identified needs of young people.<br\/><br\/>The training programmes rolled out by national youth health programme include applied suicide intervention skills training, ASIST, MindOut 2.0, and the implementation of the health quality mark, HQM.  <br\/><br\/>I do not want to quote pages of statistics because, in our submission, we have outlined many of them.  However, I want to highlight some that illustrate what is affecting young people&rsquo;s mental health.  In 2015, the health programme conducted a rapid mental health needs assessment among youth work organisations to investigate the mental health needs of young people.  The main issues identified were anxiety, stress and body image.  <br\/><br\/>We have continued to work with the youth work sector to collect information on the mental health needs of young people.  It is evident that many of the issues identified in 2015 are still relevant.  However, additional issues and themes are emerging, which include the influence of social media; the influence and misuse of alcohol and drugs; societal expectations and pressures, including peer pressure; bullying; lack of skills, to include communication, resilience and self-awareness; and isolation and lack of support.<br\/><br\/>Young people are responding to these issues in a variety of ways.  One coping mechanism is<b><\/b>self-harm.  Self-harming is becoming an increasingly prevalent issue among young people, especially young girls.  Statistics are illustrating the increasing rates with one in every 132 young women aged 15 to 19 years presenting in hospitals with self-harming injuries.  Youth workers working with these young people who are self-harming are also working, or have worked, with those who are attempting, have contemplated, or have died by suicide.  <br\/><br\/>There is also evidence to suggest that media and entertainment industries are having an impact on young people in respect of self-harm.  Recently, numerous studies have been published examining the impact and trends of the Netflix series, &quot;13 Reasons Why&quot;, on the incidence of self-harm.  These studies have found a correlation between an increase in the number of Google searches around suicide and also a 13% increase in suicides among 10 to 19 year olds.  This has helped influence the World Health Organization, WHO, in updating its media guidelines on suicide in 2017.  <br\/><br\/>Youth workers have stated that young people are presenting in youth organisations with extremely challenging behaviours.  They indicated that some young people, and some young men in particular, find it difficult to express their emotions.  The resulting frustration experienced by these young people can sometimes be expressed as anger and sometimes results in violent behaviour.  In some instances, workers believed that this anger is connected to drug use.<br\/><br\/>Within the youth work sector, the needs and issues which have been identified above are addressed through the delivery and implementation of the programmes that the health programme currently delivers.  Within our submission, we have outlined the different programmes that we run and they are all aligned to national policy and strategies.  However, continuous awareness and support are needed.<\/p><p>The youth council has a number of recommendations, which I will set out.  We recommend an increase in funding and resources for the youth work sector.  The 2016 census indicates that the number of young people aged between ten to 24 will have increased by 13.2% between 2015 and 2025 to just over 1 million.  This will make Ireland the only European country with a growing population.  With our growing youth population, investment in universal youth services is more important than ever.  However, this has not been recognised by the Government, with current investment still at 17% below the level of investment in 2008.  While overall Government expenditure has increased by 12% since 2011, youth work services funding has only increased by 0.3%.<br\/><br\/>The council recommends more accessible, youth friendly counselling services.  Youth workers have highlighted the challenges for young people trying to access services, including long waiting lists, lack of public transport and the appropriateness of the service for that young person, if that young person is even deemed suitable for a successful referral.  These issues are hugely challenging for young people, especially for those in crisis.  Some youth services have accessed funding to provide youth friendly counselling.  This funding should be increased to enable more youth services to provide counselling and therapy and to expand current service provision.<br\/><br\/>The council recommends support for young people to build their skill sets and confidence to cope, not only with their own mental health concerns, but also to support their peers, where appropriate.  For example, while ASIST training is available to youth workers and others working with young people and provides a framework to support someone with suicidal ideation, there is a gap in supporting the young person in building their own capacity to support their peers.  This support system could be developed either an online tool, or as a training programme, which could be accessed directly by them.<br\/><br\/>It is important also to investigate initiatives in other countries such as those New Zealand and Australia have in place.  One example is #ChatSafe, which is a young person's guide for communicating safely online about suicide.  This initiative would complement <i>SpunOut.ie<\/i>'s crisis line and texting services.  The initiative has been developed in partnership with young people to provide support for those who might be responding to suicide-related content posted by others or for those who require support in respect of their own experiences about suicidal thoughts, feeling or behaviours.  More training and information is needed to support those working with young people especially in dealing with challenging behaviours, self-harm, trauma informed practice and adverse childhood experiences.<br\/><br\/>I will conclude by reading a quote from a youth worker that illustrates the importance to young people of youth work, youth workers and the relationships involved:<\/p><blockquote>Youth Workers are often the first port of call when a young person is in crises, especially because of the relationship they have with the worker.  Youth Workers should not have to wing it when they find themselves in this situation.  Mental wellbeing with young people can be complex, but clear training as to how to respond, whether the issue is mild, moderate or very serious.  This will support the young person.<\/blockquote><p>I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachael Treanor","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":190,"content":"<p>On behalf of <i>SpunOut.ie<\/i>, I thank the committee for the invitation to address members.

Given that time is limited and a number of colleagues from different organisations are present, I will focus on two of the 13 areas highlighted in our submission to the committee.  The first is Pathfinder, the youth mental health project, which is an initiative of the Civil Service management board.  Pathfinder aims to enhance the cross-departmental collaboration between the Departments of Health, Education and Skills, and Children and Youth Affairs in the co-ordination of youth mental health policy, funding and accountability.  The Pathfinder report was finalised two years ago and approved by the Secretaries General of all three Departments for implementation.  The report recommends a number of transformative actions for youth mental health in Ireland, including the establishment of a team of dedicated officials from the three Departments on a time limited basis.<br\/><br\/>The creation of the Pathfinder team and the implementation of the report's recommendations was viewed by the members of the national task force on youth mental health as potentially transformative in addressing the crisis in youth mental health in Ireland.  The Ombudsman for Children is also enthusiastically supportive of the proposal.<\/p><p>While the Pathfinder proposal has the support of all three sponsoring Departments, it has yet to receive sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Attorney General to proceed almost two years after it was first proposed.  Every day the Pathfinder report gathers dust, we delay the opportunity to radically reform how we approach youth mental health in Ireland.  Pathfinder has the potential to demonstrate an effective model for cross-departmental co-operation and working, which could be replicated in other policy areas.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should resolve promptly the administrative issues holding the sponsoring Departments back from establishing the Pathfinder team.  This must happen without delay and, as lead Department for the project, the Department of Health must continue to drive this initiative forward with urgency.<\/p><p> The second issue we wish to highlight is primary care.  Prevention and early intervention should be at the heart of everything the State does when it comes to mental health care.  Almost three quarters of all serious mental health difficulties first emerge between the ages of 15 and 25.  It is, therefore, vital that properly-funded mental health interventions are available to young people in this age range to prevent problems from becoming acute, sometimes irreversibly so, and to promote recovery and long-term mental wellness.  There is significant demand for accessible early intervention services for young people that charities, NGOs and acute services simply cannot satisfy on current levels of investment.  We need to build a consensus on funding services that work and make the early, effective interventions that can have significant positive impacts on individuals and communities.  There is a wide acceptance, informed by the work of the WHO and others, that the overwhelming majority of mental health interventions should take place in primary care settings.  Any plan to improve mental health services must, therefore, have quicker, easier access to psychology in primary care at its core.  While the decision last year to appoint more than 100 new assistant psychologists posts is a welcome start, we encourage the Department and the HSE to engage with the Psychological Society of Ireland, PSI, to establish an evidence-based training programme for those recruited to ensure they make the contribution we want and need to primary care.<\/p><p> The apparent global shortage of mental health clinicians makes it more challenging than ever to attract the skilled professionals we need, especially for services in rural areas.  I point to our submission and the need to continue to expand the number of places in psychiatry, mental health nursing, clinical, counselling and education psychology to begin to address the skills shortage.  In addition, we encourage the committee to examine the need for mental health teams to regain autonomy over whom they hire into their teams.  While headcount can be managed or controlled centrally by the relevant business unit corporately in the HSE, HSE mental health services at local level must have a say in who joins their teams for a proper people strategy to take effect and to build effective teams.<\/p><p> I emphasise the excellent on-the-ground work carried out by the 13 current Jigsaw services, soon to be 15 with the expansion to Wicklow and Tipperary.  Extending the reach of Jigsaw to more parts of the country would be an extremely positive step for the future of Ireland's mental health.  The service meets an essential need for brief interventions and has a notable 98% satisfaction rating among those who have been able to access its services.  As the committee continues its work, I hope the need for more of these services is front and centre, especially given Jigsaw's unstated role in supporting the case management of young people with mental health difficulties in many areas of the country.  This role is pivotal to ensure there is a joined-up, responsive national service.  In fact, a no-wrong door approach is exactly what is needed to ensure young people get access to the help they need early, instead of having to undergo what can often be a very frustrating search for the right help at the right time.<\/p><p> As a former member of the task force on youth mental health, I encourage the full and speedy implementation of the Pathfinder report's recommendations, including an independent advocacy service for children and young people, legislative change to allow 16 and 17 year olds to consent to their own mental health treatment, and a ring-fenced fund with the HEA to provide resources to higher education institutions to help satisfy the ever-growing need for counselling support services in third level education.  Each of these recommendations, if fully implemented, would remove barriers to proper treatment and strongly enhance youth mental health provision in key areas.  I thank the Chair and committee and welcome questions from members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Power","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":192,"content":"<p>We have been given a great deal of information, but I will try to be brief.  I can read through the submissions in my own time.  My first question is for the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  I read in the office's 2018 report, which was provided to the committee three or four weeks ago, the suicide statistics from 2008 to 2018.  The highest figure was 579 in 2011 whereas the figure for 2018 was 352.  I am looking for information to educate myself.  Are there any studies showing why the number has reduced?  I spoke to the HSE last week and was told there are myriad reasons affecting suicide rates.<\/p><p>I was asked to direct my questions to the National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP, as it is more expert in the area.  I would welcome some background information on where that is, why it fluctuates, what kind of data exist, what kind of research is there and what kind of intelligence is around that.<br\/><br\/>When I spoke to the HSE two weeks ago, I also spoke about my experience of shadowing the bridge patrol in Limerick, operated by the Limerick Suicide Watch, which was a learning experience for me.  Is there any co-ordinated communication between the office and the groups on the ground?  There was one intervention during the four hours I was there.  A couple of people the group spoke to were also feeling quite low within that period.  My intention is not to sensationalise that, it is just to say how it was on that evening.  There are evenings where there will be no interventions and then there may be a peak in activity.  Is there a formal communication process between the office and such groups to get feedback and to provide data?  I refer to what they are finding on the ground, what may help and any other parameters that might be included that would be helpful.<br\/><br\/>Reference was made to <i>SpunOut.ie<\/i>and the Pathfinder project.  That is something I am working on myself behind the scenes.  The last update I got is that there was a meeting on 19 July.  I think I sent the information to the NOSP.  I was advised that what has been suggested has never been done before.  We are trying to push it.  I want to see it done and I will seek an update.<br\/><br\/>I am not sure which of the witnesses to direct my next question to.  Where are we at in terms of stigma?  There was no mention of it in the contributions today.  That is no disrespect to the contributions: I am aware that the witnesses have only five minutes to get their points across.  I do not intend any disrespect to anyone, but it is incumbent on us to ensure that stigma does not go off the radar.  We should not stop talking about stigma.  What are the initiatives in that regard?<br\/><br\/>Ms Treanor spoke about the increase in self-harm among 15 to 19 year olds.  Is there research to indicate what is the major factor behind that increase in recent years?  Is it being driven solely by social media or is it a more complex issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#M00200","speaker":"1328","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":194,"content":"<p>Deputy Neville directed two questions to the NOSP.

That is very much reflective of international trends in suicide rates, which are directly related to periods of recession.  A direct impact is seen on restrictions in public services and personal income that significantly impacts on people's ability to maintain positive well-being.  That is very much reflective of research across the world.  In the UK, for example, suicide rates have just been published for 2018, which shows a small increase.  Many commentators, both within the research and clinical setting, feel they are directly related to fears around the impact of Brexit on the economy in the UK.<\/p> <p>  There was also a point about elevated levels of self-harm among young people between the ages of 15 to 19 years.  The NOSP funds the national suicide research foundation that is based in Cork.  We are lucky in Ireland to have a very important data source, which is the national self-harm register.  It is the only national register monitoring self-harm in the world.  In fact, its annual report is about to be published tomorrow.  It shows a 6% rise in self-harm rates in 2018.  There is a rise in self-harm rates across all of the age groups, but repeatedly in recent years there are elevated rates of self-harm in young people.  I think that possibly reflects the fact that we are seeing a rise in self-harm rates across many western European countries.  We are not necessarily different in Ireland to other countries.<\/p><p>We are probably seeing a change in prevalence rates of mental illness across western European countries.  A recent European survey comparing various European countries in rates of depressive illness showed that Ireland, unfortunately, was presenting with a particularly high level of depressive symptoms.  The reason is multifactorial; there are lots of different reasons.  When one looks at the detail of the self-harm rates, unfortunately, the involvement of street drugs in the 2018 rates is showing a significant increase, including cannabis and cocaine among young men.  They are taking overdoses of those street drugs that seem to be associated with a rise in self-harm in recent years.  Any discussion associated with the liberalisation of cannabis needs to take into account that in other countries where that has happened, there has been a significant impact on increasing the levels of self-harm rates.  In recent years in Ireland we are seeing an increased rate of self-harm associated with cannabis and cocaine use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Philip Dodd","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I asked a question about suicide watch groups that patrol bridges.

In our supporting documents I see we have 22 resource officers for suicide prevention.  Although we do not provide funding specifically to either of the groups in Limerick, there is a standing agreement that the voluntary patrols in Limerick city and county have reserved spaces for training on the applied suicide intervention skills training, ASIST, and safeTALK programmes.  We support them in training and also in identifying with them local contact numbers in the event of needing assistance.  Deputy Neville provided an example.  There was a reaction to that and there was a follow-up, which we support.<\/p> <p>  We have 17 local actions plans for our resource officers around the country.  The HSE has always been accused of having national strategies and launching and leaving them.  Connecting for Life is the only strategy in Europe that has an action plan and local area plans.

That is what I would like from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>  With regard to stigma, there are two issues.  First, we have definitely seen an improvement in stigma reduction over the past five or six years thanks to all of the different campaigns that have happened.  In regard to young people in particular, we see a kind of confusion in terms of mental health literacy, for example, the difference between being anxious and suffering from anxiety and the ease with which people use those different terms.  Campaigns to improve mental health literacy would be hugely welcome to reduce stigma generally.  There is also the question of listening.  One of the other things many organisations have done to great effect is educate people on how to actually listen to others in an effective way.  We are a great country for asking \"How are you?\" but not necessarily always wanting to hear the answer.  Understanding how to listen effectively to friends and understanding that it is not necessary to fix a friend's problem if they open up with an issue is another aspect. <\/p> <p>  The first meeting took place last week of the group in the HSE to create a mental health promotion plan, which is a very welcome step.

SeeChange would acknowledge that while we have seen progress in terms of public attitudes, the attitudes towards more severe and less common mental health difficulties, such as schizophrenia, psychosis and bipolar are still very much lagging behind.  We can see also from the National Disability Authority research on public attitudes to people with mental health difficulties that people are least comfortable working with someone with a mental health difficulty, living beside somebody with a mental health difficulty or sending their children to school with other children with mental health difficulties in comparison to any other disability group.

We 100% support the need to reform it to ensure 16 and 17 year olds are presumed to have the capacity to consent and refuse admission and treatment in mental health inpatient units.  An array of other issues pertaining to young people attending hospital need to be addressed also.  Full reform of the legislation is an immediate priority if we are to ensure the rights of people, including the young, are adequately protected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Kate Mitchell"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I appreciate Mental Health Reform's work in that regard and the update on the Government's legislation.

I am not sure what experience the delegates have of CAMHS, but I have experience of filling in a referral form and it was like doing a thesis in college.  I am torn when it comes to discussions about CAMHS because we need far more resources and bodies on the ground, but there is also a need for complete reform of how CAMHS deals with people.  Generally, it is the parent who fills in the form.  This means that we do not get the child's opinion in the first instance but the parent's opinion of him or her.  The vast majority of parents want the very best for their children, but they do not know their opinions.  The thing about mental health is we do not know what another person is going through.  It is extremely daunting.  For many, it is even difficult to consider in the first instance t hat their child may be struggling or having difficulty and then they are faced with a huge number of forms.  After filling them in, they might be invited to a drop-in clinic, which is totally unsuitable.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps it is different in various parts of the country, but this is not the right way to go about it.  People need to be able to speak to a human being to explain what they believe their children are going through.  Depending on the age of the child and whether there are additional needs, the children could speak.  I understand people will not enter a service immediately, but at least they should receive assistance in trying to access it.  I believe it was Ms Charles who made the point about having to have a diagnosis on paper before someone was seen in the first instance.  People do not ring CAMHS for information for the good of their health but because it is an important service at that time in their lives, but the way it has been designed is not user friendly.  My cynical view is that it was designed in order that people would give up.  It puts far more pressure on voluntary systems.  In Kilkenny, when people ask us for advice or recommendations, we tend to look towards the voluntary organisations in the area because we know that they will listen, that they are available and that people will not have to ring a number for the following two weeks wondering whether anyone will get back to them.  I would like to hear the opinions of the delegates on CAMHS.  When we speak about it, we generally talk about waiting lists and needing more resources, which are important.  I would like to hear the opinions of the delegates on reforming CAMHS, how their organisations are structured and run and how people access them in the first place.<\/p> <p>  My next question is about prevention.

She touched on a number of pressure points in CAMHS.  It is important to contextualise with CAMHS with reference to the entire mental health service offering that should be available to young people.  As I said, the level of mental health difficulties among young people is rising.  Therefore, the numbers of referrals to our services at primary care and specialist levels have increased significantly.  If we review any of the statistics that capture our waiting lists, we will see that the numbers of referrals have shot up throughout the primary care and specialist areas.  As a result, young people are not accessing in a timely way the services available at primary care level.<\/p><p>CAMHS is designed based on the provision of the multidisciplinary team and the types of specialties available.  It is more appropriate for people presenting with more severe mental health problems.  The Deputy is correct that a significant amount of information is sought on the referral form and it can prove to be very daunting to fill it out, which is usually done with the GP.  That is because given the number of referrals being made, the triage process with every one of the 70 teams in the country is important, where they try to work out, based on the information provided, whether it is an urgent and emerging issue or a less urgent issue.  In some way, therefore, they are able to manage the referrals despite the daunting number of referrals.<\/p><p> The second version of the CAMHS standard operating procedure seeks to streamline the referral process and the referral form will be redesigned based on the new guidance document.  Until we deal with the myriad problems in CAMHS, however, including the adequate provision of services at primary care level, and until we confront the recruitment challenges in CAMHS throughout the country, there will, unfortunately, continue to be frustrations, difficulties and poor outcomes for children and young people throughout the country.  It will not happen until we try as a nation to challenge the problems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#U00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Philip Dodd","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":250,"content":"<p>Is there an alternative to form filling?

Even getting on the waiting list can be very difficult and a cohort of people will slip through the cracks.  If someone has a mental health difficulty, he or she may need someone else as a voice to get onto the waiting list.  It is not a matter of filling in all the forms and providing all the information.  It is more likely that a person in such a position would decide to leave it, not to bother doing it, and wonder whether anyone will even remember that he or she sought a referral.  In any event, often the reply will indicate that the person is considered more suited to psychological therapy, which is fine, but the service offered is a drop-in clinic.  While that differs throughout the country, a drop-in clinic, especially a group one, will not be suitable.  It relates to why people are struggling in the first instance.  It is rare that someone enters a drop-in clinic and starts talking about his or her difficulties.  Such a person is more likely to say, \"I knew it.

People have a range of difficulties, some which are severe.  So much could be done in respect of prevention, not least at school level.  A major issue I always raise is that the school system is far too academic and pressurised.  When kids join junior and senior infants, they tend to love school, but by the time they have finished, they cannot wait to leave.  While the work becomes more difficult, there is less and less free time.  Perhaps there could be a greater focus on mindfulness, meditation and the listening skills that were mentioned.<\/p> <p>  Fifteen years ago, I did voluntary work with the Samaritans, which provided an excellent course in listening.  It was the first training that volunteers had to do and it took approximately four weeks.  It is beneficial to one's entire life.  We were taught to listen without judging, which was difficult because one's first instinct is to say the problem can be solved.  Learning to sit and listen without judgment was invaluable.  I do not suggest that that level of training should be provided to children.  It would have to be age appropriate but we could do far more at primary level from the moment the child enters the school system.  It is not all about academics.  Being kind and being a good listener are important skills, but it is as though they do not matter because pupils have to get As or be top of the sports team.<\/p> <p>  I even have a difficulty with the idea of awarding a student of the week, although I understand why schools do it.  While schools will argue it means every child will get a chance, the child who is awarded it every May or June, for example, will realise he or she is awarded it every May or June, not September or October.  It bothers me.  We cannot get away from it because it is so widely discussed.  We are all guilty as parents of being proud of our kids, but it is expressed in so many ways, whether through the student of the week award, junior certificate results or parent-teacher meetings.  Years ago, people did not really talk about such matters and one would not have known the details, whereas now it is everywhere, including online, and one can access everything.  We are all aware of the pressure it puts on kids, and our guests are the experts and deal with it every day, but far more could be done in school in respect of prevention and early intervention.  We say all the time it is okay not to be okay, but do we mean that?  If a young person is struggling in school, it is not okay.  There needs to be a greater emphasis on the matter.<\/p> <p>  I do not know whether our guests have much interaction with the school completion programme and I accept that its activity throughout the country is hit and miss.  In my experience, it is fantastic.  Schools that are in the programme in my region have access to play therapy and counselling, and there is no waiting list.  It is based entirely on the needs of the child rather than requiring the parents to take a means test.  The parents' means are irrelevant.  It is about what the child needs at the time.  A number of other services are also provided.  If there was more play therapy and counselling, depending on what is age appropriate at primary and second level, there would be a far better outcome for many of the less complex difficulties, such as those relating to anxiety, coping mechanisms and building resistance.<\/p><p>The schools that participate in the school completion programme tend to have that early intervention, which stops it from becoming a major issue or at least gives children an idea of how to cope going forward.

One of the interesting things to emerge from it was that young people involved in Youthreach ended up leaving school early because of difficulty with mental health issues and also difficulties with the curriculum and it not suiting their learning style.  It is a two-track thing.  The Deputy describes it really well.  The reforms to the junior cycle curriculum and those planned for the leaving certificate curriculum are really welcome in respect of trying to approach people's different learning styles in different ways.  However, as we have also seen in the youth justice system in particular, students leave school early because of the lack of vocational learning opportunities in our second level system.  They have to leave school and become an apprentice to access those types of opportunities.  Having those earlier and in the formal school setting would be really appropriate.<\/p> <p>  In addition to the new well-being curriculum, which is very exciting and a great opportunity to increase the type of learning the Deputy is talking about and introduce it earlier, we would endorse the recommendation of the Irish Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, IACP, for a pilot for a schools-based counselling programme.  One of the things young people tell us is that if they really needed help, they would seek it, which suggests that they are waiting until they get to a crisis before looking for support.  Having lower level brief interventions or basic psychology type services within school settings could help us to prevent young people from ever needing to access services such as primary care psychology or at the more acute end in terms of CAMHS.  We firmly believe we need to look at the education system.  I welcome the committee's examination of this topic because it is multifactorial.  As we heard when we discussed the issue of suicide, it is complex and it needs multiple initiatives to be able to address it.<\/p> <p>  We ran a campaign a couple of years ago called Listening is Helping.  It was based on the active listening tips of the Samaritans and aimed to educate children and young people on how to listen to others without trying to fix their problems.  Some of the resources we provided in schools were videos of pairs of friends, one of whom was the listener, showing how the listener demonstrated good listening skills.  It is about trying to educate our young people to be there for each other.  Peer support is a massive help where it is appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Power"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her question.  I wholeheartedly agree with her that there is a requirement for a greater focus on prevention and early intervention.  That needs to happen at the earliest stages possible, including at the perinatal stage.  The HSE has developed a model of care on perinatal mental health service provision.  It is important that we see that progress.  It should be a holistic approach so that we see things like public health nurses being trained to identify where there is a mental health need and able to refer appropriately.  Maternity staff should also be trained and able to refer into more specialist services where required.  Primary care psychology should be built up for families and young children.<br\/><br\/>On our early years programme, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs over the years has invested in area based childhood, ABC, programmes which support families, parents and young children.  Some of those programmes are highly effective in addressing mental health but the approach is <i>ad hoc<\/i>.  In some communities there is no focus on mental health or it is a small part of the programme.  We need to see a national focus on mental health in these programmes and appropriate investment and resourcing.<br\/><br\/>On education, I would echo Mr. Power's comments.  We  welcome the reforms to the curriculum and the introduction of components on well-being.  It is important that we ensure a strong focus on mental health within that.  It is necessary not just at post-primary level but also within primary schools.  We must ensure that we are not just presenting schools with guidelines or introducing a framework but that we are supporting our schools, teachers and administrative staff to be able to support children and young people.<\/p><p>There are initiatives in other jurisdictions.  For example, in London mental health advisers who are specifically dedicated to mental health are appointed through local authorities.  Their sole job is to support schools in identifying where the mental health needs lie and how to address them, and to frequently review them and respond to those needs.  They are the types of initiatives that we need to look at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#X00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Kate Mitchell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I concur with the Deputy.  Prevention and early intervention have been mentioned so many times.  As my son tells me, \"Dad, you need to take things upstream.\"  I welcome the statement of the Minister for Education and Skills that well-being will be part of the curriculum, just like history.  Under Connecting for Life, the Department of Health with the Department of Education and Skills has focused on implementing the well-being policy which aims to foster and promote well-being of children and younger people in all schools.  There is also the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  The HSE is supporting the ongoing implementation of the national anti-bullying action plan, which is so important if we look at an upstream level.  The junior cycle well-being programme has been implemented for three years of junior cycle as of 2019.  SafeTALK suicide prevention training has been rolled out in education centres as part of a pilot project providing SafeTALK to teachers.  Teachers tell us that sometimes they do not feel equipped with the knowledge and skills to provide that.  My colleagues in the HSE health and well-being section continue to train teachers in health promotion programmes such as Zippy's Friends and MindOut.  It is very important to bring that upstream and, as a parent and former psychiatric nurse working in CAMHS, I would welcome well-being as part of the curriculum.  I also highlight a need for a global well-being to take in both physical and mental health, social aspects, gender - all of those together.

As we are talking about early intervention, which is a must, we want to look at a requirement to focus on training.  I refer to training across the board, particularly in respect of children in care.  We are looking at supporting foster carers who do tremendous work but might be going through a difficult time and need extra support.  Social workers should have adequate training in terms of giving mental health support.  I would add to that the difficulty we currently have of a decreasing number of social workers.  The young people do not even have that key consistent figure in their lives to whom they can turn in difficult times.  As mentioned by others, there should be key designated people within schools who are trained and informed and to whom young people can go.  They should not be guidance counsellors and should not stand out as somebody the students are going to because they have a problem with their mental health.  We need to look at transition periods.  For children in care, they include leaving care and going into after-care, and becoming a parent.  Statistics show that the number of care leavers who become parents early in life is significant and this often creates trauma for them.  The death of a parent is another transition period.  All these factors contribute.  Significant resourcing and training are needed, as is investment in data and research, which needs to be encouraged.  We need to look creatively at big sister and big brother type programmes within the mental health context, for example, reaching out to people who have suffered from mental health problems in the past and may now be able to support a younger person.  We should look creatively at doing this within communities.  We would say the same for children in care.  We should try to get people who have been in care to speak to them, encourage them and act as role models.  As the Senator said, we need role models to speak out throughout society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#Y00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Karla Charles"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I wholly support the Deputy's comments.  From the perspective of the ISPCC, I do not think anybody would disagree that education is very important.  Recently the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, spoke of having well-being as part of the junior cycle.<\/p><p>All these buzzwords like \"well-being\" and \"resilience\" are becoming part of our language.  In our experience, it is best to intervene or to tick the prevention box and get in early in primary school.  We run a small number of group resilience training activities.  We do not have enough funding to do more.  I was at one in Cork recently.  It was fantastic to see young children talking about these issues in a group situation.  It is vital to reach eight to 12 year olds.  I am unsure how many members of the committee remember the old health promotion videos in schools but they stopped me taking up smoking.  They ran back in 1975 and 1976.  When I saw those videos, I did not want to smoke.  We need to get into schools and start doing the equivalent with resilience.  That is what we are all about with Childline.  We listen to children but we do not direct them.  We help them to build resources around themselves.  Children nowadays are not as resilient as many were years ago.  We need to intervene early and help to teach them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#Y00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Church","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I want to speak about the MindOut programme.  There is a MindOut programme in schools and another MindOut programme for outside schools.  The programme is about building the core competencies of young people so that when they transition from school into college or whatever field they follow, they have the skills that will support them.  Everyone is talking about schools but the youth work sector is also a major area where young people are involved.  The National Youth Council of Ireland has the remit of rolling out the MindOut programme in the youth sector.  The programme is slightly different in the youth sector because it is very much tailored to each young person's specific needs.  The young person will fill out a needs assessment and will be able to indicate what area needs work, whether it is behaviour that develops confidence or decision-making skills.  The programme is tailored to support each young person.  Youth work organisations are trained up on this.  From November onwards, schools completion officers will also be trained up and each programme will be tailored to the young person.<\/p> <p>  Another programme, FRIENDS, was introduced by Carlow Regional Youth Services.  It is the only programme that is cited by the World Health Organization as evidence-based for anxiety in children.  It is effective at all levels.  However, there is a capacity issue in rolling it out.  The service simply does not have sufficient capacity to roll out the programme.  Such programmes provide great support to young people from a young age.  The well-being guidelines will be great.  It is similar to the health quality mark whereas the school will have to take a holistic approach.  Those involved will not only do work on mental health.  They will look at the whole organisation to identify how they will create a more health-promoting environment.  That is what the youth work sector does.  Everything we do is about embedding health promotion.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs did a review of youth work funded projects to find out what was working and what was not working.  One finding of that process was that there are seven potent mechanisms.  The title may have changed since the review was done.  If a programme is seen to be developing a young person's communications skills, relationship skills or decision-making skills, it is considered to be highly effective.  That is what is needed in prevention.  If a young person can develop these core competencies, he or she will be quicker to deal with whatever comes his or her way.  There are programmes which address that but there are funding and capacity issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#Z00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Rachael Treanor"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":266,"content":"<p>It is hard to come up with something fresh after two hours of discussion, but I wholeheartedly agree with much of what Deputy Funchion said.  I also concur with Mr. Church on primary schools.  Do children start first year of secondary school at 11 or 12 years of age?  In any event, by the time children reach the teenage years, many of their core skills are very much developed.  Although they are still developing, the groundwork has been done.  Prevention and early intervention work should be done at primary level.<\/p><p> I wish to make two specific points on social media abuse and negative or difficult material online.  Have the organisations had interactions with social media firms?  Are they doing enough to help, for want of a better word, contribute or provide funding in the area to support mental health?  I have read several studies that came out in the UK.  God knows, we all know that Twitter is a negative space.  We question it to protect our own mental health sometimes in the positions we are in.  This is something that was touched on by one of our guests.  Does a teenager have the objectivity to recognise reality as it relates to Instagram?  It may seem that the world is perfect but people filter things.  It must be recognised that someone might have just had the biggest row in the world.  Yet, he or she looks in his or her element and it appears that life is perfect.  Teenagers do not have the objectivity or skills to know that the person may actually have had a bad day yesterday and will probably have a really crap day tomorrow.  Life is not as perfect as these people's clothes look or as their smiles or filters makes them look.  What can social media firms do?  What can we do policy-wise to counter that?  It is ever increasing.  We have to accept that being online is life for many young people now.  Do our guests have any thoughts in that regard which could be helpful for our report in terms of direction and policy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#Z00500","speaker":"1406","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":268,"content":"<p>It is a timely question in light of all that is happening for young people online.  The interesting thing is that there is a limited evidence base.  There is emerging evidence but every new study with a questionable sample size makes headlines.  It is difficult to distil what is evidence and what is subjective commentary.  What we know from the good solid evidence base that what is emerging is that it is not necessarily social media but how we interact with it that is making the issue greater for children and young people.  There are two tracks to it.  The first is the way a person is engaging with social media.  If people are passively consuming content and not engaging with friends and individuals they know or having meaningful interactions, then it negatively impacts on their mental health.  Screen time is not necessarily a major indicator of poor well-being.  However, it is if a person is using a device from midnight to 3 a.m. and not getting a good night's sleep, which we know is crucial for mental health.<\/p> <p>  The emerging literature suggests that a certain young people are predisposed to being more vulnerable to things like, for example, being on certain platforms and lacking the perspective that not everyone's life is perfect.  Those young people would be more vulnerable eating disorders and things of that nature.

I agree fully with Senator Noone that we need to start at a far younger age to build resilience at the pre-teen stage so that when young people get to that stage they are able to cope with it more readily.<\/p> <p>  The Senator also asked about social media companies.  Generally, there are numerous initiatives and we are partnered with them on a couple of them.  We are a member of the global suicide and self-injury advisory committee for Facebook.  It is quite difficult because on Instagram, for example, young people will post content relating to self-harm.  We know that content could be triggering for others.  It could prompt others to engage in that behaviour if they are vulnerable to it themselves.  Where do we draw the line?  Someone may post something but may be in recovery and may be proud of his or her recovery, while another person might be posting something that is encouraging or promoting the activity.  It is quite difficult.  The policy line is quite severe in that area.  We are all grappling with it.  However, to speak to the larger point we cannot get the digital safety commissioner soon enough.

I will not go into the technical aspects of the literature but a recent comprehensive publication aligned the use of cannabis with the subsequent development of psychosis, depression, self-harm and suicide.  That link is very strong so any discussion on the liberalisation of cannabis must be very much aware of the experience in other countries of the impact it has had on presentations.

Many of the questions I had lined up have been asked.  I will pose them in any event and our guests can shorten their replies or indicate that they have already answered.  First, I acknowledge the presence of Ms Kate Mitchell.  She was in Roscommon at a seminar I ran and she was excellent.  She was extremely impressive and had a good grasp of the situation.  Everybody who attended the seminar was highly impressed by her commitment and knowledge.  It was great to have her with us and I thank her.<\/p> <p>  I will turn briefly to the issue of care.  It is amazing that this country has very poor statistics in the context of young people who have been taken into care, which is very sad and traumatic.  We all know people who have been taken into care.  Statistics in England show that over 45%, perhaps up to 50%, of children taken into care go on to develop mental health issues.  There are approximately 6,500 children in care in this country at present.  There is one thing that greatly upsets me.  Obviously, many children are taken into care for good reasons, such as their safety or welfare.  It is not a criminality situation, yet young people who have been in care are over-represented in our criminal justice system.  Does any witness wish to comment on that?  I find it quite disturbing.<\/p> <p>  I do not doubt the goodwill of everybody in this room to make things better and to help people in extraordinary situations.  It is good that we are all talking about this more.  However, I often get the sense that we appear to always be lagging behind other countries.  We have so many reports and so much conversation.  I have been a Member of the House since 2016 and I have heard plenty of talk about mental health and what we can do but, with no disrespect to anybody here, there is a lack of real action.  One thing that is emerging from this meeting is the need to get back into schools, particularly in the context of dealing with schoolchildren at primary level.  We always say that we must move away from the past.  We have quite a shameful history in caring for children, but in the past, and it was not today or yesterday that I was in primary school, there were always road safety programmes, civics programmes, etc.  It is good for young people to discuss climate change - and we have to listen to what they are saying - but surely there should be a huge focus for young people on the damage caused by alcohol and drugs, which are in every corner of society.  They are as prevalent in the rural areas of Roscommon as they are in any part of the cities of Dublin, Cork or Galway.<\/p><p>Why can we not move<b><\/b>things on and make progress?  It may be said back to me that I am a legislator now and that I need to do it but I need to put that question out there.  We seem to be always talking about the issue, having reports prepared, and we are still very slow to move on.<br\/><br\/>I come from a county where on mental health, in three years, 2012, 2013 and 2014, &euro;17.5 million was returned by the HSE, unused, where we had people in desperate situations.  We have had situations where people have died in our hospitals because of incidents.  This is a fact, yet this money was returned.  Whose fault was that?  Why did it happen?  When one considers what families and communities have gone through in losing loved ones, whether they were young, parents or old, this does not matter.  The family effect is the same. To think that the money was granted and not used.  Why is that happening and why can things not be moved on?<br\/><br\/>I have a quotation from the Scottish First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, who said recently on mental health and about those who left care homes: &quot;We will make changes as we go along rather than simply wait until the review makes its recommendations.&quot;  That is what we need to adopt in this country.  Can I have a quick comment from the panel on this and I accept that some of this may have been answered before?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#CC00800","speaker":"1342","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Murphy and ask Ms Charles to speak first, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#DD00200","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Murphy and for mentioning also children in care which is the focus of EPIC's work.

We need more data on children in care and have that longitudinal study done that has been long promised.  We need to have a mental health strategy specifically for children in care as part of the bigger mental health strategy or specifically for children in care.  We need training on mental health as regards children in care, including the trauma-informed training that many have mentioned.<\/p> <p>  Ms Nicola Sturgeon in Scotland, who was mentioned, is an impressive woman and speaks from the heart.  The point about making changes as we go along is valid, as any change in little steps is better than none.

I am always very happy to take a visit to Roscommon.<\/p> <p>  On his first point on children in care, that is EPIC's expertise, and to draw attention more widely to the issue of mental health and the criminal justice system where we are seeing many people with mental health difficulties ending up in the criminal justice system, and more specifically in the prison system because they are not getting the appropriate mental health supports that they require.  There is certainly a complete lack of resources in the prison system in providing a range of mental health services and supports and in particular psychological services and supports.  One of our asks in our budget campaign for 2020 is that there would be adequate investment in mental health supports among the prison population and also towards developing our specialist forensic mental health services.  There are plans to develop a new forensic service, which is due to open in Portrane next year.  I draw the attention of the committee to the fact, however, that the European Committee on the Prevention of Torture has previously reported that even with that new facility, it will still not meet the demand.  We need to continue to look at that issue.<\/p> <p>  I will also address the Deputy's point about lagging behind or not fulfilling our own national standards and international obligations.<\/p><p>There are a range of issues related to that as to a lack of implementation of policy.  A prime example is our existing national mental health policy: A Vision for Change.  There were a number of reasons for that.  The group that was tasked with monitoring implementation was disbanded and there was not a costed implementation plan.  Going forward, we need to do much better.  With the revised policy, it is so important that we have an independent monitoring group, that the plan is costed, time-lined, and there is effective oversight of that.  <\/p><p> Another issue is a lack of coherence between our policy and legislation.  If one takes our current policy, which promotes the implementation of the recovery ethos in mental health services, on the other side, people do not even have a statutory right to a recovery plan in mental health legislation.  That clearly shows that lack of coherence.  If we are to be truly effective in improving our services and ensuring that we have a modern recovery-focused mental health system, that coherence must be there between policy and legislation.  In that context I would raise the urgent need for reform of the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#DD00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Kate Mitchell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":299,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Mitchell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#EE00200","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Murphy.  In response to his frustration as to there being a lot of talk but where are we going, in our discussion today we should not lose focus on the root causes of mental health issues, especially in how they affect certain vulnerable communities.  The core of it is that mental health is a social justice issue.  The single most impactful factor in a person's holistic health is how much societal oppression and discrimination that person or group experiences.  This might be as regards young people in care, as the Deputy has described, or people who are experiencing socio-economic discrimination, racism, as already discussed, people who are LGBTI+, gender-based discrimination, or emotional, sexual or physical violence and neglect.  These are all social factors and root causes that we need to understand.  These lead to the traumatic brain-body responses that can cause significant mental health difficulties.  We should not forget about those root causes when we are talking about many of the symptoms and different issues we have discussed this morning.<\/p> <p>  As to the general point about action, I cannot overstress the point about the Pathfinder mental health initiative, for instance.  As we have discussed and based on that point that I have just made, mental health is cross-cutting.  It is not just the purview of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, or the Department of Health, it has as much to do with housing as with health.  We should establish this unit to be able to co-ordinate Government policy effectively across all Departments as suggested by the Pathfinder initiative and its proposed unit.  It has the support all of the Secretaries General from each of those three main sponsor Departments and the Ministers have signed off on it.  It is still, however, being looked into.  We need the urgency to establish that type of model of policy-making to be able to drive some of the changes that the Deputy would like to see in the question that he asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#EE00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Power"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Power.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#EE00400","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his comments.

If they cannot answer the questions we are in real difficulty.<\/p> <p>  I am a year in this job now and one thing I am growing to learn - there is a Joint Committee on Justice and Equality next door talking about new legislation that is going through - is that as a country we are very slow to enact legislation that to the public's eye is absolutely obvious.  For the ISPCC there is nothing more obvious than passing the legislation that is being debated next door.  If we are looking for small things that can make a big difference, there does not appear to be any political wrangling around this.  All the political parties, in my observation, seem to agree that it is a motherhood and apple pie situation going on here.  The Digital Safety Commissioner, right now - probably within its own commission or within the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and giving it real teeth - would make a significant difference.<\/p><p>There is legislation in place, which is well worded.

The fundamental lesson from Connecting for Life was that there was a need for a robust implementation plan and a governance structure.  My office is responsible for driving it through.  It is very difficult when we have to deal with other Departments that may not see this is a priority.  The governance structure, through the cross-sectoral group chaired by the Department of Health, has informed decisions and enabled progress to be made with the implementation process.  I would advocate for that.<br\/><br\/>I refer to social media, which was mentioned by Senator Noone, as an example of the other actions that have been taken.  We have intervened with Facebook to ensure certain uploads are taken down, for example in the case of an individual who has posted his or her intention to make a suicide attempt.  Facebook has been very forthcoming in such cases.  Our information is that Facebook now has a mental health specialist with whom we can liaise directly.  Our research shows that the contagion effect has a negative effect on vulnerable members of the community, particularly vulnerable younger people.<br\/><br\/>I draw the attention of the committee to our Mind Monsters initiative, which we launched in 2018.  It was developed by experts and young people.  Young people are a fundamental part of it.  As part of the digital forum, we include little animated programmes about minding one's own mental health.

Being the final speaker has given me a great opportunity to listen.  I want to pick up on a few points that kept coming up, before throwing a few other points into the conversation.  I will try to be as fast as I can.<\/p> <p>  We have heard about coping skills, funding and joined-up thinking, the many programmes and the 47 reports that have been produced.  I was lucky to be a member of the progressive Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care, which was shut down.  Consensus was agreed and signed off by all parties.  There is agreement on the issues.  It gets difficult when it comes to trying to get legislation passed.<\/p> <p>  The television programme, \"13 Reasons Why\", has been mentioned.  When it was aired, people came to me because they were panicking.  I advised them to see what it was about first.  I listened to people afterwards.<\/p><p>We have to be more outspoken.  Some people thought it was very offensive, but my view was that it was very educational.  I have been saying this for years, since I first educated myself about these issues.  I have been a mental health advocate for many years.  We need to get this issue into primary schools.  We need to get back to civics.  I was told at a conference that this could not be done because talking about mental health and suicide would put thoughts into people's heads.  I said in the politest way possible that this was like saying that giving someone &euro;20 to put petrol or diesel into a car means that the person is going to crash the car.<\/p><p> We have to get out of the bubble we are in.  We are dealing with very different people nowadays.  It is very different and complex stuff.  Every time a person anywhere in the world buys a cup, a pen or a set of headphones, it comes with a set of instructions and a warning on the packaging.  The Internet does not come with instructions or a warning.  The younger generation has advanced very quickly.  Young people have moved on.  The Internet has made them slightly detached from reality.  This is where I go back to education again.  We are not giving our children the skills and the ability to cope with life's pressures as they come along.  It has to start at an early age.<\/p><p> We expect that our parents will die at some stage.  We are not going to like it, but we expect it to happen.  This means we need the skills to deal with it.  In the same way, people need the skills to deal with their sexuality or whatever the issue is.  People need the skills to deal with relationship challenges.  It goes on and on.  It is probable that the most recent one or two generations do not have those skills.  They have been lost.  We have to go back to the education system to restore them.  We have to resource it fully.  Education in the area of mental health is not being resourced.  It is being pushed along.  Pilot projects have been spoken about.  It has been suggested that the Samaritans will take this over, but they are not capable of doing so.<\/p><p> I am trying to build a picture here.  While everything is moving in the right direction, it is not joined up.  My biggest fear is that it is going to get lost.  If we are talking about looking at demographics, as Deputy Eugene Murphy suggested earlier, we will all have problems.  I recall that 69 young people took their lives in my local area between 2000 and 2002.  When I spoke about it, I was criticised on the basis that I was bringing the tone of the area down.  I found that disgusting.  It is a question of education.  How do all of the families affected feel?<\/p><p> Everyone who has come to me in the past two years, young and old, has said that even though they were being told that services were available and hearing the messages about minding their mental health that were being broadcast on television, they could not access the services they need.  A person who has a disability in addition to a mental health requirement certainly will not access any service in the country.  I have spoken to the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, about this.  We need to start picking demographic areas in the country or in the CHOs to be targeted with fully resourced pilot projects.<\/p><p> The most frustrating thing I hear within CAMHS is that there is a premier league of 74 teams.  One cannot have a premier league with 13 people on one team, nine people on another team, five people on next team and 22 people on yet another team.  It does not work.  Something has to be done in this regard.  If we do not get to the crux of this from the start, and if we cannot provide the best ingredients to make the proper cake, it will not work.<\/p><p> It is ironic that we are speaking about this issue the day before World Mental Health Day.  I will finish by asking two questions.  I thank the Chair for her patience.  In the honest opinion of the witnesses, are things going forward?  What is the one thing they would change today to get things done right?  We have had issues here.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2019 has been sitting in the Chamber for almost three years.  I am black and blue from trying to get it through the Chamber.  I cannot do so.<\/p><p> Reference has been made to preventative measures.  In July 2016, just after I was elected to this House, the first legislation I proposed was a simple Bill on the issue of suicide training and prevention.  It provides that everyone who takes up a public sector job must do the SafeTALK programme.  This would give people coping skills and spotting skills straight away.  The political will does not exist to progress this legislation.  These preventative measures are simple.  I hope the witnesses understand where I am coming from when I talk about being bounced back into it.  Are they happy with where we are now?  If they could change something today, what would it be?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#FF01000","speaker":"1279","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his comments and questions.  Things have changed in a number of respects.  For example, there has been a substantial decrease in child admissions to adult units and investment in initiatives and services like Jigsaw, which provides valuable support to young people in the community.  However, it seems that we take one step forward but two steps back and I shall give a good example.  A national director for mental health was appointed and a national mental health division was established but the service was dissolved early last year and resulted in a gap in services.  There is a requirement for a director who has distinct leadership and oversight when it comes to the national mental health budget, planning, reporting and implementation.  The Mental Health Reform organisation has, since the dissolution of the office and post, consistently advocated for re-instatement.<\/p> <p>   I am sure that Members are well aware that there have been issues with releasing mental health development funding this year.  The fund amounts to &euro;55 million but only &euro;30 million has been released to date and this is October.  We need investment to sustain the existing levels of services.  We also need investment in new mental health services to develop the sorely needed supports, not just in specialist mental health services but in primary care, community and voluntary supports.  We also need a clear commitment.  To echo the comments made by Mr. Power, it is not just the business of the Department of Health to address these issues.  There needs to be a whole-of-government approach if we are to effectively improve the mental health outcomes of children and young people who live in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Data and research are required.  At present there is no national mental health information system.  The child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, used to report and provide comprehensive details on who accessed its services and what happened in the services.

We know that positive stories in literature about recovery have an impact in reducing levels of self-harm.  Therefore, it is not good to consider narrowly the prevalence of self-harm on a dashboard that indicates the impact of a message.  There is the so-called Papageno effect, by which means a prominent message of recovery has a positive impact on levels of presentation at hospitals.  One can argue that is a very blunt indicator.  However, when one argues for public messages and education programmes, personally, I argue more for a positive message of recovery, rather than sensationalising and giving detailed accounts of episodes of self-harm.  I get that there is tension between freedom of speech or freedom of the press and the importance of social responsibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#JJ00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Philip Dodd"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":321,"content":"<p>We will agree or disagree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#JJ00300","speaker":"1279"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I have talked enough.

I will restrict my answer to children in care.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Eugene Murphy asked whether we were happy where we were.  From our perspective, as an organisation that works with children in care, we recognise that progress has been made, but the honest answer is \"No\".  As long as children in care are over-represented in the criminal justice system and homelessness and addiction services and as long as children in care become parents and have children who end up in care, we cannot say we are where we want to be.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to Nicola Sturgeon.  She has ordered a review of the entire Scottish care system which we view as being further ahead than ours in terms of initiatives.  Ms Sturgeon sees herself as the corporate Mammy.  For children in care, all of whom do not have parents or a family to fall back on, we need a system that is child focused and centred.  Under the current system, for children who leave care to receive support or an aftercare service, they have to engage in continuing training or education.  Where children have had a fractured second level education, with multiple placements, it is very difficult for them to make a decision to move straight into third level education and training because there is no provision for them to take time out when they would be fully supported in considering what they want to do in their lives.  They are forced to make quick decisions when often they do not have the information required to choose what it is they want to do.  As long as these structures stay in place, we will end up continuing the cycle of having children in care being over-represented in all of the areas about which we have talked and they will potentially become the parents of children who will be placed in care because of their inability to look after them because of the ineffective support they will have received.  We are making incremental improvements, but until we review the system and make it focus on the child, rather than the structure that suits the State more than the child in care, we will continually face these problems.  If we could take the money that has been spent on inquiries into issues affecting children in care and put it into a review of the care system, it would be money very well spent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#JJ00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Terry Dignan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Buckley for his questions.

As for whether we are on the right track, I think we are.  Listening to everybody on this side of the table speak of the recommendations for the future and the cross-party recognition that this is an issue, I believe we have to be on the right track and we must learn from that.<\/p> <p>  On the \"13 Reasons Why\" television programme, I agree with the point that education is very important.  Rather than educating children around reasons others may take this step, we need to educate children on how to cope, inform them of who to go to if they have a worry and point out to them who the one good adult in their life is.  If they cannot go to their mum, dad or youth worker, who can they go to?  It is a matter of showing children the way.  We can do that in primary schools but the biggest educator of children are parents in the home.<\/p><p>The unconditional love that that child feels is one of the key components of having a resilient child.  The second key area of being resilient is that the child knows that he or she can go to his or her parents or grandparents and talk to them if he or she has an issue.  The final key area is the fact that children will learn that they can cope, deal with adversities and can come out the other side.  That is where one has resilient children.  The language has changed in this country.  We are talking about coping capacity and about resilience.  We are on the right path but we have such a crisis now and that can be clearly seen in terms of the CAMHS waiting lists.  That has to change. We need a review of all the resources within CAMHS to see what disciplines are the worst hit so that we can get those children seen to.<\/p><p> Prevention is always better than cure.  Listening to children is the very first step and that is why Childline is there 24 hours and the crisis text line is there 24 hours.  We have to let our children know about these services and we will do our part to make sure children look at what support systems they have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#KK00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":335,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Ms O'Sullivan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#LL00200","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":336,"content":"<p>Can I make on very brief comment on mental health?

It is not mandatory but if the witnesses would like to respond, they should feel free to jump in.  There are a few things on my mind, having listened to the witnesses this morning.  I am very conscious of the time.  We started at 10.15 a.m. and it is now almost 1 p.m. but we will finish very promptly.  Mr. Meehan mentioned the HSE is not solely responsible - of course, it is not.  We are all responsible.  In terms of promoting mental health awareness, there are so many things we have done and so many things we must do, including resilience and all the things that are patently obvious at this stage.  There is no doubt in my mind that children with anxiety need all the supports available to them at a young age because it is critical to support young children in primary school who suffer from anxiety, and it is an ever-growing trend.  I have read publications from most of the bodies represented today and it is a common theme throughout.  I refer to the peer pressure and bullying young children in primary and secondary schools face and the role social media firms play in not just policing what is on social media or doing it properly, which they do not, or being given directions, which they are not.<\/p> <p>  I will give an example.  I was not going to mention this, but I will do so.  I was away last weekend and I made a comment on Twitter which I do a lot.  Somebody inferred that I should be beheaded.  It was not because I was in an Islamic state but I presume that is why the idea popped into their head.  I very rarely do so, but I reported the tweet but it did not break the Twitter rules.  I did not mention that to make a headline or whatever but show the sheer stupidity of that.  The computer said \"No\".  Some eejit somewhere in the world decided that it was not appropriate to take something like that down.  It really got under my skin.  I was so annoyed and I asked myself: what if I was a teenager and it was sent by the guy who lives down the street from me?  Those pressures and that form of bullying are so prevalent in our society.  Nameless, faceless people believe it is okay to do this, but it is not.  That is why giving the Digital Safety Commissioner teeth and putting it into the BAI, or at least the code, would be an important step for us to take.<\/p> <p>  I am also aware of the work teachers, resource teachers and SNAs are doing in relation to young children.<\/p><p>I am also aware of the work that teachers, resource teachers, and SNAs are doing with regard to very young children.  I am not sure if the public is aware of them but things likes Braincalm are being used.  This is a very minor programme but it is really beneficial to children.  It calms them and allows one to work with them to get to them to a point at which they can talk about things and understand the impacts of the world around them.  When I took the Chair earlier, I heard Mr. Church says that 1,000 calls come into Childline every day.  That is just one NGO, I am sure there are thousands more.  In a country with a population of almost 5 million, it is very disturbing that 1,000 children are making such calls every day, and we only know about the ones who picked up the phone.  What percentage of the children who need help feel strong enough to pick up the phone?  Is it 5%, 10% or 50%?  I do not know.<\/p><p> To tie back into what the witnesses have said in response to Deputy Buckley's very relevant question, are we in the right place?  Are we going in the right direction?  The witnesses are the experts.  They are the people working in the field.  If they say we are heading in the right direction, I accept that.  I know there are problems.  Representatives of the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, were here at the end of September.  Deputy Buckley and I were here for that meeting.  I know how important what they do is, but I also fully understand the need for us to understand why there are gaps, where they are, and what we can do to fill them.  The committee has three reports outstanding.  We will probably be publishing them before the Christmas break.  One of them is on the recruitment and retention of social workers and one will be on youth mental health.  The common theme is that we cannot get people into the positions to deliver the service.  The budget does not matter, as Deputy Catherine Murphy quite rightly pointed out.  One cannot spend the money because one cannot get the people to deliver the service.  Something has to give.  We have to figure out what it is.  We know what it is.  The question is whether we can afford it.<\/p><p> We have been here for the guts of three hours.  I thank the witnesses very much for their engagement with us on this subject.  The meeting is adjourned until 15 October, when the committee will meet in private session to finalise the report on child homelessness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2019100900002#LL00600","speaker":"1300","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1570575600,"counter":341,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 1.05 p.m. until 1.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 15 October 2019.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health","time":1570575600,"counter":342},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>Th\u00e1inig an Comhchoiste le ch\u00e9ile ag 09:00<\/p><p>The Joint Committee met at 09:00<\/p><p>COMHALTA\u00cd A BH\u00cd I L\u00c1THAIR \/ MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Seanad\u00f3ir\u00ed \/ Senators Stephen Donnelly, Colm Burke.

Ms Healy has provided us with all the correspondence.<\/p><p>I have spoken to Claire Healy a number of times.  She got this letter, on 22 July, stating that she was not entitled to be referred to a colposcopist because she went through CervicalCheck but she decided to get her smear done privately.  As a result, a letter was issued on 11 June by Dr. Lorraine Doherty, which stated that anyone who went and had smears done privately could not be dealt with.  In fairness to Dr. N&oacute;ir&iacute;n Russell of University Hospital Kerry, whom I compliment, she outlined to Claire in a response letter that the letter of 11 June from Dr. Doherty had made this decision - we have a copy of that here as well.  Subsequently, after a number of us raised issues with this, it was pointed out that there was a email from Mr. Liam Woods on 16 August changing this.  As the Senator stated beforehand, there were emails issued to more than just Kerry hospital.  This was across the board, as we know now.<\/p><p> What is deeply worrying is that we have a new director of CervicalCheck who was in here not so long ago and gave information here with which I need to join up the dots.  Ms Healy is saying in her letter to us that what was said in here is contrary to her experience.  Ms Healy is saying that there was a direction given by the witness, who was here at the time, on 1 June 2019 that she could not be part of CervicalCheck.  There was a bit of flurrying around the edges about the fact that screening is not diagnostics.  We all know screening is not diagnostic etc.  This is not about that.  This is about colposcopists and referral.  Ms Healy's slides showed that there was an issue that needed to be investigated.  Subsequently, after going to the colposcopist and eventually getting it done, it showed that she had a high-grade change which was just below cancerous and it was something to be very concerned about.  I have a serious concern here - Ms Healy had high-grade changes - given everything that has gone on in relation to CervicalCheck, that somebody could unilaterally send out a directive such as this.  There have obviously been more people affected than the two women we know about and have referred to.  Anyone who was in a similar situation would have got the same treatment based on the letter sent in June by Dr. Doherty.  I am also concerned, having read the transcript of her evidence to this committee, about the reasoning Dr. Doherty gave for this happening.  In fact, at this stage, I think we need to go back and ask again.  As a consequence of this episode, which raises deep concerns as regards how this happened and how unilaterally it could happen without the HSE at a higher level doing anything about it, and while I respect the fact that the issue has been subsequently dealt with, unless a couple of people - there could have been more - put this in a certain forum, it could have continued for a considerably longer period.<\/p><p> My concern relates to a number of matters.  The first is the evidence given by Dr. Lorraine Doherty and I think we must have her back in.  The second is how management in the HSE over CervicalCheck allowed this to happen.  Third, if one looks at what they stated in committee, what they publish on their website and what is actually happening, this is an example of that trail not being accurate.  We need to instill public confidence in all the screening programmes.  We need to instill public confidence in CervicalCheck.  How can we as a committee make sure that happens?  I believe we must ask Dr. Doherty to come back in here to explain this.  While it has corrected it now, I also believe we need to ask HSE CervicalCheck management to explain in detail the process by which this happened.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100900002#B00600","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I call Deputy O'Reilly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100900002#C00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":353,"content":"<p>Could I clarify one issue?

I have spoke to Ms Claire Healy as well.  She should not have been obliged to talk to politicians.  It should have been dealt with.<\/p> <p>  We need to get Dr. Lorraine Doherty back in because there are questions to be asked.  For example, one of the excuses offered as to why there may have been an issue with tracking the results is that if one goes from the private system to the public system, somehow one's identification, ID, changes.  Clearly, it does not because the CervicalCheck ID was used by the GP and used by all of the tests at that time.  That is not an excuse for what happened.<\/p> <p>  We need to get the bottom of how somebody can come in and intimate to this committee that she did not know how the decision happened when clearly she was central to it, and how many women are involved in this.  I am aware, from within my own social circle, of at least one.  I would imagine, if we scratch the surface, there are many women who would have been impacted like this on the basis that the waits were so long and any woman who was worried would either do it herself or, as in the case of my friend, be pressured into doing it by her husband on the basis of the need to get it done.

It is worth noting the HSE's response last week.  I put its clarifying statement to it and stated that while it was regretting that there was confusion caused, it clearly instructed hospitals not to treat particular people, there is no confusion about that and it made a mistake, and asked would its representatives admit that they have made a mistake and let us move on.  I am open to being corrected but I am fairly sure they did not say, \"Yes, we made a mistake.\"  They danced around it being an awful situation that such confusion was caused.  I reflected on it afterwards and concluded it is more serious than the usual hedging one gets, because this is about CervicalCheck, which came to light because of non-disclosure and because of people not putting their hands up and saying that they got something wrong.  We are all fallible and people get things wrong.  Within a functioning healthcare system, our officials and clinicians must be able to put their hands up and say that they made a call, be it a management call or a clinical call, and it was the wrong call.  That must be acceptable within the system.<\/p> <p>  If those running the system - last week we had the Minister, the Secretary General and the head of the HSE before us - refuse to say that they got that wrong, it should not have happened and it will not happen again, that sends a message to every healthcare professional, official and manager working within the system that says it is business as usual; hedge, fudge, obfuscate and never accept that one has done anything wrong.  It is regrettable.<\/p> <p>  I will ask a question for consideration at the committee.<\/p><p>I agree that we should find out the scale of this issue regarding CervicalCheck.  However, it opens up the broader question of where else in the system this is happening.  Women were waiting up to nine months for smear test results from CervicalCheck but people are also waiting between three months and two years for access to an MRI, a CAT scan, or various other diagnostics.  Inevitably, people are being advised by their GPs that, as they will be waiting years for diagnostics on the public system, they should get them done privately.  The GP can then look at the results and refer them to a consultant in the public system if there is something there.  Patients feel compelled to get such tests done privately because of the huge waiting lists for public diagnostics.  Is it HSE policy that such patients will not be seen across the public system?  If a person has a diagnostic result that shows he or she needs specialist medical care, will the HSE do what it did to Ms Claire Healy?  The HSE knew her results indicated that she needed specialist care, but it would not allow her access to the public system.  She was told to get back in the queue and that she would be put on a list once she had gotten the same results in a year and a half from a public MRI machine.  The committee should ask the HSE where else this practice is going on.

The big issue relates to the Irish National Accreditation Board, INAB.  I have gone through all of the documentation provided.  I do not know whether any other member has done so.  I spent last night going through it.  I have raised issues regarding INAB at the committee many times.  Its representatives appeared before us.  I refer to the issues regarding quality assurance at the Manchester laboratory.  In fairness, I asked the representatives of INAB when it found out that the Manchester laboratory was not accredited.  What is really scary is that for a long time I have been chasing up what happened in regard to the second Scally report.  I have outlined the full chronology in this regard in the D&aacute;il, at this committee and at another committee on numerous occasions.  The report was due in February.  Something happened to ensure that it was not delivered.  I asked Dr. Scally and the Minister on numerous occasions and in various ways why the report was not delivered on the date it was due.  I asked the Secretary General at a meeting of the committee on 13 February and he truthfully told me it was imminent.  Dr. Scally was due to appear before us the following day.  In reply to a parliamentary question asked on 12 February, the day before, I was told the publication was imminent.<\/p> <p>  I sought information from INAB in other ways and, to its credit, it provided it.  I had to go through the committee and ask it to get all of this documentation.  In a letter to INAB on 1 February regarding MedLab Manchester, Dr. Scally outlines that he is in the course of completing the supplementary report, the publication of which is imminent and indicates that he would be grateful if his questions could be answered as soon as possible.  On 6 February, he again wrote to INAB and stated that he was in the process of completing the report and would appreciate a response sooner rather than later.  On 13 February, the same day I asked questions at this committee and was told the report was imminent, Dr. Scally wrote to Adrienne Duff regarding the lab.  He stated that he would operate on the basis that the Manchester screening facility was covered by the accreditation INAB had given MedLab, as he had been told by Ms Duff the previous day.  We all now know the truth in that regard.  In the letter, Dr. Scally goes on to inform Ms Duff that the relevant section of his report was being finalised that morning and seeks written confirmation of what she told him on the telephone.<\/p> <p>  In fairness to the Secretary General of the Department, he told me at the committee meeting on 13 February that all quality assurance issues were being dealt with, that the terms of reference which were published - I am not sure whether they were fully engaged with - would be dealt with and that the report was imminent.  The reality is very different.  As a consequence of what happened regarding the non-analysis of the contracts, the lack of information on the labs, the discovery of this issue relating to Manchester and the quality assurance concerns I raised at the committee following requests from patient advocates, the report was not published for many months.  Given that the Manchester laboratory was not accredited by INAB - it did not even know it existed - the consequences for the report were immensely serious.<\/p><p>Everything changed around that time.  This is a jigsaw on which I have been working for the guts of six to eight months.  This is the final piece in the jigsaw.  If the meeting of this committee on 13 February had not happened, would this report have been published - it was about to be published - and would we ever have known about the quality assurance that was needed, the lack of quality assurance, the issues that had not been covered by the first report, the details of what happened regarding the Irish National Accreditation Board, INAB, and the Manchester laboratory, the process by which what happened with the Manchester laboratory came about and the fact that it can never be guaranteed that no other laboratories were used by screening providers with outsourcing because some of them no longer exist?  Would we have known about any of this without that meeting of this committee?  The trajectory of this report - when and how it was going to be published - changed dramatically over those days.  I am glad it did because we subsequently obtained all the information but I am concerned about how a report that was originally 16 or 17 pages long increased to the size it was in the end.  Much of this information and analysis will have been missed.

The council works to ensure that medical education, training and lifelong learning is benchmarked against the highest international standards.  Standards for undergraduate and postgraduate training are set by the council while we also require doctors to maintain their professional competency through updating and maintaining their professional skills on an ongoing basis.  The council provides guidance to doctors on matters relating to conduct and ethics through its guide to professional conduct and ethics for registered medical practitioners.  <\/p> <p>  The Medical Council is also where the public may make a complaint against a doctor.  Fitness to practise inquiries and complaints are dealt with in accordance with rules, fair procedures and direction from the courts.  In summary, the key objective of the council is to protect the interests of the general public in its interactions with registered medical practitioners while also supporting these doctors.<\/p> <p>  As the council&rsquo;s register is a valid and complete list of doctors who are legally permitted to practise medicine in the State, it is a comprehensive source of medical workforce intelligence.  Following the 2016-17 workforce intelligence report, which was launched in April this year, we published the medical workforce report for 2018 last week.  This included a deep dive into the data describing demographics of those retaining and withdrawing from the register of medical practitioners in 2018 to inform workforce planning and, ultimately, improve patient care and safety in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  There is a continued overreliance on foreign-trained doctors, as evidenced by the continued increase in the general division of the register.  The practical and cultural challenges within the health system need to be addressed in tandem with an increase of appropriate health practitioner supply, otherwise, these problems will escalate.  <\/p> <p>  A year-on-year decrease in applicants to the register was observed between 2016 and 2018.  Simultaneously, the number of those who voluntarily withdrew their registration between 2014 and 2018 increased year on year with a net flattening impact on the register.  Comprehensive and co-ordinated workforce planning is necessary to determine requirements to put the right doctors in the right place with the right qualifications.  <\/p> <p>  The research findings establish that while we train a significant number of doctors, this needs to increase to ensure we have a sustainable medical workforce into the future.  Ireland has been replacing the doctors in the system rather than changing the system itself, which is notable through the feedback received from doctors leaving the register.  We need more attractive working conditions and increased opportunities to enter medical training programmes to guarantee substantial, high-quality workforce recruitment and retention, both short-term and long-term.<\/p> <p>  Our recruitment and retention challenges have now filtered right through from service posts to retention of consultants in the Irish context.  We know that we are experiencing doctor shortages.<\/p><p>This is being managed through high-cost interventions, for example, the use of locum services, and this impacts on the continuity and quality of patient care.  Examining retention is crucial to producing a sustainable self-sufficient workforce into the future.<\/p><p> In 2018, there were 2,190 doctors who enrolled on the Medical Council register for the first time.  That is the figure for new entrants to the register.  The primary growth reported was in the general division of the register.  Most new entrants to the register were in the general division and educated outside of Ireland.  Doctors from countries outside of the EU cumulatively contributed more new entrants to the Irish register of medical practitioners than Ireland.  Non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, were the most prevalent group of doctors registered with 7,800 on average in the system, an increase of 6.6% since 2017.  Some 46.1% of NCHDs were in training while the remaining 53.9% occupied non-training posts.<\/p><p> A total of 20,109 doctors with an average age of 44.5 years chose to retain their registration.  Some 86.9% of these doctors were on the general and specialist divisions of the register.  The majority of those retaining their registration were male and were Irish graduates.  It was also self-reported that for every two hospital consultants there were three NCHDs on the register.  Approximately 70% of non-retaining doctors were aged 44 or under.  Some three quarters of non-retainers were on the general division and 24% were on the specialist division.<\/p><p> In 2018, there were 1,453 voluntary withdrawals recorded, representing a 37.9% increase since 2017.  One third of doctors who left the register of medical practitioners in 2018 were graduates of Irish medical schools.  This group comprised slightly more female, some 52%, than male doctors.  Most of these doctors reported leaving the general division of the register while 29% left the specialist division.  Interns represented 11.9% of this group leaving the register.  The majority of these doctors planned to practise medicine in another country while 66 doctors planned to stop practising altogether.  For those who left due to workplace issues, resourcing and lack thereof was cited.  However, the lack of appreciation and value placed on the work and perseverance of doctors in such circumstances was a contributing factor.  The consequent personal impact of excessive hours and lack of support also raised significant challenges not only to morale but to patient safety as well.  Most registrants who reported leaving due to limited career progression planned to pursue available opportunities in the United Kingdom.  In particular, the UK was cited as a jurisdiction that welcomed doctors and was willing to support and train them.  Respondents reported accessing a training scheme as a significant barrier to career progression.  The standards set for admission to schemes was perceived as variable, compared to the international context.<\/p><p> For those educated internationally or possessing international experience, gaining employment at consultant level in the specialist division in Ireland was reported as a significant challenge as well.  This reflected recruitment and retention challenges at the most experienced level of the medical career trajectory.  In total, 320 doctors reported leaving the register for family or personal reasons.  International graduates from a medical school outside the EU and Ireland made up half of this group, while medical practitioners who graduated from a medical school in the EU and were EU nationals comprised an additional quarter of this group.  The majority of respondents leaving due to family or personal reasons were leaving the general division of the register.  However, a little over one in five doctors leaving the register for these reasons were specialist registrants.  Some of those leaving explicitly cited the incompatibility of long working hours with the demands of family life.  Family members and their care across the lifespan was a strong theme that emerged from the qualitative data reported, as would be expected in this category.  In particular, maternity leave was cited ten times in the data.  The demands of balancing both home and medical professional practice was made explicit by one respondent, who noted the challenges that the long working hours present.  Supporting spouses in their careers was also cited as a reason for leaving the register by respondents.<\/p><p> Through evidence-based data-driven reporting, we can provide this continuing national picture of the medical workforce in Ireland.  We can identify trends, highlight areas of concern and make suggestions on how to address issues.  Findings from this report and other research conducted by the council highlight continued trends and concerning insights that need to be addressed collaboratively by policymakers, educators, planners and employers to effect meaningful change to support doctors and, most importantly, to protect patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100900002#F01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rita Doyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Doyle.

It is interesting to note that there are quite significantly more female trainees.  There are more women going into the doctor training pipeline yet at the top there are significantly fewer.  That could be for historic reasons, meaning that as the younger cohort grows older it will balance out.

Now it is nigh on equal with about 48% women and 52% men.  I do not think that any plans were made for the fact that women have children.  The stage at which they are just finishing their higher specialist training or their general practice training is often the time when they have children.  No allowance is made for that.  No extra allowance is made for people who are going to take maternity leave.  The workload falls on the people who are there.

Proportionately the number of those in training has decreased in relation to the number who are not in training.  The numbers who are not in training have increased over the past three years by about 800.  There are real challenges in that group in progressing on to training and career progression.  About four in five or 80% of them are international medical graduates and have a real challenge getting onto a programme that will further their career.  In a situation like that, a doctor is going to make a sensible choice to want to progress his or her career and will look elsewhere to do that, so many of them do leave.

The IHCA represents 95% of all hospital consultants working in Ireland&rsquo;s public hospital and mental health services.  Our members are calling on us to stand up for the rights of patients, in particular their right to timely access to high quality care.  As the committee will have heard from the Irish Medical Council, we are losing hundreds of our highly trained medical doctors and specialist consultants each year to other countries.  Doctors want to work in a system that works for patients.  Our current system is not working for patients.  Our acute public hospitals are understaffed of consultants and patients are waiting far too long for care; many have worse outcomes as a result.<\/p> <p>  A total of 1 million people are waiting to access care in our public acute hospitals and every day and month new records are broken for the numbers waiting on trolleys, the numbers waiting for an outpatient appointment and the length of time spent waiting.  Consultants live with the impact of these deficiencies each day on, for example, children with scoliosis whose life-changing operations have been cancelled three or four times already, the elderly widow, housebound and in pain, waiting three years for a hip operation, and the almost 30,000 women to whom the State promised better healthcare but who are now waiting to see a gynaecologist.  Hospitals consultants carry this burden each day, while working on teams with half the required number of consultants compared with the EU average.  Many leave.  This ongoing exodus is being driven by a loss of hope among doctors.  They do not see a future for themselves in the Irish health service and equally have no confidence that there exists the experience, willingness or leadership to fix the Irish public acute hospital system.  For the doctors who have left and those who remain, they can see no evidence of concrete improvements over recent years.  We all have a responsibility.  Committee members, as public representatives, cannot accept this.  The people who elected them have put them in a position to fix this.  Hospital consultants on the front line believe our system is fixable but we need policymakers to work with us, not against us.<\/p> <p>  Our population has grown by 9.7% since 2008, with the most significant growth in the number of those aged 65 and over, which has increased by 44% over that period.  This is nearly three times the EU average growth rate.  It is important to note that, while those aged 65 and over make up approximately 13% of our population, they account for 54% of total hospital inpatient bed days, 37% of day-case bed days, and 26% of emergency department presentations.  These demographic changes are one of the main factors driving increased demand for public hospital and mental health services.  In the past decade, the number of inpatient and day-case patients treated in our public hospital and mental health services increased by 22%.  In addition, unmet demand continued to increase due to significant capacity deficits as is evident from the large numbers on waiting lists and patients being treated on trolleys.  The ESRI has projected a further 37% increase in patient demand for hospital care by 2030.<\/p> <p>  It did not need to be this way.  The consultant recruitment and retention crisis has been self inflicted by successive Governments and Ministers for Health since 2012.  The unilateral cut imposed on new entrant consultants and the exacerbation of it by not applying the High Court settlement to all 2008 contract holders represented a flawed policy.  The realistic solution is to restore parity for all consultants appointed since 2012.  The failure to do so has resulted in adverse consequences for patient care and their outcomes.  With 500 permanent consultant posts either vacant or filled on a temporary basis, this is resulting in an extremely overstretched work environment and it is impacting adversely on the quality and safety of care that can be provided to patients.  The new entrant salary inequity is the root cause of Ireland&rsquo;s consultant recruitment and retention crisis and the unacceptable numbers of people on record waiting lists which are now the longest in Europe.  The failure to address the crisis is destroying the basic fabric of our public hospital and mental health services.<\/p> <p>  I would like to clarify a couple of key issues on the number of consultants working across our public hospitals.  The HSE, before this committee last week, stated that the number of unfilled consultant posts now stands at 377, yet, HSE data confirm that there were 3,281 approved permanent consultant posts in our public hospital and mental health services in June 2019.  The same data confirm there were 2,762 consultants in post, leaving about 519 permanent posts unfilled of which a significant proportion are occupied on agency contracts.  The number of consultants in post is significantly below required levels.<\/p> <p>  The association has previously highlighted to the committee that the inability to fill over 500 permanent consultant posts is leading to the appointment of non-specialists to specialist consultant posts.  As at February 2019, there were 108 non-specialist doctors in consultant posts, who had been appointed since 2008 when the requirement to be registered on the specialist division to practise independently as a specialist consultant became law.  These appointments are also in breach of the terms of the 2008 consultant contract and the HSE&rsquo;s recruitment rules.  Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, President of the High Court, wrote to the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the health service management in May 2018 to outline the resultant serious patient safety concerns this is causing.<\/p><p>The main reasons for the employment of non-specialist division doctors in consultant posts are the new entrant consultant pay inequality and our public health service&rsquo;s lack of international competitiveness in recruiting consultants.  There are significant risk and governance issues with so many non-qualified doctors working as specialists in our public hospitals.  They are also concentrated in regional hospitals and mental health services.  In January 2019, a total of 44% of consultant posts at the midlands mental health service were occupied by doctors who were not on the Medical Council specialist register, according to a HSE reply to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Donnelly.  Equivalent figures at other hospitals included 31% at South Tipperary General Hospital, 13% at the Midland Regional Hospital, Tullamore, 12% at University Hospital Kerry, 11% at Sligo University Hospital and 7% at University Hospital Waterford. <\/p><p> Ireland has the lowest number of medical specialists on a population basis in the EU, 42% below the EU average, and between one quarter and one half the number in many specialties.  In Scotland, the number of public hospital consultants is 56% higher than in our public hospital and mental health services, when adjusted for population levels.  The current number of public hospital consultants in post is far short of recommended levels for most specialties.  For example, we need 140 additional radiologists by 2027, or a 55% increase on the current number, to reach the European average when adjusted for population levels.  In emergency medicine, the existing cadre of 86 consultants needs to be increased by 90% to provide a safe level of emergency care.  The consequences for patients of not having a sufficient number of permanent hospital consultants in post are very damaging and represent a false economy.  Almost 570,000 people are waiting to be assessed by a hospital consultant on an outpatient basis.  Since the start of the year, more than 53,000 people have joined hospital outpatient waiting lists, while in the past five years, the numbers waiting have increased by more than 205,000. <\/p><p> More than 1 million people are on myriad hospital waiting lists at present.  Our public hospital and mental health services can ill afford having approximately one in five of our permanent consultant posts unfilled.  It places several important national healthcare programmes at risk.  For example, phase 1 of the national children&rsquo;s hospital, the urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital, could not open 16 hours a day, seven days a week, as was originally planned in July, due to a failure to recruit a sufficient number of paediatric emergency medicine and paediatric radiology consultants.  Instead it is open for less than one third of the planned hours.  Ongoing consultant shortages put the wider children&rsquo;s hospital project at risk.  The national cancer care programme is failing to meet its requirement of seeing 95% of patients within two weeks, due to a combination of consultant and bed shortages.  The national maternity strategy, launched in 2015 following several adverse maternity events, cannot be fully implemented because of a failure to recruit the additional consultants in obstetrics and gynaecology recommended under the strategy.<\/p><p> The national critical care programme has fewer than half the ICU consultants required to provide the standards of specialist care recommended for the most critically ill patients in our hospitals.  There are only 35 whole-time equivalent ICU consultant posts, rather than the 82 that are required.  The urology model of care, launched in early September, has little chance of success as there are so few consultant urologists.  There are 37 urologists in Ireland, which is one third of what New Zealand has, or 15% of the number in Denmark, both countries having similar populations to Ireland.  The Government&rsquo;s national mental health plan, A Vision for Change, published in 2006, is a blueprint for the delivery of a modern service but it remains severely under-resourced.  Children and adolescent mental health services have 50% of the specialist staff they need, while older people&rsquo;s mental health services have a similar deficit.  Adult services have 25% fewer staff than required.  <\/p><p> There is a cost of doing nothing.  The restoration of pay parity for consultants appointed since 2012 will result in an outcome that is better than cost neutral, when account is taken of the resultant patient benefits and the savings on medical agency locums, the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, outsourcing, and State Claims Agency claims and payments.  Medical agency costs have increased by &euro;57 million per annum, totalling more than &euro;90 million per year, compared with 2012, when the then Minister for Health, Senator Reilly, imposed the salary cut on new consultants.  Furthermore, the cost of engaging an agency consultant is up to twice that of employing a non-new entrant consultant and three times the new entrant consultant salary.  In recent years, the cost of NTPF outsourcing has increased by &euro;75 million per year in an attempt to reduce waiting lists.  In addition, State Claims Agency medical compensation payments have quadrupled since 2013, totalling &euro;247 million in 2018, or an increase of &euro;184 million.  The cost of restoring full pay parity in one step in January 2020 would have been substantially less than the &euro;45 million per year estimated by HSE and Department of Health.  It is questionable in respect of the number of new entrants the HSE has assumed to be on the lower new entrant salary and the lack of allowance for the higher cost of existing agency contract holders.  In addition, a high proportion of new entrant consultants are already on the higher, ninth point of the new entrant scale, which would reduce the estimated cost significantly.<\/p><p> The word \"crisis\", when describing our health services, is unfortunately an overused and devalued term, yet all indicators point to the fact that the delivery of our health services, year after year, faces much greater challenges.  In this regard, the IHCA&rsquo;s #CareCantWait campaign has identified the extent of the difficulties arising from vacant consultant posts.  Our acute hospital and mental health services are crumbling with no sign of improvement.  One of the most effective ways to address the deterioration would be for the Government to restore pay parity for consultants appointed since October 2012 to end the medical brain drain and ensure that Ireland will become a more attractive place to pursue a medical career.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for inviting the association to its meeting.

More than 1 million people in Ireland are waiting for care.  Nothing like it has ever been seen here and nothing like it exists anywhere else in the developed world.  More than 100,000 men, women and children have been waiting more for than a year and a half just to see a consultant.  Children have been waiting for years for surgery, including some with scoliosis, as Dr. O'Hanlon noted, whose spines are curving to almost 90&deg;, something that does not happen in any other European country.  Elderly men and women must wait for days on trolleys in accident and emergency, while there are unsafe staffing levels in various specialties, as mentioned in our guests' opening statements.  There are hundreds of unfilled posts and we have the lowest level of consultants and the longest waiting lists anywhere in Europe.  There are non-specialists in specialist roles and doctors are leaving medicine in record numbers.  Agency costs have shot up more by more than &euro;60 million in recent years and national care programmes, including for cancer and maternity care, are at risk.  The national children's hospital's satellite could not even fill its posts and as a result operates on less than it was meant to.  Pay inequality for new entrants has been identified and accepted across parties, by the Opposition and the Government, and has been championed and pushed by the medical community for a long time.<\/p><p>Given all of these crises in healthcare that leave men, women and children waiting, suffering, deteriorating and dying, and given the relatively low cost of fixing this bloody thing, why is the Government steadfastly refusing to do so or even to meet representatives of the consultants to talk about it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100900002#R00200","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":720,"content":"<p>We are here because we want to help.  The only reason we come to any of these things is because we want to help and we really believe in the public system.  I could say the same for everybody who is on the Joint Committee on Health.  The only reason we show up in the morning is that we believe people should have timely access to excellent care and that it should not matter where someone lives, how much money he or she earns, or what is in his or her local hospital.  All of those things should be irrelevant.  Every person should have equal access to excellent care.  Once people get into the public health system, we do an excellent job.  They are really happy.  When we survey our patients, we find that the ones we have seen are really happy.  As has been said, it is the million people we have not yet seen who are disgruntled and they are totally entitled to be.  They have not accessed care.<\/p> <p>  The Government has a fear of dealing with us and with doctors in general.  It has this horrible fixed narrative that health is a big black hole or an unfixable problem where good money goes to die.  The Government feels that it continues to pour resources into this big black hole and nothing comes from it.  In a way, the Government chooses not to engage with us because it does not want to face up to that black hole or start looking at how to pull back from it.<\/p> <p>  I look at examples of solutions.  This morning I was in a clinic and I met one of the nurses.  She told me to make sure to tell the committee that the staff are doing a great job.  I said that I would.  The truth is that the people who work in our health service do a great job.  We have fabulous healthcare workers, but we do not have enough of them.<\/p> <p>  I can give my own hospital as an example.  I work in Beaumont Hospital.  We used to be terrible, but our numbers are now excellent.  The rheumatology department in Beaumont Hospital went from having two rheumatologists to having three.  Our waiting list went from three and a half years to less than six months.  I delved into the data for the other specialties in our hospital.  There were thousands of people waiting for longer than 18 months to see an orthopaedic surgeon.  The hospital added 1.5 new posts and changed the triage system.  Everyone now on that waiting list has been there for less than nine months.  That is pretty much the only orthopaedics department in the country that has achieved that.  Now, nine months is still terrible, but it is not the same as waiting to be seen for a year and a half.  The same can be said for respiratory care.  Nobody has been waiting for longer than six months because a new body was introduced and took the tail of the waiting list.  The waiting list is now gone.<\/p> <p>  The only places in our hospital that have not seen improvements are the places where people have resigned and left.  We have lost three or four people in the dermatology department to the private sector.  That waiting list has skyrocketed.  That is the only place where we have had to put some of the workload out to tender via the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  Yesterday, we were discussing the cost of getting people out for their dermatology assessments, their biopsies and their subsequent treatment.  I will not outline the numbers because I would be killed, but they were massive.  I was absolutely astonished.  That is the only place in our medical service where we are outsourcing.  That was a huge cost.  It certainly cost more than it would cost to hire three consultants a year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100900002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Laura Durcan"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":721,"content":"<p>I would like to come back to the lack of movement.

One of these things was the fact that the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation applying to GPs needs to be reversed.  Many people have pushed for that and it is beginning to be reversed.  Another was a stance taken by the nurses and midwives.  Things needed to be done there and movement was achieved.  They did not get everything they wanted but there has been movement and provisioning in the budgets for that.  Another thing that obviously must happen immediately is that new entrant pay inequality must be eliminated for consultants.  We are running out of doctors.

That is only my opinion and my reading of the situation.  It is partly because our public health system has been politicised and weaponised.  When I was a trainee, consultant posts were really sought after.  They were really competitive.  There were multiple applicants and the best person would be picked.  In 2012, the then Minister, Senator James Reilly, imposed a unilateral 30% additional cut on new entrants' pay.  He was warned that it would decimate recruitment and retention.  He did it anyway.  Multiple Ministers since, including the current Taoiseach, said that this was a mistake, it had not worked, it was not saving us money, and it needed to be reversed.  However, nobody has had the political courage equal to desire to say the Government made a mistake.  As doctors, we live with the fact that there is uncertainty in medicine.  We make our best decisions with the information we have.  I am a radiologist.  We have an error rate of between 3% and 5%.  We know we make mistakes.  We have to learn from them, improve and move on.  To me it seems there is an ideological or political determination not to admit that this was a mistake.  This measure never saved us money.  We are spending a fortune on agency locums, far in excess of what we would spend on permanent staff who would be leading, innovating and developing the service for our patients.  Everybody seems to see the figures, recognise the impact on patients and realise that this needs to be changed, but there is a lack of political courage to do it.<br\/><br\/>The Taoiseach made a commitment in the D&aacute;il on 24 October 2018.  He said he would sit down with the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, which represents more than 95% of consultants, and our colleagues in the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, and simply do this.  So far what we have seen is kicking the can down the road - inaction, lots of talk, selfies and spin.  I call on all the members present to say &quot;Enough&quot;.  We are not a political football.  We are the people who look after the patients of this country - the constituents, families, friends and children of the members of this committee.  We do not have enough people on our team to provide timely access to high-quality care.  Every person in this country should expect that if his or her GP feels he or she needs access to secondary or tertiary care, he or she will get it within six weeks.  That is their right.  Our Constitution says that the Government has a duty to defend their right to life.  The 1 million people waiting on lists, some of whom have been waiting three or four years for access, do not feel very defended or protected by politicians right now.<br\/><br\/>The five of us who are here this morning should not have to come here like this.  We should not have to call politicians out on an issue as basic as having enough people to staff our teams safely.  Our number of consultants <i>per capita<\/i>is half the OECD average, and some of those comparator countries are not rock stars with whom we would want to be compared.  Some 20% of our posts are empty.  We have the fewest consultants <i>per capita<\/i>in Europe.  Our system is burning out and spitting out our doctors because those of us who are in post are firefighting to protect patients from the gaps in care.  We are on intolerable call rosters, we have workloads that are not safe, and we go to work and do this every day to protect patients.  We look to politicians to lead us and to give us the resources and the front-line staff to provide the high-quality care that we provide to everybody when they need it, but politicians are ignoring us.  They promise to engage with us and then do not follow through.  We are willing to meet them any time, day or night, Monday to Sunday.  We work those hours 24-7, 365 days a year.  We provide the medical cover.  There has been enough talk.  We have implementation deficit disorder in this country.

It has been going around my mind for the past seven years.  When will people really engage at ministerial level and at official level?  I ask this question after representing the food sector and the health sector since 1990.  I am not a novice in representation.  Prior to that, I worked for two years in the Department of Finance.  I have an understanding of what officials are there to do.  That is the nub of the problem.<\/p><p>We have an inexplicable position where the Minister of the day is not engaging on an issue and the senior officials in the relevant Department, or potentially Departments, are not engaging either.  My understanding, prior to moving to the private sector, was a civil servant had a responsibility to analyse problems and formulate the best solutions.  We have made most of the analysis ourselves and I have not seen any from the other side.  It is a win-win solution and would be better than cost-neutral, as we have alluded to, if we allow for the better outcomes for patients, leading to shorter stays in hospitals, fewer medical bills and less home or nursing homecare.  If we leave patients on lengthy waiting lists, as we are, it becomes a big problem for the effectiveness of delivery of care across the spectrum.  There would be a large cost saving.<\/p><p> I again request what we have repeatedly asked of the Minister.  I ask him to engage and sit down with us.  The question is why he is not sitting down with us.  Any public servant with a role to deliver more effective and efficient service in the State should sit down with the organisation that is coming to the table with solutions and pointing out the direction of travel.  If that public servant is not sitting down with that organisation, it indicates a problem somewhere on the other side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100900002#S01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Varley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":730,"content":"<p>It is what I am trying to understand.

I do not understand it and it makes no sense.  It is not logical.  When I saw the budget documents yesterday, it really bothered me that there was no provision made for this.  The delegate will understand as someone who worked in the Department of Finance that there is a loose suggestion that all parties will come together for talks with the Government at some undetermined date in the future, but there is no provision made in the budget for next year for bringing about the reversal if the talks are successful.  We heard from the Medical Council earlier that for every one doctor leaving medicine in 2014, three doctors left in 2018.  It feels like we have passed a tipping point in the collapse of access.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps I might get the thoughts of the delegates on a final point.  The shortfall in the number of doctors is far more than what we typically speak about.  Dr. O'Hanlon indicated the shortfall was approximately 500 consultants; there are approximately 3,300 approved posts and we are missing approximately 500 full-time consultants in thse posts.  That is a number that would keep us from having the lowest level of consultants in Europe.  Accepting that the figure is 43% below average, based on the latest data, getting to the European average number of consultants for our size of population would require us to add approximately 1,600 posts.  If we are just to get to the European average, therefore, we need to fill the 500 posts and hire an additional 1,600 consultants.  That suggests we are short more than 2,000 consultants.

Such persons are being wiped off the list after seeing a private consultant, but they are then placed on another list.  They are not getting any closer to getting better, rather they are being shifted from a list that looks atrocious to one that looks slightly better.  They will soon be joined by others.

Essentially, money is being transferred from the public health system to the private system.  When there is such low staffing and restricted access, there is major risk to patients who have to wait.  We are forced into a position where we must try to buy access to quality care wherever it is possible to do so.  Deputy O'Reilly's point is absolutely correct as if people are seen and have their first outpatient appointment, they might need a scan and be transferred to another list.  They would be new to that list.  The numbers might improve, but we must see the impact on the patient.  What would work for patients is having enough consultants in posts to provide access to care in order that everybody can be seen within six weeks.  It is something we could achieve if we all worked together with a shared vision and a focus on patients by listening to them and responding to their needs.  That is what the Peoples Needs Defining Change platform in the HSE is all about.  It is about reacting to the changing and ageing population, where one person in eight is over 65 years to where one in six will be over 65 by 2030.  The NTPF is just a short-term sticking plaster.  We need capacity in public hospitals.  Dr. O'Hanlon mentioned Scotland.  It has twice the number of consultants and 30% more beds.  We need investment to provide capacity in the public sector because the NTPF is very expensive.  Investing in the health service is not just about increasing the budget but spending the money properly on front-line staff and in providing capacity to facilitate the treatment of patients.  The quote from Warren Bennis is that we are \"over-managed and under-led\".  Therefore, we need the leadership to show the vision of investing in the public health system in order that we will be staffed at capacity to meet the changing population's needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100900002#T00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabrielle Colleran"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":734,"content":"<p>We can link the consultant recruitment difficulties with the NTPF lists.  We have widely acknowledged that there is a national difficulty in recruiting doctors and consultants, particularly in regional hospitals.  I am based in the west and north west where there are examples of recruitment difficulties.  For example, in Letterkenny four acute medicine posts have been brought to advertisement recently and there has been a failure to fill three of them.  One third of the hospital's necessary radiologist posts are filled, while half of the emergency department posts are filled on a permanent basis.  There is a difficulty in filling posts in Mayo University Hospital and Sligo where posts must be advertised two, three or more times.  Some of them remain unfilled.  The effect is that in County Mayo there are over 8,000 people waiting for an outpatient appointment, according to the NTPF waiting lists.  In County Sligo there are almost 17,000 people on the lists, while in Letterkenny there are just under 18,000 on the lists.  Between the three hospitals which have clear difficulties in recruiting consultants, there are 22,800 people waiting for over six months to be seen at an outpatient clinic.  We can directly correlate the recruitment difficulties with the long NTPF waiting lists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100900002#T00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aine Burke"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":735,"content":"<p>We base many of our statistics on what we see on the NTPF waiting lists.  I would like to point to an inaccuracy I have seen in the figures quoted by the NTPF for the waiting list for endocrinology in Galway, where I work as an endocrinologist.  According to the NTPF figures, there are 144 patients waiting for an outpatient appointment at our centre for diabetes and endocrinology.  The longest waiting time quoted on the site is up to 12 months.  As I said, I work in Galway University Hospital.  As I triage the general endocrinology waiting list, I am familiar with the real figures.  There are 1,543 patients waiting for an outpatient appointment to see an endocrinologist in Galway.  Some 890 patients have been waiting for more than six months to see an endocrinologist in Galway, of whom 50 have been waiting for more than three years.  Based on the endocrinology waiting list in Galway University Hospital alone, the official figures on the NTPF's website represent a tenfold underestimate of the actual numbers of patients who are waiting.  I can see from the figures in front of me that the longest waiting time has been underestimated by approximately two years and four months.  I will explain what this means in a patient context.  I suspect that this also applies to paediatrics.  I have seen a significantly higher number of paediatric endocrinology referrals to the adult endocrinology clinic in Galway.  By the time a child over the age of 13 years has waited the three to four years required to see a specialist paediatric endocrinologist, he or she will be classified as an adult.  This denies children access to endocrine healthcare at a vital stage in their development - I emphasise that endocrinology is vital to the development of children - and to the transitional care model which represents best international care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100900002#U00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Conall Dennedy"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":736,"content":"<p>The figures that cited by Dr. Dennedy are shocking.  My views and those of my party on the NTPF are well known.  It is not going to be news to the delegates that we do not think investment in the private sector will improve the public sector.  Such investment has never helped the public sector and will never do so.<\/p> <p>  I would like to ask about what is being done.  Representatives of the Medical Council have told the committee about the culture in which medicine is practised.  When they were questioned, it became obvious that an understaffed medical facility was a tense and fraught atmosphere in which to work.  The delegates from the Medical Council described the culture in which medicine was practised as almost toxic.  It is not that the individuals working in the sector are toxic but that the organisation is dysfunctional.  It is no reflection on the people working in it; it is more of a reflection on the system.  It has been suggested some doctors and consultants who are abroad might be available to come home.  I know that some of the delegates have returned from overseas and their return is most welcome.  Is anything specific being done in that regard?  When we speak to individual hospital managers, we learn that they use informal networks for these purposes.  One such manager has told me that people with whom she was in school now have sons and daughters who are working overseas as doctors and consultants.  She is working hard to try to get them to come home.  Are the delegates aware of any specific measure being taken to make it attractive for consultants who are abroad to come home?  Are packages being offered?  Is every effort being made to attract doctors back to Ireland?  Is it simply the case, as I suspect it is, that the word is out that the Irish health service is a deeply unattractive place in which to work and that Irish doctors overseas are deterred from returning home on that basis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100900002#U00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":737,"content":"<p>Many of us have come back from abroad.  Dr. Durcan likes to say Irish people are like salmon in the sense that they want to come home.  Irish people are very passionate about their healthcare system and really want to contribute to it.  The reality is that when one goes away to work in different systems that are properly staffed and have the capacity needed, it is very hard to come back to work in a system that does not work for patients.  I will explain what I mean by referring to the concept of moral injury which comes from the military.  It means that doctors tend to move into healthcare because they care about people, want to help patients and improve things.  When an endocrinologist like Dr. Dennedy is working in our system, he deals with patients who have to wait 12 or 18 months to access the CT or other scans that determine the next forms of treatment they need.  In such circumstances, the greatest impact is on the patient.  It is hugely damaging for them and their lived experience.  For the doctor who wants to help and improve things, there is a moral injury that occurs day in, day out when he or she is working in such conditions.<\/p> <p>  We have heard about the culture in the medical sector and the bullying that happens.  There is a very high level of burnout among doctors in our system.  When people start to burn out, the first thing that starts to happen is dehumanisation.  Doctors start to lose their empathy for others because they are so overstretched.  Our consultants have huge workloads.  Staffing levels are at half of the European average.  Consultants have to run around to cover the gaps.  They try to protect patients from risk.  They try to pick out the person among all of those who have been on the waiting list for 18 months who has a hidden cancer or a degenerative neurological condition that needs earlier intervention.  They have to manage significant levels of risk.  There are substantial levels of burnout and moral injury as a result of being unable to provide care.<\/p> <p>  Any time I treated a child in Boston who needed an MRI scan, I was able to ask his or her parents whether an appointment that evening or on the following Saturday would be best for them from a employment point of view.  I was able to ask parents what worked best for them.  As a doctor, there is great satisfaction in being able to provide care when people need it in a way that is responsive to their needs.  Doctors in our system do not experience this because of the lack of capacity.  No amount of resilience training or packages will help.  We need to staff our teams.  I appreciate that pay parity, pay equality and equal pay for equal work are  some of the basic things in which Deputy O'Reilly's party believes.  For us, it is a basic part of safe staffing and making the workplace attractive.  Proportionately, we train the highest number of doctors in Europe.  Our doctors are of a really high quality and can go anywhere.  They are loved in the New Zealand and Australian medical systems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100900002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabrielle Colleran"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":738,"content":"<p>They are very mobile.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100900002#U00400","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":739,"content":"<p>If one visits every high level academic institution in the United States, the chances are that one will find more Irish people in them.

To be honest, the Government has been at war with consultants for ten years.  It has to stop.  We are the Government's full-forward line.  Consultants are part of a health team that includes the Minister, the Department of Health and the HSE.  We have to work with patients as part of a team to deliver care.  As I said, the narrative has to change.  Health has to stop being a political football that is used for political gain by people on either side of the political divide.

He has a stay or go decision to make in his life <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>his career.

His conclusion was that for as long as there is pay inequality, he has no decision to make.  It is already made for him.  That is the problem.  The difficulty we have is that for as long as successive Ministers for Health perpetuate the inequality that was introduced in 2012, it will continue to drive away our highly trained specialists who are embraced in other services and given all the resources they need to treat patients on time.<br\/><br\/>One third of the graduate classes, the intern classes, goes to Australia each year from all the colleges and locations.

They are too sick to use the private system.  What we are here today to discuss is creating access for everybody to the public system.  Martin Varley is saying that whether one decides to have private health insurance should be an irrelevance.  If somebody decides to have private health insurance and have his or her tonsils dealt with in Blackrock, that is the person's own business.  The truth is that any of us could be in a car crash on the way home, and if we suffer trauma, we go to the public hospital.  If we have a stroke, we go to the public hospital.  This discussion is about the public hospital.  If the public hospital had enough consultants and beds, how people are funding their healthcare would become a complete irrelevance.  It would be just that they go to the hospital.  That is why we are here today.<\/p> <p>  I do not have a private practice and have no vested interest in private patients.

I work in paediatrics and very few children have private health insurance.  I do not know when they are coming to me if they have private heath insurance.  My concern, when I look at our recruitment issue, is that our recruitment issues are most prevalent in the specialties where there is the least private practice and the most type A contracts, such as emergency, psychiatry and my specialty, which is paediatric radiology.  I am concerned that if the private income were to be removed, our recruitment and retention crisis would get worse.  I work with equipment in both of the hospitals I work with that is beyond its end of life and has not been replaced.  There is a huge need for investment in the capacity, the people and the infrastructure.

That is my last comment on that matter.<\/p> <p>  I come from the mid-west.  I am on a campaign at the moment regarding University Hospital Limerick, UHL.  The Chairman is my colleague in this campaign.  Neither of us is even from Limerick.  We are from Tipperary and Clare, but it is our main hospital.  It is a scandal if one does a comparative analysis on the volume of doctors and consultants in UHL versus Beaumont Hospital.  They are both model 4 hospitals.  I have the tables done on this analysis and it is a disgrace.  It cannot continue.  The people of the mid-west are being discriminated against.  UHL had eight medical physicians and consultants who left in recent years.  A number of them joined different organisations.  Two of them moved because they had more than 100 patients on their lists and they just could not cope.<\/p> <p>  I have only one more question after this but I asked the Medical Council of Ireland about this earlier and it did not have very good quantitative analysis, to be fair to it.  It will improve that based on suggestions we made.  I return to the issue of why consultants are leaving.  There are a variety of reasons for this, and I dare say they are not always financial, although some of them are.  Working conditions and geography are other variables.  Are there any instances of consultants leaving that are specifically geography related based on the structures of the HSE in certain locations or does the Irish Hospital Consultants Association have any evidence of same?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100900002#W00600","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":799,"content":"<p>I totally agree with the Deputy about the UHL staffing issues.

The fall in staffing in the regional hospitals has been very recent.  It is really only since 2012 that we have seen that there are no applicants for those jobs.  There were gastroenterology jobs in University Hospital Waterford that had ten or 12 applicants in the past.  If a gastroenterologist job in University Hospital Waterford were to be advertised now, it would be a good result if one suitable applicant came forward to fill it.  The same can be said for all the other hospitals.  There have always been people who have wanted to be county physicians and there have always been people who have wanted to be down the country for many different reasons.  Historically, there have not been specific geography challenges, but now there are hospital challenges whereby people are slow to come home for a different salary and, equally, they are slow to come home to a hospital that is almost entirely staffed by locums.

I was very much taken by what the Irish Hospital Consultants Association said recently about having no confidence in the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and I have been very much taken by what the witnesses have said here today.  I want to quote what the Irish Hospital Consultants Association said on escalating a campaign, and I would like it to give us more information on what that campaign is.  That is the first question.<\/p> <p>  The second question is as follows.  The Irish Hospital Consultants Association said the Minister did not have \"the authority, understanding, inclination or experience to deliver timely, quality hospital care ... or improving conditions for patients\".  Very few people have been as critical of the Minister on various different issues as I have.  Others have as well, to be fair to them.  I am saying this as an Opposition spokesperson, but the tone of that statement did not help the Irish Hospital Consultants Association.  I have to be brutally honest about this.  It did not help.  I listened carefully to what the witnesses said earlier about being on the one team, stopping this being a political football, and that the different sides of the political divide do not matter.  There are many sides to the political divide here, not just two.  The witnesses may want to really remember that because I am not sure it comes across a lot of the time.  There is huge sympathy across politics with the issues the Irish Hospital Consultants Association are dealing with and the consequences for patients.  Again, I am saying all of this as an Opposition spokesperson and I have put out statements that are critical of the Minister on numerous issues, but to refer to the Minister's inclination, understanding and experience, particularly to refer to his experience, needs an explanation.

Our last meeting was in early March.  He agreed to meet us and to speak at our conference in mid-September.  He wrote with his apologies that he could not attend that meeting and committed to meet us in the following week or so.  Despite numerous calls to his private secretary, I got no response to engage.  That has been the pattern and not just in recent months.  When one is trying to come to the table with solutions and to engage, it becomes quite frustrating and difficult for people who are trying to deliver care in difficult circumstances on the front line.<br\/><br\/>There was a question of what we are doing with our Care Can't Wait campaign, which I will get to.  A number of months ago, when we met the Minister, we determined that an avalanche of problems were brought to our attention that we had to highlight relating to the difficulties in delivering timely, quality care to patients.  We touched on some of them today.  For example, in University Hospital Limerick, six whole-time pathology post are approved.  There has been failure to fill one third of those posts over the last seven years, having been advertised repeatedly, and it is causing major problems in timely diagnostics.  It is also jeopardising the post mortem service, which people like to see delivered in a short time for all the obvious reasons.  That is now hanging by a thread and has been for the last number of months.<br\/><br\/>I watched the committee's earlier engagement with the Medical Council and the Deputy asked a pertinent question for which I do not think it had an answer.  He asked if the shortage of consultants and the overstretched nature of work in hospitals is giving rise to increased claims.  I checked the situation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the State Claims Agency and clinical claims.  In 2010, there were 1,935 active claims.  Last year, which is the most recent year we have statistics for, there were 3,196, a 65% increase in less than a decade.  That is indicative of what we think is happening and we know why it is happening.  Patients rightly have an expectation to get timely, quality care.  When 1 million people are on a waiting list, that does not happen.  People arrive and their treatment is effective insofar as it can be, but it is too late in some cases.  Patients have a reason then to feel short-changed.  I would if I was in their situation and I certainly hope that I am never in that situation.  To be left on a waiting list not knowing how serious is one's problem is not good.  It does not help with having a good flow and effective treatment of patients in hospitals, and makes their stay longer.<br\/><br\/>There is significant frustration with the system.  Two cardiology posts have been advertised in Kerry and are unfilled.  One locum is in position.  One geriatrician post has been advertised but the hospital has not been able to recruit for it.  There is a vacant obstetric post filled by a locum.  A radiology post has been advertised numerous times and cannot be filled.  A half-time haematology post is vacant.  A histopathology post has been transferred to Cork University Hospital.  We have major recruitment problems and there is a knock-on effect for patients and stress for doctors and consultants.  The Care Can't Wait campaign is about ventilating the real problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100900002#X00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Varley"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":809,"content":"<p>How?

Yesterday was budget day and the fund had &euro;100 million as of this budget, if my memory serves me correctly, having had &euro;75 million last year.  It is always lauded as being great that this spend exists.  As some of the witnesses probably know, I work as a pharmacist at times but have worked in the hospital sector too.  It seems that part of the health service is essentially subcontracted to a private company, whether in Dublin or abroad, and it is not as simple as just having a great value service.  It is a success for somebody who gets an operation done abroad.  Will the witness who is best placed to explain tell the committee and people at home what the impacts of that are?  A person might get the operation but what about administration and follow-on care?  It is an expensive way of doing business, from my reading of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100900002#X00400","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":812,"content":"<p>In rheumatology, some centres have outsourced to the NTPF for basic, first-time assessments.  In those cases, patients have gone to a private hospital for their first-time visit and if they are diagnosed with something or require further follow-up, they then go to the original unit as a return patient.  That is dreadful for the person.  The consultant in charge of that unit has not met the person who is now a return patient to the service with a rheumatological diagnosis.  The same happens in many different places.  It is something to be avoided for medical outpatients with conditions that need chronic care because it is a disaster.<\/p> <p>  I see many patients with joint replacements who have gone north of the Border or to other places to get their hips or knees done.  It works really well for a young, healthy person who does really well with a hip or a knee and comes back saying it was fabulous and a great experience.

If one tries to take someone off a diabetes waiting list and takes that person out of that multidisciplinary care setting, that person may be seen be a single consultant, the waiting list may be massaged, and he or she may be put on metformin or such.  Individuals who are complicated patients may have been taken from a primary care situation and placed in that setting.  Where do patients get their footcare and eyecare?  What diabetes specialist nurse or advanced nurse practitioner can they ring up to adjust insulin should they be put on insulin?

On 25 September, a conference took place in University College Cork, organised by Professor John Browne, director of the SPHeRE research and training programme, to discuss the recruitment challenges for smaller hospitals.  Professor Frank Murray, formerly professor of gastroenterology at Beaumont Hospital and now director of the HSE's national doctors training and planning, NTTP, unit, gave a presentation on exactly the topic to which the Deputy referred.  Things have not always been as they are now.  In 2010, for instance, only 30% of non-consultant hospital doctors were in non-training posts.  This year, for the first time, that cohort is at more than 50%.  It is a very bad situation to be in because when trainees are in training posts, they are affiliated to a college and faculty, take examinations and have training days, and can access a range of supports that come with being affiliated to a training scheme.<\/p> <p>  Moreover, the distribution of these non-training posts is not equitable, with smaller hospitals affected to a greater extent than the larger hospitals.  The same hospitals that have a high proportion of empty posts, locum consultants and non-specialist consultants also have the highest proportion of non-trainee NCHDs in post.  This leads to inequitable access to care for patients and an unsupported experience for the doctors in those roles.  In order for a post to be a training post, however, there must be a permanent consultant in post who is a trainer.  We have ended up in a horrendous chicken and egg cycle where we do not have enough permanent consultants to be trainers and not enough training posts.  As a consequence, there has been an explosion in the number of non-training NCHDs.  We cannot fill our permanent consultant posts, we do not have enough training posts and the hospitals are left desperately trying to cover the service and provide the care.

The Deputy's situation is a little bit different from ours.<\/p> <p>  On the serious matter of bullying, which does exist in medicine and in medicine in Ireland, it is not just non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, who are bullied even though the rates of bullying for NCHDs are slightly higher than for consultants.  The rate of bullying of consultants is also very high.  Who does it?  It is other consultants, managerial staff, nurses, patients and families.  It is totally unacceptable but it reflects a system that is toxic from within, and some of that is down to the fact that people are too overstretched.  One may dismiss this as if it does not matter but there is a lot of research on burnout and its impact on people.  The first thing that happens is dehumanisation.  If one is overworked to the point of being mentally affected by it, the first thing that happens is that it becomes easier to be rude, to be mean and to be difficult with others because one perceives oneself to be under inappropriate stress.  Is this what we want?  Is this a system in which people flourish?  No, it is not.  Part of changing this requires us to change the culture and what is acceptable.

Most of the country was broke, serious cuts were coming down the track, GPs had to make sacrifices and to accept cuts, judges had make sacrifices and to accept cuts, as did everybody right across the board.  Nobody liked it and nobody wanted to do it but the then Minister for Health did not go out at that time and decide &quot;I am going to punish the consultants, reduce their incomes and render them worthless&quot;.  There is a danger here.  I will not go along the path of my colleague, Deputy Alan Kelly, but he made the point that one can over-politicise medicine also.  It is not necessarily in the interests of the patient, the consultants or the system.<\/p><p>I have one more point, and the witnesses can answer all of them then.  Reference has been made to the State Claims Agency and a dramatic increase in recent years of &euro;184 million per year.  That is not unique to the health services.  The State Claims Agency in Ireland and its equivalent in other jurisdictions have had the same problem.  I can get the figures on those if the witnesses wish.  I am concerned that it is very easy to throw out the figures and say &quot;Look, this is the cause of our problem and we need more money&quot;.  Everybody needs more money.  Has the Irish Hospital Consultants Association<b><\/b>considered how much more money consultants need to deliver the services that the witnesses say they need?  I agree.  Can the witnesses can tell me the amount of money they need?  Is it &euro;3 billion? Is it &euro;4 billion? Is &euro;10 billion or &euro;20 billion?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100900002#Z01200","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":850,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Durkan.  We touched on some of these issues during our last exchange with the committee and I thank the Deputy for raising them again.<\/p> <p>  The reduction imposed on new entrant consultants in 2012 was an additional 30% on top of the 10% for new entrants.  It has never saved money, for reasons I can point to.  We have longer and longer waiting lists.  We are outsourcing more than an extra &euro;100 million next year.  Our agency bill has gone up to &euro;90 million.  That is the medical agency only, which is an increase of more than &euro;60 million.  Our cost of indemnity has quadrupled, and I only quote the cost of clinical indemnity that the State Claims Agency is responsible for.  If one compares this internationally, our costs of indemnity are much higher than any other jurisdiction.  There are a variety of reasons for this.  I am quite sure that our low staffing is a contributory factor.  A recent Medical Council report on training counts found that where trainees were working long hours - as often happens with a 50 or 60 hour week - there is quite a high incidence of being involved directly or indirectly in an adverse incident concerning a patient.<\/p><p>There is a correlation which the statisticians will see if they wish to go and do the work.  It is common sense that understaffed teams will lead to more clinical indemnity problems and that longer waiting lists will cause more adverse outcomes for patients.  We are dysfunctional in how we are managing the health service, not in how we are delivering it.  There are excellent staff on the front line who are doing their absolute best in extremely difficult circumstances.  The decision by Dr. James Reilly was not justified at the time and no other group of public servants was singled out for such a cut.  There was a related but not equivalent cut for the Judiciary, but it was reversed in full earlier this year.  One group of public servants has been left with a salary differential of between 30% and 40% and it is the one with the biggest recruitment and retention problems.  We want to engage with the Minister and have been seeking a meeting with him for the past seven months.  Making progress involves engagement.  When officials and the Minister do not sit down and engage with the body which represents 95% of consultants, we know that there is a problem.  The problem is not with the consultants who are seeking the meeting but with those who are not engaging.<\/p><p> The amount of money required to run an efficient and effective health service is multifactorial and we do not have the manpower to analyse it.  We spend &euro;1.23 billion less in Government funding on public hospitals than the EU average and have the lowest numbers of beds and consultants, with the highest bed occupancy.  In running any service such indicators would be used as guidelines in progressing and solving the problem.  We need to redirect funding to the front line to deliver care, meaning that acute hospitals and mental health services have to be funded appropriately.  The mental health service is very poorly funded by international comparisons, as are acute hospitals.  We want to sit around the table and work through these issues, but we are not in a position to tell anybody what the health service requires by way of funding for the future, as thousands of public servants are paid to do that job.  I was a public servant once, but I do not have to do it any more as I am preoccupied with a far wider brief.  I hope the public servants to whom I refer are prepared to meet us to brainstorm on the issues and come up with solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100900002#Z01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Varley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":852,"content":"<p>I cannot compete with Deputy Donnelly who made an offer to alleviate some of the budgetary concerns, but I am sure we will relay to the Minister the association's anxiety to progress matters on an amicable basis and I am sure he will respond in kind.

One worries that the reduction has led to an increase in unmet needs.  We are trying to find solutions.  If the director general of the HSE is to balance the books, services must be reduced or the system reformed.  Can the delegates demonstrate to the Minister that a restoration of consultant numbers and pay parity would reduce costs to the health service?  Can they demonstrate a relationship between restoring pay parity and saving money in the health service?  The HSE's service plan will be delivered in the next three or four weeks.  It invariably starts off with a statement to the effect that the money the HSE has been given this year will present challenges in delivering services similar to what was delivered last year, as well as in coping with innovation and the development of services.  A winter initiative will also be presented in the next few weeks.  It will include the cessation of elective care in December and January in order to free up beds.

Therefore, there are savings to be made in that area alone.  There are always background expenses related to providing sick cover and maternity cover, but addressing the locum bill could generate huge savings.  However, there are things that are harder to quantify such as the savings to be made in seeing and treating patients earlier.  In the context of Mr. Reid's attempts to balance the books, I ask everybody to give him a chance.  If he goes to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for additional funding, the fact that there has already been so much additional funding while waiting lists have got longer will make it more difficult for him.  He has had a few meetings with multiple consultants and senior leaders in nursing and midwifery, as well as allied health professionals, to discuss how we can save money without impacting on patients.  The impression I get from him is that he wants to show that he has a stable pair of hands and can manage the money in order that he can have investment where it is needed.  As consultants, we want to see that cost savings are not made in providing patient care but in eliminating waste within the service.  In any healthcare system across the world there is 30% waste.  Consultants are very keen to lead in that regard.  Dr. Durcan is involved with biosimilars which enable us to save money without an impact on patients as the priority is to ensure patient needs are met.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100900002#AA00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabrielle Colleran"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":859,"content":"<p>We calculate the figure for restoring pay parity at around &euro;20 million.

There has been a HSE initiative to bring on a biologic hub where one electronically prescribes these medications.  The HSE has put forward this programme where we prescribe biosimilars, which is similar to the concept of generic prescribing.  One prescribes the slightly cheaper version.  In return for that, the Government has set out that the units will be rewarded with a once-off payment in order to facilitate this kind of process.  The Irish Society of Rheumatology and my hospital will weigh in on this.<\/p><p> The truth, however, is that people want to weigh in in a scenario where they have a good relationship.  Rheumatology is full of nice people who want to help but there are other specialties which will kick back against this type of initiative.  There are many of my colleagues who do not want to engage in a process where they see a system that is flogging them to death but gives them nothing back.  It is undervaluing them and chasing them away.  If one has a system where one engages with the lead players to give patients the best service they can have, then it is a relationship that works both ways.  There are huge cost savings which we had in many different places.  At the moment, however, we are all operating in silos and we think those outside them hate us.

We have many excellent locums.

No, we are not.<\/p> <p>  My parents-in-law are from Kerry.  If they go to their local hospital and see someone with a consultant badge, I expect that that person is, by definition, on the specialist register.  What being on the specialist register means is that someone has gone through the appropriate training scheme and passed the relevant examinations.  There is a minimum standard that he or she has met.  If someone is not on the specialist register but is on the general register, the minimum it means is that he or she has passed an internship.  However, there can be a large discrepancy in what examinations they have passed and what experience they have.  For the public, it is false advertising if someone has a consultant badge and is not actually qualified in that way.  Speaking as someone with family outside Dublin, my concern is that the numbers are not spread evenly across our acute hospitals and are mainly concentrated in pockets.  I will not name the hospitals, but committee members could probably guess them.  It is a concern that there are pockets where there is a lack of permanent consultants, locums and non-specialist consultants who are not on the specialist register are in place, and the majority of NCHDs are not in training posts.

Dr. Colleran has mentioned a person's expectation that the consultant his or her mammy meets in Tullamore or wherever is a real consultant.  We are all of an age to remember the yellow packs.  We do not want a devalued, inferior or two-tiered consultant.<\/p> <p>  It was always the case that doctors left college, entered the system, trained up and wanted to be consultants \"when they grew up\".  I am not trying to trivialise it.  As such, it is concerning that people are not even applying for jobs anymore.  A question has been asked about how much money is needed.  Some &euro;20 million has been requested for the restoration of pay, which would to some extent encourage people back into the profession and even out the differential between private pay in private hospitals and the public contract.  Although Sl&aacute;intecare commits to removing private care from the public system, my understanding is that, when the 2008 contract was negotiated, it was to ensure that a consultant was not disadvantaged by working in the public sector.  The contract was designed so that a consultant would not just leave to work in a private hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100900002#CC00600","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":882,"content":"<p>In terms of the retention of staff, the public sector should pay the lowest amount possible that retains the staff in the public sector.

We have probably layered up management and administration by default over a series of reconfigurations and policy changes and by virtue of the fact that a proper effort was not made to determine how the service could be restructured possibly.  We could point to the change from the health boards to the HSE.  By the way, Deputy Durkan, the IHCA did not seek that.  In our most recent documents, we have encouraged an integration into regional areas where hospitals and community services would be put together.  Our main ask therein is for one streamlined team and one budget, for community services and hospitals to work together and for bureaucracy to be delayered.  This is not intended as a criticism of anyone who is in administration or management, but we have six administrative or management personnel for every consultant.  That is too high by international standards.  The fault rests with the failure to restructure, not the individuals.  The individuals probably do a very good job but, given the significant change in IT services, some of those functions and jobs may need to be redeveloped such that we would have less administration and less management.  This is where we can work together.  We can spend the money we have better, though.

I did not get what I wanted because everyone did not agree.  It was an all-party committee and it can be very difficult to get a committee to agree.

It is a question of patient morbidity, that is, how sick they actually are.  Any analysis that looks at the cost per patient or cost per hospital stay must be adjusted for comorbidities.  The patients who present to us in the acute hospitals are astonishingly more unwell than the patients who present to most of the private hospitals, mostly because the former present in a crisis via the emergency department.  These are people who have a comorbidity list of 20 illnesses and are taking numerous medications.  It is not the same patient population presenting to the private hospitals as that which presents to public hospitals.  As a result of paper-based record-keeping, as one factor, we are not very good at capturing the degree of complexity and comorbidity we are seeing in the public system.  That is very much reflected in the cost of a patient stay in the public system versus the cost in the private system.

Public hospital emergency departments must be sufficiently staffed and have the capacity to treat any emergency case that presents.  Such cases would include a person who has had a stroke or brain haemorrhage or is presenting acutely with a tumour, as well as people involved in a serious road traffic accident who might need to see a vascular surgeon, neurosurgeon and orthopaedic surgeon.  All of those specialists must be there to provide care in the middle of night, with access to anaesthetic services and an intensive care unit.  Within the private sector, on the other hand, hospitals can cherry-pick the types of care they provide.  To illustrate, I will use the example of a private MRI scanner.  A private hospital providing a musculoskeletal MRI service might have 20 young men with sore knees in and out at a cost of &euro;200 each.  In Holles Street, on the other hand, we have very sick and intubated premature infants coming down for MRI scans, accompanied by senior nurses and neonatologists, with each such infant possibly spending an hour and a half in the scanner.  If we compare our scanner with the scanner in the private hospital, the latter will seem to be much more productive because it was used for the young lads who were able to hop on and off in quick succession.<\/p> <p>  In fact, we are providing complex, high-level care and, as such, we will always be more expensive.  However, if one is pregnant, if one is a child, if one is in a road traffic accident, if one has a stroke or a brain tumour, one will not be going to a private hospital but to one of our public hospitals.  We need to be adequately staffed and have the infrastructure to provide that care.

I am head of public policy for Facebook Ireland and I am joined by Ms Claire Rush, our lead counsel on content and regulatory matters.  We are based at Facebook's international headquarters in Dublin.<\/p> <p>  We recognise the real concerns of citizens and Oireachtas Members regarding the fast-moving and evolving nature of harmful content on the Internet, including on our platform.  We take our role in keeping harmful content off our services very seriously.  We recognise that if society were designing the Internet as it exists today from scratch, it would not ask companies to make the judgments that Facebook must make in regard to harmful content alone.   We, therefore, welcome the fact that governments and policy makers around the world are taking an active role in addressing harmful online content.  It is with their help, including that of the committee, that the rules which govern the Internet can be updated in a way that allows people the freedom to express themselves and allows entrepreneurs to build things, while also protecting society from broader harms.<\/p> <p>  Our community standards are the rules which govern what is allowed on our platform.  We draft and update these rules in consultation with a wide range of experts, including NGOs and academics from around the world, including Ireland.  They cover a wide range of content issues including hate speech, bullying, harassment, graphic violence and nudity.  In many cases, our community standards go further than national laws, such as, for example, in the area of non-consensual intimate images, NCII.  We have zero tolerance for the sharing of NCII on our platforms.  Once we are made aware of these images, we remove them and use media-matching technology to prevent further sharing or re-uploading of the images.  However, decisions about content can be complex and we do not always get it right.  That is why we are establishing an external oversight board which will adjudicate at a global level on decisions we make on content.  The decision of the oversight board will be binding on the company.<\/p> <p>  We submitted a detailed response to the consultation convened by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, earlier this year.  In the interest of informing this discussion, I will summarise two of its points.  We outlined how, in our view, an effective and efficient system of oversight by a regulator might operate.  On the subject of notice and take-down, we recognised there can be a role for a regulator to review certain incidents where content is first reported to a service provider but not removed.  We look forward to the publication of the related Bill and to engaging in future consultation opportunities.<\/p> <p>  Every piece of content on Facebook, including photos, text posts, comments, profiles and pages can be reported to us for violating our content policies.  In each case, one can report the content by clicking on the link in the top right hand corner or, in the case of a comment, by  pressing one's thumb on the comment for a few seconds if using a mobile phone.<\/p><p>If the content is found to be against our community standards, it is removed.  We are also investing heavily in artificial intelligence, AI, so that we can more rapidly detect harmful and illegal content on our platforms, and it has been very successful in certain areas.  However there are types of content which are more challenging for Al, such as bullying and harassment where context can be important.  This is why we depend on reports from our community of users.<br\/><br\/>Our most recent community standards enforcement report, in which we publish quarterly breakdowns of the content that we have removed, demonstrates the efforts we are making to tackle a range of illegal and legal but harmful forms of content.  For example, in the first quarter of this year we removed 5.4 million pieces of child sexual abuse material globally, 99.2% of which we removed before it was reported to us.  The report also demonstrates the improvements we are making in developing Al tools to deal with challenging areas of harmful content such as hate speech, where our proactive detection rates have increased from 38% in the first quarter of 2018 to 65.4% a year later.<br\/><br\/>Our community standards recognise that bullying and harassment take place in many different places and can have many different forms.  We do not tolerate this type of behaviour as it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on Facebook.  In addition to removing content, we give users tools to help them protect themselves against bullying, such as blocking other users and controlling who sees your posts, and we operate a bullying prevention hub which gives young people, parents and teachers the tools and resources to address the complex issues which bullying presents.<br\/><br\/>In Ireland, we work with experts to inform our safety policies and deliver online safety programmes.  In the past 12 months we have invested &euro;1 million in a partnership with the national anti-bullying research and resource centre in DCU and <i>SpunOut.ie<\/i>.  The main goal of this partnership is to help raise awareness of online safety and tackle the issue of online bullying among young people by offering online safety and anti-bullying training to every secondary school in Ireland.  The programme is under way with more than 100 teachers from schools across Ireland attending the first set of training sessions in September.

My name is Karen White and I am director of public policy for Twitter in Europe.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Ronan Costello, public policy manager for Twitter in Europe.<\/p> <p>  Twitter is an open, public service.  Our singular mission is to serve the public conversation.  We serve our global audience by focusing on the needs of the people who use our service, and we put them first in every step we take.  Twitter is committed to improving the collective health, openness, and civility of public conversation on our platform.  Our success is built and measured by how we help encourage more healthy debate, conversations and critical thinking.  Conversely, abuse, malicious automation and manipulation detract from our purpose.  We provide people on Twitter with a range of tools so that they can control and manage the type of content and accounts they see, ranging from being able to keep an account private to blocking, muting or reporting other individuals on the service.  We also give people control over what they see in search results, through safe search mode, which is enabled by default.  This excludes potentially sensitive content from the search results such as spam, adult content and the accounts an individual has muted or blocked.  We strive to provide an environment where people can feel free to express themselves and we recognise that if people experience abuse on Twitter it can jeopardise their ability to do this.<\/p> <p>  An individual using the service is not permitted to promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people in a range of protected categories.  A person may not engage in abusive behaviour, which is an attempt to harass, intimidate or silence someone else's voice.  We do not allow individuals to use hateful images or symbols in their profile image or header and individuals using the platform are not allowed to use their username, display name or profile bio to engage in abusive behaviour such as targeted harassment or expressing hate towards a person, group or other protected category.  Under this policy we take action against behaviour that targets individuals or an entire protected category with hateful conduct.<\/p><p>With regard to self-harm and suicide, after Twitter receives a report of such behaviour, it will contact the reported user and let him or her know that someone who cares about him or her identified that he or she might be at risk.  We will provide the reported user with available online and offline resources and encourage him or her to seek help.  In response to certain keyword searches relating to these issues, using Twitter's search function, we direct individuals to online prevention resources.  This service is available in Ireland, where we have partnered with the Samaritans, to whose website and support services we direct individuals.<\/p><p> Twitter does not allow individuals on the service to post or share intimate photos or videos of someone which were produced or distributed without their consent.  Such material is sometimes referred to as \"revenge porn\".  This content poses serious safety and security risks.  We inform our users that sharing explicit sexual images or videos of someone online without their consent is a severe violation of their privacy and the Twitter rules.  <\/p><p> People who do not feel safe on Twitter should not be burdened to report abuse to us.  Earlier this year we made it a priority to take a proactive approach to abuse.  Today, through the use of technology, 38% of abusive content that is enforced is surfaced proactively for human review.  We have made meaningful progress towards creating a healthier service.  Since we announced our focus on improving the health of the conversation occurring on Twitter, we have seen a 16% year-on-year decrease in reports from people about other users allegedly abusing them on Twitter.  We have seen a 45% increase in the number of account suspensions for those who attempt to create new accounts following the suspension of their original accounts.  Over the first quarter of 2019, this amounted to more than 100,000 account suspensions for these reoffenders.  We are suspending three times more abusive accounts within 24 hours of a report and are taking two and a half times more private information down, with a new, easier reporting process.  <\/p><p> We have always provided an appeals mechanism for individuals who have had enforcement action taken against their accounts but earlier this year we launched a new feature that allows people to appeal within the Twitter app itself.  This change has meant that we have been able to respond to people 60% more quickly than we had previously.<\/p><p> We have well-established relationships with law enforcement agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have continuous global coverage to address reports from law enforcement around the world and have a dedicated online portal to swiftly handle requests from law enforcement.  We provide regular training on our policies and procedures and have publicly available guidelines for law enforcement on our website.  <\/p><p> The committee has asked for our recommendations on the proposed legislative changes.  It is important that legislation is as consistent as possible with existing legal frameworks to avoid uncertainties and discrepancies.  The effectiveness of any legislative solution relies on it being proportionate, technically feasible, and flexible, particularly given the diversity of companies within the digital ecosystem.  In this context, the committee will need to consider and assess how different legal and illegal harms manifest themselves across different platforms and varied jurisdictions.<\/p><p> We all share the objective of protecting our systems of due process and our commitment to freedom of expression.  Preserving these tenets in regulatory proposals can be achieved by collectively ensuring there is clarity on the obligations of all stakeholders, thereby avoiding an outcome whereby companies could overreach or erroneously remove content that should otherwise be kept online.  A clearly defined scope in that regard will assist Twitter and, I imagine, others.<\/p><p> In order to ensure people can continue to express themselves freely and safely on Twitter, we must continue investing further in our proactive technology and safety tools, as well as developing policies which keep pace with the changing contours of the public conversation we see on our service.  We stand ready to work with this committee as we continue to explore options to ensure that all people are protected from online harassment and harmful communications.  I thank members for their time.  We look forward to taking their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen White","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":925,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to contribute to the committee's deliberations on the topic of online harassment, harmful communications, and related offences.  I work with Google in Ireland as government affairs and public policy manager and am based in our EU headquarters here in Dublin.  Google supports all efforts by legislators and governments to engage with stakeholders in considering appropriate protections, remedies, and forms of redress for individuals who are the victims of online harm.  A range of governments, technology platforms and civil society groups are currently focused on how best to deal with illegal and problematic online content.<\/p><p>There is broad agreement on letting people create, communicate and find information online while preventing people from misusing content-sharing platforms like social networks and video sharing sites.  We recognise that there can be a troubling side of open platforms and that bad actors have exploited this openness.  We take the safety of our users very seriously, and we are committed to ensuring that inappropriate content that appears on our platforms is dealt with as quickly as possible.<\/p><p> Now 21 years old, Google has grown from a small start-up to a global company with legal obligations in each of the countries in which it operates.  We work hard to protect our platforms from abuse and have been working on this challenge for years, using both computer-science tools and human reviewers to identify and stop a range of online abuse, from get-rich-quick schemes to disinformation, to the utterly abhorrent, including child sexual abuse material online.  We respond promptly to valid notices of specific illegal content, and we prohibit other types of content on various different services.  A mix of people and technology helps us to identify inappropriate content and enforce our policies, and we continue to develop and invest in smart technology to detect problematic content hosted on our platforms.<\/p><p> As well as making significant investment in technology and human resources, we have engaged with policymakers in Ireland and around the world on the question of the appropriate oversight for online content-sharing platforms.  Google is supportive of carefully crafted and appropriately tailored regulation that continues to address the challenges of problematic content online.  We are keen to work constructively with legislators to build on the existing legal framework and to build trust and confidence in the systems and procedures that ensure online safety.<\/p><p> Having considered the committee's issues paper, our comments today are directed towards those aspects that concern the role of Internet service providers in preventing online harassment and certain harmful communications.  We have submitted a longer written statement which outlines all of these points in greater detail.  In this statement, we have also provide some comments on the approaches taken on this issue in other jurisdictions where Google operates and which were mentioned in the committee's issue paper.<\/p><p> In the statement, we suggest a number of central principles that should be considered for approaching oversight of content-sharing platforms and problematic content online.  These include clarity, suitability, transparency, flexibility, overall quality and co-operation.  I have set them out in more detail in the longer statement and can refer to them later if the committee wishes.<\/p><p> In framing any measures in this area, it is important for legislators to have regard to and build on the existing legal framework.  We operate in an environment where extensive regulation of online content and actions already exists and is being enforced.  Many laws, covering everything from consumer protection to defamation to privacy, already govern online content.  From consumer rights legislation to the new EU Audiovisual Media Services Directive, online behaviours come under the scope of a diverse and evolving set of legislation, multi-stakeholder initiatives and regulators.<\/p><p> Specifically relating to regulation of Internet service providers as a means of combating online abuse, the distinctive role played by Internet service providers is reflected in the EU legislation that underpins the regulation of electronic commerce in Europe.  The eCommerce directive provides strong incentives for service providers to establish and operate efficient notice and take-down procedures.  A service provider that does not operate such procedures will be exposed to potential legal liability for unlawful content hosted on its platform.  Many service providers, including Google, have developed extensive infrastructures which provide efficient tools for the reporting and removal of illegal content.<\/p><p> The eCommerce directive has the advantage of setting out different requirements for different types of Internet intermediaries, rather than being aimed at a particular business activity.  It has led to the growth of a wide variety of services and business models, and is flexible enough to cover the multiplicity of activities and content types online.  For example, an online news site can contain content authored by the news organisation, along with material licensed from third parties and also user-generated comments - the news site will be directly responsible for the editorial content it publishes but will have different legal responsibilities with respect to user comments that the website is hosting as an intermediary.  This online intermediary liability regime has fostered the huge economic and cultural benefits of the Internet while ensuring platforms are taking appropriate and speedy actions in removing unlawful content online.<\/p><p> In addition to legal regulations, Google has over the years developed extensive community guidelines and content policies that offer clear rules on what it does not allow on its platforms.  These often go above and beyond the law and we employ thousands of staff around the world, working 24 hours a day, to ensure violations are acted upon.  Companies have also worked together to address these challenges, for example, with the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, a coalition sharing information on curbing online terrorism.<\/p><p> We continue to improve on our processes and our technology to enforce these rules.  We continually review and update our policies based on new trends and invest in new machine learning, ML, technology to scale the efforts of our human moderators.<\/p><p> ML is helping us detect potentially violative content and surface it for human review.  For example, YouTube removed 9 million videos during the second quarter of 2019, 7.9 million of which were first flagged through our automated flagging system.<\/p><p>For example, YouTube removed 9 million videos during the second quarter of 2019, 7.9 million of which were first flagged through our automated flagging system.  Of those videos, 81.5% had no views at the time they were taken down.<\/p><p> We thank the committee for providing us with an opportunity to contribute to its deliberations on the topic of online harassment, harmful communications and related offences.  Addressing problematic content is a shared responsibility across society, in which companies, Governments, civil society, and users all have a role to play, and it is appropriate that this committee is hearing from a variety of voices on this topic.  We hope the committee will give our suggestions for approaching oversight of content-sharing platforms due consideration and look forward to further discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ryan Meade","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":928,"content":"<p>I call Ms Ana Niculescu, who is here on behalf of the Internet Service Providers Association Ireland, ISPAI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#N00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":929,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to address it.  ISPAI is a not-for-profit organisation and the legal entity delivering the <i>hotline.ie<\/i>service, which is the national reporting mechanism where the public can anonymously, securely and confidentially report suspected illegal content online.  <i>hotline.ie'<\/i>s remit is distinct and limited to combating online material which is simultaneously harmful and illegal, namely child pornography, also known as child sexual abuse material, CSAM.  The<i>hotline.ie<\/i>service has been effective in having CSAM swiftly removed from the Internet because it operates within a clearly defined legislative framework where the harm is clearly illegal.  Additionally, it is a transnational crime which allows for decisive international action when CSAM is hosted outside Ireland.  There is no burden of proof in respect of consent as engaging a child in sexual activities is prohibited under all circumstances and any presumed consent would be null and void.  When talking about CSAM, it is important to note that we are talking about materials showing the extreme abuse of children, the majority of them infants to 12 year olds.  For example, 84% of the material classified as child pornography from January 2017 to June 2019 showed children estimated to be four to 12, with 7% aged three and younger.<br\/><br\/><i>hotline.ie<\/i>has been working in an environment predominantly governed under the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998, amended by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017.  It is clear national legislation that comprehensively defines what would constitute child pornography and corresponding offences.<br\/><br\/>The broader context commonly referred to as industry self-regulation consists of, as a non-exhaustive list, the EU directive on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, which provides for an international framework.  The e-commerce directive is also transposed into Irish law and sets out the requirements and exemptions for intermediaries' liability for illegal content.  There is a national co-ordinated multi-stakeholder approach, where <i>hotline.ie<\/i>operations and procedures are agreed and overseen by the Department of Justice and Equality.  Since inception, we have been working in conjunction with national law enforcement and in co-operation with Internet companies operating in Ireland for the removal of CSAM from the Internet.  Our <i>hotline.ie<\/i>analysts are internationally trained by INHOPE and Interpol in content and age assessment.  There are national reporting mechanisms such as <i>hotline.ie<\/i>in more than 40 countries worldwide, coming together as the International Network of Internet Hotlines, INHOPE, allowing for international co-operation and co-ordination.  When child pornography is hosted in Ireland, we will issue a notice for takedown to the Internet service or content provider and will notify the paedophile investigation unit of the Garda National Protective Services Bureau.  In most cases, the notified material is removed from the Internet within 24 hours.  When CSAM is hosted outside Ireland, <i>hotline.ie<\/i>will still notify the paedophile investigation unit and thereafter the INHOPE member hotline in the relevant jurisdiction, so that CSAM may be swiftly removed at source.<br\/><br\/>INHOPE figures show that 64% of CSAM reported across different international jurisdictions in 2018 was removed within 72 hours.  As previously outlined, in Ireland, it is removed within 24 hours.  However, slower international removal times may be due to CSAM hosted in countries without a hotline presence, a lack of designated points of contact and streamlined notice for takedown process with Internet companies, or countries with inadequate or deficient legislation.<\/p><p>The self-regulatory model is effective in the circumstances in which<i>hotline.ie<\/i>operates and may be useful to look at as a reference point for other types of content but it would warrant further scoping.<br\/><br\/>For those who may not be aware, the <i>hotline.ie<\/i>service will be 50% co-funded by the European Union through the Connecting Europe Facility's safer Internet programme until June 2021.  The other 50% is co-funded by ISPAI member Internet companies, comprising Internet service providers, hosting providers, search engines and mobile and telecommunications operators.  <i>Hotline.ie<\/i>was established as one of the key recommendation of the Government's working group on the illegal and harmful use of the Internet in 1998.  It provides a free, secure and anonymous online reporting mechanism, content assessment expertise to ensure reported material is subject to objective evaluation in accordance with rigorous standards by reference to Irish law, a triage function through assessing public reports and notifying only content that is most likely illegal under Irish law, thereby reducing the burden that would otherwise be placed on law enforcement by, for example, assessing complaints that may not prove to reside in Ireland and operating the notice and takedown service, which is recognised worldwide as a vital and efficient tool in the removal of child sexual abuse material at source and which, in turn, reduces its availability on the Internet, disrupts the cycle of sexual exploitation and prevents further victimisation of children.  In my written statement I have provided statistics that are worth looking at.<br\/><br\/>I stress that we welcome the committee's engagement with a variety of experts and stakeholders and we are grateful for the opportunity to contribute to these discussions.  We are also supportive of the Government's attempts to address the spectrum of harms and that different harms may require different legislative and regulatory responses, with due account of the fact that the Internet is an ever-evolving, technically challenging and complex environment.  Superimposed on that is a continuum between offline and online behaviour that contributes to the complexity of developing effective responses and remedies.

Are people ruled out from using our services because they do not have access to an ID?  In Ireland, for example, there is a cost to obtain ID.  That is not to say that we do not take the issue of child sexual abuse extremely seriously.  We take proactive steps.  As others have said, we have zero tolerance for this type of behaviour.  There are genuine concerns about how proof of identity would operate and whether us holding all of that information about more than 2.7 billion people globally would respect the data minimisation principles within the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  That is not to say that we are not looking at this as something that we have to do better.  We are looking at artificial intelligence to determine whether it can assist us in verifying accounts.

It is open to legislators to decide to apply the same rules that publishers work under to the various online services.  This would need to be taken through to its conclusion.  What would it mean and what impact would that have on the operation of the open Internet?  We have developed our services on the basis that they are open and for everyone.  One of the great features of our services is that the same Gmail, drive or whatever service we offer is available anywhere in the world on the same basis.  That brings with it a huge volume of material.  On YouTube, for example, there are hundreds of hours of video material uploaded to our services every minute.  If we were to be considered publishers, each item would have to be reviewed before appearing on the platform.  It would be open to legislators to make that a requirement but it would fundamentally alter the availability of that service.  It is up to legislators to decide what the rules should be.  The point I would make, in common with the other members of the panel, is that legislators should also take account of what benefits the liability regime has provided.<\/p> <p>  Just because we do not consider it appropriate that the regulation should be the same for publishers as for the platforms, that does not mean the platforms cannot be regulated.

By being deemed an intermediary, it escapes this consequence.  This is why, in my opinion, this is like the wild west of the 21st century.  There is a very interesting historical analogy.  In the United States at the start of the previous century, European copyright was not accepted.  This meant, in effect, that authors could not be paid.  The American Government and the publishers, some of which are now the biggest names in publishing in the entire world, did not accept European copyright.  The publishers made their money in that way.  When they got to a certain size, they of course turned around and said that they wanted copyright enforced and regulation.  It suits Internet companies to grow to a certain size and then look for a bit of regulation to prevent entry into the market.<\/p> <p>  There is one main stumbling block, if one takes an honest look at it.  This is the bit I can never quite get.  It reminds me of the chief executive of a cigarette company sitting before the US Senate and saying that smoking is not harmful.  The witnesses answered one of Deputy O'Callaghan's questions about whether their companies increased the proliferation of child pornography.  The honest answer to that is \"Yes\".  Whether the companies accept that they are individually responsible for that or that they should be legally responsible for it, the Internet did increase that proliferation.  There is no getting around that.  My point is that, by not being declared publishers, the companies avoid the liabilities with which almost everybody else has to deal.  I do not believe a decision in this regard should be made in Ireland alone.  It should be broader and decided at least at the level of the EU.  The traditional western countries need to operate together and to look at this issue.  There is a role for the Internet and for what the companies do, but there is also a role for regulation.<\/p> <p>  I will conclude with this because I am conscious of time.  There are two things that really changed my mind.  It is not so much about the area of pornography or anything like that.  There was one horrendous incident in Ireland involving Facebook, and I do not want to go into too much detail about it out of respect for the family involved, in which the public shared multiple images of an horrific incident.  There is no comeback for that family.  They cannot unsee it.  It does not matter that it was taken down in 24 hours, which in fairness it was.  People should not profit off that level of absolute horror being inflicted on someone.  The other issue, unfortunately, also involves Facebook.  Somebody went on a murder spree and, using the live-streaming facility Facebook developed to make further profits, live-streamed himself murdering people.  I cannot understand, from a moral perspective, how people are comfortable with defending themselves against liability for that.  That is my issue.  That is why I believe there should be a change.  Any of the witnesses are more than welcome to reply to me on those points, but that is where I will leave it for now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#U00100","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":1003,"content":"<p>Would Facebook like to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#U00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":1004,"content":"<p>I will go first and then pass over to Ms Rush.

I thank the Deputy and note and appreciate his concerns in this regard.  One of the points he made is that the heightened layer of responsibility arising from being a publisher would result in people queueing up at the door to take claims and so on.  As Mr. Meade mentioned earlier in respect of an obligation to preview, pre-screen or pre-moderate every single piece of content against all the laws in force anywhere in the world the content might be available or might be shared, regardless of the operational burden and cost, such an obligation would have a significant chilling effect.  Companies would be incentivised to take down anything that is remotely dubious or questionable from a legal perspective.  They would have to err on the side of removing everything, which could have a very detrimental effect on the availability of content.  It is just one perspective.  I absolutely appreciate all the other points the Deputy has raised, to which Mr. &Oacute; Broin has responded.  We are here because we accept and know that this is an opportunity to find a better way forward with regard to a future regulatory model which would learn from and build on other models and which would be conscious of EU developments and developments that have worked in other countries.

It allows the companies to exercise a degree of moderation and to impose their own standards with regard to what they will or will not allow on their platforms.  From our point of view, that has served the purpose of allowing us to keep our users safe on our platforms and to provide them with a more positive experience.  The Deputy's point is that is a form of editorial control which would lead to us being defined as publishers.

I have been working in this area for many years.  The role of content reviewers has really changed because of the evolving lead-in and the technological advances we have been able to make.  Some eight or nine years ago all the content reviewed by content reviewers would come from human reports, that is, people clicking on a piece of content and indicating that they did not like it because they thought it was hate speech or violence.  That would be reviewed manually.  The volume of content has increased.  Some forms of harm are particularly egregious and abhorrent.  All types of harmful content hold their own in some ways, but it is easier to develop the technology for areas like terrorism and child sexual exploitation imagery, CSEI, because they are very visual and clearcut.  Context does not really come into it.  That is different from a piece of hate speech, for example.  It is much harder to train classifiers or machine learning to tell if a hateful slur is being used in a derogatory way or in a comedic, satirical or self-referential way.  That is why the rates of AI detection are lower for bullying and those types of content.<\/p> <p>  To return to the previous point, it is increasingly the case that content reviewers are not just reviewing reports from human users.  The AI is always trying to learn and become more precise.  Where it cannot take automatic action to remove content once it matches it, it will sometimes send content to humans for review as a double-check.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#Z01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire Rush"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":1064,"content":"<p>I thank the witness.

Indeed, in January this year, we held a workshop in the office which was participated in by the council, the Commission and a range of non-governmental organisations, NGOs, from across Europe.  The purpose of that was to create a counter-speech campaign that would be rolled out across Europe and would reject hate speech and encourage people to take an alternative view.

Facebook has a real-name policy, although that is not the same as authenticating every person on the platform.  We require people to use the name by which they are known in real life.  If an account is suspected to be false, we will act on that and ensure either that the person verifies it or, if he or she is not who he or she claims, that it will be removed.  We also take strong measures against fake accounts that people try to establish on our platform.  In the first quarter of this year, we removed 2.2 billion accounts from our platform.  That figure does not include the accounts we stopped or prevented from being set up in the first instance.  They are accounts that managed to be set up but were caught within minutes.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned a couple of the issues relating to what such a system would look like.

We carry out account verification in certain circumstances where we feel it is proportionate, for example, when we introduced new policies for election advertising for the European Parliament elections.  That involved a process of account verification so that anyone who wanted to advertise had to provide documents and so on.  The degree of data that was required to be collected in that process was quite significant. Our view is that it was proportionate to apply that in that case but perhaps not proportionate in every case.<\/p> <p>  In terms of a universal obligation, there are certainly countries in which we operate that require people to verify their account with us, using a government ID or some other form, in order to use our services.  There are certainly countries where that would exclude large numbers of people.  In particular, it would exclude people who were perhaps not as well got with the government as other parts, shall we say.  That is just the nature of them.  That may not necessarily apply here in Ireland but in many countries in which we operate.  That is a consideration we have to take into account. <\/p> <p>  I will not repeat the issues concerning data minimisation.  That point would have to be considered against the GDPR.  <\/p> <p>  Speaking for Google, we do see a role for private or anonymous use of the Internet.  There are use cases for various reasons.  We offer, for example, in our browser incognito mode where people can switch into a mode to use the Internet without their identity being known.  Overall it is useful to hear from the companies on this but, primarily, one would have to put that question to the people who would be affected by it, which would be our users.  I know that next week the committee will hear from civil liberty groups and so on and that is a really important question to tease out.  At present, our view broadly is that there are circumstances that are proportionate to require account verification but I am not sure we would go as far as to say it is appropriate in all circumstances.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#HH00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ryan Meade"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":1150,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Chambers for his questions.

The witnesses emphasised that child sexual abuse material is clearly illegal and therefore the issue of consent does not apply.  I would like to tease out the issues of consent and freedom of expression and where the platforms stand in that respect and also how they deal with those issues.  We all regularly come across content online which is not considered appropriate or normal.  We do not know from looking at this content whether the people depicted in the images gave their consent.  A couple of decades ago, page 3 of many daily newspapers featured a picture of somebody wearing very little or no clothing.  That was considered normal at the time but it is no longer considered normal and these pictures no longer feature.  One of the reasons for this is that much of this material has moved onto the Internet.  The reality is that society has deemed it not to be appropriate.  If it is not appropriate in a newspaper, surely it is not appropriate in formats like the various Internet platforms.  I understand completely that what makes these platforms unique and what makes them work is freedom of expression and the ability to put something online immediately.  At the same time, there is an element of responsibility around this, including as regards consent.  I would like to get Ms Niculescu's views because we have not heard from her in regard to checking out that consent or whether consent is checked out regularly in respect of images other than child sexual material.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#QQ03600","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":1341,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his question.

Twitter has a hateful conduct policy.  It outlines that it is against our rules to promote violence against, threaten or attack others on the basis of a range of protected categories such as gender and race.  Twitter's focus is on behaviour over content in particular.  It is much easier to identify certain types of abusive behaviours and scale that than solely looking at hate speech which is highly subjective and often context dependent.  Twitter is somewhat unique in that it is a public communications platform.  We are looking at behaviours of different types of accounts.  Our systems can proactively detect if, for instance, one account is @-mentioning another account repeatedly and that account does not follow them.  That might signal to us that someone is engaging in some level of abusive behaviour or if there is some sort of dog-piling with an attack on another account.  Sometimes we take a variety of these signals in combination to give us some indication that we need to review an account for hateful conduct or abusive behaviour.  I can assure the Deputy that our policies are applied consistently across the board.  When violations are found actions are taken.  There are various actions, which I outlined, that we can take beginning with the outright suspension of an account.  We have vastly improved the stopping of repeat offenders coming back to Twitter by setting up another account and leveraging our own technology; we are finding new ways to do that and to stop them coming back to Twitter to engage in the same behaviours.  There are those on our service who set up what we classify as sole purpose accounts where they engage in nothing more than abusing others.  That type of behaviour is reviewed against our policies and we take appropriate action.  There is a range of actions we can take.  We also introduced a change to our hateful conduct policy on dehumanisation.  Research shows that dehumanising language leads to offline violence.  We have made a change to our hateful conduct policy in regard to religious groups.  We will continue to iterate on those.<\/p> <p>    Mr. Costello might talk to some of our efforts with NGOs with whom we work.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#VV00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen White"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":1394,"content":"<p>There seems to be a contradiction in what Ms White says.

He was right to mention livestreaming as a category of content that needed special caution.  At YouTube, we have preliminary hurdles that people need to jump through before they get the ability to livestream.  For example, they need to have a certain number of followers and cannot be brand new.  They cannot just create an account and suddenly start livestreaming.  If there is a violation of our policies, their ability to livestream can be taken away.  We have taken the approach that livestreaming is something that needs special attention.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the types of livestreaming the Deputy mentioned, he may or may not be aware that we updated out policy on hate speech this year, which has resulted in violations by people who were livestreaming.  In one fairly high-profile case, we terminated that account.  The Deputy may have seen that there has been quite a reaction to that.  This shows that there has been progress in the development and implementation of our policy.  There is no question but that we will suspend accounts and remove people's opportunity to use these tools if they violate the policies.<\/p> <p>  The question on spent convictions is an interesting one, in that it cuts across privacy law.  The right to be forgotten was been established in European privacy law.  The practical implication of this is that platforms, including Google Search, must assess requests from users to delist information.  The information may still be out there on the Internet, but we must assess the request to delist it from our search engine.  The law also requires us to apply a balancing test.  As such, there has to be a consideration of whether other issues need to be taken into account.  Naturally, any decision we make on this basis is subject to dispute, in that people may say that we made the right or wrong decision.  In such cases, there is recourse to the Data Protection Commission, DPC, as the matter is handled under privacy law.  The individual in question can make a complaint to the DPC if he or she is not happy with our decision.  The law requires us to have a balancing test.  As Mr. &Oacute; Broin stated, private companies like us may not always be the right arena in which to make such decisions, but that is what is required of us under the law.

She was present for quite a part of the meeting and is well entitled to that.<\/p> <p>  It is important to acknowledge that, while the focus of our engagement over a number of hours today has been on what we all accept are the worst excesses of human usage of each of the platforms' sites, the services they provide are very valuable, appreciated and utilised responsibly by the overwhelming majority of their respective customers.<\/p><p>That needs to be said because, otherwise, we are giving a very skewed image and perception of the respective sites with which our guests are involved.  I am of the view that this acknowledgment is important, but the focus of our address is harmful online activity.  Although we are some steps away from producing our report and recommendations, I get the sense that there is a general unified opinion coming from all the members that the platform companies are facilitating significantly harmful postings, including criminal acts, that have given rise to serious injury and worse.  I hope our guests are equally committed to addressing and, where possible at all, eradicating that activity.<\/p><p> I wish to reflect on the contributions of those who appears before us last week.  They were very strong in their recommendations.  The committee is very mindful of the importance of working together.  The respective component parts of the industry must work with legislators to try to reach a better situation where safety is critical and most especially in respect of children, but where there is safety for all users if at all possible.<\/p><p> Some of our guests keep referring to rules.  There has been talk of Twitter rules and Facebook rules.  When the rules have been broken, the companies respond.  It is almost a competition from our perspective.  In terms of breaking the rules, in many of those instances and most certainly in the most serious of the cases that have been reported to us, we would like to see that people have broken the law.  It is not enough just to look at some as being inappropriate.  We would like to see some of the cases that have been reflected to us as involving illegality.<\/p><p> I am minded of the contribution last week of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.  I am very grateful to Mr. John Church, its chief executive.  I will just instance one of the cases that was brought to its attention.  A 16 year old girl told Childline that she had sent images to a former boyfriend, who then shared them with others without her permission.  With the images circulating widely, the girl told Childline she could not face going back to school and was contemplating suicide.  I do not expect a response on that today but, in the context of the exercise we have embarked on, we are very mindful of the harm, hurt and serious consequences involved and we want to try to find a means of address.  We have only the power of recommendation to the Minister and the Government, but we will not shirk in our responsibilities in outlining the strongest recommendations if we believe they are the most appropriate.<\/p><p> Professor Joe Carthy was mentioned.  He is the founding director of the UCD centre for cybersecurity.  He made an analogy with automobile legislation.  Every car has a number plate.  Every car is registered to someone.  He said while it is perfectly acceptable to use the Internet in any anonymous fashion, it is not acceptable to abuse, bully or libel others anonymously.  He said it is akin to allowing people to drive cars without number plates.<\/p><p>This is a key area in respect of which legislation could make a huge difference.  Professor Carthy believes that we should require social media platforms and online providers to register their users and that users should provide appropriate evidence of identity, and not just after the event or in following through when something outrageous has happened.  He stated that users who can show that they have been bullied, harassed or abused on a social media platform should be legally entitled to find out the identity of the user carrying out the inappropriate behaviour.  I would welcome a brief response to that.  I know that if Professor Carthy was here he would like to ask our guests about this matter.  I invite a response from Mr. &Oacute; Broin.  Our guests have probably all looked at a recording of last week's meeting so they know what I am talking about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#XX00900","speaker":"1269","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":1411,"content":"<p>It is an issue that is referenced in the Law Reform Commission's report.

I am going to refer to a particular case of which I am aware, and to at least two Facebook pages that existed for a number of years.  I refer to the recent outrageous and dreadful attack on Kevin Lunney, a director of Quinn Industrial Holdings.  At least one of the Facebook pages in question referenced, by name, the senior executives of the company and allegations were made against them.  Other posts included mock-ups of posters calling individuals traitors and warning of consequences.  The intention in this regard was to misrepresent and label those executives.  Some of them were referenced on the page.  When I sat with these people, including Kevin Lunney, earlier this year, I was mindful that we were embarking on this particular exercise.  My question would have been put to our guests in any event, regardless of what happened to Kevin recently, which was an absolute disgrace.  My question is the same as it would have been if the attack had not taken place.  The executives in question made repeated requests of Facebook to remove the offensive material.  I understand that Facebook removed it he day after Kevin Lunney was kidnapped and attacked.  Facebook described is as a violation of authenticity guidelines.  I wonder how our guests will explain the meaning of the latter.  In any event, it was action after the event.  It was much too late.  The material was hugely offensive.  It was intended to harm the good name and reputation of the people involved and, as a Deputy representing the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, I believe it fed into a view that in some way those people, the named parties, and the businesses they were involved in, were a legitimate target for the worst excesses of what I can only describe as the most ill-informed people on this island.  How does Facebook respond to the example I have cited?  I would have raised it with Facebook even if the attack had not taken place because the pages should have been removed.  The vile content and its intent and purpose is an affront to any and every one of us.

The issue of targeted harassment is one I hope to return to in a moment, specifically in conversation with the representatives from Twitter.  It is notable that in its testimony today, Facebook has told us it is not confident there is any lawful weight to its guidelines.  Twitter, with regard to the Ryan case specifically, said that if there had been any legal action, it would have co-operated in the case.  Even in the representatives' own words, they are strongly making the case not only regarding legislation on hate speech but also regarding legislation on online regulation.  Representatives from both Facebook and Twitter pointed out that they would have moved further if required to by law.  This underscores the need for legislation in this area and the fact that self-regulation clearly has its limits.  Community standards have little concrete weight when it comes to persons' lives and persons who may be the subject of online abuse, regardless of whether they choose to be part of the online community.  That is important because the duty of protection is not simply to users but to all citizens.  That is a wider concern.  The duty of protection also extends to those who may not be citizens but who are resident in our country.<\/p> <p>  Let me point to an issue raised by Deputy Brophy.  Follow-up information and granular detail may be required.  Deputy Brophy asked about the resources and number of staff allocated for taking down offensive or harmful content.  I would like a breakdown also on the resources devoted to brand protection.  All the organisations represented today have a large number of staff working on brand protection, for example, to ensure their advertisers' branding is not being misused.  I am aware there are those whose work is dedicated specifically to targeting and watching out for issues that may be of concern to advertisers.  I do not know the extent to which those issues, in terms of brand protection removals, are subject to notification requirements.  Are there staff permanently allocated to deal with these issues?  In providing us with the information on staffing and resources allocated for taking down content that violates standards, the representatives might give a specific breakdown on the proportion of resources allocated to deal with harmful content and the proportion triggered by notifications, by comparison with the resources allocated to deal with issues such as brand protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#CCC00300","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":1433,"content":"<p>To add to that, the Senator will probably have noted that Deputy Connolly asked for that information.

It has been pointed out time and again that the e-commerce directive is wildly out of date.  In many cases, individuals are not in a position to notify because they may not be aware of the offensive or harmful content related to them.  I want to focus a little on the facilities associated with the targeting of information.  If I do not see abusive content about me, I am not in a position to notify the relevant organisation about it.  This leads to the question of the targeting of information.<\/p><p> Twitter has a policy whereby it can block content but it tries to support a person's experience on the site.  I may not be simply concerned about my experience on the site but about abusive content about me.  As I understand it, Twitter changed its rules, and perhaps there has been a further change, whereby if I block somebody and assume that person no longer has access to my information, that person can still see me and speak about me but I do not see what he or she is saying.  That change in the blocking provision is a very serious concern and relates to stalking, harassment and so forth.  It is not just my experience but misinformation.<\/p><p> Ms White indicated that Twitter never automatically suspends accounts.  I have spoken to people who have been the subject of very targeted campaigns of harassment and a person who has been suspended as a consequence immediately created a new account and resumed the harassment.  This is a real concern.  When the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, RCNI, spoke to this committee it emphasised that this should not apply only to repeated activity but a single incident should be enough.  Stalking is one of the concerns that may be included in this Bill.  Someone can repeatedly re-register on new accounts but Twitter will wait until that person does something offensive or dangerous.  That approach creates a very chilling fear for a person.  I will not bring the people involved into committee testimony but I know there are people who have been repeatedly targeted by accounts which effectively threatened them and when those accounts were suspended a new one immediately appeared.  How can Twitter improve its blocking mechanisms to address those concerns? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#CCC00700","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":1438,"content":"<p>The Senator raised several issues and I will do my best to address them as quickly as I can.  She mentioned a strong emphasis on notification.  I have tried to communicate to the committee this morning that we are trying to reduce the burden on victims having to report to Twitter.  People absolutely need a mechanism to get in touch with Twitter to tell us if they have been subjected to certain types of behaviour.  In response to the Senator's point that if someone cannot see something, that person cannot notify us, we made a change some years ago to allow bystander reporting.  If a person sees something online, it goes back to the \"see something, say something\" principle.  If people see someone being bullied in the playground, they should say something to the teacher.  The same principles apply online.  We allow bystander reporting. <\/p> <p>  In addition, I have highlighted that 30% of the action that we take on content deemed to be abusive behaviour is taken proactively.  That is without any reports; it is content that Twitter has surfaced for human review.  We hope that figure will increase so that we can further reduce the burden on victims having to report content to us.<\/p> <p>  We had a problem with repeat offenders at Twitter.  It was a bit like playing whack-a-mole in that we would suspend an account and another account would be opened.  We did significant work with our trust and safety council which advised us of the need to remedy this situation.  We have stopped repeat offending by more than 100,000 accounts over the past year.<\/p><p>Our actions are having real results.  I do not mean to imply that we have fixed the problem in its totality but we are slowing it down.  Our actions are stopping repeat offenders opening new accounts or engaging in multiple account abuse, where one individual has multiple accounts with the sole intention of abusing others on the service.

The appendix to Facebook's presentation was optimistic when it suggested an amendment to the Bill which provided that communication does not include provision of information society services.

There are questions about what a platform and publication are, which need to be teased out but there is a communication function and communication is taking place.  That was acknowledged elsewhere.  This is not a neutral platform for freedom of expression.  It is a commercial platform in which certain particular messages can be promoted, highlighted and amplified.  It is not a neutral <i>tabula rasa<\/i>where people place their tuppence worth.  What steps does Twitter believe need to be taken to change its financial model?

I have produced a written statement so I propose to give only a short summary to leave the maximum amount of time for questions.<\/p> <p>  Since I last appeared before this committee, Science Foundation Ireland has put in place a number of administrative arrangements between the UK and Ireland to foster bilateral collaboration between the two countries.  Those arrangements are detailed in my statement and I will not go through them here, but in summary, all of the arrangements are in place.  We have made investments to stimulate those and what will be required is further funding to take forward those bilateral relationships.<\/p> <p>  There are few opportunities emerging from Brexit but one of them is the opportunity to recruit outstanding people.  We have already been successful in doing that.  Recruiting outstanding researchers is very important, not just for the academic sector but for the economy.  They are stars and attract companies, allow for collaboration with companies and build excellence.  I particularly single out the recruitment of Professor Seamus Davis, who is a joint appointment between the University of Oxford and University College Cork.  That is an opportunity to recruit someone of an outstanding calibre.<\/p> <p>  There will be further such opportunities and it is important that we take advantage of them because most of Brexit is about mitigating damage and there are relatively few areas in which we may gain some advantage.  Bilateral collaboration is important.<\/p> <p>  I would especially like to single out the necessity of doing things with Northern Ireland.  There are no North-South collaborative research programmes.  There were previously, but they fell apart when the Northern Ireland Executive did because they were not a line item in the Northern Ireland budget and therefore the civil servants could not allocate the UK money.  We have submitted proposals to strengthen North-South research collaboration through centres.  Those submissions are with the Irish and UK Governments and that is an important area for us to look at post Brexit.<\/p> <p>  My statement gives the committee the up-to-date data on the European programmes within Horizon 2020.  The high-level summary is that Ireland is on track to draw down more funding than we put in for the first time.  While that is good, approximately 10% of our collaborations are with the UK.  Should the UK crash out of the European Union without a deal regarding research collaboration, it will not be eligible for those programmes and we will have to look therefore at bilateral ways of collaborating with the UK.  The administrative arrangements are in there but the budget is not because, of course, they are currently paid for out of the EU budget and, in the future, after Brexit, they would have to be paid for by Ireland and the UK separately.  That is another important issue to be looking at.<\/p> <p>  We strongly support the proposal from the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce to establish a UK-Ireland research and innovation fund.  We also hope that research and innovation will be covered in the contingency fund that was allocated in yesterday's budget.  We are respectful of the fact that there are many small businesses and farms in Border regions that need to be protected but there are some things in the research and innovation space that also require attention.  One or two of those, as I have outlined, are opportunities.<\/p> <p>  I will stop there and leave the maximum amount of time for questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019100900002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Mark Ferguson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":1494,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chair and committee members for inviting the Irish Universities Association to come and speak today.  I will recap on the points in our statement about research and my colleague, Mr. Lewis Purser, will pick up on the education piece in particular.  A lot of what I have to say will reflect what Professor Ferguson has said.<\/p> <p>  Higher education and research are vital to the Irish economy and play a role in protecting us from global crises.  Ireland's economic success is dependent on our capacity to compete globally in a fiercely competitive knowledge economy.<\/p> <p>  As Professor Ferguson has said, it is well recognised that our pool of high-quality talent and our capacity for innovation at a global competitive level is central to that achievement.  Universities are the engine rooms for the production and nurturing of talent and the cutting edge research and innovation that takes place therein.<\/p> <p>  In the early 2000s, Irish universities experienced an unprecedented investment in higher education and research that approached that of their competitors in Europe, and Ireland thrived on the global stage.  Two of our universities moved into the top 100 and, due to the work of Science of Foundation Ireland and the Programme for Research in Third-Level Institutions, PRTLI, Ireland was ranked tenth in the scientific rankings, its first time in the top ten.<\/p><p>That period of investment in higher education was sufficient to guide us through the worst years of recession.  Our highly qualified graduates, the knowledge transfer from research and development activity and the university-industry partnerships played a significant role in our knowledge-led economic recovery.<\/p><p> With the UK's impending departure from the European Union, we are now faced with another crisis in which higher education and research again have a significant role to play.  There are several challenges and threats, as Professor Ferguson outlined, but there are opportunities, too, in research and higher education, which is not often said in reference to Brexit.  One of the main challenges is that if the UK does exit without a deal, the impact on Horizon 2020 will be significant.  The UK is Ireland's largest collaborator on research documents, with more than 15,000 publications jointly held.  In the &euro;80 billion research programme under Horizon 2020, it is our third largest collaborator.  There will be difficulties with the current projects we hold with our UK partners and in all future applications to Horizon 2020 and its successor, Horizon Europe.  In addition, we will lose the UK as a strategic partner in influencing the agenda for European programme funding.  Overall, there could be a reduction in the amount of funding that is available as a consequence of the budget reductions that will be made under Horizon Europe.<\/p><p> One of the greatest opportunities arising out of Brexit is the possibility to attract and recruit outstanding talent, not only from the UK but internationally.  While it is helpful that we are an English-speaking country, for many researchers and top academics, a national funding system that values basic and applied research and provides appropriate facilities for researchers is also key.  Several considerations come into play when researchers are considering moving their laboratories and small businesses to Ireland.  Unfortunately, the recent decline in rankings and other indicators for the higher education sector means that Ireland is no longer seen as positively in some quarters as it was in the past.  In particular, it is viewed as inferior to our competitors in Germany, France and the Scandinavian countries.  This makes it more difficult to attract the top talent.<\/p><p> Along with the specific measures that Science Foundation Ireland and other funders and Government agencies have been putting in place, including bilateral agreements and specific actions, we are asking that in order to keep pace with our competitors, we do everything possible to achieve the national target of 2.5% of GDP for research and development.  We are particularly focused on the Exchequer element of that funding, that is, the amount of moneys that go through public funds into research and development through Science Foundation Ireland and other agencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019100900002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lisa Keating","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":1496,"content":"<p>I will elaborate further on some of the challenges and opportunities for the universities as we face into Brexit.  In the 2017-2018 year, there were almost 9,600 Irish-domiciled students enrolled in UK universities, which is equivalent to the size of Maynooth University or two average Irish institutes of technology.  The UK has traditionally served as a safety valve for capacity issues in Irish higher education both in terms of our overall student numbers and in specialised fields of study where our domestic provision is limited or, in some cases, non-existent.  The figures decreased significantly in recent years due to the increase in student fees in England and Wales from 2012 onwards.  There has been an even more significant decline since 2016, in all probability due to Brexit.  On the other side, in 2018 we had just over 2,500 students from the UK in Irish higher education, 864 of whom were from Northern Ireland.  We place particular value on North-South and east-west student mobility in the higher education sector.  However, these numbers have likewise decreased significantly since 2016.  This year, applications from Northern Ireland students were down a further 18%, while those from students in Great Britain had reduced by an additional 13%.  Brexit has effectively wiped out the gains we made up to 2016 in terms of increasing cross-border student mobility.  This is a huge challenge for Ireland strategically.  While the reduction in cross-border student mobility is exacerbated by Brexit, the UK's departure from the EU will also have long-term detrimental effects on all-island co-operation, our social and economic interactions with our nearest neighbours and general good neighbourliness across these islands.  That is a significant challenge for the future.<br\/><br\/>The IUA welcomes the Irish and UK Governments' memorandum of understanding, MoU, signed in May this year, which guarantees that the reciprocal rights and privileges offered by the common travel area will continue after the UK leaves the EU.  Those rights and privileges include in the area of education and training, employment and so on.  However, that overarching memorandum was due to be followed up with a sectoral-specific memorandum between the two Governments which would ensure that Irish students who study in the UK in the future will continue to be subject to the same financial terms and conditions, including eligibility for grants and loans, as UK students, and <i>vice versa<\/i>for UK students studying in Ireland, including eligibility for Student University Support Ireland, SUSI, grants.  That sectoral MoU has not been finalised.  To address the associated uncertainty for students and their families, we request the select committee's assistance in ensuring that the proposed sectoral MoU between the Irish and UK Governments on student fees and supports is finalised and signed as soon as possible.  Failing that, the universities request that unilateral steps be taken by Ireland to guarantee that UK students coming here for the purposes of higher education, particularly Northern Ireland students, are eligible for free tuition and SUSI grants on the same terms as are Irish students.  In addition, students who are affected by Brexit in terms of fees and lack of grants should be priority recipients of the contingency Brexit fund that was announced yesterday by the Government.  Their livelihoods and futures are directly affected, and it would be a suitable way of investing some of that money in the future of our young people.<br\/><br\/>The Irish universities are experiencing a healthy and welcome increase in demand from students in other EU countries, which is good for diversity on campuses and allows Irish students to study and work alongside colleagues from different cultures, thereby preparing them for a diverse future.  However, these increases in EU applications alongside the reduction in the numbers of Irish students moving to the UK are likely to put further pressure on existing infrastructure in Irish higher education institutions.<br\/><br\/>While the broader impact of Brexit on the Irish economy is as yet unknown and could be very significant, it is highly likely that it will also have a detrimental effect on Exchequer income and, hence, on the Government's ability to fund public services such as higher education and research.  However, as Professor Ferguson and Dr. Keating outlined, in the most recent economic downturn, the knowledge-intensive economy was key to a rapid recovery.  The Government should protect and, indeed, boost investment in higher education and research in order to ensure the substantial economic and social dividends such investment is guaranteed to return in the medium to long term.<br\/><br\/>Brexit does present some opportunities for the higher education sector in Ireland.  It is resulting in a greater number of European and international students applying to study in Ireland, as I outlined.  We have opportunities to expand Irish participation in the Erasmus+ programme, particularly if the UK is no longer such an active player.  There are large numbers of students from other EU countries who will seek to take a year or several years of their degree programmes in an English-speaking institution.  However, we come back to the problem of lack of capacity in a scenario where there are additional EU and non-EU students seeking to study here.  Given the ongoing healthy growth in domestic student numbers, any growth in the numbers of international students, many of whom are highly qualified and fluent in English, brings the risk of displacement of less competitive domestic students.  In order to overcome these capacity issues, we encourage the Government to put in place a sustainable funding model for higher education and to plug the funding gap over a series of budgets.<br\/><br\/>We thank the committee for offering us the chance to present a brief overview of the main challenges and opportunities raised by Brexit from the perspective of the Irish universities.  The issues we have outlined highlight the need for a sustainable funding model and a significant increase in Irish expenditure on research and innovation if we are to overcome the challenges that arise and capitalise on the few opportunities that are available.  We would be delighted to discuss these and any other relevant issues with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019100900002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lewis Purser"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":1497,"content":"<p>Before I proceed to members, I have a couple of questions.  Mr. Purser mentioned a memorandum of understanding regarding the common travel area and student and staff mobility.  It does not currently have a basis in law in this country.  Considering the current uncertainty, is this enough reassurance for members of the Irish Universities Association or do we need specific legislation to provide for the education and research sector in a no-deal scenario?  I know Mr. Purser talks about the outstanding need for a memorandum of understanding with regard to the financial treatment of students.  Likewise, I presume we will need some legislation once that is in place.  On 31 October, what will happen to Irish students in Britain and British students here?  What will happen to people getting grants in the event of a no-deal Brexit?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Purser has described how much science and research in the UK and Ireland seems to be worked on bilaterally rather than through EU programmes such as Horizon 2020.  How does Mr. Purser envisage that Brexit could impact on bilateral Ireland-UK research programmes?

It was built up from years of custom and practice.  I understand that as part of the Government's Brexit preparations, some elements are prepared to be placed on a legal footing.  I do not know whether that will be entirely necessary to ensure normal mobility of individuals across these islands, but it might well be to ensure employment and residency rights.  With regard to students, we could, if and when the UK leaves the European Union, with or without a deal, unilaterally write UK students into the various Government schemes, such as the free fee scheme or the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, scheme, which is renewed annually.  Our Government could do that.<\/p> <p>  The UK has committed to continue to fund European students, including Irish students, who are currently in UK higher education for the continuation of their studies.  I believe it has already issued a guarantee for students who might enter next year.  Beyond that, it is anyone's guess.  The Irish Government has issued a guarantee to UK students who started this year for the duration of their normal study period of three or four years, but it is anyone's guess from next year on.  This uncertainty makes it difficult for young people and their families to plan and it contributes significantly to the fall-off in student mobility.  It may need to be written into legislation or into secondary documentation such as the SUSI scheme or internal documentation between the Departments of Finance and Education and Skills.  I imagine the latter is necessary but that is entirely within the gift of the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019100900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lewis Purser"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":1499,"content":"<p>I can address the question on research.  If the UK leaves without a deal, the UK Government has committed to fund the UK component of Horizon 2020 and the existing European programmes.  If it honours that commitment, then those existing programmes should proceed to the end.  If the UK leaves the EU without being a part of the European research programmes, which would be the case if there was a no-deal Brexit then, going forward, it will not be an eligible partner.  That poses two problems.  The first is that Irish researchers need to find partners from other European countries, which is the nature of the Chair's second question, and we are stimulating that.  For example, a couple of years ago, we opened the first Fraunhofer-SFI German research centre in Dublin.  We are busy building relations with the researchers, with Germany, Lithuania and so on.  It is essentially a substitution exercise for future European programmes.<\/p> <p>  It leaves the question of what will happen with bilateral collaboration between Ireland and the UK because the UK will no longer be part of those programmes.  We have put in place all of the administrative arrangements bilaterally, but the funding will have to increase significantly.  To give a ballpark number, 10% of collaborations are with the UK.  Ireland's drawdown under Horizon 2020 will be &euro;1.25 billion, 10% of which is &euro;125 million.  That is a rough number for the shortfall.  That is what currently funds the Irish component of those collaborations with the UK through our EU subscription.  It will no longer do that.  We will have to find that money for the bilateral collaboration elsewhere.  That is all in place, there is no further administration to do, and the programmes will survive a hard Brexit.  The money to do that is required and that will be a challenge because Ireland will also have to contribute more to the European budget.  The Minister for Finance will have challenges because he will want to contribute to the European budget to deal with Brexit, and there is this issue too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019100900002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Mark Ferguson"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":1500,"content":"<p>I welcome our three guests.  It is an extraordinarily important area of discussion.  Being from near the Border myself and involved in friendship groups etc., I am a strong exponent of North-South co-operation and interactions at all levels as a basis ultimately to create a united people and good working relations in the meantime.  It is disappointing to hear from Professor Ferguson that there are no North-South research collaboration projects in place at present because of the absence of an Administration in Northern Ireland.  It once again underscores the importance of putting the Administration back in place.  It is disturbing news.  The only question I have arising from that is whether Professor Ferguson sees any potential to get around the absence of an Administration, although one would like to think that an Administration will be established soon.<\/p> <p>  If I understood correctly, though I may not have and it would be fine to have this clarified, I think Professor Ferguson expressed alarm that the contingency funds cited in the budget for research and development in the Border region in the event of a no-deal Brexit could negatively impact on the national funding.  If I am wrong, please tell me.  My humble opinion there is that the two are surely one in many regards and this should not be an issue.  If there is a new discovery or breakthrough in Monaghan Mushrooms, Lakeland Dairies or Glanbia in Cavan, they are part of the national canvas.  Will Professor Ferguson clarify that?<\/p> <p>  The question of cross-border student mobility is important and has been touched on by the Chair with regard to the practical areas of finance etc.  It is my view that, as a committee, we should strongly support the signing of those memorandums of understanding in our report and talks with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to achieve seamless cross-border student mobility.<\/p><p>The witnesses stated that Brexit could lead to an increase in students and academic staff coming to study and work in Ireland from other EU countries.  Does this raise capacity issues?  Have Irish universities started to see an increase in the number of student and academic staff who might otherwise have gone to the UK?  What needs to be done at Government or sectoral level to prepare for this?  To what degree is this already becoming a reality?  Can this be quantified?  How will we deal with this in future?<\/p><p> It is wonderful to have the witnesses here.  It is an exciting area and it must be the future.

We have been busy trying to put those in place not only with the Northern Ireland Civil Service but also directly with Westminster.  It is possible, through UK Research and Innovation or the programmes which the UK may initiate post Brexit, that the funding for a Northern Ireland piece, particularly through its cities or regional deals, could flow centrally from Westminster as well as, or instead of, flowing through a Stormont assembly.  Those discussions are progressing.  They are also progressing in Ireland.  There is uniform agreement.  Colleagues in the UK agree that it is a good thing to do.  There was a meeting of the nine university presidents across Ireland, the two universities in the North and all the universities in Ireland, and everyone agreed that it just needs to happen.  We are working on it.  We are working on the assumption that it could be a restoration of the Executive, which would be excellent, but we also need a plan B.

They all also see this as an opportunity.  SFI has various programmes to attract the top talent.  In many cases, the initiative and mechanisms are there, as is the willingness of the universities and funders.  Our difficulty is the funding is not there to make it happen.

We have already seen a significant increase in demand from students from other European countries outside Ireland and the UK.  In 2017, the first real year after the UK's vote to leave the European Union, there was a 17% increase in applications from students from other European countries.  In 2018 that increased by a further 5% and this year, there has been a further 9%.  There has been a very significant increase in numbers.  That is great for Ireland and our universities and young people, as it brings a huge additional diversity on campus and adds both to the life of the campus and to interaction in academic programmes.  It increases the world view and the opportunities for Irish students in their future lives and careers.  However, as is well documented elsewhere, this increased interest from European students is adding significantly to the domestic increases we already experience because of our very healthy demographic trends, coupled with the fact that year on year, our substantial numbers of students going to the UK are decreasing rapidly.  That all means that more and more good students want to study in Irish higher education.  We are now at a situation where the Government funding per student is just over 50% of what it was in 2008.  The universities have made up that shortfall through other income and mechanisms and the students themselves are paying significantly more in student fees in 2019 than was being paid in 2009.  That is where the additional money is coming from.  The capacity issues are there in terms of capital spending for buildings, for laboratories, student supports and all the things that students need on the ground, such as residences and student accommodation.  The list is long.

It is very telling that in 2019, there is a &euro;138 million gap between what is needed and what is being provided.  The Government says that higher education is a priority.  It needs to show that with resources.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019100900002#E01200","speaker":"1408","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":1514,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and thank them for their comprehensive presentations.  The combination of the presentations and the previous questions covers a lot of what I intended to ask about.  I would like to thank the witnesses for opening their statements by mentioning opportunities.  On this committee and outside of it we have all become accustomed to pessimism and negativity when we discuss Brexit.  It was refreshing that all the witnesses endeavoured to start out with opportunities, but unfortunately they concluded on negativity and problems.  I would like them to elaborate on those problems and to describe the feedback they get from deliberations with their counterparts in the UK and Europe.  The witnesses seem to have their homework done and all their ducks in a row where Irish issues are concerned.  They have highlighted where there may be problems.  What is the reaction on the British side of bilateral communications that are held in anticipation of potential problems?  To get back to where I started my comments, do they see the same issues or are they stuck on the opportunities?  Have the witnesses encountered any problems in these communications?  Is the British side in denial, taking the opportunistic approach or thinking it will be all right on the night?  How have those discussions gone?<\/p> <p>  I presume Science Foundation Ireland has multilateral projects in which Ireland, the UK and other members of the EU 27 are equally involved.  If the UK leaves the EU in the morning, how will these projects be affected?  Turning to attitudes away from this island, how are the other members of the EU 27 approaching this and preparing for it?  Do they perceive it to be as big an issue as we do? <\/p> <p>  Have universities noticed any difficulties in recruiting industries to their research partnerships?  Has there been any decline in the number of industries approaching universities because of the uncertainty we hear about in industry?  We hear that money and talent are available and there are potential opportunities for expansion but the companies are sitting on their hands because of the uncertainty Brexit has created.  Has that affected the universities' joint programmes with industry? <\/p> <p>  That is basically it.  This is somewhat repetitive but I would like to hear about the UK.  I know that to an extent what we read and see in the media is propaganda, but Ireland seems to be number one in the blame game in the UK.  Are the witnesses finding that in a professional capacity, or is it just media propaganda?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019100900002#F00200","speaker":"1383"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":1515,"content":"<p>The witnesses were asked several comprehensive questions.  There is not much left for me.  I would like to thank them for telling us that there are opportunities.  This is the first group that has come before this committee and said that there are opportunities and we need to be looking for them.  That is vitally important to the country.<\/p> <p>  I am a little bit concerned when we start talking about Ireland as the English-speaking member of the European community.  Last summer I spent some time at a conference in Georgia, in the Caucasus.  Everybody in the hotel I stayed in spoke perfect English.  English is widely spoken in all of those countries, as well as in Germany.  The only country that really hangs onto its language is France.  Perhaps that is a cultural thing; I am not sure.  On one hand I am a little concerned that we are using English as a marketing tool but on the other hand, it opens the door for people who are already fluent in the language to come here.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Universities Association referred to the accommodation problem and the growth in foreign demand for places in Irish universities.  I would respectfully suggest that if some of those studying in university took up apprenticeships, which might be more suitable to their careers, we might have a few more places.  If we ever achieve peer equivalence between university qualifications and apprenticeships, we might solve some of the accommodation problem.  <\/p> <p>  In the last few days I listened to an interview about the investment in research in this country.  It might have been with Professor Ferguson.  This afternoon Professor Ferguson has frequently made the point that there are so many other calls on the public purse.  The point made in that interview was that investment in research and development is an investment in the future.  We seem to have failed to get that message across.  I did not see any provision for research in the &euro;190 million that was allocated to further and higher education yesterday.  This budget was about marking time and trying to hold the horses at bay.  I do not see anything in it. <\/p> <p>  Would North-South collaboration be taking place if there was an assembly in the morning?  If the assembly fell apart in six months, would the collaboration collapse as well, or would continued collaboration on each project be guaranteed?  Bilateral agreements were mentioned.  People in this illustrious establishment tend to get very uptight and hung up about the word \"bilateral\" in relation to the UK and state that we do not do that sort of thing.  Could we enter into bilateral agreements under the auspices of the Good Friday Agreement, rather than as a rogue country stepping outside the EU 27?  I believe the Good Friday Agreement provides a vehicle by which we could have bilateral agreements.  I would be interested in the witnesses' views on this. <\/p> <p>  I was delighted to hear somebody say for the first time ever in this room that the common travel area is not underpinned by law in either the UK or Ireland.  Some of universities in Scotland offer free education.  I have sent several students to Scotland over the years.  Will they be treated as foreign nationals in a future arrangement?  If so, what sort of funding will this country have to provide in order to continue to send students to the UK?<\/p> <p>  I will throw one or two other issues in.  Professor Ferguson mentioned the recruitment opportunities, particularly the collaboration between the University of Oxford and University College Cork.  That is fantastic.  Will that type of collaboration between two different systems run into HR difficulties?  Will there be problems with pensions, which will be a vital issue for everybody involved?  How will we jointly fund the pensions for those who come across in those areas?<\/p> <p>  Finally, I was looking at the figures concerning research as a proportion of GDP.  It is absolutely disgraceful that we are so far down the scale.  It is very hard to justify spending on research.  It is like advertising; 50% is vitally important for the future of the country.  I note we are slipping down the international scale.  That will impact the students coming to Ireland from foreign countries, including from other European countries.  They want to be among the top ten institutions.  They want to go to the best universities.  We cannot be the best unless we attract what one of the witnesses referred to as \"top talent\".  Unless we bring in the top talent, we will not bring in the understudies, that is, the PhD students who carry out this research. <\/p> <p>  Foreign direct investment is a big concern in Ireland.  I sometimes wonder about it.  The other day I read the curriculum vitae of a person involved in a multinational company.  This person holds a masters degree and for all intents and purposes, her job is nothing more than customer service over the phone.  Some of the IT companies are now saying they no longer want people with degrees as they can train their own people.  I perceive the foreign firms that invest here as consumers of our human capital.<\/p><p> How much engagement has there been with them on research and development, specifically product development?  Pharmaceutical companies here tend to be more focused on manufacturing than on research and development.  IT companies tend to be more engaged in technical and customer support than research and development.  Some of the IT companies in this country were writing software but I do not think they do so any longer.  These are general questions.  I am sorry if they fall slightly outside the topic of Brexit but I think they are all relevant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019100900002#F00300","speaker":"1390","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":1517,"content":"<p>I will respond first to Senator Black.  In terms of the projects that are ongoing under Horizon 2020, if the UK Government makes good on what it has pledged, they will continue uninterrupted.  What the UK Government has said is that anything that is currently ongoing that is funded by Europe, the UK Government will step in and take it over if the UK leaves Europe without a deal.  One can read in the newspapers that many academics in the UK do not believe that.  The UK Government has said it and we can only take it at its word.  I understand where the confusion arises because many people in the UK say they do not believe their Government and that it does not have enough money to do that.  If we take the UK Government at its word, the projects will continue, but, going forward, the UK will not be eligible for new projects and the Irish researchers will have to find other partners in Europe.  That is doable.  If they want to continue to collaborate with counterparts in the UK, this will have to be done on a bilateral basis.  That means we need to find new money to fund those projects because they were previously funded by money from Europe.<\/p> <p>  The second question was about the GDPR.  This is a very complicated area and I may get something wrong, but I can tell Senator Black that a lot of UK universities have registered offices in Ireland in order to specifically comply with European GDPR standards, particularly in the area of clinical trial data in circumstances where data are collected on patients.  The GDPR aspect will be a UK problem.  It is a brass-plate registration, but the universities are registering in order to comply.<\/p> <p>  In response to Senator Paul Daly, in terms of the opportunities and the UK attitudes, we have encountered nothing but extreme enthusiasm and very professional engagement from our colleagues in the UK.  That is within the research agencies and the universities.  In fact, I would say they are much more engaged than they have been in the past.  The reason is that they see a threat.  I will give a concrete example.  In July, I spent a full day at the University of Cambridge, which is one of the top UK universities, with all of the top management.  At the top of their to-do list is increased collaboration with Ireland.  Before Brexit, I would have to say I would have got a soft-pillow effect, in other words, I would have had a nice meeting.  It would have been fantastic but nothing would have happened.  What we get now is real engagement because they see opportunities.  We are talking about joint appointments between Oxford and Cambridge and many of the leading universities.  They see an opportunity there.  They are going to lose staff.  Our Brexit strategy is very simple.  If people are thinking of leaving the UK, I want them to think of Ireland, but we want to collaborate with the UK in order that it is not parasitic.  I am not going over asking people to leave; I am saying if they are thinking of leaving, they should please think of us as well as America, Australia, Germany and wherever else they might be thinking about, but more importantly, they should think about a joint appointment between a UK university and an Irish university, which might give the UK university the best of both worlds.  I see huge engagement and major opportunities.<\/p> <p>  We have encountered nothing akin to what members might see in the press in terms of blaming Irish people.  In fact, quite the opposite; they think we are a bastion of common sense and good governance.  They think Ireland looks sane among the English-speaking world.  There are significant opportunities.  We will shortly announce the relocation of full professors currently at Oxford and Cambridge who are going to be relocating to Ireland.  That would not have happened prior to Brexit.  We will see the joint appointment to which I referred with Professor S&eacute;amus Davis.  I hope there are more of those.  I see big opportunities.  It is not big numbers but one does not need a very large number of really talented people.  Twenty top people will make a big difference.  One does not need to have 2,000.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the multilateral projects and the attitudes of other people in Europe, that is quite different.  I will generalise.  Many of our European colleagues do not need the UK as much as we do, because they are not its closest neighbour and they are probably a bit fed up with all this Brexit nonsense.  They probably think it is much easier to collaborate with people in Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and so on, and they will put the uncertainty to one side.  I do not think that is an Irish problem; it is a UK problem.<\/p> <p>  In terms of industry collaborations, to generalise, small and medium enterprises are probably being quite cautious because they are going to face into the Brexit storm.  There is probably no difference or perhaps even increased enthusiasm among multinational companies for engaging in research and development investment.  Things that might have been done in the UK in the past may be done in Ireland.  That is another opportunity.  Those people will not invest unless the research is world class.  They will not invest unless the people are user-friendly, but if there is a minor difference between an Irish group and a UK group, we may be able to get the investment and that is what we need to focus on.  The SME community is very engaged, but it is being cautious because it does not know what is happening, given the uncertainty.  It is important that we invest in the future.<\/p> <p>  I will address the North-South aspect because I understand how that could be confusing.  The way that our collaborations work is the bit done in the North of Ireland or in the UK is funded there and we fund the bit done in Ireland.  We do not do charity.  We do not fund the bit in the UK and they do not fund the bit in Ireland.  When we established the collaborations in Northern Ireland it was a decision by the Minister in the Northern Ireland Assembly.  It is not a line item in the Northern Ireland budget.  Due to the fact that there is no functioning Assembly, the civil servants cannot allocate money unless it is specified as a line item, so they do not have a discretionary spend.  That is why it fell apart.  If we were to reinstate it and it were to become a line item, then it would persist.  If it were to be where it was historically, just at the discretion of the Minister of the assembly, it would fall apart if the assembly fell apart.  That is one of the reasons we are trying to do it through Westminster.  If it were done through London - and London does have a devolved regional section in the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform - then it would be more enduring in nature.  We are trying to do both of those.  It is awfully important.<\/p> <p>  There is no problem about bilateral arrangements in science.  We have signed a whole pile of those with our UK colleagues.  We do not have to do it under the Good Friday Agreement.  We could, as there is provision there, but it has not been necessary.  It is a function of the enormous enthusiasm and goodwill.  Both Senators Craughwell and Paul Daly asked me about the UK focus on research and innovation.  It is very simple; it is away from Europe.  The UK is focusing major efforts on collaboration with the Americas, that is, the United States and Canada, and very major focus on the Commonwealth.  The Commonwealth has been resurrected, so to speak.  It was never a part of the science system when I was in the UK and there is now a Commonwealth science approach with, among others, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.  The focus of a government that is not particularly pro-Europe is to focus on America and to focus on the Commonwealth countries.<\/p> <p>  I was asked to explain about the arrangement between UCC and the University of Oxford.  It is dead simple.  It is a joint appointment, but in practice it is 50% at UCC and 50% at the University of Oxford and none of those issues arise because it is very clear.  One just needs to be very precise about where the person is going to be at a particular time.  It is not an issue in terms of doing it.<\/p> <p>  If we look at FDI with respect to development, there is a major opportunity for Ireland.  We are seeing more companies invest in public research in Ireland than ever before.  It is a question of taking those companies on a journey, both large and small companies.  There are significant investments in research and development by large companies in Ireland.  To give an idea of the figures, in 2012, companies in Ireland collectively invested approximately &euro;8 million in  public research in universities.  They now put in close to &euro;200 million.<\/p><p>This is capable of being expanded.<\/p><p> That is the good news story.  The bad news story is that 50% of the multinational companies engage and 50% do not, so we still have a big job to do.  It is not done.  The figure relating to SMEs is about the same.  It is very patchy.  There is a lot to do and there is a significant opportunity.  It is very important for the future that we increase our investment in research and development and that this is done while maintaining the model of two thirds from the private sector and one third from the public sector.  This is what we are doing through programmes like the industry partnerships we run with our colleagues in the universities, the SFI research centres, the partnerships and so on.  We are getting the companies and the public sector to invest.  We need to do more of it.  The programmes, people and talent are there; we just need to put more fuel in the tank.  It is as simple as that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019100900002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Mark Ferguson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":1519,"content":"<p>Is that done on a project-by-project basis where one third comes from Government and two thirds from a company?

I will add a few points for clarity.  He mentioned that 10% of the partnerships we have under Horizon 2020 are with the UK.  This is really important in terms of making up the shortfall of the &euro;125 million to fund those.  However, it is not just about finding an alternative partner.  I emphasise that these are long-term relationships with stellar universities and top academics who are recognised around the world and who are based in UK universities.  It is really important for us to maintain those links.  It is not a monetary type of partnership or interaction one can find it in another country.  While, like business, it is really important to diversify and look to Europe for new partners and collaborations, the links we have with UK academics and researchers are key because these people are recognised as some of the best in the world and Ireland's reputation is enhanced by our interaction with them.  The money is not just to fill a budget pot.  Maintaining those links is of strategic importance to Ireland.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked about collaborations between industry and universities and higher education institutions.  As Professor Ferguson stated, we are not necessarily finding that there has been a drop-off in those interactions.  The trend over time has been to increase greatly.  Irish companies now invest more in research and development than they did in the past and there is much stronger collaboration with universities and higher education institutions.  What defines that is the quality of the research and the talent, which is probably why Brexit is probably not impacting on those.  This is what we have in Irish universities and the Irish higher education system.  We worry that if we continue to erode the funding, we will not have that excellence in science and research and that excellence in our talent.  That is what will stop industry collaborating with our members.  It is not the uncertainty of Brexit; it is the lack of quality and talent that would result from a further erosion of funding.  I wanted to reiterate that point.<\/p> <p>  The English-speaking aspect comes into it a great deal.  I worked as a researcher in Germany.  I am not proud to say that I cannot speak German but it did not impact on me.  English is obviously important in research and academia and is spoken by many.  While that is the icing on the cake, our problem is that we do not have the rest of the cake.  We have been nibbling away at it for years.  We put an awful lot of money in through SFI by means of PRTLI.  We put in a great deal of funding and when the downturn happened, we were able to turn to that investment, reap rewards and use it to bring us through the economic recession we faced.  Going back to the cake analogy, the problem we now face is that we have not been buying the flour and sugar and putting everything back in.  We have the icing on the cake.  We have the mechanisms that SFI has and the English-speaking element.  We have lots of things going for us but we must focus on funding core research if we are to make a difference.  As the Senator noted, this is one of the few opportunities presented by Brexit and we need to capitalise on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019100900002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Lisa Keating"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":1522,"content":"<p>I will deal with a few of the other questions, particularly the ones concerning students.  Senator Black asked how a student from Belfast would be treated in a year's time, which is a very serious issue.  Theoretically, that student could pull out an Irish passport and demand to be treated as a domestic student and we would agree entirely with that.  Our preference is to continue to treat students from any part of the UK as domestic Irish students irrespective of what happens with Brexit.  Maintaining good neighbourly relations, cultural contact and economic links will only continue if our young people continue to cross borders, work and study with each other and get to know each other.  That is how we build up that sustainable future together so we have a very strong preference for maintaining the current terms and conditions for UK students in Irish higher education.  What needs to happen is quite urgent because students and their families make decisions about where they will apply before Christmas.  The CAO system for 2020 will open in early November but the UK system opens earlier.  In the context of high-achieving UK students, the closing date for universities in the Russell Group, which is the group of 24 to 30 top universities in the UK of which Queen's University Belfast is a member, is before Christmas so we need to send out a very loud and clear message to UK students who would be interested in studying in Ireland and their families that we will offer them the same terms and conditions we used to regardless of what happens with Brexit.  Otherwise, they will not know and the uncertainty is what drives people to make decisions.  Unfortunately, we have seen those numbers drop off substantially in the past few years.<\/p> <p>  Senator Craughwell asked whether the Good Friday Agreement would allow us to establish some sort of bilateral agreement with the UK.  I do not think we need the protection of the Good Friday Agreement to do that.  I am very aware that a number of other European countries already have bilateral arrangements and memorandums of understanding with the UK to continue the sort of bilateral research arrangements Professor Ferguson said we need to put in place.  We need funding for that.  They would kick in automatically on the day on which Brexit really goes pear shaped.  Schemes to ensure bilateral mobility are already in place, as well as European funding for young researchers and promising students.  We need those as well.  There is nothing stopping us having good bilateral relations with the UK or constituent regions and devolved provinces in the UK.  That will become more important as we move forward so I would encourage this committee to put pressure where possible on the Government to begin to make those preparations where they have not already been made.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Keating mentioned advantages relating to the English language.  On the surface, this is the case but in the higher education and research game, everybody speaks English and everybody has those advantages.  We are and will remain small.  We are marginal and on the edge of Europe and have an underfunded system despite the best efforts of SFI and other research funders.  In the latest round of the very high-profile European Research Council grants, we got one out of over 400 grants.  We are not at the races.  The former president of UCD, Hugh Brady, was in Dublin last week.  He said that his university, which is smaller than UCD, got more of those grants than the entire Irish system.  That is what we are up against and that is why we need the investment.  Then we will continue to be attractive and to be a magnet for top talent.  This, in turn, will continue to draw foreign direct investment, boost SMEs and indigenous industry and continue to drive our economic development but that is the risk at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019100900002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Lewis Purser"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":1523,"content":"<p>On the issue of passports, it is really important-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019100900002#H00600","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":1524,"content":"<p>Senator Paul Daly indicated that he wishes to ask a supplementary question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019100900002#H00700","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":1525,"content":"<p>I need to get in this question about passports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019100900002#H00800","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":1526,"content":"<p>Could the Senator keep it brief?

Currently, we cannot legally distinguish between an Irish citizen and, for example, a Swedish citizen who wishes to study in Ireland.  That is normal.  We are considering theoretically how we would treat a citizen who has lived all his or her life in the North or in Scotland and comes here as a student.  <i>De facto<\/i>, post Brexit such students will be from a non-EU jurisdiction but will have lived in part of the EU for most of their lives.

This discussion will also allow us to update the committee on some of the potential solutions it identified in its report of July 2017, which was compiled after we appeared before it.<\/p><p>EirGrid Group is a State-owned transmission system operator on the island of Ireland.  We operate the transmission system both in the North, through the System Operator of Northern Ireland, SONI, and in the South.  We are charged with developing the high-voltage electricity grid to cater for the demands of society and the economy.  We also operate the electricity market on the island of Ireland.  In this regard, we work closely with the ESB in the Republic, and with Northern Ireland Electricity Networks, NIE, in the North on delivering that mandate.  In addition to ensuring security of supply, we also play an integral role in delivering decarbonisation through the successful integration of ever-increasing levels of renewables into the system.<\/p><p> In the climate action plan published by the Government during the summer, we have been tasked with progressing and delivering on a number of key areas.  The most significant of those responsibilities include increasing the level of renewables on the grid to 70%; ensuring an appropriate auction and grid regime is designed to support the development of offshore wind; and a commitment to deliver further electrical interconnection to facilitate Ireland&rsquo;s target for renewable electricity by 2030, which I will touch on later.  Work across these work streams and others has commenced and is making significant progress.  The most high-profile of these initiatives is the Celtic interconnector which will link the electrical grids of Ireland and France.  It is worth noting that the Celtic interconnector was a potential solution identified by members of this committee in its July 2017 report.  My colleague, Mr. Mahon, will now discuss the specifics of the interconnector. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019100900002#J01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Rodney Doyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":1539,"content":"<p>The interconnector that will link Cork and Brittany has been studied for well over a decade now.  Its merits are multiple and include facilitating Ireland&rsquo;s 70% target for the increased use of renewable electricity by 2030, as set out in the climate action plan.  It will also increase competition in the electricity market, apply downward pressure on cost, enhance the security of supply for both Irish and French electricity consumers and improve telecommunications between Ireland and France by providing a direct fibre-optic link between both countries.  In addition to these benefits, the Celtic interconnector will, crucially, provide Ireland&rsquo;s only energy connection to an EU member state once the United Kingdom leaves the EU.  Last Wednesday, the European Commission announced grant funding to the tune of &euro;530 million for this project.  Due to the manner in which the regulatory authorities in Ireland and France profiled the grant application, 65% of the grant will be allocated to Ireland.  As such, the overall grant to Ireland will be approximately &euro;345 million, which is a fantastic outcome for both Irish electricity consumers and the broader Irish energy system.<\/p> <p>  I pay particular tribute to the solid cross-party support the Celtic interconnector project has received to date, in both the Seanad and the D&aacute;il, especially from Senators Noone, Richmond and the entire membership of this committee.  The committee's report from July 2017 explicitly stated: \"The free-flow of electricity through inter-connectors, particularly through the completion of the Celtic interconnector, should be a priority.\"  The announcement by the European Commission last week has overwhelmingly demonstrated that it shares this priority.

I am happy to report that we completed that project and the market has now been significantly advanced.  It has been operating successfully under its new arrangements for the past 12 months.  While much political discussion has focused on various sectoral aspects of the North-South and east-west relationships in the Brexit negotiations, there has remained a strong and consistent view that the single electricity market should be retained.  Operating the electricity market on an all-island basis has been a major success and is a tangible benefit of the peace process.  Now that we have transitioned to the integrated single electricity market, we are linked into the European market which resulted in the delivery of even greater efficiencies across the electricity system.

From a system operator perspective, I encourage the committee to ensure that the benefits derived from integration of electricity systems North and South is retained no matter what kind of Brexit we end up with.  A failure to preserve the success of the single electricity market would have a negative impact on prices in Northern Ireland and Ireland, which we do not want to see happen.  We call on the policy makers and negotiators on Brexit to continue their support for the current approach, which would allow us to continue operating a clear model into the future.<\/p> <p>  We were pleased last week to launch the EirGrid Group strategy for 2020 to 2025.

Any decision to move from this level of energy co-operation due to the fallout from a hard Brexit would only serve to unpick the good work that has been done to date, something that we do not want to see happen.

I was glad to provide evidence to it in 2017.  I commend the committee on its report published subsequent to those sessions.<\/p> <p>  I am the country lead for SSE in Ireland.  SSE plc is a FTSE top 40 company, headquartered in Scotland and active in the Irish market for 11 years.  SSE Renewables is proud to be the largest renewable electricity developer on the island of Ireland, with plans for up to three offshore wind farms in the Irish Sea.  We are also one of Ireland's largest energy providers, supplying approximately 700,000 customers on the island.  Over the past six years, SSE has contributed more than &euro;5 billion to the Irish economy, supporting over 4,700 jobs while contributing to the achievement of Ireland&rsquo;s energy and climate policy aims.<\/p> <p>  As the largest company by market capitalisation in the FTSE 100, whose revenues are derived solely from the UK and Ireland, SSE is intractably invested in the UK and Ireland continuing a collaborative and co-operative relationship after the UK formally leaves the EU.  In addition, a number of our business activities are organised on an all-island basis.<\/p> <p>  With that in mind, SSE has undertaken an extensive programme of Brexit readiness.  This includes examining our own supply chain and GDPR requirements and communicating with staff on issues such as freedom of movement and driving licence and insurance arrangements.  A no-deal Brexit would be a suboptimal outcome for SSE and the energy industry, given the uncertainties it creates for all businesses.  However, we do not anticipate Brexit becoming a deterrent to our continued operation and future investment in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on the material issues for our customers and our business across the island.  When I last appeared before the committee two years ago, I proposed three principles for the exit negotiations, which were reflected in the report of findings published by the committee.  Those principles have not changed, though the circumstances have, in particular the greater threat of a no-deal Brexit.  First, the single electricity market on the island of Ireland must be maintained in all Brexit scenarios, both immediately after the UK leaves the EU and into the future.  Second, the flows of electricity and gas between countries through interconnection should continue to support energy security and consumers.  Third, Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to tackling climate breakdown must be delivered on.<\/p> <p>  Taking each in priority order, the combining of the electricity markets in Northern Ireland and Ireland into the SEM has been a success.  As the committee found in its 2017 report, the maintenance of the SEM is a key component of the all-island economy.  The SEM has improved competition and provided the investment case for the construction of new and cleaner generation, providing the benefits of a larger, integrated electricity market.  For customers, these benefits arise in the form of lower costs.<\/p> <p>  The withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May&rsquo;s Government allowed for the SEM to be retained intact.  A statement by the regulators in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland outlines that, in a no-deal exit, the market would essentially be retained, although one element, namely, day-ahead coupling between the SEM and the UK&rsquo;s British Electricity Trading and Transmission Arrangements, BETTA, market, would be lost.  The loss of day-ahead coupling would be regrettable and would lead to reduced efficiency in flows over the electricity interconnectors.  SSE is fully convinced that retaining the rest of the market design and working to replace day-ahead coupling is the best outcome for both Ireland and Northern Ireland.  We would, however, consider any reduction in efficiency due to the loss of day-ahead coupling to be minor in comparison to the overall benefits of the SEM.<\/p> <p>  Protection of the SEM is not only a priority for day one.  Its continued existence will rely on ongoing collaboration between authorities in London, Belfast, Dublin and Brussels.  Continued North-South co-operation between businesses and other bodies will be vital in enabling this to happen, with complementary frameworks needed to allow all sides to continue to trade and co-operate with one another.  We ask these authorities to provide for the maintenance of the SEM immediately following any form of Brexit and on an ongoing basis afterwards.  We also ask the Government to work closely within the EU and with counterparts in the UK to ensure that the SEM and the benefits it brings to consumers in Ireland can be protected in all circumstances.<\/p> <p>  Our second priority is that electricity and gas should continue to flow over the interconnectors.  Two years ago, I outlined the reasons it was vital that flows of energy between the UK and Ireland continue.  As the committee recommended in its 2017 report, the facilitation of seamless interconnection is the preferred solution in all outcomes.  Although there may be increased administration, SSE&rsquo;s expectation is that there will be no barrier in any Brexit scenario to prevent electricity and gas flowing day to day, including in the case of a supply emergency.  In addition, tariffs on the flow of electricity and gas are not expected.<\/p> <p>  As ever, interconnection is one tool in the market, and a combination of it and domestic generation must be provided to ensure that security of supply is assured in all scenarios.  New interconnection should be supported by a clear cost-benefit analysis for customers such as that undertaken for the Celtic project between Ireland and France.<\/p> <p>  When I last appeared before the committee, I noted that the North-South interconnector project was before the courts.  While it is encouraging that it has now gone through the planning process in Ireland, the project is still facing delays in Northern Ireland.  This project would address impediments to transporting energy within the SEM, whereby the cheapest and greenest electricity cannot always travel to where it is needed, while also facilitating greater security of supply.<\/p><p>SSE supports this important piece of infrastructure and the significant savings it will bring to customers on the island. <\/p><p> When I last spoke to the committee, I advocated that Brexit should not subsume all focus in these upcoming, crucial years.  It is welcome that, two years later, such ambitious and necessary plans have been formed to enable Ireland to tackle climate change, providing renewed confidence to renewable investment.  The Government&rsquo;s climate action plan, published this summer, provides a welcome target of 70% of electricity from renewables by 2030.  To achieve this target, the plan identifies a need for 3.5 GW of offshore wind energy, as well as a doubling of onshore wind energy to 8 GW.  This plan builds upon the clear and ambitious recommendations of both the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action.<\/p><p> The plan and its targets can provide a green light for renewables investment in Ireland.  For this investment to be realised, the actions in the climate action plan must be completed on time.  This includes a significant level of facilitative frameworks and consents to deliver grid connections, along with system services to support a higher level of renewables.  It also includes a timely implementation of the new renewable electricity support scheme, currently in design by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  It is critical that any Brexit outcome, including a no-deal exit, does not result in these actions being delayed or a reduction in the outlined ambitions.<\/p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s offshore sector has had numerous false starts over the past decade.  The committee&rsquo;s 2017 report noted the opportunities which exist for the offshore generation of wind energy.  The climate action plan has signalled a clear intention to ensure these developments now begin, setting up processes for offshore leases and connections, as well as route to market.  Early offshore projects such as SSE&rsquo;s Arklow bank can make a significant contribution towards meeting Ireland&rsquo;s EU emissions targets.  It is critical they are facilitated and supported if this transition is to happen this decade.<\/p><p> With the delivery of this increase in renewables, along with the complete phasing out of coal and peat in the first half of the decade, gas will have a critical role to play.  High efficiency gas generation will provide the flexibility to support the renewables transition while ensuring security of supply.<\/p><p> It is essential the transition to a low-carbon economy is delivered cost effectively.  This needs a strong overarching policy driver.  The EU&rsquo;s emissions trading scheme, ETS, is designed to put a cost on carbon emissions in the electricity sector, as well as for other large demand users.  In the case of a no-deal Brexit, the UK including Northern Ireland, will leave the ETS.  The UK Government has outlined its intention to substitute the European scheme with a replacement for the coming two years with a view to aligning with the ETS in the future.<\/p><p> Authorities should assess ways to ensure the ETS, and any replacement in Northern Ireland, maintains alignment to the greatest extent possible in order to ensure electricity generators in the single electricity market, SEM, compete on a level playing field.  Ireland should also take an active role at EU level in ensuring the EU ETS is on a pathway to delivering a robust carbon price.  If this is not achieved, we should consider domestic measures to supplement the scheme.<\/p><p> The increase to carbon tax, as announced in yesterday&rsquo;s budget, should provide the same overarching signals to solid fuels, heating and transport.  We support the announcement and welcome the commitment to use revenues on climate action measures such as improved energy efficiency, as well as in support of a just transition for those particularly impacted.<\/p><p> SSE sees three energy priorities for Ireland as Brexit plays out, namely, maintain the SEM, ensure flows of energy over the interconnectors continue, and deliver on plans for decarbonisation of energy.  We believe these three priorities are deliverable, although effort will be required both in the near term and on an ongoing basis.  It is our view that the successful fulfilment of these three aims will represent a win-win outcome for consumers in Ireland and the EU as a whole, as well as the UK and particularly in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p> Energy customers want prices to be fair and Ireland requires cost-effective investment in energy infrastructure to decarbonise its economy and maintain security of supply.  The imperative and public demand for decarbonisation has never been higher.  Brexit, and the potential of a no-deal Brexit, must not distract from the fulfilment of these decarbonisation objectives, along with the continued delivery of cost-effective energy for consumers.  It is in that spirit that I have presented these three priorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019100900002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Wheeler","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":1548,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Wheeler for his opening statement.

I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Brian Mullins, head of regulatory affairs.<br\/><br\/>In June 2017, my colleague, Ms Claire Madden, addressed members of the committee on the likely impacts of Brexit on Ireland&rsquo;s gas supply.  Since then we have progressed several key actions to help provide the necessary assurances that Ireland&rsquo;s gas supplies will be unaffected by Brexit.  Our assessment is based on our experience as the operator of Ireland&rsquo;s transmission and distribution network, as well as on the significant engagement we have undertaken with stakeholders, including officials in Ireland, the EU, Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  Based on our assessment and most up-to-date engagement with all stakeholders, our view is that the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union will not impact on security of gas supply to the island of Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Before discussing Brexit in greater detail, I will provide some context for the committee.  Gas Networks Ireland is the owner and operator of Ireland&rsquo;s gas network, supplying gas to over 700,000 industrial, commercial and residential customers.  Natural gas is of key strategic importance to Ireland, representing 30% of our country's primary energy.  Approximately 50% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity is powered by natural gas.  As the Climate Change Advisory Council recently pointed out, not only is gas important to our economy, it is essential for our transition to a decarbonised economy.<br\/><br\/>Following Brexit, the physical gas infrastructure linking Ireland to the rest of Europe will not change.  Of the three entry points to the Irish gas system, approximately half of our gas is supplied from the indigenous sources in Corrib and Kinsale, with the balance being imported from Moffat in Scotland.<br\/><br\/>The Irish gas market is heavily interconnected with that of the UK.  It should be noted that the supply of gas to Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man is fully reliant on Gas Networks Ireland&rsquo;s infrastructure.  This only underpins the need for continued co-operation between Ireland and the UK regarding gas supplies.  There are existing intergovernmental framework agreements in place since 1993 between Ireland and the UK concerning Ireland&rsquo;s two gas interconnectors.  We see this framework continuing to apply post Brexit.<br\/><br\/>The progress we have made since we last addressed the committee in 2017 allows us to reaffirm our assessment that security of gas supplies will not be impacted by Brexit.  First, we have undertaken extensive engagement with key stakeholders in the gas industry, including regulators, other pipeline operators, gas shippers and relevant Departments across the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  Ireland and the UK have successfully operated in a highly connected and interdependent energy system since the early 1990s.  Given the interconnected nature of the markets, all relevant parties remain strongly committed to the continued successful operation of the gas interconnectors.  It is clear from our engagements that the parties are all committed to ensuring that gas will continue to flow under existing arrangements from Great Britain to Ireland, Northern Ireland and Isle of Man, regardless of the outcome of Brexit.<br\/><br\/>Second, the UK has transposed all relevant existing EU gas legislation into national law.  This essentially means that the <i>status quo<\/i>will be maintained with the flow of gas between the UK and Ireland, as well maintaining the legal obligations on neighbouring transmission system operators, TSOs, to co-operate with each other regarding gas flows.<br\/><br\/>Third, measures are in place to ensure the contractual framework governing gas flows from Great Britain to Ireland will remain unchanged post Brexit.  We are confident all existing systems and processes governing gas flows and gas trading will remain unchanged following Brexit.<br\/><br\/>It has been confirmed by both the UK and the EU that a zero tariff will apply to gas flows in the event of a default to World Trade Organization, WTO, tariff rules.  On the basis of this progress, Gas Networks Ireland is satisfied there will be no disruption to the daily importation of gas from Great Britain to Ireland, even in the event of a no-deal Brexit.<br\/><br\/>In the past week, Gas Networks Ireland published its Vision 2050 strategy, which will deliver sustainable additional indigenous gas supply.  By 2030, 20% of gas on the network will be indigenously produced renewable gas.  By 2050, 50% of our gas will be carbon-neutral comprising renewable gas and hydrogen.  This will only reinforce security of supply in the years to come while ensuring Ireland has indigenous and sustainable sources of energy.<br\/><br\/>Gas Networks Ireland remains committed to continuing our strong relationships with our stakeholders over the coming months and years to ensure there will be minimal, if any, negative impact on all our gas customers as a result of Brexit.  While there is the potential for some regulatory divergence in the years ahead, we are confident that given the interconnected nature of our islands and our energy systems, this can be managed.  We look forward to the committee&rsquo;s questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019100900002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":1550,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses for their opening statements.<\/p><p>I might kick things off myself with a few questions.

As a Border person who wants to see every form of North-South co-operation grow, and ultimately grow into a unified State, I am also firmly in support of maintaining the all-island energy market.  There is no challenge to that.  The North-South interconnector comes into play in a huge way there.  I have no intention of going through all the technical issues.  There are people who argued that it could be undergrounded efficiently and the witnesses' argument was that this would be difficult from the point of view of bringing in renewables and that of cost.  This is not the correct forum to go back over all that and it is not the agenda today.  However, I have been led to believe that technologies are evolving all the time.  Do the witnesses see technological developments and innovation that might change what they have argued in the past in respect of taking the renewables into the grid and in respect of the overall cost?  Is technology moving there?  If it were, the inference is obvious in terms of what it would be right to do.<\/p> <p>  In respect of SSE, I am interested in the whole area of offshore wind farms.  They get over a lot of the societal issues and populist difficulties that may arise in certain instances.  Where I come from in Cavan, we have had an extraordinarily good relationship with the wind farm and the wind industry.  There has not been the popular uprising against them because they were a supplementary income for small farmers in the area through leasing the land for the turbines.  It has actually worked very well.  There is a good community dividend and there are no issues, thankfully, as of yet.  The wave energy would get over any community difficulty.  I would be interested to hear a comment on the economics of offshore wind energy.  Does SSE see a big future there?  Are offshore wind farms ultimately superior and what is the difference?  Can we get greater power there?  I am interested purely as a layperson.  I am sure the people watching would be similarly interested in the contrast between wind farms on land and offshore wind farms.  Wave energy is not on the agenda.  I have heard it said that the potential for Ireland in wave energy is almost equivalent to what oil was in Norway some years ago.  I do not know if that is outside the witnesses' brief but I would interested in a comment on it at any rate.<\/p> <p>  I wanted to comment on the gas networks.  Mr. O'Sullivan will be aware of the good news in Cavan that we are very proud of.  I raised it in the Seanad this morning.  It concerns Virginia International Logistics, a major haulage company.  I am not going to go into this in depth.  The company has become the first haulier in Ireland to complete a zero carbon heavy goods vehicle delivery to Europe.  The trucks were fuelled by compressed renewable gas, also known as bio compressed natural gas.  While we congratulate the Cole family and Virginia International Logistics, Mr. O'Sullivan might comment on the potential of this to become the norm.  I would like a comment on the economics around that.  Can it become profitable for haulage companies to make that transition?  Would they need support in so doing?<\/p> <p>  Could Mr. O'Sullivan explain to me as a layperson the degree to which the use of gas is decarbonised, the degree to which there is still a carbon footprint in the use of gas and the distinction between this form of gas and the other?  It is an interesting area and a relevant one.<\/p><p>I share the Chairman's interest in what all this means for consumers post Brexit in terms of price.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019100900002#O00300","speaker":"1397","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":1555,"content":"<p>The witnesses are welcome.  Their joint presentation has reassured me that business will rise above politics and that Brexit will do whatever Brexit does but business will continue to be transacted across the globe.  Their presentation was very welcome.  They are not hanging about waiting to see who wins and who loses; they are ensuring the future of their businesses, which is important.<\/p> <p>  Many institutions in this country are now cross-Border.  Under the Good Friday Agreement, we have Waterways Ireland and Gas Networks Ireland and electricity supply moving North and all that.  Is there anything that is a pinch-point now for the witnesses that we could work through the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement to get around?  I am concerned, as this Brexit process rolls on, that politicians are looking at the macro issue, so to speak, but the witnesses are interested in the micro issues on the ground.  If there is anything in that respect that is important to them, they might allude to that.<\/p> <p>  On the risk to supply, when we talk about interconnectors we are talking about a central point and the risk to supply across all three areas is something that is of concern to me.  In 2016, I wrote a piece about the implementation of a border in Ireland following the referendum.  I could see no way that we would get by without some sort of border, be it soft or hard.  As we draw closer to 31 October, I see that becoming a hard border.<\/p> <p>  I have spent some time in Northern Ireland and I am concerned about the security aspect of Brexit, the part we all hope will not happen.  With single points of supply, interconnectors running across borders and so on, have the witnesses taken on board the security implications of that supply and the infrastructure required?  I refer to the policing of it.  Do they believe they will need military personnel to manage the infrastructure on the ground or will they bring in private companies to do that for them?  I am concerned about that.<\/p> <p>  I do not want to stray off the Brexit theme but two issues cross my mind.  We were talking about carbon tax.  There is much debate here about whether carbon tax is the way to go or whether we should offer incentives to encourage people to move away from carbon-generated energy supply.  If the witnesses have something to say on that, I would be interested to hear it.  <\/p> <p>  Now that we have an interconnector coming from France, I am sure some people here will be looking at whether electricity is generated through nuclear power stations and the like.  Some people will be concerned about that so we might as well be upfront and tell them straight if it is involved.<\/p> <p>  People refer constantly to electric vehicles and the like.  I believe we will have arrived with electric vehicles when I can pull into a petrol station, take out a battery, put in another one and be on my way in three and a half minutes.  If I have to sit for two hours while the battery is charging, forget it.  For the average long-distance traveller, that will not work.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' views on that.<\/p> <p>  My key question is the security in all three cases.  I know the witnesses have supply coming in, for example, in Wexford, for the wind turbines.  How vulnerable are those if we face a terrorist incident in this country again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019100900002#P00200","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":1556,"content":"<p>Who wants to go first?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019100900002#P00300","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":1557,"content":"<p>As the Acting Chairman asked me the first question I will start with the emissions trading system, ETS.  It must be remembered that the ETS will continue whether the outcome is a hard or soft Brexit.  Ireland will continue to trade in that market.  What we will see that is different is that the UK will adopt its own policy.  We would look to see that the UK would adopt a policy that is aligned to the European Union ETS.  The challenge from a power generation point of view is that, on the island of Ireland, if we have a generator in the South on an ETS and a generator in the North on a UK tax, they are not aligned.  They are different.  In effect, it becomes cheaper for one side of the Border, whether it is North or South, to emit carbon.  On an all-island basis, we would prefer to see an alignment of that.  We would prefer to see them equal on both sides of the Border but that is for the UK Government to determine after Brexit.  To be clear, I do not believe there will be a major short-term impact in that regard.  The Senator asked if we will continue with regard to the climate action plan.  In power generation, Ireland has a plan to generate 70% of electricity from renewable sources.  The focus now is on delivering that. Whether the UK is in the ETS or outside it does not impact that.  We need to be clear about that.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about offshore wind.  I have been talking about offshore wind at Oireachtas committees for about ten years.  What we have seen in that ten years is a huge improvement in technology.  The original machines in the Arklow Bank wind farm, for example, were 4.5 MW or 5 MW machines.  In terms of the latest auction that took place in the UK only last week, the results of which have just been published, we are now talking about 12 MW machines.  The first wind farm I built in Cavan was 12 MW versus one 12 MW machine now in offshore.  The technology advancement in that and the cost reduction in offshore wind now puts offshore wind in poll position to deliver on the scale required for this challenge.<\/p> <p>  I do not want to take away anything from onshore wind.  We are the largest onshore wind operator developer in the country.  Onshore wind projects have been hugely successful in the past 15 years.  Ireland, in terms of all the different parties, and EirGrid is the industry policy, deserves great credit for the work that has been done on onshore wind but to meet the 70% target, onshore wind projects cannot do that alone.  It needs large-scale offshore wind projects to complement that.  As a result of the technology advancements and the reduction in price, offshore wind is now a credible option for Ireland to hit its 70% target.  Without offshore wind, Ireland will not hit its 70% target by 2030.  That is a reality.  The key point now is to advance all the strong work mentioned in the climate action plan and deliver on the actions to ensure we get to 2023, 2025, 2027 and, in terms of career milestones, all the way to 2030.<\/p> <p>  We are talking about involving technologies to support the penetration of renewable energy.  We lose sight of this point, and it is a great credit to EirGrid and to the entire industry that we have more than 65% of renewables on the system at any one time.  That is ground-breaking and world-leading.  The target is that when we get to 70%, that will be up as high as 95%.  Ireland deserves huge credit for that when we look at the actual investments and the progress that has been made in our systems and how we have developed renewables across Europe.  <\/p> <p>  The challenge going forward is about the back-up.  Renewables now becomes the main power source so instead of gas, coal or peat in the past, it will now be renewables.  To back that up, at SSE, we believe the answer is high efficiency combined gas turbines, CGTs, because we believe gas is the transitional fuel.  Between now and 2050, and we have to get to zero carbon by 2050, gas will be a key enabler of more renewables and a higher renewables penetration on the system.  The challenge then is how we take carbon out of gas.  Gas is the lowest emitter of all carbon fuels in terms of what we are burning currently.  It is much less than coal and peat.  Coal and peat are coming off the system.  The timetables for that have been clearly set out.  The challenge now is how to decarbonise gas.  Gas Networks Ireland has done much work around how we move to potentially green hydrogen, for example.  That could become a real element of power generation in the future.  The target is to get to 70%.  To get to 70%, we need to have back-up and ensured security of supply.  That is where high-efficiency CGTs come in, as well as the other advances that are being made in battery technology and other system services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019100900002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Wheeler"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":1558,"content":"<p>Will Mr. Wheeler comment on wave energy?

As Mr. Wheeler alluded to earlier, the climate action plan is focused on a target of 70% renewable electricity generation by 2030.  That means that at some point, for much of the year we need to use a 95% renewables electricity system on the grid as a back-up supply.  That is a major step change.  EirGrid launched a new strategy a couple of weeks ago and we need to transform the entire electricity grid to be able to cater for all those new generators that will come on-stream.  We are set up to deal with the large-scale generation systems around Ireland but we need to connect onshore wind, offshore wind and solar power.  To achieve the 70% target, we are looking at bringing on an additional 10,000 MW of generation.  That is a large step change that needs onshore and offshore wind, as well as solar power.  If we do not bring them all on-stream between now and 2030, we will not achieve the aims of the climate action plan.  It is very simple means.  There must be new infrastructure and the pinch point or challenge for us may be related to public engagement and getting permission and agreement to build the infrastructure.  It is absolutely key.<\/p> <p>  The interconnector to France is a key element in this and security of supply is a central part of the process.  When we have many forms of renewable energy, there is also the possibility to export that renewable generation to France and support the economy here.  At a time of very low wind, for example, we also need the benefit of the electricity supply from France to provide back-up.  There is also the possibility of back-up from high-efficiency gas generation as well.  The Celtic interconnector is central to the strategy, as is the North-South interconnector.  Getting to the point where we build those two key projects is absolutely essential to us.  Any other interconnection that may be possible between France or the United Kingdom would be a key infrastructure project, and that is where we will need much help and engagement.  It is about getting through the challenges we have and building those large-scale infrastructure projects over the next number of years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019100900002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Mahon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":1565,"content":"<p>I can touch on the price element of Brexit.

There is great support North and South from both regulatory authorities and departments on the energy side.  The all-island single electricity committee, which governs the electricity market, has also supported the idea of the continuation of the single electricity market.  The certainty of that market in a post-Brexit environment will provide certainty to those generating electricity, those supplying it and price follow-through.<\/p> <p>  There will be an impact from Brexit but we do not expect it to have a significant impact on consumers.  We also expect that in the weeks and months straight after Brexit, the generators who trade in the electricity market will find ways of trading with their colleagues in Britain as they transform how they trade in a Brexit environment.  That will lead to further efficiencies.  At the same time we will look at the structures of the market and continue to evolve it, and if required, push it further to provide more efficiency.

Currently, Ireland does not have liquefied natural gas facilities and, therefore, it does not have an impact.  I do not see an impact either in a post-Brexit scenario unless LNG facilities are constructed in Ireland.  I am aware two private companies are certainly investigating the potential to develop LNG facilities in Ireland.  Until those facilities are in place, LNG will not have an impact on power generation.  As an aside, we have two interconnectors with the United Kingdom that operate in parallel.  They have little or no capacity constraint and there is sufficient capacity in them to deliver 100% of Ireland's electricity requirements if that was the case.  We came very close to that in summer 2018, with more than 90% of electricity being produced from gas.  Other areas are supplied by gas, including heat and industry.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the previous speaker that from a gas perspective, I do not foresee any impact on pricing in a no-deal Brexit scenario.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, we are reassured by shippers, network operators and through the work we have done with our counterparts with the United Kingdom.  This relates to the mechanisms in place, the platform for booking capacity and the idea that how trading of gas operates will continue in the same way.  The risk relates to a significant economic shock arising from Brexit.  From a gas perspective, if that materialised it would not have an impact on pricing.  We can go back to 2008, when we had a serious economic shock, and there was no significant impact on energy pricing in general, and there was certainly no impact on gas pricing.<\/p> <p>  Senator Paul Daly asked if we can meet demand and we can do so in a post-Brexit scenario for reasons similar to those I have outlined.  The same mechanism operating today for gas will operate post Brexit and gas supplies will come into the country.  The Kinsale gas field is at end of life and we expect it to stop producing next year.  The volumes it is producing now are quite small.  The Corrib gas field, as I mentioned earlier, is under 50% of our current supply and that will decline over the next ten to 15 years.  At the end of that period, we will be fully reliant on the interconnectors to supply our requirements for gas unless there is a further indigenous source of gas put in place.<\/p> <p>  In my opening statement I touched on the work we are doing to mitigate a position where we would be 100% dependent on imported gas.  That will happen through the development of alternatives, such as renewable gas and hydrogen through electrolysis, which is taking excess renewable electricity and converting it to hydrogen.  We see a bright future in that but it will require the co-operation of several bodies to come together and make that happen, as was mentioned.<\/p><p>To respond to Senator O'Reilly's query on Virginia Transport, I am very familiar with it and we are working in partnership with it to provide compressed natural gas infrastructure.  Virginia Transport is proposing to build a new station on which we are working with it.  The certified renewable gas it bought from the UK was delivered through the gas network.  This is a huge opportunity.  We opened a large compressed natural gas station in Dublin Port last year and another will open on the M7 motorway in the coming weeks.  Several others are in development.  This is at an early stage but we will roll out the infrastructure.<\/p><p> Initially, these stations will operate on natural gas, which will give an immediate 20% reduction on emissions over the use of diesel in these vehicles.  They do not have a range issue.  Refuelling a compressed natural gas truck takes three to four minutes, which is the same time it takes to refuel a diesel truck.  The real opportunity here is to transition from natural gas to renewable gas.  We have not sought supports or subsidies for this.  I believe supports are required for the haulage industry and the bus sector to cover the cost of transitioning fleets and should be introduced.  The task force on low-emission vehicles is looking at introducing supports where companies have incurred costs in taking the initiative to move to lower emission vehicles or emission neutral vehicles whereby they would get the same incentives as exist for electric cars and so on.<\/p><p> Senator O'Reilly also asked about the carbon footprint of introducing these measures.  The gas network has a low carbon footprint as it is, with 100% renewable gas.  This year, for the first time, we introduced some renewable gas on the network and we hope to increase this.  The climate action plan calls for targets and mechanisms to be put in place to facilitate it.  Our goal is to have a carbon-neutral gas network by 2050.  There is a pathway to it and we have already started on it.  We have commenced the roll-out of compressed natural gas and the injection of renewable gas onto the network.<\/p><p> There are other technologies that are complementary to the electricity sector, such as carbon capture and storage.  Recently, we signed a memorandum of understanding with Equinor in Norway to investigate jointly the potential of capturing carbon from power generation plants and storing that carbon.  In other words, in its simplest terms, this means taking the energy out of the gas and putting the carbon back where the gas came from.  This technology also facilitates the production of hydrogen, which we see coming to the fore probably towards the latter part of the next decade and into 2030 and being a significant contributor.  Overall, our ambition is to become a carbon-neutral gas network by 2050.<\/p><p> With regard to security of supply, the interconnectors we have with the UK are extremely robust.  They have been there since 1993 and we have not had a single outage on them - touch wood.  The fact we completed a twinning of the last section of pipeline in Scotland last year gives two completely independent interconnectors with Scotland and puts us in a very robust position in terms of security of supply.  Having that said, any new forms of gas coming on the network outside of those interconnectors will enhance security of supply and possibly bring more competition into the market, which is always welcome.<\/p><p> I do not think there is a security issue.  We are very much interdependent with the UK, particularly with regard to Northern Ireland systems.  Natural gas flows into Northern Ireland initially via our network in Scotland and then through the Scotland and Northern Ireland interconnector.  Because it is a single pipe, the backup for this interconnector is the South-North pipeline from the Republic of Ireland to Northern Ireland.  This means gas would be flowing from the Republic of Ireland into Northern Ireland.  The mechanisms for all his are in place.  I cannot comment on potential terrorist activities but from a practical point of view, the normal working of the gas network is what we will see in a post-Brexit scenario.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/WUS2019100900002#Q00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":1568,"content":"<p>Would it be fair to assume that all three organisations have at least engaged with the security forces?
