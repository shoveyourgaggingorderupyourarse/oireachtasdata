I am head of public policy for Facebook Ireland and I am joined by Ms Claire Rush, our lead counsel on content and regulatory matters.  We are based at Facebook's international headquarters in Dublin.<\/p> <p>  We recognise the real concerns of citizens and Oireachtas Members regarding the fast-moving and evolving nature of harmful content on the Internet, including on our platform.  We take our role in keeping harmful content off our services very seriously.  We recognise that if society were designing the Internet as it exists today from scratch, it would not ask companies to make the judgments that Facebook must make in regard to harmful content alone.   We, therefore, welcome the fact that governments and policy makers around the world are taking an active role in addressing harmful online content.  It is with their help, including that of the committee, that the rules which govern the Internet can be updated in a way that allows people the freedom to express themselves and allows entrepreneurs to build things, while also protecting society from broader harms.<\/p> <p>  Our community standards are the rules which govern what is allowed on our platform.  We draft and update these rules in consultation with a wide range of experts, including NGOs and academics from around the world, including Ireland.  They cover a wide range of content issues including hate speech, bullying, harassment, graphic violence and nudity.  In many cases, our community standards go further than national laws, such as, for example, in the area of non-consensual intimate images, NCII.  We have zero tolerance for the sharing of NCII on our platforms.  Once we are made aware of these images, we remove them and use media-matching technology to prevent further sharing or re-uploading of the images.  However, decisions about content can be complex and we do not always get it right.  That is why we are establishing an external oversight board which will adjudicate at a global level on decisions we make on content.  The decision of the oversight board will be binding on the company.<\/p> <p>  We submitted a detailed response to the consultation convened by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, earlier this year.  In the interest of informing this discussion, I will summarise two of its points.  We outlined how, in our view, an effective and efficient system of oversight by a regulator might operate.  On the subject of notice and take-down, we recognised there can be a role for a regulator to review certain incidents where content is first reported to a service provider but not removed.  We look forward to the publication of the related Bill and to engaging in future consultation opportunities.<\/p> <p>  Every piece of content on Facebook, including photos, text posts, comments, profiles and pages can be reported to us for violating our content policies.  In each case, one can report the content by clicking on the link in the top right hand corner or, in the case of a comment, by  pressing one's thumb on the comment for a few seconds if using a mobile phone.<\/p><p>If the content is found to be against our community standards, it is removed.  We are also investing heavily in artificial intelligence, AI, so that we can more rapidly detect harmful and illegal content on our platforms, and it has been very successful in certain areas.  However there are types of content which are more challenging for Al, such as bullying and harassment where context can be important.  This is why we depend on reports from our community of users.<br\/><br\/>Our most recent community standards enforcement report, in which we publish quarterly breakdowns of the content that we have removed, demonstrates the efforts we are making to tackle a range of illegal and legal but harmful forms of content.  For example, in the first quarter of this year we removed 5.4 million pieces of child sexual abuse material globally, 99.2% of which we removed before it was reported to us.  The report also demonstrates the improvements we are making in developing Al tools to deal with challenging areas of harmful content such as hate speech, where our proactive detection rates have increased from 38% in the first quarter of 2018 to 65.4% a year later.<br\/><br\/>Our community standards recognise that bullying and harassment take place in many different places and can have many different forms.  We do not tolerate this type of behaviour as it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on Facebook.  In addition to removing content, we give users tools to help them protect themselves against bullying, such as blocking other users and controlling who sees your posts, and we operate a bullying prevention hub which gives young people, parents and teachers the tools and resources to address the complex issues which bullying presents.<br\/><br\/>In Ireland, we work with experts to inform our safety policies and deliver online safety programmes.  In the past 12 months we have invested &euro;1 million in a partnership with the national anti-bullying research and resource centre in DCU and <i>SpunOut.ie<\/i>.  The main goal of this partnership is to help raise awareness of online safety and tackle the issue of online bullying among young people by offering online safety and anti-bullying training to every secondary school in Ireland.  The programme is under way with more than 100 teachers from schools across Ireland attending the first set of training sessions in September.  In addition, the research carried out through the school's training programme will inform <i>SpunOut.ie<\/i>'s online safety resources for teenagers.<br\/><br\/>I hope that this gives committee members a brief overview of the steps we are taking to address harmful content on our platform.  We have put these measures and more in place because we want users to feel safe and secure when they are using our services.  Claire and I look forward to your questions and we would be happy to follow up in writing on any point which is of interest to the committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dualta &Oacute; Broin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I now invite Ms Karen White to make the opening statement on behalf of Twitter Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#K00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for its invitation to Twitter to participate in today&rsquo;s session.  My name is Karen White and I am director of public policy for Twitter in Europe.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Ronan Costello, public policy manager for Twitter in Europe.<\/p> <p>  Twitter is an open, public service.  Our singular mission is to serve the public conversation.  We serve our global audience by focusing on the needs of the people who use our service, and we put them first in every step we take.  Twitter is committed to improving the collective health, openness, and civility of public conversation on our platform.  Our success is built and measured by how we help encourage more healthy debate, conversations and critical thinking.  Conversely, abuse, malicious automation and manipulation detract from our purpose.  We provide people on Twitter with a range of tools so that they can control and manage the type of content and accounts they see, ranging from being able to keep an account private to blocking, muting or reporting other individuals on the service.  We also give people control over what they see in search results, through safe search mode, which is enabled by default.  This excludes potentially sensitive content from the search results such as spam, adult content and the accounts an individual has muted or blocked.  We strive to provide an environment where people can feel free to express themselves and we recognise that if people experience abuse on Twitter it can jeopardise their ability to do this.<\/p> <p>  An individual using the service is not permitted to promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people in a range of protected categories.  A person may not engage in abusive behaviour, which is an attempt to harass, intimidate or silence someone else's voice.  We do not allow individuals to use hateful images or symbols in their profile image or header and individuals using the platform are not allowed to use their username, display name or profile bio to engage in abusive behaviour such as targeted harassment or expressing hate towards a person, group or other protected category.  Under this policy we take action against behaviour that targets individuals or an entire protected category with hateful conduct.<\/p><p>With regard to self-harm and suicide, after Twitter receives a report of such behaviour, it will contact the reported user and let him or her know that someone who cares about him or her identified that he or she might be at risk.  We will provide the reported user with available online and offline resources and encourage him or her to seek help.  In response to certain keyword searches relating to these issues, using Twitter's search function, we direct individuals to online prevention resources.  This service is available in Ireland, where we have partnered with the Samaritans, to whose website and support services we direct individuals.<\/p><p> Twitter does not allow individuals on the service to post or share intimate photos or videos of someone which were produced or distributed without their consent.  Such material is sometimes referred to as \"revenge porn\".  This content poses serious safety and security risks.  We inform our users that sharing explicit sexual images or videos of someone online without their consent is a severe violation of their privacy and the Twitter rules.  <\/p><p> People who do not feel safe on Twitter should not be burdened to report abuse to us.  Earlier this year we made it a priority to take a proactive approach to abuse.  Today, through the use of technology, 38% of abusive content that is enforced is surfaced proactively for human review.  We have made meaningful progress towards creating a healthier service.  Since we announced our focus on improving the health of the conversation occurring on Twitter, we have seen a 16% year-on-year decrease in reports from people about other users allegedly abusing them on Twitter.  We have seen a 45% increase in the number of account suspensions for those who attempt to create new accounts following the suspension of their original accounts.  Over the first quarter of 2019, this amounted to more than 100,000 account suspensions for these reoffenders.  We are suspending three times more abusive accounts within 24 hours of a report and are taking two and a half times more private information down, with a new, easier reporting process.  <\/p><p> We have always provided an appeals mechanism for individuals who have had enforcement action taken against their accounts but earlier this year we launched a new feature that allows people to appeal within the Twitter app itself.  This change has meant that we have been able to respond to people 60% more quickly than we had previously.<\/p><p> We have well-established relationships with law enforcement agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have continuous global coverage to address reports from law enforcement around the world and have a dedicated online portal to swiftly handle requests from law enforcement.  We provide regular training on our policies and procedures and have publicly available guidelines for law enforcement on our website.  <\/p><p> The committee has asked for our recommendations on the proposed legislative changes.  It is important that legislation is as consistent as possible with existing legal frameworks to avoid uncertainties and discrepancies.  The effectiveness of any legislative solution relies on it being proportionate, technically feasible, and flexible, particularly given the diversity of companies within the digital ecosystem.  In this context, the committee will need to consider and assess how different legal and illegal harms manifest themselves across different platforms and varied jurisdictions.<\/p><p> We all share the objective of protecting our systems of due process and our commitment to freedom of expression.  Preserving these tenets in regulatory proposals can be achieved by collectively ensuring there is clarity on the obligations of all stakeholders, thereby avoiding an outcome whereby companies could overreach or erroneously remove content that should otherwise be kept online.  A clearly defined scope in that regard will assist Twitter and, I imagine, others.<\/p><p> In order to ensure people can continue to express themselves freely and safely on Twitter, we must continue investing further in our proactive technology and safety tools, as well as developing policies which keep pace with the changing contours of the public conversation we see on our service.  We stand ready to work with this committee as we continue to explore options to ensure that all people are protected from online harassment and harmful communications.  I thank members for their time.  We look forward to taking their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen White","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to contribute to the committee's deliberations on the topic of online harassment, harmful communications, and related offences.  I work with Google in Ireland as government affairs and public policy manager and am based in our EU headquarters here in Dublin.  Google supports all efforts by legislators and governments to engage with stakeholders in considering appropriate protections, remedies, and forms of redress for individuals who are the victims of online harm.  A range of governments, technology platforms and civil society groups are currently focused on how best to deal with illegal and problematic online content.<\/p><p>There is broad agreement on letting people create, communicate and find information online while preventing people from misusing content-sharing platforms like social networks and video sharing sites.  We recognise that there can be a troubling side of open platforms and that bad actors have exploited this openness.  We take the safety of our users very seriously, and we are committed to ensuring that inappropriate content that appears on our platforms is dealt with as quickly as possible.<\/p><p> Now 21 years old, Google has grown from a small start-up to a global company with legal obligations in each of the countries in which it operates.  We work hard to protect our platforms from abuse and have been working on this challenge for years, using both computer-science tools and human reviewers to identify and stop a range of online abuse, from get-rich-quick schemes to disinformation, to the utterly abhorrent, including child sexual abuse material online.  We respond promptly to valid notices of specific illegal content, and we prohibit other types of content on various different services.  A mix of people and technology helps us to identify inappropriate content and enforce our policies, and we continue to develop and invest in smart technology to detect problematic content hosted on our platforms.<\/p><p> As well as making significant investment in technology and human resources, we have engaged with policymakers in Ireland and around the world on the question of the appropriate oversight for online content-sharing platforms.  Google is supportive of carefully crafted and appropriately tailored regulation that continues to address the challenges of problematic content online.  We are keen to work constructively with legislators to build on the existing legal framework and to build trust and confidence in the systems and procedures that ensure online safety.<\/p><p> Having considered the committee's issues paper, our comments today are directed towards those aspects that concern the role of Internet service providers in preventing online harassment and certain harmful communications.  We have submitted a longer written statement which outlines all of these points in greater detail.  In this statement, we have also provide some comments on the approaches taken on this issue in other jurisdictions where Google operates and which were mentioned in the committee's issue paper.<\/p><p> In the statement, we suggest a number of central principles that should be considered for approaching oversight of content-sharing platforms and problematic content online.  These include clarity, suitability, transparency, flexibility, overall quality and co-operation.  I have set them out in more detail in the longer statement and can refer to them later if the committee wishes.<\/p><p> In framing any measures in this area, it is important for legislators to have regard to and build on the existing legal framework.  We operate in an environment where extensive regulation of online content and actions already exists and is being enforced.  Many laws, covering everything from consumer protection to defamation to privacy, already govern online content.  From consumer rights legislation to the new EU Audiovisual Media Services Directive, online behaviours come under the scope of a diverse and evolving set of legislation, multi-stakeholder initiatives and regulators.<\/p><p> Specifically relating to regulation of Internet service providers as a means of combating online abuse, the distinctive role played by Internet service providers is reflected in the EU legislation that underpins the regulation of electronic commerce in Europe.  The eCommerce directive provides strong incentives for service providers to establish and operate efficient notice and take-down procedures.  A service provider that does not operate such procedures will be exposed to potential legal liability for unlawful content hosted on its platform.  Many service providers, including Google, have developed extensive infrastructures which provide efficient tools for the reporting and removal of illegal content.<\/p><p> The eCommerce directive has the advantage of setting out different requirements for different types of Internet intermediaries, rather than being aimed at a particular business activity.  It has led to the growth of a wide variety of services and business models, and is flexible enough to cover the multiplicity of activities and content types online.  For example, an online news site can contain content authored by the news organisation, along with material licensed from third parties and also user-generated comments - the news site will be directly responsible for the editorial content it publishes but will have different legal responsibilities with respect to user comments that the website is hosting as an intermediary.  This online intermediary liability regime has fostered the huge economic and cultural benefits of the Internet while ensuring platforms are taking appropriate and speedy actions in removing unlawful content online.<\/p><p> In addition to legal regulations, Google has over the years developed extensive community guidelines and content policies that offer clear rules on what it does not allow on its platforms.  These often go above and beyond the law and we employ thousands of staff around the world, working 24 hours a day, to ensure violations are acted upon.  Companies have also worked together to address these challenges, for example, with the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, a coalition sharing information on curbing online terrorism.<\/p><p> We continue to improve on our processes and our technology to enforce these rules.  We continually review and update our policies based on new trends and invest in new machine learning, ML, technology to scale the efforts of our human moderators.<\/p><p> ML is helping us detect potentially violative content and surface it for human review.  For example, YouTube removed 9 million videos during the second quarter of 2019, 7.9 million of which were first flagged through our automated flagging system.<\/p><p>For example, YouTube removed 9 million videos during the second quarter of 2019, 7.9 million of which were first flagged through our automated flagging system.  Of those videos, 81.5% had no views at the time they were taken down.<\/p><p> We thank the committee for providing us with an opportunity to contribute to its deliberations on the topic of online harassment, harmful communications and related offences.  Addressing problematic content is a shared responsibility across society, in which companies, Governments, civil society, and users all have a role to play, and it is appropriate that this committee is hearing from a variety of voices on this topic.  We hope the committee will give our suggestions for approaching oversight of content-sharing platforms due consideration and look forward to further discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ryan Meade","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I call Ms Ana Niculescu, who is here on behalf of the Internet Service Providers Association Ireland, ISPAI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#N00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to address it.  ISPAI is a not-for-profit organisation and the legal entity delivering the <i>hotline.ie<\/i>service, which is the national reporting mechanism where the public can anonymously, securely and confidentially report suspected illegal content online.  <i>hotline.ie'<\/i>s remit is distinct and limited to combating online material which is simultaneously harmful and illegal, namely child pornography, also known as child sexual abuse material, CSAM.  The<i>hotline.ie<\/i>service has been effective in having CSAM swiftly removed from the Internet because it operates within a clearly defined legislative framework where the harm is clearly illegal.  Additionally, it is a transnational crime which allows for decisive international action when CSAM is hosted outside Ireland.  There is no burden of proof in respect of consent as engaging a child in sexual activities is prohibited under all circumstances and any presumed consent would be null and void.  When talking about CSAM, it is important to note that we are talking about materials showing the extreme abuse of children, the majority of them infants to 12 year olds.  For example, 84% of the material classified as child pornography from January 2017 to June 2019 showed children estimated to be four to 12, with 7% aged three and younger.<br\/><br\/><i>hotline.ie<\/i>has been working in an environment predominantly governed under the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998, amended by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017.  It is clear national legislation that comprehensively defines what would constitute child pornography and corresponding offences.<br\/><br\/>The broader context commonly referred to as industry self-regulation consists of, as a non-exhaustive list, the EU directive on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, which provides for an international framework.  The e-commerce directive is also transposed into Irish law and sets out the requirements and exemptions for intermediaries' liability for illegal content.  There is a national co-ordinated multi-stakeholder approach, where <i>hotline.ie<\/i>operations and procedures are agreed and overseen by the Department of Justice and Equality.  Since inception, we have been working in conjunction with national law enforcement and in co-operation with Internet companies operating in Ireland for the removal of CSAM from the Internet.  Our <i>hotline.ie<\/i>analysts are internationally trained by INHOPE and Interpol in content and age assessment.  There are national reporting mechanisms such as <i>hotline.ie<\/i>in more than 40 countries worldwide, coming together as the International Network of Internet Hotlines, INHOPE, allowing for international co-operation and co-ordination.  When child pornography is hosted in Ireland, we will issue a notice for takedown to the Internet service or content provider and will notify the paedophile investigation unit of the Garda National Protective Services Bureau.  In most cases, the notified material is removed from the Internet within 24 hours.  When CSAM is hosted outside Ireland, <i>hotline.ie<\/i>will still notify the paedophile investigation unit and thereafter the INHOPE member hotline in the relevant jurisdiction, so that CSAM may be swiftly removed at source.<br\/><br\/>INHOPE figures show that 64% of CSAM reported across different international jurisdictions in 2018 was removed within 72 hours.  As previously outlined, in Ireland, it is removed within 24 hours.  However, slower international removal times may be due to CSAM hosted in countries without a hotline presence, a lack of designated points of contact and streamlined notice for takedown process with Internet companies, or countries with inadequate or deficient legislation.<\/p><p>The self-regulatory model is effective in the circumstances in which<i>hotline.ie<\/i>operates and may be useful to look at as a reference point for other types of content but it would warrant further scoping.<br\/><br\/>For those who may not be aware, the <i>hotline.ie<\/i>service will be 50% co-funded by the European Union through the Connecting Europe Facility's safer Internet programme until June 2021.  The other 50% is co-funded by ISPAI member Internet companies, comprising Internet service providers, hosting providers, search engines and mobile and telecommunications operators.  <i>Hotline.ie<\/i>was established as one of the key recommendation of the Government's working group on the illegal and harmful use of the Internet in 1998.  It provides a free, secure and anonymous online reporting mechanism, content assessment expertise to ensure reported material is subject to objective evaluation in accordance with rigorous standards by reference to Irish law, a triage function through assessing public reports and notifying only content that is most likely illegal under Irish law, thereby reducing the burden that would otherwise be placed on law enforcement by, for example, assessing complaints that may not prove to reside in Ireland and operating the notice and takedown service, which is recognised worldwide as a vital and efficient tool in the removal of child sexual abuse material at source and which, in turn, reduces its availability on the Internet, disrupts the cycle of sexual exploitation and prevents further victimisation of children.  In my written statement I have provided statistics that are worth looking at.<br\/><br\/>I stress that we welcome the committee's engagement with a variety of experts and stakeholders and we are grateful for the opportunity to contribute to these discussions.  We are also supportive of the Government's attempts to address the spectrum of harms and that different harms may require different legislative and regulatory responses, with due account of the fact that the Internet is an ever-evolving, technically challenging and complex environment.  Superimposed on that is a continuum between offline and online behaviour that contributes to the complexity of developing effective responses and remedies.

It is open to legislators to decide to apply the same rules that publishers work under to the various online services.  This would need to be taken through to its conclusion.  What would it mean and what impact would that have on the operation of the open Internet?  We have developed our services on the basis that they are open and for everyone.  One of the great features of our services is that the same Gmail, drive or whatever service we offer is available anywhere in the world on the same basis.  That brings with it a huge volume of material.  On YouTube, for example, there are hundreds of hours of video material uploaded to our services every minute.  If we were to be considered publishers, each item would have to be reviewed before appearing on the platform.  It would be open to legislators to make that a requirement but it would fundamentally alter the availability of that service.  It is up to legislators to decide what the rules should be.  The point I would make, in common with the other members of the panel, is that legislators should also take account of what benefits the liability regime has provided.<\/p> <p>  Just because we do not consider it appropriate that the regulation should be the same for publishers as for the platforms, that does not mean the platforms cannot be regulated.  As I said in my opening statement, there are regulations that apply to platforms and it is obviously open to legislators to decide if they are appropriate, if they can be strengthened, changed and made more clear and whether we can get better outcomes for users.<\/p> <p>  I do not know if the Deputy and I will agree on the question of publishers versus platforms.  Perhaps we can agree, however, that just because we are not regulated in the same way as publishers and are not subject to exactly the same regime, that does not mean there is no ability for legislators to regulate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#T00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ryan Meade"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I ask our other guests to respond. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#T00200","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I ask for a response from Twitter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#T00300","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I appreciate that Internet services providers are in a slightly different position but I would like to hear from Twitter and Facebook.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#T00400","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":76,"content":"<p>We will ask Twitter to respond and will ask Ms White and Mr. Costello to reply, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#T00500","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the question.

By being deemed an intermediary, it escapes this consequence.  This is why, in my opinion, this is like the wild west of the 21st century.  There is a very interesting historical analogy.  In the United States at the start of the previous century, European copyright was not accepted.  This meant, in effect, that authors could not be paid.  The American Government and the publishers, some of which are now the biggest names in publishing in the entire world, did not accept European copyright.  The publishers made their money in that way.  When they got to a certain size, they of course turned around and said that they wanted copyright enforced and regulation.  It suits Internet companies to grow to a certain size and then look for a bit of regulation to prevent entry into the market.<\/p> <p>  There is one main stumbling block, if one takes an honest look at it.  This is the bit I can never quite get.  It reminds me of the chief executive of a cigarette company sitting before the US Senate and saying that smoking is not harmful.  The witnesses answered one of Deputy O'Callaghan's questions about whether their companies increased the proliferation of child pornography.  The honest answer to that is \"Yes\".  Whether the companies accept that they are individually responsible for that or that they should be legally responsible for it, the Internet did increase that proliferation.  There is no getting around that.  My point is that, by not being declared publishers, the companies avoid the liabilities with which almost everybody else has to deal.  I do not believe a decision in this regard should be made in Ireland alone.  It should be broader and decided at least at the level of the EU.  The traditional western countries need to operate together and to look at this issue.  There is a role for the Internet and for what the companies do, but there is also a role for regulation.<\/p> <p>  I will conclude with this because I am conscious of time.  There are two things that really changed my mind.  It is not so much about the area of pornography or anything like that.  There was one horrendous incident in Ireland involving Facebook, and I do not want to go into too much detail about it out of respect for the family involved, in which the public shared multiple images of an horrific incident.  There is no comeback for that family.  They cannot unsee it.  It does not matter that it was taken down in 24 hours, which in fairness it was.  People should not profit off that level of absolute horror being inflicted on someone.  The other issue, unfortunately, also involves Facebook.  Somebody went on a murder spree and, using the live-streaming facility Facebook developed to make further profits, live-streamed himself murdering people.  I cannot understand, from a moral perspective, how people are comfortable with defending themselves against liability for that.  That is my issue.  That is why I believe there should be a change.  Any of the witnesses are more than welcome to reply to me on those points, but that is where I will leave it for now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#U00100","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":93,"content":"<p>Would Facebook like to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#U00200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I will go first and then pass over to Ms Rush.

One of the points he made is that the heightened layer of responsibility arising from being a publisher would result in people queueing up at the door to take claims and so on.  As Mr. Meade mentioned earlier in respect of an obligation to preview, pre-screen or pre-moderate every single piece of content against all the laws in force anywhere in the world the content might be available or might be shared, regardless of the operational burden and cost, such an obligation would have a significant chilling effect.  Companies would be incentivised to take down anything that is remotely dubious or questionable from a legal perspective.  They would have to err on the side of removing everything, which could have a very detrimental effect on the availability of content.  It is just one perspective.  I absolutely appreciate all the other points the Deputy has raised, to which Mr. &Oacute; Broin has responded.  We are here because we accept and know that this is an opportunity to find a better way forward with regard to a future regulatory model which would learn from and build on other models and which would be conscious of EU developments and developments that have worked in other countries.

It allows the companies to exercise a degree of moderation and to impose their own standards with regard to what they will or will not allow on their platforms.  From our point of view, that has served the purpose of allowing us to keep our users safe on our platforms and to provide them with a more positive experience.  The Deputy's point is that is a form of editorial control which would lead to us being defined as publishers.

I have been working in this area for many years.  The role of content reviewers has really changed because of the evolving lead-in and the technological advances we have been able to make.  Some eight or nine years ago all the content reviewed by content reviewers would come from human reports, that is, people clicking on a piece of content and indicating that they did not like it because they thought it was hate speech or violence.  That would be reviewed manually.  The volume of content has increased.  Some forms of harm are particularly egregious and abhorrent.  All types of harmful content hold their own in some ways, but it is easier to develop the technology for areas like terrorism and child sexual exploitation imagery, CSEI, because they are very visual and clearcut.  Context does not really come into it.  That is different from a piece of hate speech, for example.  It is much harder to train classifiers or machine learning to tell if a hateful slur is being used in a derogatory way or in a comedic, satirical or self-referential way.  That is why the rates of AI detection are lower for bullying and those types of content.<\/p> <p>  To return to the previous point, it is increasingly the case that content reviewers are not just reviewing reports from human users.

Indeed, in January this year, we held a workshop in the office which was participated in by the council, the Commission and a range of non-governmental organisations, NGOs, from across Europe.  The purpose of that was to create a counter-speech campaign that would be rolled out across Europe and would reject hate speech and encourage people to take an alternative view.

If an account is suspected to be false, we will act on that and ensure either that the person verifies it or, if he or she is not who he or she claims, that it will be removed.  We also take strong measures against fake accounts that people try to establish on our platform.  In the first quarter of this year, we removed 2.2 billion accounts from our platform.

We carry out account verification in certain circumstances where we feel it is proportionate, for example, when we introduced new policies for election advertising for the European Parliament elections.  That involved a process of account verification so that anyone who wanted to advertise had to provide documents and so on.  The degree of data that was required to be collected in that process was quite significant. Our view is that it was proportionate to apply that in that case but perhaps not proportionate in every case.<\/p> <p>  In terms of a universal obligation, there are certainly countries in which we operate that require people to verify their account with us, using a government ID or some other form, in order to use our services.  There are certainly countries where that would exclude large numbers of people.  In particular, it would exclude people who were perhaps not as well got with the government as other parts, shall we say.  That is just the nature of them.  That may not necessarily apply here in Ireland but in many countries in which we operate.

I know that next week the committee will hear from civil liberty groups and so on and that is a really important question to tease out.

The witnesses emphasised that child sexual abuse material is clearly illegal and therefore the issue of consent does not apply.  I would like to tease out the issues of consent and freedom of expression and where the platforms stand in that respect and also how they deal with those issues.  We all regularly come across content online which is not considered appropriate or normal.  We do not know from looking at this content whether the people depicted in the images gave their consent.  A couple of decades ago, page 3 of many daily newspapers featured a picture of somebody wearing very little or no clothing.  That was considered normal at the time but it is no longer considered normal and these pictures no longer feature.  One of the reasons for this is that much of this material has moved onto the Internet.  The reality is that society has deemed it not to be appropriate.  If it is not appropriate in a newspaper, surely it is not appropriate in formats like the various Internet platforms.  I understand completely that what makes these platforms unique and what makes them work is freedom of expression and the ability to put something online immediately.  At the same time, there is an element of responsibility around this, including as regards consent.  I would like to get Ms Niculescu's views because we have not heard from her in regard to checking out that consent or whether consent is checked out regularly in respect of images other than child sexual material.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#QQ03600","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his question.

Twitter has a hateful conduct policy.  It outlines that it is against our rules to promote violence against, threaten or attack others on the basis of a range of protected categories such as gender and race.  Twitter's focus is on behaviour over content in particular.  It is much easier to identify certain types of abusive behaviours and scale that than solely looking at hate speech which is highly subjective and often context dependent.  Twitter is somewhat unique in that it is a public communications platform.  We are looking at behaviours of different types of accounts.  Our systems can proactively detect if, for instance, one account is @-mentioning another account repeatedly and that account does not follow them.  That might signal to us that someone is engaging in some level of abusive behaviour or if there is some sort of dog-piling with an attack on another account.  Sometimes we take a variety of these signals in combination to give us some indication that we need to review an account for hateful conduct or abusive behaviour.  I can assure the Deputy that our policies are applied consistently across the board.  When violations are found actions are taken.  There are various actions, which I outlined, that we can take beginning with the outright suspension of an account.  We have vastly improved the stopping of repeat offenders coming back to Twitter by setting up another account and leveraging our own technology; we are finding new ways to do that and to stop them coming back to Twitter to engage in the same behaviours.  There are those on our service who set up what we classify as sole purpose accounts where they engage in nothing more than abusing others.  That type of behaviour is reviewed against our policies and we take appropriate action.  There is a range of actions we can take.  We also introduced a change to our hateful conduct policy on dehumanisation.  Research shows that dehumanising language leads to offline violence.  We have made a change to our hateful conduct policy in regard to religious groups.

Young people in particular use many of the platforms.  We hear of young people who are self-harming, sometimes to the extent of suicide.

We often discover in the aftermath that various complaints were made but material was not removed from online in spite of people's requests.<\/p> <p>  The committee is undertaking work on the issue of spent convictions.  The people in question have moved on with their lives.  Someone in my area had mental health issues when young and got into trouble.  However, if one were to Google that person's name today, a media report would come up.  There was a request to have that search result taken down, but the response was that it was in the public interest to leave it even though it was hurtful and damaging to the individual in question.  Anyone looking at this logically would not see a public interest in the matter at all.<\/p> <p>  A large amount of work is to be done by all of the organisations before us if they are to gain people's confidence in these matters.

He was right to mention livestreaming as a category of content that needed special caution.  At YouTube, we have preliminary hurdles that people need to jump through before they get the ability to livestream.  For example, they need to have a certain number of followers and cannot be brand new.  They cannot just create an account and suddenly start livestreaming.  If there is a violation of our policies, their ability to livestream can be taken away.  We have taken the approach that livestreaming is something that needs special attention.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the types of livestreaming the Deputy mentioned, he may or may not be aware that we updated out policy on hate speech this year, which has resulted in violations by people who were livestreaming.  In one fairly high-profile case, we terminated that account.  The Deputy may have seen that there has been quite a reaction to that.  This shows that there has been progress in the development and implementation of our policy.  There is no question but that we will suspend accounts and remove people's opportunity to use these tools if they violate the policies.<\/p> <p>  The question on spent convictions is an interesting one, in that it cuts across privacy law.  The right to be forgotten was been established in European privacy law.  The practical implication of this is that platforms, including Google Search, must assess requests from users to delist information.  The information may still be out there on the Internet, but we must assess the request to delist it from our search engine.  The law also requires us to apply a balancing test.  As such, there has to be a consideration of whether other issues need to be taken into account.  Naturally, any decision we make on this basis is subject to dispute, in that people may say that we made the right or wrong decision.  In such cases, there is recourse to the Data Protection Commission, DPC, as the matter is handled under privacy law.  The individual in question can make a complaint to the DPC if he or she is not happy with our decision.  The law requires us to have a balancing test.  As Mr. &Oacute; Broin stated, private companies like us may not always be the right arena in which to make such decisions, but that is what is required of us under the law.  We need to consider requests as they come in, apply the test and make a determination on whether information should be delisted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#XX00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ryan Meade"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":492,"content":"<p>Perhaps the Twitter delegation will address the last question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#XX00300","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":493,"content":"<p>There are a variety of ways in which individuals who use our service can request that content be removed.

I am of the view that this acknowledgment is important, but the focus of our address is harmful online activity.  Although we are some steps away from producing our report and recommendations, I get the sense that there is a general unified opinion coming from all the members that the platform companies are facilitating significantly harmful postings, including criminal acts, that have given rise to serious injury and worse.  I hope our guests are equally committed to addressing and, where possible at all, eradicating that activity.<\/p><p> I wish to reflect on the contributions of those who appears before us last week.  They were very strong in their recommendations.  The committee is very mindful of the importance of working together.  The respective component parts of the industry must work with legislators to try to reach a better situation where safety is critical and most especially in respect of children, but where there is safety for all users if at all possible.<\/p><p> Some of our guests keep referring to rules.  There has been talk of Twitter rules and Facebook rules.  When the rules have been broken, the companies respond.  It is almost a competition from our perspective.  In terms of breaking the rules, in many of those instances and most certainly in the most serious of the cases that have been reported to us, we would like to see that people have broken the law.  It is not enough just to look at some as being inappropriate.  We would like to see some of the cases that have been reflected to us as involving illegality.<\/p><p> I am minded of the contribution last week of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.  I am very grateful to Mr. John Church, its chief executive.  I will just instance one of the cases that was brought to its attention.  A 16 year old girl told Childline that she had sent images to a former boyfriend, who then shared them with others without her permission.  With the images circulating widely, the girl told Childline she could not face going back to school and was contemplating suicide.  I do not expect a response on that today but, in the context of the exercise we have embarked on, we are very mindful of the harm, hurt and serious consequences involved and we want to try to find a means of address.  We have only the power of recommendation to the Minister and the Government, but we will not shirk in our responsibilities in outlining the strongest recommendations if we believe they are the most appropriate.<\/p><p> Professor Joe Carthy was mentioned.  He is the founding director of the UCD centre for cybersecurity.  He made an analogy with automobile legislation.  Every car has a number plate.  Every car is registered to someone.  He said while it is perfectly acceptable to use the Internet in any anonymous fashion, it is not acceptable to abuse, bully or libel others anonymously.  He said it is akin to allowing people to drive cars without number plates.<\/p><p>This is a key area in respect of which legislation could make a huge difference.  Professor Carthy believes that we should require social media platforms and online providers to register their users and that users should provide appropriate evidence of identity, and not just after the event or in following through when something outrageous has happened.  He stated that users who can show that they have been bullied, harassed or abused on a social media platform should be legally entitled to find out the identity of the user carrying out the inappropriate behaviour.  I would welcome a brief response to that.  I know that if Professor Carthy was here he would like to ask our guests about this matter.  I invite a response from Mr. &Oacute; Broin.

I am going to refer to a particular case of which I am aware, and to at least two Facebook pages that existed for a number of years.  I refer to the recent outrageous and dreadful attack on Kevin Lunney, a director of Quinn Industrial Holdings.  At least one of the Facebook pages in question referenced, by name, the senior executives of the company and allegations were made against them.  Other posts included mock-ups of posters calling individuals traitors and warning of consequences.  The intention in this regard was to misrepresent and label those executives.  Some of them were referenced on the page.  When I sat with these people, including Kevin Lunney, earlier this year, I was mindful that we were embarking on this particular exercise.  My question would have been put to our guests in any event, regardless of what happened to Kevin recently, which was an absolute disgrace.  My question is the same as it would have been if the attack had not taken place.  The executives in question made repeated requests of Facebook to remove the offensive material.  I understand that Facebook removed it he day after Kevin Lunney was kidnapped and attacked.  Facebook described is as a violation of authenticity guidelines.  I wonder how our guests will explain the meaning of the latter.  In any event, it was action after the event.  It was much too late.  The material was hugely offensive.  It was intended to harm the good name and reputation of the people involved and, as a Deputy representing the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, I believe it fed into a view that in some way those people, the named parties, and the businesses they were involved in, were a legitimate target for the worst excesses of what I can only describe as the most ill-informed people on this island.  How does Facebook respond to the example I have cited?  I would have raised it with Facebook even if the attack had not taken place because the pages should have been removed.  The vile content and its intent and purpose is an affront to any and every one of us.

The issue of targeted harassment is one I hope to return to in a moment, specifically in conversation with the representatives from Twitter.  It is notable that in its testimony today, Facebook has told us it is not confident there is any lawful weight to its guidelines.  Twitter, with regard to the Ryan case specifically, said that if there had been any legal action, it would have co-operated in the case.  Even in the representatives' own words, they are strongly making the case not only regarding legislation on hate speech but also regarding legislation on online regulation.  Representatives from both Facebook and Twitter pointed out that they would have moved further if required to by law.  This underscores the need for legislation in this area and the fact that self-regulation clearly has its limits.  Community standards have little concrete weight when it comes to persons' lives and persons who may be the subject of online abuse, regardless of whether they choose to be part of the online community.  That is important because the duty of protection is not simply to users but to all citizens.  That is a wider concern.  The duty of protection also extends to those who may not be citizens but who are resident in our country.<\/p> <p>  Let me point to an issue raised by Deputy Brophy.  Follow-up information and granular detail may be required.  Deputy Brophy asked about the resources and number of staff allocated for taking down offensive or harmful content.  I would like a breakdown also on the resources devoted to brand protection.  All the organisations represented today have a large number of staff working on brand protection, for example, to ensure their advertisers' branding is not being misused.  I am aware there are those whose work is dedicated specifically to targeting and watching out for issues that may be of concern to advertisers.  I do not know the extent to which those issues, in terms of brand protection removals, are subject to notification requirements.  Are there staff permanently allocated to deal with these issues?

It has been pointed out time and again that the e-commerce directive is wildly out of date.  In many cases, individuals are not in a position to notify because they may not be aware of the offensive or harmful content related to them.  I want to focus a little on the facilities associated with the targeting of information.  If I do not see abusive content about me, I am not in a position to notify the relevant organisation about it.  This leads to the question of the targeting of information.<\/p><p> Twitter has a policy whereby it can block content but it tries to support a person's experience on the site.  I may not be simply concerned about my experience on the site but about abusive content about me.  As I understand it, Twitter changed its rules, and perhaps there has been a further change, whereby if I block somebody and assume that person no longer has access to my information, that person can still see me and speak about me but I do not see what he or she is saying.  That change in the blocking provision is a very serious concern and relates to stalking, harassment and so forth.  It is not just my experience but misinformation.<\/p><p> Ms White indicated that Twitter never automatically suspends accounts.  I have spoken to people who have been the subject of very targeted campaigns of harassment and a person who has been suspended as a consequence immediately created a new account and resumed the harassment.  This is a real concern.  When the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, RCNI, spoke to this committee it emphasised that this should not apply only to repeated activity but a single incident should be enough.  Stalking is one of the concerns that may be included in this Bill.  Someone can repeatedly re-register on new accounts but Twitter will wait until that person does something offensive or dangerous.  That approach creates a very chilling fear for a person.  I will not bring the people involved into committee testimony but I know there are people who have been repeatedly targeted by accounts which effectively threatened them and when those accounts were suspended a new one immediately appeared.  How can Twitter improve its blocking mechanisms to address those concerns? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#CCC00700","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":528,"content":"<p>The Senator raised several issues and I will do my best to address them as quickly as I can.  She mentioned a strong emphasis on notification.  I have tried to communicate to the committee this morning that we are trying to reduce the burden on victims having to report to Twitter.  People absolutely need a mechanism to get in touch with Twitter to tell us if they have been subjected to certain types of behaviour.  In response to the Senator's point that if someone cannot see something, that person cannot notify us, we made a change some years ago to allow bystander reporting.  If a person sees something online, it goes back to the \"see something, say something\" principle.  If people see someone being bullied in the playground, they should say something to the teacher.  The same principles apply online.  We allow bystander reporting. <\/p> <p>  In addition, I have highlighted that 30% of the action that we take on content deemed to be abusive behaviour is taken proactively.  That is without any reports; it is content that Twitter has surfaced for human review.  We hope that figure will increase so that we can further reduce the burden on victims having to report content to us.<\/p> <p>  We had a problem with repeat offenders at Twitter.  It was a bit like playing whack-a-mole in that we would suspend an account and another account would be opened.  We did significant work with our trust and safety council which advised us of the need to remedy this situation.  We have stopped repeat offending by more than 100,000 accounts over the past year.<\/p><p>Our actions are having real results.  I do not mean to imply that we have fixed the problem in its totality but we are slowing it down.  Our actions are stopping repeat offenders opening new accounts or engaging in multiple account abuse, where one individual has multiple accounts with the sole intention of abusing others on the service.  We rely on behaviour base signals.  There are several signals that may not be visible to individuals who use our service or to the public at large but they are behind the scenes, such as whether an email address has been verified or whether an account is mentioning other accounts in large volumes.  That would give the impression to us that an account is potentially violating rules on behaviour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#DDD00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen White","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":530,"content":"<p>That seems slightly at odds with the comments on suspending and hoping that people learn from their experience and change earlier because it seems Ms White is saying Twitter will block repeat accounts as soon as they appear if somebody is suspended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#EEE00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570575600,"counter":531,"content":"<p>Yes.

The appendix to Facebook's presentation was optimistic when it suggested an amendment to the Bill which provided that communication does not include provision of information society services.  I hope and expect that would be roundly rejected because it is a very ambitious attempt by Facebook to remove itself from its responsibilities.  There are questions about what a platform and publication are, which need to be teased out but there is a communication function and communication is taking place.  That was acknowledged elsewhere.  This is not a neutral platform for freedom of expression.  It is a commercial platform in which certain particular messages can be promoted, highlighted and amplified.  It is not a neutral <i>tabula rasa<\/i>where people place their tuppence worth.  What steps does Twitter believe need to be taken to change its financial model?

The debate will be on how to get international collaboration in the regulation and governance of platforms and will also address harmful speech versus free speech and how to protect both.  I am very hopeful that all of the three companies here will send representatives.  Parliamentarians from all over the world will attend as will leading thinkers on the subject.  The day before we will have a non-governmental organisation, NGO, event in the Westin Hotel and extend an invitation to the members of this committee.  The Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment will work in collaboration with this committee on this very critical issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100900002#GGG02200","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1570575600,"counter":576,"content":"<p>The Joint Committee on Justice and Equality does not charge for advertising unlike our guests.<\/p> <p>  I thank Deputy Eamon Ryan, Senator Alice-Mary Higgins and Deputy Martin Kenny for being here at the end.  I thank each company for their opening statements and participation.  I shall seize on the word \"collaboration\" and say that I hope that this will not be the last time that we will engage or that the companies will engage, more importantly, with the representatives of these Houses and Government.  We have already outlined the objectives of this committee, in setting out on this course of hearings, to the companies.<\/p><p>I believe this is a journey on which we can travel together.
