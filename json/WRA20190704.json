This will bring significant benefits including in areas such as e-Health, e-Education, smart farming, regional development and tourism. <\/p>  <p>  The NBP aims to ensure that every home, school and business in Ireland has access to high speed broadband. I recently brought a recommendation to Government to confer Preferred Bidder status on Granahan McCourt, the remaining bidder in the NBP procurement process and Government agreed to this. <\/p>  <p>  The Government decision of 7 May 2019 means that it is intended to award the State Intervention contract to the Preferred Bidder. This award is subject to contract close, including finalisation of financial and legal documents. Deployment of the NBP State Intervention network will commence shortly after that. <\/p>  <p>  This plan will ensure that rural Ireland will have the same opportunities as urban Ireland. Digital participation helps small and medium businesses to compete successfully on a global scale, accessing more customers and enabling businesses to streamline their efficiencies to provide for cloud computing, back-up and recovery and e-commerce services. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the provision of high speed broadband in rural Ireland is of critical importance in areas such as flexible and remote working. Remote or home-working is becoming an increasingly prevalent employment model, including amongst overseas firms that continue to invest in Ireland. This area of the economy is projected to double over the next 5 years. It will also afford national and international employers better access to a wider catchment of skilled workers, even where offices and businesses are located within more rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  The efficient and timely provision of a high speed broadband network across Ireland will also enable agricultural businesses to move into smarter farming which will increase output while reducing administrative costs. Smart farming can improve Ireland's competitiveness on the international scale through efficiencies delivered via remote monitoring of livestock, increased crop output, data driven crop and herd management and enabling quality software that supports efficient farm management and profitability.<\/p>  <p>  The National Broadband Plan highlights the importance of remote working opportunities to regenerate, revitalise and re-establish regional and rural Ireland as an attractive place to live and work. In turn this will help bridge the rural\\urban divide and create equality of employment opportunity across Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400053#WRA04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Incentives","counter":59,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400053#WRA04250"},{"type":"question","counter":60,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[28580\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400053#WRA04300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the extent to which it can be illustrated that the replacement of a specific amount of fossil fuel generated electricity with renewable energy can demonstrate a reduction in carbon emissions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":61,"content":"<p>Thirty per cent of electricity was produced from renewable sources in 2017 with a target of reaching 40% by 2020.

The plan sets out, for the first time, how Ireland can reach its 2030 targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and also put Ireland on the right trajectory towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. We have a great window of opportunity to reverse this trend and secure a healthy more resilient future for the country, It means changing the way we heat our homes, the way we travel and the way we power the country.<\/p>  <p>  The step-up in ambition in each of the sectors covered by the plan will require investment across the entire economy. Overall, through the mix of technologies and measures identified, the plan sets out the pathway that represents the least-cost burden to the economy as a whole. <\/p>  <p>  A significant portion of the technologies and measures set out in the plan will result also in net lifetime cost savings to the economy as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of costs to the Exchequer and other public funding, the plan will be funded through Project Ireland 2040 which provides &euro;30 billion for low carbon and sustainable mobility investments in the period to 2027.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the actions in the plan do not require public funding. The actions contained in this plan fall broadly into four categories:<\/p>  <p>  - public funding provided in the annual estimates process and in Project Ireland 2040 <\/p>  <p>  - measures such as setting a long-term trajectory for the carbon tax, in order to change long-term behaviour and decisions to encourage investment in more sustainable choices<\/p>  <p>  - new regulations to end certain practices (e.g. phasing out oil and gas boilers in homes or introducing low emission zones in cities) <\/p>  <p>  - actions to promote public and community engagement and participation in reducing our emissions.<\/p>  <p>  For the first time, a decarbonisation target has been set for each sector. Each Government Department must now determine the optimum approach to utilising the funding available to it to support the policies necessary to meet the targets proposed for each sector. The exact costs will be determined from the detailed policy design work which will consist of a mix of regulations, taxes, and subsidies which the Government may choose to deploy to achieve the target abatement range in each sector.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that there would also be a very significant cost to the Exchequer for not implementing any policies to achieve compliance with our 2030 targets, which would also lock Ireland into a high carbon trajectory that would be unsustainable in the long-run.<\/p>  <p>  Failure to implement these policies to meet our legally binding EU targets could result in a cost to the Exchequer of up to &euro;1.75 billion over the next decade as well as locking Ireland into a future high carbon trajectory.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the costs of purchasing carbon credits for compliance with Ireland&rsquo;s emissions targets for the period 2013 to 2020 under the 2009 Effort Sharing Decision 406\/2009\/EC (ESD), my Department currently estimates the additional costs to be in the region of &euro;6m to &euro;13m, depending on the price and final quantity of allowances required.

However, in the event that all three of the electricity generating plants referred to co-fire peat with biomass, it is unlikely that there will be sufficient amounts of indigenous biomass to meet the demand. In addition to the three power stations, there is demand for biomass for use in industry and in residential heating, and the Government&rsquo;s Support Scheme for Renewable Heat will also create a demand for biomass supplies in the coming years. Therefore international sources of biomass will be required. <\/p>  <p>  Use of appropriate sustainability criteria will help to ensure that use of biomass does not have a detrimental effect on the world&rsquo;s forests. EU-wide sustainability criteria have been introduced in the revised Renewable Energy Directive, which includes provisions to ensure that energy biomass will be required to emit significantly less carbon than the fossil fuel equivalent. This Directive excludes certain types of biomass from contributing to a member state&rsquo;s renewable energy performance such as biomass from areas of high biodiversity, areas designated for nature protection purposes and areas designated for protection of rare, threatened or endangered ecosystems or species. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, I am advised Bord na Mona sources sustainable biomass used at the Edenderry station, based on a set of sustainability principles, aligned to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400054#WRB02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":123,"content":"<p>Question No. 52 answered with Question No. 42.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":124,"content":"<p>Question No. 53 answered with Question No. 40.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Internet Safety","counter":125,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400054#WRB02850"},{"type":"question","counter":126,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[28529\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400054#WRB02900","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his views on the ease of access to pornography for children online; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1274","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":127,"content":"<p>Children's access to online pornography is a matter of serious concern, even where that content is not illegal.

Representatives of civil society, such as the organisation to which the Deputy refers, may attend meetings of the UNFCCC as observers to the negotiation process. While I have not engaged directly with this particular organisation, Ireland&rsquo;s delegation to the UNFCCC regularly meets representatives of civil society, in particular organisations from Ireland, that attend the annual Conference of the Parties. <\/p>  <p>  I note that the report, published by the organisation referred to, shares the conclusions of the IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5\u2070C, published in October 2018, on the urgency of ambitious action to tackle the challenges of climate change. Addressing climate change, whether through decarbonisation of our economy, or preparing to adapt to the impacts of climate change such as through low-risk land-sector approaches as highlighted in the report, is one of the most significant challenges of this century. The IPCC, through its reports, has confirmed the absolute urgency of achieving deep cuts in our greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades.<\/p>  <p>  I recently published the Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan 2019, which puts Ireland on a trajectory to meet our 2030 target for greenhouse gas emissions, and puts us on a pathway to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Plan reaffirms Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to becoming a leader in responding to climate change and to supporting increased climate ambition at national, EU and international levels.<\/p>  <p>  As land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) emissions will be integrated into the EU framework for compliance with national emissions targets from 2021, it is essential that Ireland has robust policies in place to manage emissions and enhance removals from relevant LULUCF sectoral categories. The Climate Action Plan, therefore, includes 34 individual actions to facilitate the development and implementation of policies to manage emissions and enhance removals from the Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use sectors. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s new policy for international development, &lsquo;A Better World&rsquo;, which was published earlier this year by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, also includes climate action as a core priority. By supporting solutions for those most affected by climate change, the new policy will seek to ensure the Ireland continues to champion the needs of those most vulnerable to climate change, especially those in the least developed and small islands states.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400054#WRB03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Climate Change Policy","counter":132,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400054#WRB03350"},{"type":"question","counter":133,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[28559\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400054#WRB03400","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the way in which the Climate Action Plan 2019 will maintain a green image of agriculture here while meeting the national policy objective of carbon neutrality; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1273","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":134,"content":"<p>The Climate Action Plan identifies the long-term challenge for the agriculture sector to meet the national policy objective, set out in the 2014 National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development, of an approach to carbon neutrality which does not compromise our capacity for sustainable food production.<\/p>  <p>  The Plan notes that achieving this objective will involve greenhouse gas emissions reductions, but also increased emissions removals. Given the contribution of agriculture to overall national greenhouse gas emissions, achieving this objective will be a significant challenge facing Irish agriculture over the coming decades. In this context, the Plan separately commits to evaluating the changes which would be necessary in Ireland to achieve a net zero emissions target by 2050.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the period to 2030, the Plan commits the sector to delivering 16.5 - 18.5 Mt CO2 eq. cumulative abatement from agriculture as well as achieving 26.8 Mt CO2 eq abatement through Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry Actions over the period 2021 to 2030. To achieve these targets, the Plan sets out a range of actions to reduce emissions on farms, promote afforestation and diversification of land use, develop opportunities in the bio-economy and in the supply of substitutes for fossil fuels, promote better management of peatlands and soils, and develop clusters of best practice.<\/p>  <p>  Implementation of these actions will, collectively, help to further underpin the environmental credentials of the Irish agriculture sector and better position it to meet the evolving expectations of both domestic and international markets.

I believe that a strong and stable democracy cannot flourish without full respect for fundamental rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of assembly, association and expression. Ireland actively works to promote and protect the right to these freedoms in the relevant international fora. <\/p>  <p>  At the 41st session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, which is currently ongoing in Geneva, the EU issued a statement on Human Rights situations that require the Council's attention. Among other issues, the statement refers to the situation in Egypt, recalling the importance of the respect of freedom of expression, media, assembly and association and the need to stop unduly restricting space for civil society, including through arrests and long periods of pre-trial detention.<\/p>  <p>  The EU and Egypt adopted partnership priorities for 2017-2020 at the EU-Egypt Association Council, which took place in July 2017. The priorities make it clear that human rights &ndash; civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, as set out in international human rights law, the Treaty on European Union and the Egyptian Constitution &ndash; are a common value and constitute the cornerstone of a modern democratic state. These agreed priorities commit Egypt and the EU to promoting democracy, fundamental freedoms and human rights as constitutional rights of all citizens, in line with their international obligations.<\/p>  <p>  During the seventh EU-Egypt Association Council in December 2018, which is the forum for formal EU-Egypt political dialogue, the EU expressed concern about efforts in Egypt to limit freedom of expression and opinion, including through the arrest and sentencing of journalists and bloggers on anti-state charges. The EU also called on Egypt to adhere to its commitments to promote and protect the freedoms of expression, association and assembly, as well as the freedom of the press and access to information, as guaranteed by the 2014 Constitution and according to Egypt's international obligations. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland conveys these messages to Egypt on a regular basis at political and official levels, including most recently at a meeting between the Egyptian Embassy and the Human Rights Unit in my Department in June. I also discussed human rights with my Egyptian counterpart during his visit to Ireland in February.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400055#WRC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Peace Process","counter":166,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400055#WRC01700"},{"type":"question","counter":167,"qnumday":68,"qnumall":"[28804\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400055#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on the recently published Kushner plan for the Middle East; his views on the reaction to same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":168,"content":"<p>The United States introduced the economic element of their long awaited plan for the Middle East Peace Process, entitled Peace to Prosperity, at a meeting which took place in Bahrain on 25-26 June. The published document sets out a range of possibilities for economic revitalisation and growth for Palestinians and the neighbouring countries, which could be achieved if the parties can agree a settlement of the conflict, and large scale international investment can be attracted to the region. Part of the purpose of the workshop, which was aimed primarily at Gulf Arab states, was to introduce the plan to such possible donors or investors.\u00a0Ireland was not represented at the meeting.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  This document covered economic issues only, and does not address the political questions, which are at the core of the search for peace in the Middle East. I understand that the US team continues to work on those elements. <\/p>  <p>  I have always been clear in my view that an economic element can help support a well-thought out political solution, by setting out a vision of a post conflict situation in which all are winners. But as I have stated consistently, it is not possible to solve political problems by economic means alone. Support to the Palestinian people is, of course, always important and welcome. However, any potential investor or donor, public or private, will be very conscious that the main impediment to economic development for Palestinians, and the reason for the severe contraction of the Palestinian economy over the last two decades, is the web of restrictions due to the Israeli occupation. It is thus very difficult to discuss economic possibilities separate from the political context.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The EU has encouraged the US in its efforts to develop a peace plan, and Ireland has done this in all our contacts with the US Middle East team. It is my strong view that any plan must address the needs of both sides if it is to be successful. Preparing the ground can also be crucial to winning a considered hearing for any plan, and improved dialogue between the US team and Palestinian community and its leadership will be important in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400055#WRC01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Agreements","counter":169,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400055#WRC02000"},{"type":"question","counter":170,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[28829\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400055#WRC02100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the expected ratification process for the Mercosur trade agreement; and if D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and other national parliaments will need to ratify the agreement.","asker":"1225","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":171,"content":"<p>The trade agreement reached last week is part of a comprehensive new Association Agreement under negotiation between the EU and Mercosur countries (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay).

In this regard, the euro area flash headline inflation rate in June was stable at 1.2 per cent. The ECB projects that inflation will remain below target across the forecast horizon, reaching 1.6 per cent in 2021. <\/p><p>Quantitative easing (QE) refers to the large-scale asset purchases conducted by the European Central Bank (ECB) in order to combat persistently low inflation. The ECB&rsquo;s Asset Purchase Programme (APP) and other monetary policy measures made a substantial contribution to the economic recovery in the euro area and Ireland. As a small and highly open member of the monetary union, disentangling the exact effect of the asset purchase program on Irish GDP is difficult. However, euro area estimates suggest that, on the whole, non-standard monetary policy measures including the asset purchase program, Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTROs) and others, will increase real GDP by approximately 1.9 percentage points cumulatively between 2016 and 2020, with the strongest impact occurring in 2016 and 2017.Any increase in euro area real GDP growth in aggregate also has a strong second round impact on Ireland, by increasing foreign demand from Ireland&rsquo;s trading partners. <\/p><p>Overall, economic evidence generally points to QE as having had positive effects on the European economy, contributing to lowering sovereign debt yields and providing a small boost to bank lending, investment, real GDP, headline inflation, and medium-term inflationary expectations. The Irish economy has benefited in particular via a reduction in sovereign borrowing costs, additional liquidity in the banking sector, and an improvement in economic activity in key export markets. <\/p><p>Research by the Central Bank[2] has also shown that the announcement effect of the APP caused a compression of Irish bond yields. Over the course of the APP, the average yield on Irish sovereign bonds decreased, despite increased issuance and a longer maturity profile of outstanding debt, which demonstrates that the APP had a favourable impact on the cost of servicing Irish debt. The decrease in sovereign yields passed through into lower bank funding costs and ultimately to more favourable financing conditions to households and firms. <\/p><p>My Department will continue to monitor monetary policy developments, including with respect to growth and inflation in the euro area, and advise accordingly. While it is not possible to predict the future path of ECB monetary policy or interest rates, guidance from the ECB suggests that monetary policy is likely to remain accommodative for some time yet. I am aware of the ECB President Mario Draghi&rsquo;s recent speech (18<sup>th<\/sup>June) on twenty years of the ECB&rsquo;s monetary policy, where he referred to the current economic outlook and downside risks facing the European economy.  President Draghi noted that in the absence of a return of inflation to the ECB&rsquo;s target additional stimulus will be required. Furthermore, in the coming weeks, the ECB Governing Council will consider how the instruments at their disposal can be adapted commensurate to the severity of the risk to price stability.<\/p><p>Hammermann, Felix &amp;amp; Leonard, Kieran &amp;amp; Nardelli, Stefano &amp;amp; von Landesberger, Julian, 2019. &quot;Taking stock of the Eurosystem&rsquo;s asset purchase programme after the end of net asset purchases,&quot; Economic Bulletin Articles, European Central Bank, vol. 2. &amp;lt;&amp;gt;<\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400056#WRD02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Small and Medium Enterprises Supports","counter":231,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400056#WRD02900"},{"type":"question","counter":232,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[28791\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400056#WRD03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated full year cost of removing the restriction for the key employee engagement programme, KEEP, on employees to work in a single company in a group in order to enable them to work in the companies within a group structure; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":233,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[28792\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400056#WRD03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated full year cost of removing the requirement for an employee to work full-time in a company for the key employee engagement programme, KEEP; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":234,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[28793\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400056#WRD03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated full year cost of removing the requirement for the key employee engagement programme, KEEP, that all shares in a company must be new shares; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":235,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[28794\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400056#WRD03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the cost of the key employee engagement programme, KEEP, in 2018; the number of persons that availed of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":236,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[28795\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400056#WRD03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated full year cost of removing the restriction to 50% of the employee&rsquo;s annual emoluments for the key employee engagement programme, KEEP; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":237,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[28796\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400056#WRD03500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated full year cost of increasing the &euro;3 million share option market value restriction to &euro;6, &euro;12 and &euro;24 million, respectively and removing it altogether in relation to the key employee engagement programme, KEEP; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":238,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 to 100, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The Key Employee Engagement Programme (KEEP) came into effect on 1 January 2018. The aim of the incentive is to support SMEs in Ireland in competing with larger enterprises to recruit and retain key employees, by way of a targeted share option programme. <\/p>  <p>  KEEP provides for an exemption from income tax, USC and PRSI on any gain realised on the exercise of a qualifying share option.  With limited exceptions, a key employee must hold the option for twelve months prior to exercise. However, it is likely that employees may hold the KEEP share options for a number of years before exercise, as the options must be granted at not less than market value on the date of grant, so a benefit will only arise to the employee if the shares increase in value from that date. Where share options are exercised, and the shares are subsequently sold, such individuals will be subject to Capital Gains Tax on the disposal of the shares.<\/p>  <p>  As KEEP is a demand-led scheme, uptake will depend on the decisions made by qualifying SME companies with regard to the offering of share options to employees, and also on the growth in value of the employer company shares in the period between grant and exercise of the options.  The uptake of KEEP thus far has been limited. Given the longer-term nature of the incentive, Revenue has, as yet, relatively little information on which to estimate the cost and other consequences of possible changes.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that, as there is no information available on the potential increased uptake of KEEP if employees were allowed to work in multiple companies within a group structure, or if the shares were not restricted to new shares, there is no underlying data on which to estimate a cost of removing such restrictions. Under KEEP, only full-time employees or directors who are required to work at least 30 hours per week with a company are eligible to participate. <\/p>  <p>  I am also advised by Revenue that there is no information on the potential increased uptake of the programme if the requirement in respect of being a full-time employee was removed.  As such, there is no underlying data on which to estimate the cost of such a change.<\/p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that some 10 companies granted qualifying share options to 87 key employees during 2018 (the first year of the scheme). As no exercises occurred in 2018, there is no cost to the exchequer for 2018 in terms of income tax, USC and PRSI.  Returns for 2019, which will contain details of all options granted and exercised during 2019, will not be filed with Revenue until 31 March 2020. <\/p>  <p>  With a view to enhancing the attractiveness of the scheme, Finance Act 2018 amended the restriction applying to the total market value of shares which can be granted by the qualifying company to a qualifying employee, by increasing the limit from 50% of salary to 100% of salary (i.e. that participants may now receive of equal values of shares and salary).  This required state aid approval from the European Commission, which has recently been granted, and I expect to commence this change shortly. Revenue advise me that there is no underlying data on which to estimate the cost of this change. <\/p>  <p>  Currently, the total market value of the issued but unexercised qualifying share option a company may grant cannot exceed &euro;3 million.  Revenue advise me that it is not possible to estimate the number of companies who might exceed the &euro;6 million, &euro;12 million or &euro;24 million thresholds outlined by the Deputy and thus benefit from raising this restriction or removing it.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, and as the Deputy may be aware, my Department recently carried out a public consultation process in relation to KEEP and other tax incentives targeted at the SME sector with a view to identifying possible enhancements that might be made to the scheme to make it more efficient and effective. The intention is that issues raised by stakeholders during the consultation will be analysed and proposals will be submitted to me for consideration in the context of this year's Finance Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400056#WRD03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabled Drivers and Passengers Scheme","counter":239,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400056#WRD04200"},{"type":"question","counter":240,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[28824\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400056#WRD04300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will act on comments made by the Ombudsman (details supplied) and also communicated directly to him by the Ombudsman; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":241,"content":"<p>The Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme provides relief from VAT and VRT (up to a certain limit) on the purchase of an adapted car for transport of a person with specific severe and permanent physical disabilities, payment of a Fuel Grant, and an exemption from Motor Tax. <\/p><p>To qualify for the Scheme an applicant must be in possession of a Primary Medical Certificate.

The purpose of the SBCI is to deliver effective financial supports to Irish SMEs, address gaps and potential failures in the Irish SME finance market, as well as encouraging competition and innovation, and facilitating the efficient and effective use of EU resources and financial instruments. The SBCI achieves this through the provision of low cost liquidity and risk-sharing guarantee activities that support the provision of appropriately priced, flexible funding to Irish SMEs.  <\/p><p>Instead of lending directly to SMEs, the SBCI operates through partner finance providers, known as on-lenders. The SBCI has provided funding to a mixture of both banks and non-bank finance providers and currently has 6 on-lenders, 3 bank and 3 non-bank finance providers: AIB, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank, Finance Ireland Limited, Bibby Financial Services Ireland, and FEXCO Asset Finance.  <\/p><p>The SBCI&rsquo;s priority is meeting the credit needs of SMEs not currently being fully met by the private sector. Consequently, the SBCI&rsquo;s lending to SMEs is largely driven by market demands. Figures provided by the SBCI to my Department show that, since the SBCI began its activities in March 2015, to the end of December 2018, the total amount of SBCI supported lending activity, through the provision of liquidity, was &euro;900 million to 21,783 Irish SMEs supporting 141,658 jobs. Under the SBCI&rsquo;s risk sharing schemes, &euro;152 million has been drawn down by 4,278 SMEs, this has supported 6,572 jobs.

The strategy for the South Eastern Region provides the opportunity for the priorities of Waterford, for example the priorities included in the existing County Development Plan, to be integrated into a regional investment plan which is expected to be a major driver of the implementation of the NPF.<\/p>  <p>  A regional report on the South-East has been published on the Project Ireland 2040 website.  The report details the specific regional projects and programmes which are being planned and delivered in the South-East as part of the public investment detailed in Project Ireland 2040, the Government&rsquo;s National Planning Framework and National Development Plan. <\/p>  <p>  I might also add that my Department publishes a major capital projects tracker, which sets out details of the key projects and programmes being implemented under the NDP, including the location of the projects where possible.  The Tracker includes a number of major projects directly related to Waterford.  The tracker currently focuses on projects and programmes with costs greater than &euro;20 million.  While it does not provide an exhaustive list of all capital expenditure, the list of projects serves to highlight the diverse range of infrastructural demands competing for the resources of the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400057#WRE04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Transport","counter":287,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400057#WRE04500"},{"type":"question","counter":288,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[28717\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400057#WRE04600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the model of the car or cars used by him in the performance of his official duties; and if it is a diesel, petrol or electric engine.","asker":"1311","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":289,"content":"<p>The car used for official duties is a Skoda Superb with a diesel engine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400057#WRE04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Procurement Contracts","counter":290,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400057#WRE04800"},{"type":"question","counter":291,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[28832\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400057#WRE04900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans to increase the threshold over which all public tenders have to go on e-tenders; his further plans to increase the level allowed for local tendering to facilitate the possibility of small local companies getting more contracts in order to sustain local small businesses nationally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":292,"content":"<p>Public Procurement is governed by WTO, EU and National rules and guidelines. The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.  <\/p>  <p>  WTO rules and EU Directives on public procurement require that public works, supplies and service contracts above certain thresholds must be advertised on the Official Journal of the EU and awarded on the basis of objective and non-restrictive criteria. For works contracts, the threshold is &euro;5,548,000; for supplies and service contracts awarded by Government Departments, the threshold is &euro;144,000 and for the remainder of public bodies, the threshold is &euro;221,000. The threshold for supplies and service contracts of entities operating in utility sectors (water, energy, transport and postal) is &euro;443,000.  For contracts below these thresholds, the general requirement is that they be advertised on the national public procurement website www.etenders.gov.ie or, depending on value, awarded on the basis of a competitive process of direct invitation to an adequate number of suitable suppliers.   <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Deputy will be aware that the Office of Government Procurement developed Circular 10\/14 which is aimed at facilitating small and medium-sized enterprises in competing for public procurement opportunities. In this regard, the following national rules apply to below EU threshold procurements:<\/p>  <p>  - All public contracts for supplies and services with an estimated value of &euro;25,000 (exclusive of VAT) and upwards should be advertised on the national public procurement website, www.etenders.gov.ie.       <\/p>  <p>  - The advertising threshold for works is set at &euro;50,000 (exclusive of VAT).  <\/p>  <p>  - Suppliers of goods and services and especially the SME sector are encouraged to register on the e-Tenders website and avail of its facilities including receiving automatic alerts in relation to future tendering opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that these thresholds were reviewed last year in consultation with the SME Advisory Group, chaired by my colleague, Minister of State O'Donovan, which is comprised of representatives from IBEC, SFA, CIF, ISME and Chambers Ireland and it was recommended that the national thresholds remain at the current levels. The main reasons for setting the national thresholds at these levels is to open up public procurement opportunities to small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and to achieve value for taxpayer&rsquo;s money through competitive and transparent tendering processes. It is a basic principle of public procurement that a competitive process should be used. <\/p>  <p>  These thresholds for advertising on etenders will be kept under review in light of the impact on operational efficiency, value for money and accessibility to business opportunities, particularly the SME sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400057#WRE05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":294,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400057#WRE05200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":293,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400057#WRE05100"},{"type":"question","counter":294,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[28619\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400057#WRE05200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his views on staffing levels at a school (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":295,"content":"<p>The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30th September. <\/p><p>The school referred to by the Deputy is due to have one teaching post suppressed due to a fall in enrolments in September 2018. <\/p><p>The staffing process includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board.

I want to make clear my determination that co-operation and collaboration between the education systems on this island should not be maintained but strengthened between education institutions.  I am also anxious that this extends on an East-West basis. Facilitating student mobility is a key dimension of this process.  It is my intention that students from Northern Ireland will maintain access to EU fees status post Brexit. This is currently being addressed in the context of the Common Travel Area (CTA).  In May 2019, a Memorandum of Understanding on the CTA was signed between my colleague, An T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Simon Coveney T.D. and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster David Lidington MP in May 2019.

The EGFSN plays a key role in identifying and advising the Government on current and future skills needs, through the undertaking of research, analysis and horizon scanning on current and emerging skills requirements at thematic and sectoral levels. Recently completed and ongoing work being undertaken by the EGFSN includes analyses of skills needs or implications relating to the food and drink sector, design, high level ICT, Brexit\/trade related skills needs, and digitalisation.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the National Skills Architecture, the EGFSN presents its findings to the National Skills Council, which includes representation from the chief skills stakeholders within the Irish economy, including my Department. <\/p>  <p>  Together with additional skills and labour market intelligence provided by the Regional Skills Fora, Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU) in SOLAS, and employment permit trends, the Council works to enhance the response of the education and training system to the provision and delivery of those skills. In considering the recommendations of the EGFSN, the Government and relevant stakeholders are guided by the timeframes advised by the Group in its individual reports.<\/p>  <p>  This National Skills Architecture, underpinned by robust analysis and data collection on skills needs, ensures an education and training system that can be responsive and flexible in meeting the evolving skills needs of the economy, especially under the impact of continuing technological change. <\/p>  <p>  The research of the EGFSN and SLRMU also informs my Department&rsquo;s Economic Migration Policy Unit, which holds responsibility for the employment permits system and manages the Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations List and Ineligible Categories List. <\/p>  <p>  The employment permits regime is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA migrants to fill areas of identified skills shortage.

The rationale underpinning inclusion or omission from the occupations list is augmented by a consultation process that includes calls for submissions. <\/p>  <p>  The analysis of the EGFSN, and other work by my Department, have been reflected in the overarching longer term strategies for the education and training system published in recent years.

After the process of &ldquo;legal scrubbing&rdquo; and the preparation of the legal texts in the various languages was completed, the EU and Vietnam signed the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) along with the EU-Vietnam Investment Protection Agreement (IPA) on 30th June last.<\/p><p>The FTA will unlock a market with significant potential for Irish and EU firms and includes the elimination of nearly all tariffs (over 99%) on EU exports to Vietnam.  Widespread coverage is achieved at entry into force, with 65% of EU exports to Vietnam coming in duty-free from day one.  Tariffs on our remaining trade &ndash; with the exception of a few products &ndash; will be fully liberalised after 10 years.  These sensitive items are not offensive export interests for Ireland.  The EU will liberalise 71% of its imports from Vietnam from day-one and 99% will enter duty-free after seven years.  The EU-Vietnam FTA provides for the full dismantling of nearly all tariffs except for a few tariff lines that are subject to duty-free Tariff Rate Quotas (TRQs).  The gradual elimination of custom duties on these sensitive products will allow domestic producers to gradually adapt.  Consumers from both sides will benefit from lower prices and exporters from strengthened competitiveness.<\/p><p>Sectoral opportunities include almost all EU exports of machinery and appliances which will be fully liberalised at entry into force of the FTA.  Around half of EU pharmaceutical exports will be duty-free immediately and the rest after seven years.  Close to 70% of EU chemicals exports will be duty free at entry into force and the rest after three, five and seven years respectively.  In addition, Vietnam will also simplify requirements for marketing authorisation of pharmaceutical products and medical devices, which in turn will reduce delays and costs for these important Irish exports.<\/p><p>The FTA also improves market access by addressing non-tariff barriers to trade and other trade related issues such as public procurement, competition, services, investment, intellectual property rights, regulatory issues, and sustainable development.  The benefits and opportunities to business in the Agreement will be especially valuable for SMEs, given that trade barriers tend to disproportionately burden smaller firms, which have fewer resources to overcome them than larger firms.  <\/p><p>In 2018, Ireland&rsquo;s goods exports to Vietnam amounted to &euro;65 million.  Ireland&rsquo;s main exports to Vietnam include medical and pharmaceutical products valued at &euro;18.6m in 2018.  Ireland's food exports to Vietnam have grown considerably in recent years.  While meat and dairy products are the largest share of this, beverages and seafood also contributed strongly.  In 2017 (the most recent year with available figures), services exports from Ireland to Vietnam were valued at &euro;164m.<\/p><p>Through the Government&rsquo;s Trade Strategy, &lsquo;Ireland Connected: Trading and Investing in a Dynamic World&rsquo;, we aim by 2020 to increase indigenous exports by Enterprise Ireland supported companies, including food, to reach &euro;26 billion and secure 900 new foreign direct investments.  As part of the Government&rsquo;s Global Ireland 2025 strategy, Enterprise Ireland will open a new office in Ho Chi Minh City this year to support Irish businesses to expand into the Vietnamese market and to take advantage of the new opportunities presented by the FTA. <\/p><p>Opportunities exist for Ireland to grow exports in dairy products, pork, seafood and alcoholic beverages by taking advantage of reduced tariffs under the FTA.  Currently tariffs on EU exports of spirits to Vietnam are particularly high at 48% and will be eliminated over a 7-year period following entry into force of the FTA.  The elimination of tariffs of 15% on frozen pork products is also significant for Irish producers. <\/p><p>Ireland is an exceptionally open economy and is dependent on international trade and investment as sources of growth.  Building new export opportunities for our businesses forms a vital part of Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise strategy.  We favour ambitious and balanced trade agreements, negotiated by the EU Commission on our behalf, which are designed to deliver jobs and growth for the benefit of our citizens.  The EU-Vietnam FTA and the EU&rsquo;s other trade agreements help to open new markets, break down barriers and provide new opportunities for Irish firms.  <\/p><p>In a wider context, Vietnam is a member of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).  The EU is working towards achieving a region-to-region FTA with ASEAN by first concluding FTAs with individual ASEAN members.

The EU, in turn, will liberalise 92% of its imports from Mercosur over a transition period of up to 10 years.

Ireland also has offensive interests in the pharmaceutical, machinery, and chemical sector.

While it is disappointing that the agreement reached on beef access is more than we would have wished,\u00a0it is far less than the Mercosur block originally sought. The deal that has been agreed provides necessary reassurances on food safety &ndash; i.e. that the EU will not accept any lesser standard in respect of the additional quota of 99,000 tonnes.\u00a0 It also ensures an extended lead-in period (over\u00a0six years) before full tariff reduction levels are reached.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The EU-Mercosur Agreement also has a special chapter on SMEs. SMEs will benefit most from the simplification of exporting and customs procedures &ndash; as the savings are proportionately greater for them. A dedicated website will provide information on the Agreement for SMEs, practical guidance to importing and exporting will be published, and a dedicated data base on tariff reductions will be made available.

In this regard, where an agreement covers only areas where the Union has exclusive competence under the EU Treaties, the agreement must be an EU-only agreement. On the other hand, where an agreement covers areas where competence is shared with the Member States (or contains areas of Union competence and exclusive Member State competence), it will be a \"mixed\" agreement referred to as an Association Agreement, with both the EU and the Member States being parties to it.<\/p>  <p>  In order to determine whether an agreement entered into by the EU should be EU-only or \"mixed\", it is necessary to examine its contents to see whether it covers areas of EU exclusive competence, or of shared competence, or of Member States&rsquo; exclusive competence.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to free trade agreements, EU exclusive competence can arise in two ways. First, the Common Commercial Policy is an exclusive competence of the European Union under the EU Treaties. Thus, any provisions of a free trade agreement covering areas such as trade in goods, or sanitary and phyto-sanitary measures will fall within the EU&rsquo;s exclusive competence. The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) interprets the scope of the Common Commercial Policy very broadly, and holds that foreign direct investment, most trade in services, and sustainable development provisions all fall within the scope of the Common Commercial Policy and therefore, with the EU&rsquo;s exclusive competence. EU exclusive competence can also arise where provisions of an international agreement would affect the EU&rsquo;s internal rules or alter their scope.<\/p>  <p>  On the other hand, a \"mixed\" agreement contains aspects where the competence is shared between the Union and the Member States. Aspects of \"mixed\" competence, insofar as trade is concerned, are often provisions concerning Investment Protection and the EU Investment Court System. However, where an agreement also contains provisions which go beyond the broad area of trade and fall within the exclusive competence of the Member States &ndash; for instance, provisions concerning political cooperation in foreign policy areas &ndash; such an agreement would be considered to be \"mixed\".<\/p>  <p>  When any Agreement is finalised, such as with Mercosur, the Commission proposes the Agreement to the Council and in doing so, it indicates to the Member States its view on competence and, therefore, ratification. Nationally, Ireland would then confer with the Office of the Attorney General for their views.<\/p>  <p>  Insofar as Mercosur is concerned, it is our current understanding that it will be\u00a0a \"mixed\" agreement. While the Trade Agreement elements fall under the exclusive competence of the Commission and are, therefore, ratified by Member States in Council under Qualified Majority voting and by the European Parliament, the EU-Mercosur Agreement is a wider 'mixed' Agreement &ndash; including Trade &ndash; with areas of &ldquo;shared competence&rdquo; (such as political co-operation elements).<\/p>  <p>  However, the text of the EU-Mercosur Agreement will now have to proceed to so-called &ldquo;legal scrubbing&rdquo;, and translation, a process which can take between several months and up to two years to complete, before a final text is available.<\/p>  <p>  \"Mixed\" agreements only enter into force once each individual EU Member State has approved it in line with its own national procedures. As this process may take several years, the Commission could propose that the Agreement\u00a0be applied provisionally in respect of those aspects of the Agreement for which it has exclusive competence, such as trade.\u00a0 Such provisional application requires agreement by the Council and ratification by the European Parliament.\u00a0 It is not possible at this stage to be definitive about what timelines may apply in respect of ratifying the EU-Mercosur Agreement, until a final text is available. However, it is my Department&rsquo;s understanding that the EU-Mercosur Agreement will be a \"mixed\"\u00a0Agreement, ultimately requiring the involvement of D&aacute;il Eireann in its ratification process.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on an assessment, my Department commissioned by open tender, a study of Free Trade Agreements, more than 12 months ago.\u00a0 Copenhagen Economics were awarded this contract as an internationally renowned trade modelling firm.

The preliminary findings, which was\u00a0grounded in the information available at the time, suggest a doubling of annual goods and services exports to Mercosur over the 10 years to 2030.<\/p>  <p>  In light of\u00a0the conclusion of the negotiations last Friday, my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine will now ensure that a comprehensive, independent economic assessment is carried out specifically on the finalised EU-Mercosur Trade Agreement. This assessment will consider the impact the Agreement will have on the Irish economy and on jobs as well as the environmental implications of the deal. It will also consider how the EU-Mercosur Agreement might exacerbate\/mitigate the likely impact of Brexit for our economy.\u00a0 This assessment will help to inform our future actions in relation to EU-Mercosur agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400060#WRH04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Work Permits Eligibility","counter":468,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400060#WRH04900"},{"type":"question","counter":469,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[29047\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400060#WRH05000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if a person (details supplied) qualifies for a work permit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":470,"content":"<p>The Employment Permits Section of my Department informs me that not enough information has been provided to determine whether the person (details supplied) qualifies for an employment permit.<\/p><p>In order to work in the State all non-EEA nationals require a valid employment permit unless exempt under permission from the Department of Justice and Equality.

The joint Department of Health\/HSE\/National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published in March and sets out measures to improve care for patients waiting for scheduled care in 2019 by reducing waiting times for inpatient\/day case treatment and outpatient appointments. The plan\u00a0places a strong focus on\u00a0ten\u00a0high-volume Inpatient\/Day Case procedures.

A holding reply had issued to the PQ at the time and I had undertaken to obtain the outstanding information for the Deputy from the State Claims Agency (SCA), which manages claims in relation to clinical negligence.  Due to an administrative oversight, my Department had not issued the information which had been received from the State Claims Agency. I apologise to the Deputy for this oversight. The response to the Deputy's question is now set out below.<\/p><p>In relation to the Deputy's reference in his question concerning  missed diagnosis, it is important to note that a screening test is not a diagnostic test. Cervical screening aims to prevent cervical cancer through the early detection and treatment of pre-cancerous changes on the cervix. Earlier detection can often increase treatment options, as well as reduce the invasiveness of that treatment. It is estimated that regular cervical screening can prevent 75% (or 3 out of 4) of cervical cancer cases. Since 2008, 1,200 invasive cancers have been detected by CervicalCheck. More than 50,000 women with high grade abnormalities (CIN 2 &amp;amp; 3) have been diagnosed and treated, considerably reducing their risk of developing cervical cancer. CervicalCheck has been successful in reducing cervical cancer rates in Ireland - these dropped from around 14 per 100,000 in the period 2009-2011 to 10 per 100,000 in the period 2013-2015.  Cervical screening will not prevent all cases of cervical cancer, and some women will still develop cervical cancer despite regular screening.<\/p><p>Also, I would like to clarify matters regarding the Deputy's reference to alleged failings in the cervical cancer screening programme. It should be noted that the Report of the Scoping Inquiry into the CervicalCheck Screening Programme, conducted by Dr Gabriel Scally, is unequivocal in stating that the widespread non-disclosure of the results of historical screening audits was a substantial breach of trust for the women and families concerned. It caused significant distress and additional suffering to those affected.<\/p><p>However, Dr Scally was clear in his Final Report, published in September 2018, that the Inquiry was satisfied with the quality management processes in the laboratories contracted by CervicalCheck. His report presented no evidence that either the rates of discordant smear reporting or the performance of the programme fell below what is expected in a cervical screening programme.  Dr Scally also confirmed that he found no reason why the existing contracts for laboratory services should not continue until the new HPV regime is introduced.<\/p><p>In response to the Deputy's question relating to the number of claims on hand in this regard, I have been informed by the State Claims Agency that the information set out below has been extracted from the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and is correct as at 30th March 2019:<\/p><p><b><i>1. Number of Claims on hand:<\/i><\/b><i>There are currently 98 claims relating to allegations of misinterpretation of slides by the National Screening Service under active management by the State Claims Agency.<\/i><\/p><p><b><i>2. Number of Claims Settled:<\/i><\/b><i>To date the SCA has settled 4 of these claims.<\/i><\/p><p><b><i>3. Amount paid out in claims to date:<\/i><\/b><i>Due to the low volume of claims paid out to date, the SCA is unable to provide this figure as it could lead to the identification of an individual.<\/i><\/p><p><b><i>4. Legal costs of the cases:<\/i><\/b><i>In respect of all associated National Screening Services cases, legal costs amounting to &euro;590,583 have been paid.  These legal costs include fees paid to mediation services, which is consistent with the SCA&rsquo;s policy of using mediation wherever possible to resolve these claims in a non-adversarial manner that does not add to the considerable pain and trauma of the people affected and their families.

While Onshore wind, currently generates a substantial proportion of the countries&rsquo; renewable electricity, comparatively, Offshore is underdeveloped. A key component of the Climate Action Plan will be the development of Offshore wind.<\/p>  <p>  My Department published the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP) in 2014 which sets out policy for the sustainable development of our abundant offshore renewable energy resources. An interim review of the OREDP was published in May and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website: www.dccae.gov.ie.

The Early Years Sector Profile report, which was published in November 2018 and relates to the 2017\/2018 programme year, indicates that existing childcare provision nationally meets current needs nationwide in terms of capacity whilst recognising that small pockets of under supply may exist within this.<\/p>  <p>  This report outlines a 4% vacancy rate as a percentage of children enrolled in Dun Laoghaire Rathdown. Pobal reports that nationally the trend for waiting lists suggests a reduction in waiting lists for older children and an increase for under twos. Pobal cautions that its data on waiting lists cannot by itself be used to inform capacity decisions as parents often place their children on more than one waiting list. <\/p>  <p>   My Department funds 30 City and County Childcare Committees across the country. Part of their role is to advise my Department on capacity issues. I would encourage anyone having difficulty in securing a place to make contact with their local CCC. Contact details for all of the CCCs, in addition to other information about the services they provide, may be found on www.myccc.ie<\/p>  <p>  During my time as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I have secured an unprecedented increase of 117% in investment for early learning and care and school age childcare. While this additional investment has supported a doubling of capacity in the sector it is clear that further capacity is required and that is why I am continuing my intensive efforts in this area. <\/p>  <p>  In 2019, I provided &euro;4m in capital funding to support additional places for under threes and &euro;1m to support additional places for school age care. Successful applicants have been notified and I anticipate that this funding will support the creation of approximately 3,600 new and extra spaces for children up to the age of 15. <\/p>  <p>   The National Childcare Scheme (NCS), due to be launched later this year will also be a significant intervention to address this challenge. The NCS recognises the different costs associated with providing childcare for children of different ages. The Scheme will provide for a progressive system of subsidies starting with the highest subsidy rates for children under 1(up to &euro;5.10 per hour) and the next highest subsidy for children from 1 to under 3 (up to &euro;4.35 per hour).  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to childminding, I was delighted to secure &euro;500,000 in Budget 2019 to recruit a National Childminding Coordinator and a team of six Development Officers around the country, to support the registration of more childminders with Tusla and thus enable them access subsidies under the National Childcare Scheme. My Department will publish a Childminding Action Plan in the coming months to follow through on the commitments in First 5 and the Programme for Government to further develop the childminding sector.<\/p>  <p>  In the more medium term, under the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan published in 2018, I ensured that Childcare was identified as one of our nation's strategic priorities.

established by my Department in 2016, to investigate problems that have emerged in the concrete blockwork of certain dwellings in counties Donegal and Mayo.<\/p><p>In 2017, the report of the Expert Panel was published and included eight recommendations, which my Department is actively progressing with the relevant stakeholders, prioritising the implementation of Recommendations 1 and 2. <\/p><p>With regard to Recommendation 1, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) established a Technical Committee to scope and fast track the development of a standardised protocol. The standardised protocol will inform the course of action in relation to remedial works for all affected householders.  The standardised protocol was published by the NSAI on 13 November 2018 and <i>&lsquo;I.S. 465:2018 - Assessment, testing and categorisation of damaged buildings incorporating concrete blocks containing certain deleterious materials&rsquo;<\/i>, is available at www.nsai.ie.<\/p><p>The standard can be used to assess and categorise the damage in properties where the concrete blocks are suspected to contain the minerals mica or pyrite. Previously, there was no common way for engineers or homeowners to assess the damage caused by defective concrete blocks, in order to decide what, if any, remedial work could be carried out.  The standard:<\/p><p>1.establishes a protocol for assessing and determining whether a building has been damaged by concrete blocks containing certain excessive amounts of  deleterious materials (free or unbound muscovite mica, or aggregate with potentially deleterious quantities of pyrite); <\/p><p>2.describes methods for establishing the extent of the problem; <\/p><p>3.describes the scope of any testing required; and<\/p><p>4.categorises buildings, in  accordance with the standard, providing competent persons with guidance on the appropriate measures to be taken.<\/p><p>With regard to Recommendation 2, my Department has been in contact with Engineers Ireland in relation to the establishment of a register of competent engineers for homeowners\/affected parties&rsquo; reference. In June 2019, Engineers Ireland established such a register, which is available at www.engineersireland.ie\/Services\/I-S-465-2018-Register.aspx. <\/p><p>The register lists Chartered Engineers, who have the necessary direct professional experience, competence and specialist training in accordance with the requirements set out in ' I.S. 465:2018 - Assessment, testing and categorisation of damaged buildings incorporating concrete blocks containing certain deleterious materials&rsquo;.<\/p><p>In October 2018, the Government approved in principle the development of a grant scheme of financial assistance to support affected homeowners in the counties of Donegal and Mayo to carry out the necessary remediation works to dwellings that have been damaged due to defective concrete blocks. <\/p><p>In May 2019, agreement was reached with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to allocate &euro;20 million to a scheme for this purpose from within the &euro;2.4 billion housing budget for 2019.  Funding for future years will be agreed on an annual basis as part of the normal Estimates process.<\/p><p>The full terms and conditions of the scheme are being finalised, again in consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  This process will take account of the engagement that my Department is currently having with both Donegal and Mayo County Councils. In this regard, officials from my Department met recently with both local authority teams to discuss implementation arrangements for the scheme and further engagement will take place over the coming weeks.  <\/p><p>On completion of this work, it is intended to revert to Government on the matter. The aim will be to complete the outstanding work without delay in order to ensure that the scheme can get underway as early as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400074#WRW05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Eligibility","counter":1172,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400074#WRW05400"},{"type":"question","counter":1173,"qnumday":463,"qnumall":"[28867\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019070400074#WRW05500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when he plans to publish the promised review of income eligibility limits for social housing; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the perceived totally inadequate income limits in areas such as counties Cavan and Monaghan are depriving persons on low income to apply for local authority housing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1174,"content":"<p>Applications for social housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority, in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended.  <\/p>  <p>  The 2011 Regulations prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI and the universal social charge. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off in nature.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.
