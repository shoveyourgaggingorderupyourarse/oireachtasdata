This is the fourth such meeting, with previous meetings having taken place on 10, 17 and 26 March.  I welcome the opportunity to provide an account of these meetings to the D&aacute;il and to exchange views and ideas with Members.<\/p>  <p>  Sadly, when this emergency started, the level of co-ordination across the European Union was poor.  Member states did their own thing, very often because they were responding to a pandemic that was happening at a different pace in different countries, and, of course, as we all know, public health is a national, not a European, competence.  At its best, the European Union stands for freedom, peace and solidarity and a belief that we can achieve something greater by acting together as a continent.  Europe showed what these values meant recently during the first phase of the Brexit negotiations and now must do so again during this pandemic.  We must have a co-ordinated response based on solidarity and demonstrate that the European ideal shines brightest when things are at their darkest.<\/p>  <p>  In our meetings, the European Council has focused on five strategic areas of work where we believe co-operation is essential: first, limiting the spread of the virus; second, ensuring the supply of medicines, equipment and goods; third, supporting research; fourth, alleviating the socio-economic consequences for our people; and fifth, co-operating to bring citizens home from other countries.  At our meeting of 23 April, we welcomed, in particular, the joint European roadmap towards the lifting of Covid-19 containment measures, which was published by the Commission on 15 April.  It sets out a principles-based and science-led approach to reopening our societies and economies.  This was widely welcomed and aligns with the approach we have taken as a Government to date.<\/p>  <p>  Across Europe, our first responsibility - and our highest responsibility - has been to protect the lives and health of our citizens.  We see this in the Commission's work on a shared procurement framework for personal protective equipment, PPE, and other medical supplies, EU research funding for the development of effective diagnostics and therapeutics, as well as a co-ordinated approach to working towards an effective vaccine for SARS-CoV-2.  I welcome that the European Commission is building a strategic stockpile of medical equipment from which member states will be able to draw in the future and, indeed, in the near present.  In fact, batches of FFP2 protective masks were distributed from this stock in recent days to Spain, Italy and Croatia.<\/p>  <p>  There is more to do and we need to consider how to make the European Union more resilient and more responsive as we chart our way through and beyond this crisis.  At our first meeting, we agreed to co-ordinate the repatriation of our citizens stranded across the globe as a result of the pandemic.<\/p> <p>To date, repatriation efforts have brought more than 500,000 EU citizens back to their home countries.  These include people repatriated to Ireland on special flights we chartered from Peru and India, on which citizens of 17 other countries also travelled.  We have availed of the reverse from other countries.<\/p> <p> On 17 March, we agreed that we would do whatever it takes to meet the current challenges, to restore confidence and to support a rapid recovery.  We invited the Eurogroup of EU finance Ministers to scrutinise economic and financial developments and adopt a co-ordinated policy approach.  The president of the European Central Bank, Madame Christine Lagarde, has participated in each of these meetings and she strongly supported our position that we need to provide monetary flexibilities to protect the European economy, at least in the initial stages of this economic crisis.  The crisis has had deep and sharp economic and social impacts of which everyone in the House will be well aware.  We have already seen the stresses and strains across all countries of the European Union and some more than others have been particularly affected.<\/p> <p> At the meeting on 26 March, we discussed how we can best respond to this crisis collectively.  Together, we must deal with the immediate issues arising and drive our recovery into the medium and longer term and ensure that it is sustainable.  Prior to that meeting, I joined eight of my colleagues in advancing an approach that would have led to the mutualisation of debt, known in shorthand as corona bonds.  The idea was to take a shared approach to managing debt arising solely from this crisis.  This could be spending directed towards our health services or wider spending that governments have to undertake to protect their welfare states and refloat their economies.  Such an approach would have required a legal underpinning not currently provided for in the European treaties and I accept that it would have taken a long time to agree this, even longer if it had to be approved in all member states and longer still if some, including Ireland, required referendums.  However, it was still worth exploring.  In the absence of unanimous support for this approach, we agreed that alternative solutions for a recovery fund should be developed.<\/p> <p> I am supportive of the broad suite of measures taken at EU level.  These include a temporary relaxation of the state aid rules under which Ireland has two aid packages, totalling &euro;400 million and approved by the Commission, to assist our most affected companies.  However, we need to ensure that member states do not use state aid to give an unfair advantage to companies based in member states with which they competed.  This will be monitored closely.  We have also invoked the escape clause in the Stability and Growth Pact in order to give member states additional flexibility to spend and borrow more in response to this crisis.  We all appreciate that this cannot go on forever but it is appropriate that we do so at this particular point in the cycle.  The European Central Bank has also played an important role in ensuring stability in the midst of this extraordinary crisis, including through its &euro;750 billion pandemic emergency purchase programme.  Capital rules for banks have also been eased to ensure that they can lend into the real economy, providing liquidity to businesses under pressure.<\/p> <p> At the meeting on 23 April, we endorsed an economic package agreed by the Eurogroup worth up to &euro;500 billion, and we asked that it be operational in the first week in June.  The package contains three elements: a &euro;100 billion EU SURE instrument, which will provide financial assistance in the form of loans granted on favourable terms to cover initiatives such as short-term work schemes and similar measures for the self-employed - this would include, for example, our temporary wage subsidy scheme; a &euro;200 billion EIB Covid-19 guarantee fund for crisis lending to SMEs, mid-cap businesses and corporates, underpinned by &euro;25 billion in member state guarantees; and a &euro;240 billion ESM-operated pandemic crisis support instrument to provide a backstop for member states to make available sovereign funding of up to 2% of GDP for direct and indirect health care expenditures.  It should be noted that these are all loans and guarantees and not grants, and borrowed money must be repaid.  Taken together, these measures represent an EU fiscal response of over &euro;500 billion - an historic level of deployment of resources to respond to an emergency that is unprecedented.  This is a much greater and more appropriate response from the European Union than during the financial crisis ten or 12 years ago, when it acted in a way that was too little and too late.<\/p> <p>Looking beyond the immediate crisis, we agreed the need to put in place a recovery fund to rebuild our economies, reopen our businesses and get our citizens back to work.  We also welcomed the joint roadmap for recovery and asked the Presidents of the European Commission and Council to bring it forward.  It also sets out a framework for collective action towards recovery, including a fully functioning Single Market, an unparalleled investment effort and a commitment to the EU playing its part in driving a global recovery.<\/p> <p> As a necessary next step to this work, we welcome the European Commission's proposal that it undertake a sector-by-sector analysis of the economic impact of the crisis to identify and target supports necessary for recovery in those particular sectors.  We also agreed that climate action and the digital economy should be critical components of this recovery plan.  This crisis has dealt a terrible shock to our economies but also creates an opportunity to make sure that the European-wide recovery is climate-proofed and technology-driven.  I believe the EU budget, the Multiannual Financial Framework, is the most obvious vehicle for doing this, so we have asked the Commission to look again at the MFF proposal and to consider how it and the recovery fund should be linked.<\/p> <p> As is well known, there are strongly held different views around the table on how this should be financed.  Some believe there should be transfers from other countries to those countries most affected in the form of grants - generally speaking, a transfer from north to south.  Others expressed the view that loans were the only acceptable option to their citizens and also the legal order of their nations and their constitutions.  I articulated the view that both could play a part and that the right balance between loans and grants is what we should aim for.  I also argued that I could not accept any approach that deployed the MFF to the detriment of proper funding of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  Farming, agribusiness and the food sector were already facing great challenges and have been deeply affected by this crisis.  Successful and well-functioning programmes, such as CAP, cohesion and Horizon, will help to drive our recovery and, therefore, should be funded properly for the next seven years.  At this time of crisis, we see the strategic importance of a strong agrifood sector providing European citizens with food security and affordable food.  CAP is needed now, more than ever, perhaps as much as it is was needed when it was first invented.<\/p> <p> During this emergency, we have seen huge stresses on the Single Market as some internal borders closed to people, goods and services, albeit temporarily.  As was predictable, countries that closed their borders and introduced export bans had to reverse them within weeks, when they learned very quickly that the benefits were less than the costs.  I believe a fully functioning Single Market and free trade beyond our borders will be necessary as we recover from the recession induced by Covid-19.  In the wrap-up statement, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will discuss the package of measures being taken at EU level to support partner countries globally.  As part of the Union's global effort, more than &euro;3.3 billion of EU financial support has been mobilised for the western Balkans for Covid-19 and the post-pandemic recovery.  This is our neighbourhood and it is the right thing that we should help them.  Later this afternoon, I will participate in a western Balkans summit with EU leaders and Heads of Government from the western Balkan states.  This will also be done by video conference, so I apologise that I have to leave this session early to take part in that. <\/p> <p> On Saturday, we mark Europe Day.  I believe this date should serve as a reminder of what we have achieved together.  The EU is held together by its values - respect for democracy, the rule of law, individual freedom, equality before the law, our unique model which is the social market economy and the four freedoms.  It should also remind us that so many of the problems and challenges we face do not recognise borders drawn my mankind.  Whether it is health emergencies like pandemics, environmental emergencies like climate change, security threats like international terrorism or global economic movements, the pooling of resources, the creation of safety nets and the adoption of collective measures are necessary to drive our recovery.<\/p> <p>This is particularly important for small countries such as Ireland, with a population of only 5 million.  Our best hope for the future lies in working together, being at that top table in the European Union and making sure we are at the heart of the common European home we helped to build.  I welcome the views and thoughts of Members today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600004#B00700","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588764000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCeann Comhairle.

The events of the past two and a half months have once again highlighted the great strengths and serious weaknesses of the European Union as currently constructed.  The failure of leaders participating in the European Council summits to agree a radical response to a unique emergency should be of grave concern to everyone.  Measures which have been announced are welcome and they will help, but they go nowhere near providing the scale and range of actions Europe needs if it is to recover quickly.<\/p>  <p>  For a few years, Fianna F&aacute;il has been pushing for Ireland to take a more active role not just in defending Europe but in helping to develop Europe.  We have called for this country and its partners to break free of the defensive posture adopted in response to the anti-European Union rhetoric of the right and left.  A debate which looks at every issue as a zero-sum game defined by who gets our money has been highly destructive in the past and it will continue to be so.<\/p>  <p>  Collectively, we have asked the European Union to take a lead in promoting innovation, guaranteeing food security, promoting regional development, securing our energy supplies, tackling long-term unemployment, ensuring we address the climate emergency, stabilising and reforming the financial system and many other tasks.  Now we look to it to limit the financial damage of a severe pandemic and help countries to recover from a profound economic shock.  The simple fact is the European Union has been denied the resources and powers it needs to deliver the agenda we have set for it, with a budget limited to a combined national income of 1%, a range of measures designed to limit fiscal transfers, a ban on raising collectively assured debt and a requirement that all emergency funding be taken from existing programmes.<\/p>  <p>  On top of this, the European Central Bank, the one institution willing to act with true urgency and ambition, is under assault as a result of a remarkable judgment from the German constitutional court.  It should be of grave concern that the court believes the European Central Bank's measures are disproportionate to the economic and fiscal policy effects.  It is hard to conceive of any circumstance more serious than the one we face today and the idea that the European Central Bank's response could be considered to be disproportionate is almost bizarre.  While this is not something receiving a lot of attention today, it is just as serious as when there was an attempt to block the ECB action that saved the euro from disintegration during the financial crisis.<\/p>  <p>  While we welcome the measures agreed at the summit and Ireland's late conversion to supporting collective borrowing, we reject the idea that anywhere near enough has been agreed or that what has been agreed has been delivered.  Other than the outbreak of a war there has never before been such a dramatic and rapid public health and economic shock.  Just like every other country in Europe, Ireland does not yet really know the scale of the recovery challenge we face.  If the member states of the Union continue to block measures to develop new direct funding mechanisms, then the Union's contribution will continue to be economically marginal.  If ever there was a time to reflect on the importance of co-operation between states and strong shared institutions, this is it.<\/p> <p>Without the international public organisations, the world would be in a much worse position today.<\/p> <p> While there should be a comprehensive and independent inquiry into the early stages of the pandemic, an inquiry focused on what can be done better next time, the World Health Organization has proven its value and we strongly support the efforts to secure its funding.  We also believe we should acknowledge the work of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.  It is not a high-profile European Union body but it does essential work in sharing information and co-ordinating responses among member states.  It is also important to acknowledge the work of scientists working in our universities and institutes.  In addition to being central to much of the response here, many teams are working on different parts of the challenges of developing both treatments and vaccines.  It is a reminder to us all of the importance of having a wide research base and that not all of this can or should be linked to commercial objectives.  The societal and public health benefits which come from having a broad range of scientific expertise here are simply undeniable.<\/p> <p> A development of deep concern in the past two months has been the way in which some governments appear to see the pandemic as an opportunity to entrench themselves.  The effective suspension of parliament in Hungary is clearly a major breach of the core democratic principles to which that country signed up when seeking membership of the European Union.  Every country has had to implement emergency measures to respond to the pandemic but the powers grabbed by the Orb&aacute;n Government go well beyond anything seen elsewhere.  In many countries, there have been questions about whether the media has been challenging enough concerning government action, but only in Hungary has the Government taken major new censorship powers unto itself.  One decree in recent weeks has given the Government of Hungary the power to effectively confiscate money from local authorities without appeal.  So far, this power has only been used to take money from districts controlled by the Opposition and the combination of suspending parliamentary oversight and controlling the media means that there has been no means of challenging this.  In this context, the sense that Viktor Orb&aacute;n can act with impunity and the European Council will do nothing is deeply corrosive of the foundations of the Union.  One of the highest net recipients of European Union support, whose economy is profoundly based on free access to the Single Market, is challenging the basic idea that a state must be a free democracy with genuine checks on power if it is to be a member of the Union.  To simply ignore this and hope it will sort itself out is not good enough.<\/p> <p> Last week the European Parliament raised its concerns about the possible watering down of a Commission report on the spreading of pandemic disinformation.  It is not yet clear what happened but there should be no doubt about core principles.  The spreading of disinformation by states outside the European Union has reached dramatic proportions in the past decade.  The efforts to support the far left and far right have been a core part of a strategy to undermine democracy and the Union itself.  In recent months, there has been widespread evidence of conspiracy theories and false claims being created and spread relating to the origins and impact of the virus.  Member states rely on the institutions of the Union to monitor and report honestly about this issue.  Under no circumstances should the honest assessment of relevant experts be watered down or censored.  At a minimum, there should be a comprehensive explanation of what happened in this circumstance and any removed material should be published.  In terms of specific measures taken during the summer, what we need is to move as quickly as possible to implementation.  The delay which has characterised funding initiatives in recent years cannot continue.  Equally, we support the call of President Macron and the French Minister for Finance to return to discussing more ambitious actions.<\/p> <p> Obviously, Brexit has not gone away.  It appears likely that there will be major decisions to be taken in the coming weeks and months.  This will be discussed at length tomorrow so I will leave most of Fianna F&aacute;il's comments to that session.  However, it is important to state today that the threat of a chaotic Brexit remains and the need for us to prepare for all eventualities is more significant than ever.<\/p> <p>The extraordinary position of London that no European Union office will be agreed for Belfast appears like a demonstration of bad faith concerning the operationalising of what has been agreed relating to Northern Ireland.  It may be some form of negotiating tactic, the logic of which remains hidden.  There is, however, nothing positive about London citing a concern with community divisions in Northern Ireland, which had not existed before.  No one in Northern Ireland appears to object to the idea of a European Union office in Belfast.  The London Government's position is of concern and is, in my view, potentially highly divisive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600007#E00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588764600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>The Covid-19 emergency has presented the people of Europe with an unprecedented crisis and challenge.  The virus has attacked our societies, ravaged our economies and tested our communities in previously unimaginable ways.  Despite the painful and cruel nature of this pandemic the people of Europe have rallied and demonstrated, as the Taoiseach put it, Europe at its best.  There is solidarity, compassion and social justice.  We have endured and we will endure, not because of the worst of Europe, which is corporate greed, an aggressive, doctrinaire neo-liberal approach, vested interests, privatisation, and the running down of social protections and workers' rights.  Europe's people will thrive despite all of that.<\/p>  <p>  It is incredible that a huge economic system and political systems globally have been brought to their knees by this deadly virus, yet the people prevail.  It is they who most effectively articulate what Europe is and what the European Union should be.  We see Germans singing \"Bella Ciao\", that great anthem of the Italian resistance, in solidarity with their beleaguered Italian friends.  We see Spaniards clapping their health workers on their way into work every night.  In households here, we see people placing candles in their windows to honour all who have tragically lost their loved ones.  That is the real measure and value of what the European project should be.<\/p>  <p>  Workers and families in the European Union also share a common hope for the future that the recovery, which will surely follow, must be fair and that progress will be built as we emerge from this crisis with people, citizens and solidarity front and centre.  In the aftermath of this pandemic, we cannot perpetuate an economic system of winners and losers.  We cannot have a scenario where some profit from the pandemic while others are saddled with crushing debts from mortgages, rents and utility bills.  Ordinary people must come first in this recovery.  This also means giving back to low-paid and front-line workers who managed to carry us all through this emergency.  Caithfidh gn&aacute;thdhaoine a bheith chun tosaigh san am seo.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir leis na hoibrithe riachtanacha inniu a bheith ina n-oibrithe dearmadta am&aacute;rach.  The essential workers of today cannot become the forgotten workers of tomorrow.  Much has been said in this regard about those who work in retail.  Debenhams workers are outside the gate today.  These are workers whose employer availed of this public health emergency to cast them aside and dispense with their services.  The truth is that the Government did little or nothing to secure those jobs.  It is astonishing.  Bank of Ireland is a minority shareholder in Debenhams, yet the Government has sat on its hands.  It looks like Debenhams will get off scot-free and the workers are left high and dry.  Perhaps we should start there, with that set of workers, to demonstrate what the new recovery and new economic and social order might be.<\/p>  <p>  Ten years ago, the European Union was faced with a different crisis, a seismic economic recession as a result of the banking collapse.  At that time, it was faced with a real choice between the imposition of austerity that would punish workers, families and communities for the reckless gambling of bankers and financial speculators and building a recovery through investment and stimulus that would protect ordinary people and really kick-start economies.<\/p> <p>The EU at the time chose austerity, which Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael in government implemented with great relish.  The people of this State paid a very heavy price in the form of devastating cuts to services, soaring unemployment and staggering levels of emigration.  The consequences of this austerity were severe hardship, particularly for low and middle-income workers, while those at the top were insulated.  Indeed, many of them thrived in this savage environment and that cannot happen again.  There can be no return to austerity in the wake of this emergency.  To that end, the Taoiseach noted that the fiscal rules within the EU are currently suspended but he will also know, as outlined in black and white in the spring stability programme update, that this is only a temporary state of affairs and the excessive deficit rules will apply again in the future.  The Irish people are all too aware of what austerity looks like and how it feels from the time of the previous crisis.  The European Commission at that time and the European system was no great friend to Ireland or our people.<br\/><br\/>There are huge concerns now among workers and families that we are looking at <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>, a re-run of that scenario.  I listened to the Minister for Finance this morning and I am very concerned.  He suggested that financial supports for hundreds of thousands of workers will come to an end in June.  That is an intolerable and unacceptable proposition and I hope the Taoiseach will confirm for the House that it will not happen.<br\/><br\/>The better way to manage this crisis is to take those decisions that serve the interests of workers and families.  This is not pie in the sky, before anyone dismisses it.  This is about having the courage, ambition and political imagination to make better choices.  It is also about doing the right thing.  No longer can our society be held back by the naysayers who say a fair recovery and a more equal society are not possible.  Many of the things that those in Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il told us were impossible in the course of the recent general election have been done in a few short weeks.  <i>Voil&agrave;<\/i>- all of it could be done, including a rent freeze, the thing they railed against.  The people do not want a repeat of the lost decade and will not tolerate it.

There are opportunities, however, not only to address the democratic deficit that contributed to Brexit but also to reshape many aspects of our society and of the whole of our island.  The EU has a major and crucial role to play in this transition, and the EU financial support package, the suspension of the Stability and Growth Pact, the temporary relaxing of state aid rules, the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, transition regulation, and the next CAP programmes have to be used to invigorate the regions.  Now is the time to place balanced regional development and rural Ireland firmly front and centre of EU and Government policy by identifying and implementing rural solutions to national problems.<\/p>  <p>  All too often we in rural Ireland hear about the millions and billions of euro that are made available, but it is always out of our reach because of too much bureaucracy and too many unidentified beneficiaries.  To that end I have grave concerns about the high interest rates being charged by banks when, globally, interest rates are so low.  It is unthinkable that the banks would again capitalise on the backs of ordinary people.  During this pandemic, focus has been put on the fact that 40% of the population live in Dublin, while 44% work there.<\/p> <p>Only a fool would consider this imbalance to be sustainable or safe.  Investment policies driven by population numbers do not work.  We can no longer miss out on the opportunities to deepen and widen the lengths between education and industry or to forgo opportunities for remote working and learning because we do not have equal access to broadband and telecommunications.  We are losing out so much on human capital, denying children with autism, parents of children with autism and those living with disabilities the opportunities to develop and use their abilities and talents to their full potential.<\/p> <p> The economic recovery must include the fast-tracking of critical physical telecommunications infrastructure as well as introducing fairness into our fishing and agriculture industries.  We must ensure we proactively pursue all monetary opportunities as well as using the fiscal instruments available to direct industry and job creation.  The long-promised strategic development zone at Knock Airport must be advanced as a matter of urgency and the airport itself must be enabled to reach its full potential as a catalyst for growth in the west.  The EU Commission proposal to make 2021 the year of rail presents us with opportunities to bring the western rail corridor to fruition and to upgrade existing rail lines.

I welcome the European Council's discussion of the joint European roadmap towards the lifting of Covid-19 containment measures.  I also welcome the endorsement by the European Council of the Eurogroup's agreement on safety nets for workers, businesses and sovereigns.<\/p>  <p>  The maintenance of workers' incomes, either through wage subsidy schemes to keep jobs or through direct financial assistance, such as the pandemic payment in Ireland, is a key response responsibility of all governments.  It is also important to note that the EU has recognised the scale of the crisis that the Covid-19 pandemic poses across the Union by recognising that the conditions for the use of the general escape clause of the EU's fiscal framework, where there is a severe economic downturn in the eurozone or across the Union as a whole, has been met.  That step, combined with the novel use of the EU budget via the coronavirus response investment initiative and the actions of the European Central Bank to support liquidity and financing conditions, demonstrate the ability of the EU to react jointly and with a sense of solidarity.  We regret, however, that we did not see that same sense of solidarity expressed by some member states, especially with respect to novel ways in which the EU could support member states to borrow as they emerge from the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to refer in particular the joint roadmap for recovery that was presented at the European Council meeting.  This is described as a comprehensive recovery plan and an unprecedented investment that will help the EU to relaunch and transform its economies.  Central to this joint roadmap for recovery is the European green deal.  Over the past two weeks in Ireland, there has been extensive discussion of how we can meet the target of cutting carbon emissions by at least an average of 7% per annum between now and 2030.  A lot of the coverage is focused on the financial cost of the policies needed to achieve this.  I would like to take this opportunity to discuss how at EU level the recovery from the economic shock created by the coronavirus is linked to the green European deal, how the policy changes we are implementing will be supported by EU-wide policy approaches, and in particular how major funding is being provided at EU level to finance these policies.<\/p>  <p>  Under EU law currently, the Union is committed to a 40% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.  However, as part of the EU's move to achieve the target set out in the Paris Agreement, it plans to increase its 2030 commitments to a cut of between 50% and 55%.<\/p> <p>This change is being brought forward as part of a new EU climate law which the Commission has recently proposed.  Once this law is passed, it will be binding on all EU member states, including Ireland.  A reduction of at least an average of 7% per annum in Ireland will enable us to meet this target.  It is important to remember that this target is not Ireland going alone.  It is part of a collective EU response to the decision by all 27 member states, including Ireland, to sign up to the Paris Agreement and it will be legally binding on Ireland and all the member states within the year.<\/p> <p> Obviously, setting a target of at least 7% average annual emissions reductions is not enough on its own.  Success will only be achieved through a range of policy measures that deliver reductions in each part of the economy.  As part of the European green deal, the EU will bring forward specific policies in 2020 and 2021 to support the achievement of its new emissions reduction targets.  New CO2 emissions standards for vehicles, including vans and trucks, are currently being set.  Later this year, there will be a funding call to support the development of public recharging and refuelling points as part of alternative fuel infrastructure.  There will be a new strategy on offshore wind, something that will help support Ireland as we seek to develop this hugely underused resource which could deliver us 5 GW per year of clean and cheap energy by 2025.  A new circular economy action plan will be developed.  This will include a sustainable products initiative and a particular focus on resourcing sectors such as textiles, construction, electronics and plastics.  Ireland and the EU can be at the forefront of designing products where waste is minimised.<\/p> <p> Changes of this scale have a cost, but the EU is providing a huge amount of funding to enable these changes to be financed.  Central to the European green deal is the European green deal investment plan, which proposes to mobilise at least &euro;1 trillion in sustainable investment over the next decade.  Some &euro;500 billion is to be provided by the EU budget for climate and environmental spending between 2021 and 2030.  This will trigger additional national co-financing of &euro;114 billion over this timeframe on climate and environmental projects.  The InvestEU fund will leverage approximately &euro;280 billion for climate and environmentally friendly related investments by providing an EU budget guarantee to reduce risk.  The innovation and modernisation funds, which are financed through the revenues from the auctioning of carbon allowances under the emissions trading scheme, will provide at least &euro;25 billion for the EU transition towards climate neutrality.  Beyond the EU budget, other EU funding bodies are changing their mandates to better reflect the need for climate action.  The European Investment Bank has launched its new energy lending policy which aims to end financing for fossil fuel energy projects by the end of 2021.  Its investment priorities are now shifting to clean energy innovation, energy efficiency projects and renewables.<\/p> <p> One of the principles of the European green deal is that no person and no place is left behind.  The Green Party has always advocated for the need for a just transition whereby the rights of workers and communities who are currently dependent on fossil fuel industries are provided for in the move to more sustainable energy production through investment, retraining and diversification of local economies.  This is a major issue across the EU as communities in parts of Poland, Germany and France are deeply dependent on coal mining.  In Ireland, the regions associated with peat cutting, particularly in the midlands, must be protected.  To facilitate this, a just transition mechanism is being put in place.  The aim of this funding mechanism is to promote and develop new skills among workers and to support the growth of businesses.  It is expected that between the fund and member states' commitments, between &euro;30 billion and &euro;50 billion will be available.  This fund will target fossil fuels, including peat, and greenhouse gas intensive industries.<\/p> <p> The scale of the investment I have set out, &euro;1 trillion over ten years, will not only help create jobs in Ireland but will also spur new industries.  There will be a great benefit for those countries and regions that put in place the proposals that can seek EU funding, co-funding or support from the European Investment Bank.  A number of European governments, particularly in the east, have taken the direction of opposing climate action and refusing to move their economies in a more sustainable direction.  Those countries will lose out on the potential to get this massive investment.<\/p> <p>Ireland must not do this.  It must put in place the national policies that connect with these EU policies so we can benefit from the investment, develop new industries around renewables and create new jobs all over the country, particularly in those communities in transition.<\/p> <p> Every action taken by any government across the planet for the foreseeable future will be coloured by the Covid-19 crisis.  Earlier this week, a group of well-known economists, including Professors Joseph Stiglitz and Nicholas Stern, published a paper in which they examined whether the recovery packages being prepared to follow the Covid-19 crisis will be beneficial to climate policies I have spoken about or run contrary to them.  Their research finds that recovery packages that seek synergies between climate and economic goals have better prospects for increasing national wealth and enhancing productive human, social, physical, intangible and natural capital.  They also state that green fiscal recovery packages can act to decouple economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions and reduce existing welfare inequalities that will be exacerbated by the pandemic in the short term and by climate change in the long term.<\/p> <p> As we hopefully begin to emerge from the worst of the coronavirus crisis, we can choose what kind of recovery this can be.  What I hope to see, and what we will work for as a party, is a recovery that works for all, rooted in European solidarity, and that confronts the challenges we face.  We are in a climate emergency.  The costs of failing to meet the 7% target are catastrophic.  That is the scientific consensus and it is on that basis that we should plan.  It is also the clear direction of the EU.  The European Council sees the European green deal as central to its joint roadmap for recovery.  The policies I have outlined can help to create jobs and support a recovery from Covid-19 that is equitable and sustainable in every sense of the word.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600011#J00300","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588765800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Once again, the EU is faced with a major crisis.  This crisis has the potential to make or break the Union.  The test this time is whether the EU can demonstrate solidarity among its member states based on shared democratic values or just wants to be a marketplace.  One of the reasons the UK was never fully integrated into the EU was it only wanted a single market and not a political community.  The Labour Party's view, however, is that the EU can be successful only if it is built on solidarity and mutual assistance among its member states.<\/p>  <p>  We welcome the EU's decision to use &euro;540 billion from the ESM to assist member states without many of the onerous rules that usually come with its loans.  We particularly welcome the recent action by the EU to host donations to developing countries to assist them in their response to the epidemic.  The target of &euro;7.5 billion, set on 4 May, was essentially reached within 24 hours.  This was a testament to the surge of global solidarity brought about by the Covid-19 epidemic.<\/p>  <p>  My main focus, however, is on the idea of a European recovery fund.  My colleagues from the Party of European Socialists proposed a &euro;1.5 trillion recovery fund to help all our countries to rebuild after this crisis.  I am glad EU leaders recently agreed to create a new fund of at least &euro;1 trillion euro, which is a great step forward, but a lot hinges on the model of financing used to underpin it and decisions on how it will operate.  In short, we need a fund that distributes grants as well as loans and that targets more assistance to the worst-affected countries on the basis of solidarity, not their proportion of the EU's population.  We also need the fund to be financed at EU level, not by piling unsustainable debt onto member states' already overstretched national debts.<\/p>  <p>  The recovery fund proposal is important so I would like to speak about it in more detail.  The first point is fairly self-evident.  When countries and major employers are already overstretched, they cannot afford to take on too much additional debt.  Many viable enterprises throughout Europe will only remain viable if they are given grant aid, not loans.  Likewise, there are countries that will have the capacity to quickly get their public finances in order but only if they are given grants, not loans.  The choice is between being pragmatic about what will work and being ideologically opposed to grants.  Unfortunately, a number of governments across the EU are ideologically opposed to the idea of giving grants to other member states.  The irony is that this ideological position will make the EU's recovery slower and more painful, just like after the 2008 banking crisis, when the same ideology dominated EU thinking.  We must not make the same mistake twice.  Other parts of the world came out of the 2008 crash faster because they were not prisoners of this ideology.  Across Europe, people must not be asked to endure another set of austerity years.  People will not tolerate more austerity.  We have already seen the rise of Eurosceptic and far-right politics in response to these ruinous policies.<\/p> <p>This time around the EU has to give grants in addition to loans if economic recovery is to be faster and more sustainable.<\/p> <p> The second point is that the European recovery fund must be focused on the areas of greatest need regardless of geography.  In normal times the EU carefully allocates funds based on the population size of member states and their contribution to the EU budget, but we are not living in normal times and those rules cannot apply.  A European recovery fund needs to allocate money to where it is most needed to boost recovery and to rescue as many viable jobs as possible in the aftermath of this crisis.<\/p> <p> It is also an opportunity to direct funds towards environmentally sustainable activity and to speed up the EU's transition to a low-carbon economy.  Again, this is a choice between being pragmatic about what actions will help economic recovery versus being ideologically opposed to any kind of fiscal transfer.  Unfortunately, a similar set of governments is blocking this idea because it fears a domestic political backlash if it is seen to use its own tax revenue to fund the recovery of other countries.  However, the model for a European recovery of the Party of European Socialists took that concern into account.  There is no need for member states to fund other member states directly as long as the EU borrows money at EU level and repays that money from its own resources.  As such, there should be no objection to channelling money to where it is most needed, and that will benefit the whole of the EU in the long term.  We will all be worse off if regions of Europe are left behind in the recovery; hence, the recovery fund must be targeted where it is most needed.<\/p> <p> The third point about the recovery fund is that it should be raised at EU level and paid for at EU level.  In this context I am pleased to see that the Government has backed the proposal for eurobonds to fund the recovery.  The logic of raising debt at EU level to create the recovery fund is fairly straightforward.  Many EU member states have relatively high public debts following the disaster of 2008.  Some of us would find it difficult to borrow money to raise those debts further, even though in Ireland we are still fortunately able to borrow at very low rates.  The EU exists as a separate international entity with the capacity to borrow, but it currently has no debt compared to the United States where debt is carried at both federal level as well as at state level.  To use the analogy of bank accounts, many member states have already reached their overdraft limit on their personal accounts but we have a shared account with our partners with no overdraft at all.  It makes much more sense to collectively use our shared account to finance the recovery fund rather than to individually pay more to extend our already large overdrafts.  This is where some member states fear being asked to directly finance others, but that is not what is being proposed.  If we borrow at EU level we should also repay the debt at EU level.  Currently, the EU has modest revenue-raising capacity, mostly from custom duties and sugar levies, but these could be expanded, for example, with the proposal for a financial transaction tax at EU level.  Also, the original proposal for a &euro;1.5 trillion fund envisaged perpetual or very long-life bonds, which have a surprisingly low annual cost in comparison to the &euro;1.5 trillion capital figure.  It could be financed for about &euro;5 billion in interest payments per annum and as a perpetual bond the capital could very well not come up for repayment.  The EU has the capacity to service such a debt.  Over time, inflation would erode the capital cost to a much lower level, which means that it could be paid off decades later just as some post-Second World War bonds have only recently been paid off.<\/p> <p> I hope that the idea of a European recovery fund will be agreed sooner rather than later as the future of the EU depends on a successful economic and social recovery after Covid-19.  I seek clarity from the Government about whether or not it supports a European recovery fund along the lines I have described.  I would appreciate a detailed response on what the Government agrees with or disagrees with regarding any recovery fund.<\/p> <p> Regarding bond buying by the European Central Bank, which is currently keeping national borrowing rates low and keeping inflation down, there has been a major challenge to the ECB's quantitative easing approach by the German constitutional court.  It has made a ruling that will potentially halt participation by the German Bundesbank or the German Government in this policy, which would have major knock-on effects and could jeopardise the stability of national debts in numerous member states.  All of this stems from a legal case taken by an independent group of business people and academics who are ideologically opposed to any burden sharing across EU member states and who oppose the &euro;2.7 trillion programme.  While this ruling excludes the &euro;750 billion pandemic emergency purchase programme, there is now expected to be a further legal challenge to its legality.  What is the Government's understanding of the German court decision and what actions are being taken to ensure that the ECB's bond-buying programme can continue, including the actions to ensure that the pandemic emergency programme is legally robust?  What is the Government's understanding of how this ruling at national level challenges the authority of the European Court of Justice and the ECB?<\/p> <p> Key to all of this is solidarity: solidarity among EU members and solidarity between the EU and the rest of the world.  I believe Europe has a responsibility to be a leader not only in its own recovery but in the global recovery.<\/p>  <p>We need to stand strong in solidarity with those who need it within our own borders and throughout the world.<\/p> <p> In mid-March, 52 doctors and nurses from Cuba arrived in the region of Lombardy in Italy on a day when Italy's death toll from Covid-19 reached 800.  That was an incredible act of global solidarity.  The EU must be seen to reciprocate and work to assist countries such as Cuba which are impeded by tightening US embargoes when accessing medical equipment that is much needed to combat the pandemic.  We should use Covid-19 as an opportunity to break traditional enmities and hostilities.  I support call of the UN Secretary General, Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, for sanctions to be waived to the tackle the crisis.  He said this was a time for solidarity, not exclusion.  We are all bound by our common humanity and we all need to defeat this virus.  The EU should be moral leaders on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600013#L00200","speaker":"1564","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588767000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>This is the second time in just over a decade that we face an economic crisis.  This one is obviously very different because life and health are centre stage and the economic fallout is as a consequence of Covid-19.  While I welcome the belated response to limit the spread, the investment in the development of medicines, and the research which is under way, and they are important, there is lesson to learned in particular from the late response in Italy and how that played out.<\/p>  <p>  The response to the previous economic crisis meant that some countries were forced to cut back on spending on areas such as health, which made them less able to deal with this crisis.  The response to this crisis cannot impact on member states' ability to mitigate predictable crises in public services or climate mitigation measures in the future - things that we know we have to respond to.  There has to be an appreciation of the scale of the problem by all member states, and there also to be an appreciation that the response to that has to be large enough, that not all member states were impacted the same way, and that not all of them have the ability to respond equally.  For example, we have a huge national debt imposed partly as a result of how the EU dealt with the previous crisis.  We are not alone in this, however.  Countries such as Italy simply cannot take on further debt.  If they are required to do so, and I am hearing the loan and grant scenario, that will be catastrophic, not just for Italy but for the eurozone as a whole.  We have very fresh memories of the last crash.  It was not, as we were told, a Union of equals.  It was dominated by intergovernmentalism, with Germany and France at the axis.  They really called the shots.  There are signs of the same kind of thinking - perhaps slightly less, which we should be very concerned about.<\/p>  <p>  This crisis was not caused by individual member states.  It must be viewed the same way as a natural disaster, with all member states impacted, some more so than others.  There simply must be a common response, with European solidarity driving the solutions.  We must recognise this is a once in 100 years occurrence, which must be a factor in how it is responded to.  It cannot depend on member states taking on more debt.  If it does, it will elongate the problem and it may well lead to a break-up of the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  Last week in the D&aacute;il, my colleague Deputy Shortall raised the issue of corona bonds, and in response the Taoiseach stated: \"We expect the European Commission to come to us next week with proposals on how we can use the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, the seven-year budget for the EU, and borrowing perhaps by the Commission as a means to do something similar.\"  This approach seems to be the one favoured by the northern European states.  While it would mean that there was a larger fund available within an increased EU budget, it relies on private actors investing in EU countries.<\/p> <p>The riskiest tranche of their investment would, however, be guaranteed by the Commission.  The big problem with this approach is that it still means taking on extra debt.<br\/><br\/>We all agree that a major stimulus programme is needed for countries throughout Europe, including Ireland, if this crisis is to be temporary.  The French proposal to establish a Covid-19 recovery fund financed through joint debt insurance has definite merits.  It has a downside in that it would take several months to establish, and these are months that we simply do not have.  It would also be resisted by countries like Germany, Netherlands and Austria.  The more ambitious Spanish proposal of a &euro;1.5 trillion recovery fund underpinned by perpetual bonds rather than loans or grants would mean avoiding adding to national debts.  The Spanish proposal could obviously be modified but it allows for funds to be granted on the basis of the proportion of citizens impacted upon by the pandemic in each country.  That would seem like a logical approach.  As a review of the Spanish proposal in the <i>Financial Times<\/i>put it, the plan is, on its merits, the best of the many ideas that have surfaced.  Above all it takes seriously the scale of the challenge.  It involves real resources, unlike the EU's usual financial conjuring tricks of leveraging private finance.  At some 10% of the EU's collective annual national income, its size is similar to the likely hit to the bloc's growth and the likely worsening of public sector deficits.  Anything less than something on this scale would be an inadequate financial response to the Covid-19 recession.  A <i>Project Syndicate<\/i>article highlights the advantage of perpetual bonds as follows: &quot;... because perpetual bonds never have to be repaid, they would impose a surprisingly light fiscal burden on the EU, despite the considerable financial firepower they would mobilize.&quot;  The article goes on to state:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe disruption caused by the pandemic should be temporary, but only if Europe's leaders take the extraordinary measures needed to avoid long-term damage to the EU. That is why the EU Recovery Fund is so desperately needed.  Financing it with perpetual bonds is the easiest, fastest, and least costly way to establish it. <\/blockquote> <p>If the EU were to take on Spain's proposal, a &euro;1.5 trillion bond with an annual coupon of 0.5%, it would cost &euro;7.5 billion across the eurozone.  The EU Commissioner with responsibility for a green deal is Frans Timmermans.  He offered his view of the Spanish proposal.  He is an important player in all of this because there will need to be major investment in the green deal.  He stated that the figure of &euro;1.5 trillion has already been mentioned by the European Commission.  That number does not seem far from the scale of investment that would be necessary.  I am of the view that the proposal of the Spanish Government has a double merit.  On one hand, it recognises the magnitude of the challenge, something not everyone accepts.  I am concerned about the lack of acceptance of the scale of the problem throughout the eurozone.  Mr. Timmermans also referred to how the Spanish plan represents a proposal of solidarity at European level.<br\/><br\/>Is the Spanish proposal on or off the table?  Is it receiving serious consideration?  What happened at European level on the last occasion really set the scene for the subsequent decade.  It was a decade of austerity, a time when we needed to invest here in housing, sustainable forms of transport, retrofitting and modernisation of our infrastructure.  In our case, such investment would have future-proofed us from other problems.  Like other member states, our ability to invest was inhibited.<br\/><br\/>Europe will not get a second chance.  This is really make or break.  If Italy does not survive this, for example, there will be catastrophic consequences for the European Union.  This really is a time for Marshall plan thinking and for that kind of solidarity.  Can the Taoiseach let us know whether he favours a relaxation or suspension of the fiscal rules into the future so as long-term investment can continue?<\/p> <p>The general escape clause is temporary.  It is very difficult to conceptualise how it would work on the other side of this, particularly if very large debt has to be taken on.  The Taoiseach might address the approach.  Is the approach he outlined earlier of the mixture of grants and loans really where it is fixed at this stage?  Is there room?  What are we doing to try to create space with other countries to try to look for a different approach?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600015#N00200","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588767600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>There are very alarming signs that both the European Union and the Irish Government are utterly failing to learn the obvious lessons of the current public health emergency and are planning to revert to the failed austerity policies that did such damage in the aftermath of the financial crash of 2008 and to impose the cost and burden of this emergency once again on working people and the key public services on which we depend more than ever.  The fact that the European Union is opting for loans with conditions attached to them immediately sets the alarm bells of austerity ringing.  They have learned nothing.  Such loans and conditions crippled this country, imposed incredible suffering and hardship on people and were utterly counterproductive the last time around, but we have the signs that they are planning to do it all over again.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has warned of a so-called tapering of Covid payments, that is, cuts to these payments, when in fact the Government was forced into acknowledging that nobody could be expected to live on less than &euro;350 per week.  Now, however, we are talking about cutting that payment and pushing into poverty people who are in no way responsible for the fact that they have lost jobs and income.  We are hiring the nurses we so desperately need for the health service on temporary agency contracts - hire-'em-and-fire-'em contracts - whereby they have no rights whatsoever.  As I discovered from speaking to Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha on the phone the other day, we have still not paid most of the nurses the pay award they won as a result of the industrial action they took last year.  In the majority of hospitals the nurses who are protecting us at the moment have not got their pay awards.  It is disgraceful.  There is the failure to intervene to support the Debenhams workers outside, who are being ditched in the most cynical way by a private company still making profits in the North, still operating online services in this country and still operating in the UK which has clearly used the Covid crisis as an opportunity to ditch its workers.  I was talking to the workers outside.  They have been emailing Ministers, who are saying: \"Nothing to do with us.  There is nothing we can do.\"  That is a very worrying sign for the many workers who may face similar job losses as a result of this crisis.  These are bad signs for the future.<\/p>  <p>  It seems to me that the absolutely inescapable lesson of the current public health emergency and the absolutely indisputable conclusion one can draw is that when one is faced with a major emergency and challenge to society, one cannot let austerity and the market dictate the response.  We learned, and the Government learned, that it had to be the State that marshalled all the resources necessary to respond and to take over private healthcare capacity to respond to a public health emergency.  Why, then, would the Government want to revert to a two-tier health system?  Why would it want to employ nurses on temporary contracts through a private agency and then be able to fire them after the crisis?  It makes no sense whatsoever.  If that is true of a health emergency, it is true of a climate emergency, it is true of a housing emergency and it is true of the need to prevent mass unemployment, which we could face in the aftermath of this crisis.<\/p> <p>None of that will be necessary if the State willingly intervenes and marshals the resources that exist in our society.  We have discovered during this crisis that wealth is not paper money.  Wealth lies in the factories that produce ventilators, in the hospitals, in teachers, essential workers and retail workers.  They are the ones who have to be protected and resourced in order that we learn the lessons that this crisis has taught.  Those truths are staring us in the face and yet the Government and the EU seem intent on reverting to the mistakes of the past.<\/p> <p> I urge the Government and the EU to learn those lessons.  We do not have to face austerity and mass unemployment if we take the available wealth and resources and put them into producing a single-tier, properly-resourced health service, resolving the housing crisis, providing for smaller class sizes in schools and redeploying workers who have lost their jobs into the areas in which we need them, such as education, healthcare and public services.  We do not need to repeat the mistakes of the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600017#P00200","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588767900,"counter":37,"content":"<p>Last week, the International Labour Organization stated that 50% of the global workforce are in immediate danger of having their living standards destroyed by the coronavirus.  \"Destroyed\" was its word, not mine.  In some ways, that statement is only half correct because to be fully correct, it would state that those people's living standards will be destroyed by the coronavirus in the framework of market economics.<\/p>  <p>  Ryanair is talking about making 3,000 redundancies, 20% wage cuts and closing bases throughout Europe.  The company says that it cannot afford the cost of the coronavirus crisis to it, effectively in the region of &euro;300 million.  Ryanair made profits of &euro;1 billion last year alone.  It could absorb the hit it is taking but it is choosing not to do so and is placing the burden of the crisis on the backs of the people who work for it.<\/p>  <p>  The European economy is facing a contraction of between 7% and 20%.  Some 60 million jobs are likely to be affected and unemployment may double.  For example, Spain lost 1 million jobs in three weeks.  Clearly, without massive intervention on the part of states in order to save jobs, we face an unemployment disaster.  There have been examples of state intervention in recent weeks.  In France, a &euro;9 billion package for Air France and KLM was announced.  Germany announced a &euro;9 billion package for Lufthansa.<\/p>  <p>  I raise an issue about the retail industry in this State.  Workers from Debenhams were protesting outside the D&aacute;il earlier today in a disciplined and socially-distanced manner.  Standing behind them are hundreds of thousands of retail workers whose jobs are on the line.  That is not an exaggeration.  Retail Ireland estimates that 110,000 jobs are at stake.  Debenhams sets the benchmark; it is a test case.  What are the parties that are negotiating a programme for Government going to do about it?  There are 2,000 jobs involved.  Debenhams has a profitable online business and at least four of its shops, more than one third of the outlets it has in the State, are clearly profitable.  There is the possibility of rent cuts from landlords.  I make the following point to the parties that are negotiating a programme for Government.  It will cost the State more to let those jobs to go by the board, in terms of what is lost in tax revenues and paid out in social welfare payments, than it would to intervene and save them.  Is the Taoiseach going to stand idly by while a profitable Debenhams store on his doorstep in Blanchardstown is allowed to close?  Is the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il going to stand idly by and watch a profitable Debenhams store close in the main street of his city, Cork, and allow another profitable Debenhams shop close within the heart of his constituency at Mahon Point shopping centre?<\/p>  <p>  This is not a matter of providing State aid to Debenhams because the company has walked away.  Instead, it is a case of a State takeover.  People might ask questions about that and call it crazy talk.  However, in a post-Covid-19 world, many things are going to be done that were not done in the past.  This could be done.  The company had ideas for diversification involving coffee shops, possibly wine bars, hairdressing services and so on, although they will not now be implemented.<\/p> <p>Innovative policies to diversify could be implemented under State ownership.  There could be a board in the company to which the Government could appoint representatives, people with economic and business experience etc., but the majority should not be civil servants.  The majority at the heart of the management of such a company could be and should be the workers themselves.  I refer to people who have worked in the company for ten, 15, 20 or more than 25 years, going back to the Roches Stores days.  They know what the customers like and do not like.  They have a strong idea of what would work and what would not work.  They should be put at the heart of the management of the company and it should be run under the control and management of the workers.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach will be discussing the question of a jobs package as part of the programme for Government.  That must examine and focus on the question of jobs in retail, where we are facing a jobs massacre.  The test case for Deputy Martin, the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, and Deputy Ryan is the Debenhams case.  They have got to focus on that.  What are they going to do on it now?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600018#Q00200","speaker":"1522","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588768200,"counter":39,"content":"<p>We go now to the Regional Group.

I have four brief observations to make, both from my own perspective and also on behalf of my good colleagues in the Regional Group.  First, I very much welcome the endorsement by the European Council of the Eurogroup's recommendation to provide an emergency financial package to assist the European states and peoples most affected by this crisis.  The fact that this fund is in excess of &euro;0.5 trillion is very reassuring and is also a very positive development that it will be used to finance the three so-called safety nets - for workers, businesses and member states.  Consequently, I believe this funding will have a significant impact, at least in the short term, once it is finally up and running.<\/p>  <p>  I am also happy to note that this emergency funding is meant to be available from 1 June.  That is very important as it is urgently needed to offset and mitigate the catastrophic socioeconomic consequences of the crisis and, therefore, it cannot come too soon.  Mindful that the first week in June is less than four weeks away, I would be grateful if the Minister could indicate when wrapping up the debate whether we are likely to meet this ambitious target of 1 June as planned and if she could outline the mechanisms that are in place to draw down this funding.  I would also like her to indicate if Ireland will avail of this funding and if there is any conditionality associated with it.<\/p>  <p>  Second, while it is good to see that this emergency funding will shortly be in place to help us get over the acute phase of the crisis, I note with concern that there has yet to be an agreement on the larger and more longer-term recovery fund, which most likely will be linked to the EU budget, the so-called seven year multi-annual financial framework.  It is vital that this recovery fund be proportionate in size to the scale of the challenge we face.  I therefore welcome it being compared to the second Marshall Plan for Europe, designed to ward off potentially the worst recession in a century.  I only hope that the reality matches the ambition of this proposal.<\/p>  <p>  While its scale is important, so is its urgency.  I share the Government's frustration that a deal has not yet been agreed or struck.  I note that the four most recent European Council meetings have been held by video conference and have not been as successful as expected, with Ministers citing the format being as big a barrier to an agreement as the extent of the policy differences between the various Governments.  Consequently, I respectfully suggest that Ireland should push for the next European Council meeting scheduled for 18 and 19 June to be held physically, in person, in Brussels, which could easily be done within social distancing guidelines, as we are doing here today.  For all the advantages of video conferencing, no amount of it can substitute for or compete with an actual physical conference in person, particularly when the stakes are so high and the need for an agreement so pressing.<\/p>  <p>  Third, I welcome the recent announcement of an additional &euro;200 billion in funding available through the European Investment Bank in Luxembourg.<\/p> <p>I welcome that the focus of this funding is on small and medium-sized businesses.  I very much encourage any Irish companies to consider accessing such funding if required and would appreciate greater clarity on how to draw down this finance over the short to medium term.<\/p> <p> Finally, I note with concern yesterday's landmark and explosive ruling by the German constitutional court that the European Central Bank may have strayed beyond its mandate in the past few years with its bond-buying quantitative easing, QE, programme.  Perhaps even more important to this country than the fiscal supports being provided by the EU is the very accommodative monetary assistance provided by the ECB.  It is what keeps our bond yields at historically low levels, thus saving us billions of euro annually in servicing our national debt.  As the ECB has only three months to justify the proportionality of its bond-buying programme to the German court, I would be grateful if the Government would share its view on how it sees the matter progressing at a European level and what impact it will have on Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600019#R00300","speaker":"1587","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588768500,"counter":42,"content":"<p>Deputies Carol Nolan and Mattie McGrath are sharing time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600020#S00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1588768500,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to make some brief remarks on this issue.  When this crisis first emerged, the response of the European Union at Commission and Parliament level could hardly have been described as ideal.  Pleas for meaningful solidarity on the part of Italy, which was enduring horrendous suffering, were met with bureaucratic resistance and an absence of regulatory flexibility.  Fortunately, the pace of the response has picked up somewhat since then, even if many sectors, especially agriculture, remain deeply concerned about its scale and effectiveness.<\/p>  <p>  What I want to see is genuine and constructive engagement with our European partners.  No nation is strong enough to weather this storm alone.  European solidarity has to become more than a clich&eacute; that is trotted out from time to time.  If it is to mean anything, it must deliver practical and timely supports.  I note that the European Commission is co-ordinating a common European response and taking action to reinforce our public health sectors and mitigate the socio-economic impact in the European Union.  This will require mobilising all means at the EU's disposal to help member states to co-ordinate their national responses.<\/p>  <p>  I note the recent submission by the Irish Farmers Association which proposed that the Government and the Commission act swiftly to introduce emergency measures, including using the EU Common Market organisation regulation to support farmers with direct payments for price-related market losses.  This will be one of the central concerns as we go forward into 2020 and 2021.  The cashflow and liquidity crisis facing Irish farmers and the agrifood sector is absolutely enormous.  Only last week I supported the call for a market disruption fund linked to some form of credit guarantee.  At present, agricultural SMEs cannot access the credit guarantee scheme due to state aid rules.  This needs to be reassessed and resolved urgently.  If it means escalating or bringing forward basic payments, then let that happen very quickly because it is needed.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the European Commission's private storage aid scheme, which is something I have been calling for since early March.  However, the EU's response in designating a fairly paltry &euro;80 million to cover the costs of private storage right across the Union is not sufficient.  Who signs off on these packages?  Surely there must be a sense that to do so is counterproductive in that it allows for uncertainty and unpredictability to remain in the markets?  That must be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the EU response to the midlands, I would like clarity on what is happening and is going to happen with the just transition strategy.  I call on the Taoiseach to ensure that the Mulvey report is published without delay.  The wider EU strategy aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% by 2030 and achieve climate neutrality by 2050.<\/p> <p>This will require a socioeconomic transformation in regions like the midlands which has historically relied on fossil fuels and carbon intensive industries such as Bord na M&oacute;na.  Peat extraction is being held hostage by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Its decision to grant Bord na M&oacute;na leave to apply for substituted consent was only issued earlier today.  I welcome this decision.  I believe that common sense has prevailed on this occasion in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Workers, communities and peat harvesting contractors were left in limbo, and that is unacceptable.  We need to ensure that peat harvesting is not tied up in uncertainty, with all power in the hands of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The latter needs to change.<\/p> <p> We recognise that this is not the time for divisiveness within Europe but we also need to recognise the scale of the challenge and to be ambitious enough to take the steps to meet that challenge and ensure that all sectors are supported.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600020#S00300","speaker":"1592","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588768800,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I too thank the Taoiseach for his briefing following the recent European Council meeting which was held by way of video conference.  I note the Taoiseach has left the Chamber but I am sure my remarks will be relayed to him.  At the previous post-European Council meeting debate on Thursday, 5 March, to which I contributed, there were very serious issues emerging.  We did not know then how devastating and serious the pandemic would be.  At the time the Taoiseach stated in the House that he had set out Ireland's position on long-established, well-functioning and successful policies such as the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and had made clear that those policies need to continue to be funded properly.  That could not be truer than it is today.<\/p>  <p>  At the European Council meeting in February the Taoiseach clearly outlined - this is important - that Ireland was willing to contribute more to the budget over the next seven years.  In the debate on 5 March, I pointed out that that could not be done.  We now know that there is no possibility of Ireland doing that.  This means that payments to Irish farmers and important regional and social development programmes such as INTERREG will be cut.  This is obvious.  We now know that despite the Taoiseach's efforts, on 5 March EU Council members rejected Ireland's position, leaving farmers and the agricultural community, agribusiness and related sectors with deep concerns regarding what the cuts to CAP funding would mean.  It was reported after the February meeting that Chancellor Angela Merkel had said that the differences were \"still too great to reach an agreement\" and \"we are going to have to return to the subject of the budget\" during the discussions on the multi-annual financial framework, which is meant to be operational from next year.  That was simply unacceptable at that stage and it is even more unacceptable now.  There are lengthy delays on many issues.<\/p>  <p>  I remember well the financial crisis during which Ireland went broke.  I recall that on the evening of my late mother's funeral the Minister, the late Brian Lenihan, telephoned me as he was leaving Brussels.  I also recall returning his call and asking him not to accept the deal because it was not a deal.  Rather, it was horrible and horrific treatment of Ireland at the hands of the wealthier and stronger countries in Europe, which are the same countries that had shovelled and bulldozed money from their banks into our banks and contributed hugely to our financial crash.  The deal was accepted.  They threw us out and dangled us on a line.  They did not care about Ireland.  We were the good boys.  We made penniless our families in a so-called bailout, which I described then as a clean out, which is what it was.  It was daylight robbery that when we could get money from the IMF for less than 3% we were charged almost 5% for it at European level.  At that time, they showed zero solidarity with a country on the periphery of Europe that had been exemplary Europeans.  We still are trying to be exemplary Europeans, in my view too much so a lot of the time.<\/p>  <p>  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, could outline the possible impact of the decision of the German court in regard to the European Central Bank and the German Central Bank.<\/p> <p>I wonder why they were not keeping an eye on it when they were shovelling money in here, and giving it to our banks to give it to our people and to anybody who wanted it, literally, and then forcing them to pay it back.  A trauma has been visited on our society as a result of the banking crisis.  We are now dealing with a far broader and deeper crisis, and we see the different efforts, with funding of over half a trillion euro.  I note they are going to be loans or supports and there will not be any grant aid, and I note also that Covid-19 bonds were rejected.  Therefore, I see the very same pattern developing among the stronger countries at the centre of Europe and I see the reasons the United Kingdom left the EU, namely, the lack of solidarity and, frankly, the bullying and intimidation of smaller nations.  When our need is there, we are not getting the support.<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, to redouble her efforts to assess the impact of that judgment.  Why are Ms Merkel and the German community so much stronger and why do they wield so much power?  When the group of eight, including Ireland, got together to discuss Covid-19 bonds, they got no support and it fell idly by.  How serious does this have to be before the European project realises there has to be parity of esteem for smaller countries and there have to be meaningful supports for them? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600021#T00200","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588769100,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Catherine Connolly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600022#U00200","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1588769100,"counter":48,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

It certainly seems that is what the European Union is going to do throughout this crisis.  The Taoiseach said earlier that what we should see coming out of this is a fully functioning Single Market.  I would love to know what he means by that and if he would explain it to the House because it is a very interesting statement.  What I take it to mean, and what I take the judgment of the German constitutional court to mean, is that we will have to move to far-reaching European economic union, where, basically, this Parliament will be a county council and we will take our measures from Europe.<\/p><p>It is very interesting how the court judgment is being reported today across Europe.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>refers to &quot;The welcome ruling on Tuesday by the German federal constitutional court that the European Central Bank&rsquo;s (ECB) massive 2014 quantitative easing...&quot;.  However, other European copy raises concerns and suggests it is actually undermining the European Union.  I would like to know what Ireland's intention is and where we want to go.  To take what the Taoiseach is saying, as well as what was said by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, the ultimate outcome of this will be that we resign ourselves to becoming a county council that accepts diktats on European measures.  I, for one, do not think that is the way we should go.  We should look to build a Europe of equals, which we are not, but this seems to be the underhand way it has happened within Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, in the D&aacute;il and in Ireland.  It seems to be the case that we will use this crisis to build up momentum and we will get treaty change down the road.  Treaty change is ultimately what will have to come.<\/p><p>One commentator on the Politico website states: <\/p> <blockquote> \tSome worry that the ruling effectively neuters the ECB, blunting the famous declaration made by then-president Mario Draghi in 2012 to do &ldquo;whatever it takes&rdquo; to save the euro.  That's because the decision makes clear that the central bank doesn&rsquo;t have carte blanche to follow through on Draghi's pledge.<br \/><br \/>Many economists believe the only way to resolve the tensions around the ECB&rsquo;s mandate is to amend the EU treaties to both broaden the bank&rsquo;s purview and to give the eurozone fiscal powers, which would make the currency area less dependent on the ECB in times of crisis. <\/blockquote>  <p>&quot;Fiscal powers&quot; means to give the bank parliamentary powers and it means us giving up our powers.  The Politico article continues:<\/p> <blockquote> \t'It is clear that the eurozone cannot continue to muddle through with creative interpretation of EU law by the ECB,' said Stanislas Jourdan, executive director of Positive Money Europe ... 'More than ever, eurozone institutions, starting with the ECB, are in need of a treaty overhaul.' <\/blockquote> <p>What this will actually mean is that a centralised Europe will be given more powers and that we will consign our country to being a county council within the EU.  Some would argue that perhaps we are already and that we just take whatever they tell us and get on with it.  At the time of the bailout, we took our medicine and got on with it and sacrificed the people, our housing and our homeless in order to ensure that Europe moved forward.  Will the Minister of State clearly lay out the Government's stance on this, because it is very important?  Over the next 18 months we will see a European treaty change to broaden and increase the powers Europe has.  Is this what the Government will support and call for?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600022#U00400","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588769700,"counter":51,"content":"<p>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin referred to the deeply corrosive effect of no action being taken in respect of the suspension of parliament in Hungary.  I have the same concerns about the suspension of that parliament.  What I think is deeply corrosive is the gap between the language used by our leaders in the Government here and their counterparts in Europe and the reality on the ground.  This is what is deeply corrosive to the democratic process and I am very concerned about it.  Lovely words were used today by the Taoiseach or the incoming Taoiseach &ndash; I am not sure which &ndash; about Europe.  These words included \"solidarity\" and \"equality\", and there was mention of the four freedoms.  The reality is so removed from this that it beggars belief one would use this language without looking at what is happening in our name in Europe.<\/p>  <p>  While I welcome its belated effort, when this crisis originally broke the EU failed to mount a collective humanitarian response and has struggled for months to put together a package.  It blatantly ignored the relevant article in the Lisbon treaty that spoke about acting collectively if a country came under threat from a natural disaster or other type of problem.  The EU is founded on cross-border freedom and mutual solidarity but several countries, including Austria and Germany, unilaterally moved to close their borders.  Of course, Ireland did not close its border.  Italy, which has suffered tremendously, invoked the disaster fund, which is meant to facilitate the sharing of vital medicinal supplies between members, but not a single European country responded to Italy's call to activate the fund.  It was not until weeks later that the EU approved a &euro;50 million package to Italy to help produce ventilators and personal protective equipment.  If I have an opportunity I will return to this point.<\/p>  <p>  Most EU nations imposed export restrictions on medical supplies.  That was some solidarity.  Germany blocked shipments of 240,000 masks to Austria.  The French authorities commandeered the distribution of 6 million masks from Swedish companies that were already contracted to other countries.  The people who were most down did not rely on the ever-increasing closer union.  A team of Chinese health experts arrived on 13 March to help Italy.  Russia sent help.  Cuba, which has been subjected to more and more restrictions through the US embargo, about which Europe says nothing, sent doctors.  Criticism of the treatment of Italy came from the European Commission President, who said a heartfelt apology was owed to Europe.  The question must be asked as to whether the EU finally mobilised because of shame with regard to action taken by China, Russia and Cuba.<\/p>  <p>  On the Greek islands, 42,000 asylum seekers are trapped in five hotspots but nobody has mentioned them today.  Not a single one of our esteemed leaders of the bigger parties mentioned this situation.  There is capacity for only 6,000 people.  On Lesbos, there are 20,000 people in a camp.  These figures come from the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights.  Our fundamental rights are absolutely being affected by the measures taken.<\/p> <p>On Lesbos, there are 20,000 people in a camp built for 2,840 while on Samos there are 6,000 people living in a centre for 650 people, and so on.  There has been no action by Europe on Palestine and the serious situation for those who have been placed under a blockade by the Israelis.  There are many other examples.<\/p> <p> In my final minute, I want to go back again to language.  We have used the language of war to deal with this virus.  Indeed, the Minister, Deputy Harris, has repeatedly used the language of war and has used personal words in respect of the virus, saying it is vicious, nasty, not nice, horrible.  What is not nice is our reaction to dealing with it in a prepared way.  What is nasty is our failure to have our health service in a position to deal with the virus.  Europe is behind that because, following Europe's directions, we ran down our health service for a very long time and we built up our military capacity.  If we are serious about a new world, about learning something and not going back to the type of unsustainable development that we had, in every sense of the word, then the first thing for the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, to do is make a statement here today on our military budget to Europe.  She should make a statement on stopping our payments under Permanent Structured Cooperation on Security and Defence, PESCO, and should state that we will withdraw from PESCO.  If we are seriously interested in humanitarian help, then let us look at what is going into a military budget in the guise of pretending that we are defending each other.  When the test came and we had to defend our countries against the so-called nasty, vicious virus, we utterly failed to do so as Europeans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600023#V00200","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588770000,"counter":53,"content":"<p>We now move to the questions and answers session with the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee.

The ECB may yet have an escape route, so to speak.  However, this does reveal a mindset consistent with an ongoing divide.  Some see a collective approach to crisis, be it the financial crisis or in this context of a global pandemic, from European institutions.  They believe that the ECB is independent and that we do need a collective response either through a coronabond or through financial instruments which, to be fair to the bank, it has deployed.  Has the Government received legal advice from the Attorney General on this?  What has been the initial response from the Commission in terms of the legal experts and the sense of the next stage in this?  There is a stage where the Bundesbank has three months, I think, to engage but I am more interested in the European understanding of the court.  It is the first time that a national court is essentially challenging the European Court of Justice, apart from the financial issues and the ECB.  This is a very serious development, which could undermine the entire cohesion of the EU itself.

Many areas are impacted by the current situation but there is one that, it seems to me, the Government should have been thinking about already in our discussions with Europe.  One thing that has been revealed clearly is that our public health system is under capacity.  We have the lowest levels of ICU and of GP cover and the fewest hospital beds as a proportion of our population.  We have sailed dangerously close to the wind.  I do not think anybody could disagree that we need permanent increases in the capacity of our health service, across the board.  We need to make the case to Europe that there have to be increases in the expenditure in those areas to bring up our health system to safe levels.  I wonder whether the Government has thought about that and whether it is discussing it with Europe.<\/p>  <p>  Has there been any discussion about what Israel is doing with the Palestinians, as was mentioned by Deputy Connolly?  The Palestinians believe that Israel is using the public health emergency - the Covid-19 crisis - as an opportunity to advance further illegal annexations of Palestinian land in the West Bank.  That is very concerning and I hope the Government and Europe are responding to it.  Will the Minister of State indicate whether there has been a response?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600026#Y00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1588770600,"counter":69,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's general comment, while everyone accepts that the initial EU response was not as quick as we would have liked, one of the challenges in responding to Covid-19 is that we are facing a health crisis.  What happens in our health system is different from that of Germany, France or Greece.  It is a national competency, and trying to respond collectively to the crisis was difficult.  While we fell down in certain areas, we have tried in the initial stages - whether through the relaxation of state aid rules, the response investment initiative, the &euro;750 billion provided through the European Central Bank or the three other pillars that, we hope, will be in place by 1 June - to provide funding to invest in our healthcare systems to ensure that our priority is to save lives and protect the health of our citizens.<\/p>  <p>  One matter we are discussing, and the Commission has published a paper on this, is how we will exit the crisis safely.  The exit strategy is very much in line with what we have been looking at here in Ireland, whereby we will have an increased capacity for testing and for contact-tracing.  Most importantly, not only if there is a second wave of Covid-19 but if anything like it happens again, we will have capacity within our hospitals to deal with it.  We all need to reflect on the matter.  Health ministers in the EU are engaging regularly as to how we can, collectively, respond to this kind of crisis again.  It has highlighted gaps that we will need to fill, whether in respect of personal protective equipment, or types of medicine, medical equipment or machinery.  Acknowledgment will certainly be taken that there are areas in which we need to improve.  Health is still a national competency and we cannot move away from that, but we can certainly learn from this and from one another.<\/p> <p>The second issue was not raised at the latest European Council meeting but I will get a response back to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600026#Y00400","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588770900,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Is the Government's opinion the same as it was after the February meeting of the European Council when the Taoiseach said that Ireland was in a position to be a net contributor to the MFF over the next seven years and would pay more?

The coronavirus has added to that so our view remains the same.  We should increase our overall budget.  We have seen how we have benefited from our membership of the EU in the funding we have received back.  We have also seen how we have benefited from our membership of the Single Market.  There was a question earlier on what the Taoiseach means when he talks about going back to a fully functioning Single Market.  The Single Market is integral to the free movement of our goods and people and to the functioning of our economies.  It is important that we protect it and that as we work through this crisis, the Single Market, which is still not complete and requires much work in the areas of goods, services and the digital single market, we continue our work and use it.  As we develop in these areas, we must adapt to the situation we find ourselves in and that particularly applies to the digital single market.  To answer the Deputy's question, we still feel we should pay more but, at the same time, we are not willing to pay more if priorities such as CAP, cohesion funding and investment in research and innovation are not protected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600027#Z00300","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1588770900,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I want to ask about the European Commission private storage aid.

In particular, if one looks at our membership PESCO, we are involved in programmes such as maritime surveillance and peacekeeping.  We are not in any way moving towards, as is often suggested, an EU army.  When one looks at our triple lock system, our neutrality, in the same way as for other member states which have joined PESCO, will not and cannot be impacted or changed without the wish of Irish citizens.<\/p> <p>A vote would obviously be required to do that, but I do not see it changing any time soon.<\/p> <p> What is important, as I will outline shortly, is that we are providing a massive amount of humanitarian assistance and aid through our Europe response.  In terms of Ireland's specific response, we have provided &euro;60 million in funding, which was previously committed, in direct or repurposed grants to enable our UN and other partners to respond rapidly to the situation on the ground.  We have tripled our funding to the World Health Organization, and the Taoiseach, in a conference that took place last week, pledged &euro;18 million to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.  A huge effort is being put into supporting and protecting the member states and countries outside the EU that do not have the necessary finance or capabilities, whether that is to do with vaccines or otherwise.  This is where the money is going.  The suggestion that a large amount of money is going into defence or any type of EU army is simply not the case.<\/p> <p> Regarding the Single Market and any type of treaty change, it was the case before the coronavirus, and I do not believe it has changed, that any move towards a treaty change is not something we would support at this point.  Again, I can be corrected on that but I do not believe it is something to which we would be positively disposed, nor do I believe we are moving in the direction of individual member states becoming like county councils.  I do not agree with that statement.<\/p> <p> In his statement the Taoiseach set out the wide range of measures already taken or under development at EU level to protect citizens and businesses during the current crisis.  Like at home, the focus has been on protecting life and health in the first instance as well as working to mitigate economic damage and to chart a path to recovery.  Leaders have also correctly recognised that for the fight against Covid-19 to be successful it must have a global reach, and the EU has an important leadership role to play.  We saw this in action on Monday when the EU took the lead in hosting a pledging conference during which &euro;7.4 billion was pledged in support of the search for a vaccine, for medicines and for tests.  This is something that Ireland strongly supports and, as the Taoiseach outlined, we announced a pledge on behalf of the Irish people of &euro;18 million to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.  This will be paid over the course of the next five years so that the poorest countries in the world will have access to a Covid-19 vaccine if, as we obviously hope, and when it is developed.  That funding adds to the &euro;60 million that Ireland has committed previously.  We have quadrupled our contribution to the World Health Organization to &euro;9.5 million.<\/p> <p> Until there are effective diagnostics, treatments and a vaccine universally available, every region and country remains vulnerable to a renewed surge of the pandemic.  On 8 April, development Ministers endorsed the Team Europe global response to Covid-19 with &euro;15.6 billion mobilised by the Commission for the European Investment Bank and over &euro;4 billion via member states targeting fragile and vulnerable countries.  Such countries are facing enormous health and economic challenges as a result of the pandemic.  The Team Europe collective approach is designed to approve a fast response on the ground where it is needed most, supporting health systems and also helping to alleviate the socioeconomic impacts of Covid-19.  In the next 20 minutes the Taoiseach will take part, by video conference, in a summit of the EU and the western Balkan leaders.  The key focus of that summit will be co-operation and support between the EU and the region throughout this crisis.  On 29 April, the European Commission announced over &euro;3.3 billion of EU financial support, mobilised jointly with the European Investment Bank, to specifically benefit the western Balkan citizens.  Having been on a conference call this morning with many of the leaders, I believe that, now more than ever, as we move towards the opening of the enlargement session process with North Macedonia and Albania, it is important that citizens see this solidarity.  It is also important as we exit this crisis that we work in unison not just within the EU but also with our partnering countries and states.<\/p> <p> We have seen from the beginning of this crisis that the virus does not respect borders and does not recognise countries.  To beat it and to forge a recovery, Ireland and the EU must think and act globally.  This week the EU took a significant step in this regard.  Ireland has made it very clear that it is willing and ready to play its part with its EU partners and the rest of the world in the global fight against Covid-19.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600027#Z00800","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1588771500,"counter":79,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 2.10 p.m. and resumed at 2.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Establishment of Special Committee on Covid-19 Response: Motion","time":1588772100,"counter":80,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600029#FF00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1588772100,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders&mdash;

I have addressed the House on a number of occasions to reflect on tourism but never in the circumstances in which the sector now finds itself.  It is right and proper that the primary focus of the Government should be on the public health crisis response.  Nevertheless, we must also ensure that we do our utmost to help our economy to recover from what is the worst short-term economic shock in the history of the State.<\/p>  <p>  The importance of tourism in Ireland cannot be overstated.  The sector has made a huge economic and social contribution in recent years and played a leading role in driving the recovery from the latest economic calamity.  Tourism plays a pivotal role, particularly in rural and regional areas, with most earnings retained within the country.  Until now, as a labour-intensive sector contributing directly to more than 11% of employment, tourism has been a leading job creator, supporting 260,000 jobs in 2019.  It is the largest indigenous sector.  In normal circumstances, tourism helps to provide diverse employment opportunities for many lower-skilled workers and those unable to work full time.  It also provides employment in rural communities and other often economically disadvantaged locations where alternative opportunities can be limited. <\/p> <p>Approximately 70% of tourism jobs are located in regional and rural areas outside Dublin.  Tourism is a significant export sector, with the majority of tourism spending being generated by overseas tourists.  In 2019, international tourists spent more than &euro;5 billion in Ireland compared with approximately &euro;2.4 billion spent by residents of Ireland, North and South.  The breakdown is roughly 2:1.<\/p> <p> Tourism is one of the most directly affected sectors in the current crisis.  With international aviation at a virtual standstill, the closure of tourism sites and a ban on public gatherings, the impact of Covid-19 on global tourism is overwhelming and immediate and has impacted travel and tourism like no other event in history.  In the space of a few short weeks, the Irish tourism and hospitality industry has been decimated, with job losses in the sector estimated at this stage to be in excess of 200,000.  The devastation being experienced is unprecedented.  I sincerely empathise with those who have lost their jobs and livelihoods as a result.<\/p> <p> For international tourism, the OECD projects that the shock could amount to a 75% decline globally in 2020.  It is important, however, to note that the scale of the impact remains difficult to estimate given the unknowns that exist.  The OECD also estimates that domestic tourism across the globe is expected to recover more quickly, but it will still be badly hit.  It could be down 50% or more by year end.  Crucially, all of this assumes that economic activity, both domestically and internationally, begins to recover significantly in quarters 3 and 4.  If that does not occur, the results will be even worse.  Many tourism businesses have now written off 2020 completely and some may not reopen until 2021.  Others may go out of business and never reopen.  It is likely to take years to recover business to anything like 2019 levels.<\/p> <p> Since the crisis began, the Minister, Mr. Ross, and I have engaged with the industry with a view to understanding its concerns and needs.  We established and participate in a Covid-19 tourism monitoring group made up of industry stakeholders, tourism agencies and Department officials.  The group first met on 26 February and has met seven times in total thus far, including yesterday afternoon.  That first meeting on 26 February was at the very start of the crisis here and we tried to get on top of it as early as possible.  The meeting was the day after the postponement of the Ireland versus Italy rugby game.  The information we have received from these meetings has been most valuable in formulating a response to the crisis in terms of how our agencies operate and the Government's response.  I thank all the people who have been involved with the body to date.<\/p> <p> F&aacute;ilte Ireland has set up a Covid-19 industry advisory group which meets weekly.  The purpose of the group is to provide supports to the tourism industry and to facilitate the rapid sharing of information and insights to help improve the sector's understanding of and response to the crisis.  In addition, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has developed and rolled out a suite of training and advisory supports for tourism businesses that enables them to respond to the challenges and threats now being faced by the sector.  The focus of the supports has shifted from the shutdown phase of the crisis to the business survival phase, with a focus on preparing businesses to reopen and relaunch.<\/p> <p> For its part, Tourism Ireland has postponed virtually all of its overseas promotional activity.  It will resume activity when the time is right, not just in Ireland but also in our key markets.  As a first step, it will carry out market research in some of those markets to gauge consumer sentiments towards holidaying again in a post-crisis environment.<\/p> <p> Tourism must seek to survive before it can start to recover.  The Government's focus to date has been on supporting those who have lost their jobs and supporting businesses to remain viable during this difficult time, with specially targeted supports to assist companies to stay operational and retain their staff.  The Department has liaised with other Departments and industry representative bodies to align the economy-wide Covid-19 supports and initiatives with tourism and hospitality needs.  As a result, many tourism businesses are now availing of the various cross-sectoral economic supports the Government has already put in place, including the wage subsidy scheme, increased unemployment benefits, the State credit guarantee scheme, working capital loan schemes, enterprise support schemes and the deferral of tax liabilities, VAT, social contributions and local authority rates.<\/p> <p> In recent weeks, the Minister and I met representatives of the pillar banks and Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland to discuss difficulties being experienced by tourism businesses in accessing low-cost financial supports.  We also met representatives of Insurance Ireland to highlight issues with the business interruption elements of policies and to press for a reduction in premiums for tourism businesses that are now closed.<\/p> <p> The depth and breadth of COVID-19 related impacts on tourism and the wider economy mean that a speedy recovery is unlikely.<\/p> <p>It is likely that the restart of the sector will be slow and phased and it will not be easy.  We should not forget that it is a people-industry and these are the types of enterprises which are likely to be the last to return to full normality.<\/p> <p> As a first step we must work with public health authorities to establish ways of making tourism enterprises safe for workers and consumers.  On 1 May, the Government published a roadmap for reopening society and business to ease the Covid-19 restrictions and reopen the economy in phases.  The framework sets out how we can keep the level of transmission as low as possible while balancing continuing restrictions proportionately with the positive social and economic benefits which will be brought about by lifting restrictions.  Phase 1 provides for the welcome reopening of outdoor public amenities and tourism sites such as carparks, beaches, mountain walks where people are non-stationary and where social distancing can be maintained.  The inclusion of golf as a sporting activity from the beginning of phase 1 is welcome for domestic tourism.  Phase 2 will extend the travel limit from 5 km to 20 km and public libraries may reopen.  Under phase 3 caf&eacute;s and restaurants will reopen on 29 June.  Hotels, hostels, caravan parks and holiday parks will reopen under phase 4 on 20 July.  Phase 5 will see pubs, bars and nightclubs reopening, hopefully, on 10 August.<\/p> <p> It is important that the tourism sector now puts plans in place for reopening in line with this roadmap.  It will take some weeks for businesses to put adequate provisions in place to cater for social distancing which will be very challenging for certain enterprises and their employees.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is currently preparing a framework and guidelines, in conjunction with public health authorities, to assist the sector in this regard.<\/p> <p> Tourism and hospitality businesses will require liquidity, working capital and business development funding to continue trading because demand and bookings from our international markets will be very slow to recover.  The Government agreed on 2 May, at a special Cabinet meeting, a suite of measures to support further small, medium and larger business that are negatively impacted by Covid-19.  The latest measures announced at the weekend are a &euro;10,000 restart grant for micro and small businesses; a three month commercial rates waiver for impacted businesses; a &euro;2 billion pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund within the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF; and a &euro;2 billion Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme to support lending to and the warehousing of tax liabilities for a period of 12 months after recommencement of trading.<\/p> <p> Once we get the sector back open, we can look at what type of actions are needed to stimulate the recovery in the sector.  For example, domestic tourism is sure to play a big part this year and next given the international tourism situation and how slow it is anticipated it will return.  The Minister, Shane Ross, and I are considering the most effective structures to develop the recovery plan required for the tourism sector.  We have already had some very useful contributions and proposals from industry stakeholders and our tourism agencies in this regard and all of these will receive due consideration as we develop a longer term tourism recovery plan for this important sector.<\/p> <p> Given the severity of the crisis there are calls from the industry to reduce the VAT rate for tourism.  Tourism will be a very competitive market globally as recovery takes hold and competing destinations will all be considering how they can best gain a competitive advantage.  Tourism businesses are already putting together sales and marketing plans for 2021 and an early decision on a lower VAT rate for 2021 would help the industry to put forward competitively priced packages.  This is something I will seek from the Government.  It is something I am very passionate about and it will be much needed during the recovery phase.  However, any measures taken, particularly on anything related to economic recovery, must be well co-ordinated across all sectors of the economy.  A balance is required to ensure any measures taken will benefit the economy as a whole.<\/p> <p> I will impress upon my colleagues in government the importance of supporting tourism in the recovery phase.  I am under no illusions, however, that we as a country will face some very difficult choices on public expenditure in the coming years.  Tourism has faced many challenges in the past, including 9\/11, SARS, the volcanic ash cloud and foot and mouth disease, for example, but the current crisis is greater than all of those combined and it will take a huge effort to get tourism back into a well working recovery mode but we will all do our best.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600029#FF00250","speaker":"1581","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588773300,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I will share time with Deputies Calleary, Foley and Christopher O'Sullivan.  I will use six minutes to make a statement rather than pose questions.  Perhaps the Minister will impose on the Taoiseach to use one of his &quot;Six One&quot; or &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; slots to give answers.<\/p> <p>In the meantime, I want to get some things on the record.  First, I regret that the senior Minister is not here.  I do not doubt the commitment of the Minister of State but I have an issue if those monitoring groups, like the Zoom meeting the Minister of State had with industry yesterday, are not getting to the Cabinet table.  Unfortunately, despite the deserved work of the Minister of State over the years in tourism, he is not in the Cabinet.  I have a concern that these issues are not getting to Cabinet.<\/p> <p> Let us consider the business announcements of last Saturday.  Funnily enough, they were not made to the House but to the media, which is standard.  At least Hungary has formally suspended its parliament.  We have simply somewhat suspended our Parliament in terms of the workings of it.  I would prefer if such announcements were made to the House.  Be that as it may, the announcements last Saturday were one-size-fits-all and are not worth the paper they were written on, frankly.  There is an 80% business guarantee scheme on the never-never.  Money is coming in from abroad at -0.75% through SBCI.  It goes to banks.  They then add on 3% or 4% and apply their own arbitrary underwriting to screw businesses into the ground.  That is not the kind of support that is going to support the 20,000 businesses that are already closed in the country.  Of 260,000 employees, some 175,000 have already lost their jobs.  How many will get them back?  We do not know.  At the moment there are no industry-specific measures that have been identified to help.<\/p> <p> The Zoom meetings the Minister of State has had since 26 February clearly have had no impact.  I have outlined why in terms of Cabinet.  That is a worrying concern.  The first thing the Minister of State needs is a task force with a direct line to Cabinet.  This should include people like publicans, who know how to operate a pub; hoteliers, who know how to operate a hotel; restaurateurs, who know how to operate a restaurant; and all the various tour operators, including adventure tourism and the various other types we have in this country.  They should be informing the Minister of State.  The health people can tell us how it must operate from a health perspective, but those in industry know how to put that stuff into practice.  We have not had their input.  We have had superficial meetings but the things identified have not come forward.<\/p> <p> The first thing that needs to happen with the two European Commissioners who advocate sector-specific measures is that the Germans and the Dutch need to get with the programme.  The Germans in particular should cast their minds back to the post Second World War era.  We need a Europe-wide perpetual bond so that we can put aside or warehouse the entire cost of this.  Fiscally, we would then be free to introduce the kind of sector-specific measures that will be required to get our industries out of trouble.<\/p> <p> Do we really need to wait until the end of July to reopen hotels?  The Minister of State should talk to the hoteliers.  Is there a way that we can bring that back a month?  What we are asking these people to do is close for five months and then reopen, be happy and make money operating at 50% capacity.  Regarding publicans, I will use Sligo town as an example.  I can think of only six of however many pubs there are in the town that could open and apply these social distancing measures.  What are we doing for pubs?<\/p> <p> Another specific measure the Minister of State must look at is 0% VAT.  The Minister of State has said it himself and I am pleased to hear it.  Again, however, he is not at Cabinet.  These are issues that need to be looked at.  Is the message getting through to Robert Watt and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe?  It is the case that 13% of nothing is nothing but 0% VAT allows those people offering tourism product a 13% competitive advantage.  As the Minister of State said, tourism will be highly competitive in the new period.  There is no doubt about that.  As matters stand, from a VAT perspective we are the 28th most expensive country in Europe.  Will we look at that?  Will we look at excise on alcohol to try to get people in on the basis that these people will not be in a position to be viable at 50% capacity?  Again, if the Minister of State had the expertise of the trade in the decision-making room, he would know all of this already.  The superficial Zoom meetings need to be backed up with tangible action and not a one-size-fits-all arrangement announced on Saturday to some media organisation.  It should have been done in the House.  There should be scrutiny and examination and it should be tested by Members, not only the chosen few, like myself, who are lucky to have their names drawn from the hat and get in here to speak for a few minutes once a week or every fortnight.<\/p> <p> We also need to look at the French scheme on commercial rents.  It is called the 60-20-20 scheme.  Under that scheme, 60% of commercial rents are subsidised by the French Government, 20% is reduced by the landlord and 20% is paid by the commercial tenant.  In terms of loan schemes, we need to look at 0% loans.  The Government can borrow at -0.75%.  It should get this funding to the people who need it in the meantime.  Commercial rates should be suspended for 12 months.  That is what businesses will need.  Everyone will need 12 months.  What is more, the Government cannot expect local authorities to take the heat on that.  It must give them the money in advance or give them the money they are going to lose so that they can continue to provide services locally.<\/p> <p>Reopening or restarting grants of between &euro;10,000 and &euro;30,000 will be required.  Again, this is all contingent on Europe getting with the programme and realising we need to set aside the entire cost of this.  In the context of Ireland, that cost could be &euro;30 billion.<\/p> <p> America will have a programme worth &euro;50 billion to try to support the aviation industry.  One thing I have a problem with is EC Regulation No. 261\/2004, which the Minister of State's Government promoted and asked for in a European context.  The regulation stops people getting refunds.  I understand that airlines need cashflow at this time but why not let the airlines give the Government a credit note such that the Government pays back the hard-pressed families the cost of the holiday they will face?<\/p> <p> I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could take some of those matters on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600031#HH00200","speaker":"1606","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588774500,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I know that talking about economic issues in the context of 1,339 people who have lost their lives can be cruel for people, particularly the families involved, but we also have to focus on getting people back to work.  Tourism, as the Minister of State said, has taken the biggest hit.  I have a couple of questions for him.<\/p>  <p>  This is a general question to all Ministers.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, suggested there will be flexibility for businesses to open more quickly.  Who measures the flexibility?  Will there be a central mechanism for organisations and industries - we have heard from the vintners and the hairdressers - that think they can come up with social distancing measures more quickly?  To whom do they talk, and how will they be measured?<\/p>  <p>  There is huge confusion about the schemes announced at the weekend.  It is not a &euro;10,000 grant; it is a cap of &euro;10,000, and it is linked entirely to the rates paid in 2019.  That differs fundamentally from other schemes such as that in the North, where for tourism and hospitality the figure is up to &pound;25,000.  That is more reflective of the amount of money that will be needed for hotels with big properties to try to get up and running, perhaps at much less capacity than normal and without bar income, based on current plans.<\/p>  <p>  On working capital, as the Minister of State said, some businesses may not open until at least 2021 or possibly 2022.  The current proposals look at six-month interest-free and payment-free issues.  That will not work for tourism when income may not run until 2021 or 2022.  What flexibility is there for tourism and hospitality specific products within the schemes announced at the weekend?  The reduction of the VAT rate to zero has to happen, but unless we get working capital in, most businesses will not have the capacity to open.  It is important, therefore, that we get clarification on that issue first.<\/p>  <p>  Commercial rent still has not been adequately dealt with by the Government.  Many landlords are still demanding rent.  The Minister of State mentioned that insurance companies are not paying out on business interruption.  This is an interruption beyond anyone's control, including that of the tourism industry.  We need much more force from the Government in taking on the insurance companies, as well as in taking on the banks which are administering all the schemes that have been announced with a very heavy hand, not realising what they are doing to small businesses, particularly in tourism and hospitality, in order to get them back up and running.<\/p>  <p>  What is the capacity for 2021?  Many tourism interests made investment this year in coaches, for instance, or extensions.  They need to be given a break to protect the industry for reopening on the international markets in 2020 or 2021.  Our local tourism promotion co-operatives need support.  They have done huge work.  Their membership will not be in a position to support themselves.  Our regional airports need support.  They are essential to getting the tourism industry back up and running for incoming visitors.  They need to be protected during 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, regarding the col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge, the closure of col&aacute;ist&iacute; samhraidh right across the country will have a massive impact on domestic tourism.

To my mind, however, the most important truth, dare I say it, is that County Kerry is the jewel in the crown of the Irish tourism industry, hosting 2.2 million overseas and Irish visitors every year.  Last year alone, tourism was worth some &euro;661 million to Kerry and supported one in five of our workforce and their families.  Now, all our hotels, guest houses, bed and breakfast accommodation, bus operators, restaurants, pubs and visitor facilities are in lockdown.  Covid-19 has forced 82% of the hospitality workforce into unemployment.<\/p> <p>Tourism supply and support businesses have also been severely affected, with thousands of employees out of work and companies struggling simply to survive.<\/p> <p> The hit to Kerry is likely to be in the order of between &euro;300 million and &euro;400 million and will impact on every town, village and local community in my home county.  We now have a provisional timetable for the reopening of the tourism sector, but if tourism is to survive and ultimately thrive post-Covid-19, it needs much more than just a timetable.<\/p> <p> In that regard, I ask the Minister for State to consider and address the following points.  Why have seasonal workers, so vital to the tourism industry, been excluded from the Covid-19 payment?  Will the Department insist on a VAT rate of 0% for a two-year period with immediate effect, followed by a scaled increase to a maximum of 9%?  Will the Minister of State commit to rate relief for six or nine months, with a further commitment to fund local authorities for revenues lost?  Will he consider a revision of the criteria for local enterprise office, LEO, support mechanisms to facilitate employment grants for the tourism sector?  Will he also consider a rebate on insurance premiums for the periods that businesses are closed?  Will he consider a business reactivation fund to support businesses in reopening?  We require a fair and equitable reopening schedule for restaurants, public houses and other facilities so that no single sector is disadvantaged by virtue of the timetable.  I also suggest an extension of the wage subsidy scheme for a further six to 12 months.<\/p> <p> Ba mhaith liom c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; maidir leis na col&aacute;ist&iacute; Gaeilge shamhraidh.

I am here today, like everybody else, to highlight the hardships that our tourism sector is facing.  There is no doubt that the sector will face a massive struggle in post-pandemic Ireland.  While other sectors will be impacted, we can all agree that tourism will face the longest road back when this pandemic has abated.<\/p>  <p>  Tourism is of vital importance to our economic health.  The industry employs more than 260,000 people.  It generated &euro;7.5 billion in revenue last year and was worth &euro;1.7 billion to the Exchequer.  It is fair to say that 2020 has been an economic write-off for tourism.  These tourism businesses emerged from the quiet months of January and February into an absolute economic lockdown.  It has devastated many of the towns and villages that rely on tourism to put bread on the table.  In my own county of Cork, for example, the hotel industry once employed 6,000 people.  That number has been whittled down to 400 people.  We are talking about absolute devastation to the industry.<\/p>  <p>  The tourism sector is an ecosystem of thousands of delicately balanced, community-based small and medium sized enterprises that are the economic backbone of rural towns and villages in Ireland.  West Cork, where I am from, is a perfect example of that, similar to Kerry, of which Deputy Foley spoke.<\/p>  <p>  I am not asking for an immediate opening of the floodgates and acknowledge that public health has to come first.  However, when we beat this thing, and we will, we must be in a position where we can hit the ground running.  We need a dedicated plan to help the sector.  I firmly believe that just throwing money at advertising campaigns is not good enough and while interest-free loans and reductions in VAT are steps in the right direction, they are not enough.  Significant grant aid is needed for the businesses affected.  Businesses in the tourism sector are finding it incredibly difficult to access finance at the moment because there are questions about the viability of those businesses and the banks are classifying them as a high-risk category.  That does not make sense because those businesses were viable before Covid-19 and will be again.  What we need is grant aid.  Those businesses need a stimulus and money in their pockets so that they can pay and retain staff and keep their businesses afloat.<\/p> <p>In my first address in the Chamber I called for a reduction in VAT.  I am calling for that again.  Will the Government consider a 0% VAT rate for these industries?  Will it begin the planning for a campaign to reinvigorate domestic tourism in the medium term?  What is it the Government doing to ensure the long-term return of international tourism?  Will it consider providing significant grant aid for those businesses?  These operators need clarity.  Restaurant and caf&eacute; owners need to know how much space they need to put between tables.  How many people will be allowed in their premises?  Will Perspex divisions, for example, work?  They need to know the answers to those questions.  Can the Government provide clear guidance to those businesses to ensure they know precisely what they need to do to reopen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600034#LL00200","speaker":"1545","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588775400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I very much welcome the opportunity to speak.  I am sharing time with Teachta Cullinane and Teachta Daly - five minutes each.<\/p>  <p>  When we heard on the news over the weekend that tourism was among the sectors worst hit by the Covid-19 job losses, it came as confirmation for most of us rather than a surprise.  The sector is crucial.  In many areas it is the beating heart of local economies but, dependent as it is on the movement of people, it has been decimated by Covid-19.  The tourism and hospitality sector supports an estimated 260,000 jobs in Ireland.  That is 11% of total employment, making it our largest local employer, and it has reached into every region and county.  Some 70% of jobs in the sector are outside Dublin - 6,500 of them are in my county of Meath - highlighting the regional contribution of tourism and its vital role in spreading employment opportunities and prosperity across the entire country.<\/p>  <p>  In recent weeks we have seen pubs and restaurants, shops, hotels, guest houses, bed and breakfast premises, museums, galleries, theatres, visitor centres, tour operators - the list goes on - closed, many with hundreds of employees who have thousands of years of combined working experience.  For many, it is a lifetime's work.  I extend my solidarity to those workers at this uncertain time.<\/p>  <p>  If the economic impact is great, I suggest that the social impact is many times that.  Festivals, events and places that bring people together are all out of bounds.  These are matters of the greatest importance.  Literally hundreds of thousands of workers and their families - entire communities in some cases - are waiting in anticipation.<\/p>  <p>  I have two questions for the Minister of State.  We need a dedicated recovery plan for the tourism and hospitality sector.  The business supports announced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, at the weekend do not go anywhere near far enough.  They are not ambitious enough, focused enough or extensive enough.  Will the Minister of State commit to the establishment of a tourism recovery task force to develop and deliver a dedicated tourism recovery package?  In his opening statement, he made reference to looking at the structures.  Will a tourism recovery task force be part of that?  Will he outline a timeline for the delivery of that?<\/p>  <p>  Separately, our air and sea ports are the vital lifelines for the tourism and hospitality sector and we want to see them thrive but there are concerns that essential Covid-19 precautions are not being implemented.  It is suggested that entrants are not being screened and followed up, and social media magnifies that.

Plans are well under way within the Department to have the task force established.

With the support of the Ceann Comhairle, I will take two minutes to speak, ask the Minister of State to respond for two minutes and use the remaining minute to wrap up my contribution.  It is important to leave time for us to get responses to the questions we put to the Minister of State.  He said in his opening remarks that tourism is one of the most directly affected sectors in the current crisis.  Nobody would disagree with that.  He also said that tourism will seek to survive before it can start to recover.  Again, I agree with that.<\/p>  <p>  However, for the tourism sector to survive there must be a plan, and it has to be a plan that is separate from any plan for other sectors of the economy because of how precarious the situation is for the many businesses affected by the tourism sector, including hotels, restaurants, bars and other hospitality services as well as a whole range of other tourism products.  There does not seem to be the urgency from the Department that is needed in this regard.  I welcome that there may be a task force, but there must be immediate measures that can be put in place in the here and now.  I am sure the Minister of State is talking to the same hotel owners who are telling me their doors will not be reopened unless there are tangible and practical solutions put on the table.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the rents waiver the Minister of State spoke about, three months is not enough.  Business owners require certainty in the here and now.  Will the Minister of State commit to there being a commercial rates waiver for the rest of the year for the hospitality sector?  Those involved need to hear that level of certainty.  The grants scheme that was announced some weeks ago is woefully inadequate in terms of the supports put in place.  It needs to be revisited.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Health spoke about the possibility of an extra bank holiday towards the end of the year.  Is that being looked at seriously?  It would be of benefit because the tourism sector does well out of bank holiday weekends.  Will the Minister of State respond to those points?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600036#NN00300","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1588776000,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I appreciate the importance of the industry in the Deputy's region of the south east.  There is huge further potential there.  In regard to our plan and our roadmap, which is available since last Friday, the reality is that we are planning in the context of not knowing how this global pandemic will develop.  There are a huge number of moving parts.  Yes, we want to have our plan ready as early as possible and have it fed into by as many people with the relevant expertise as possible, but it is not quite as simple as put out a plan and off we go.  We do not know exactly where we are going to be in three months.  We have our hopes and aspirations in regard to where we want to be but, as we know, all the phases in the roadmap are dependent primarily on the public health scenario at those times.  That is the context in which we are working and it is changing and evolving rapidly.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to rates, the situation will be reviewed further in June.  I welcome the initial movement in regard to the scrapping of rates for the three months from March to June.  That is positive and I certainly would like to see it happening further into the future if people are not able to get back to anywhere near normality in regard to their businesses.  This is something we will be working on and liaising on with our colleagues in the relevant Department.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the grants issue the Deputy raised, any supports that can be given to enterprises that are viable to help them to get through this period, our Department is, of course, seeking support to deliver them.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to an extra bank holiday.  Coming from a county that is so dependent on tourism, I have felt for a long time that an additional bank holiday, either in the earlier part of the year or the tail end of the year, would be very helpful.  I see the economic benefits that come from bank holidays.  The tail end of the year would probably be better as we have a lot together in the early part of the year with St. Patrick's Day, Easter and May.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600036#NN00400","speaker":"1581"},{"type":"speech","time":1588776600,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I agree that no plan is a simple one.  There are no simple solutions.  There are moving parts to all of this; I accept that.

There is a need for a bespoke solution for tourism, separate from what is being put in place for other sectors.  The Minister of State is correct in what he said about the south east.  In the aftermath of the last economic crash some regions pulled themselves up from their bootlaces by putting in place plans and economic drivers to build capacity in their regions.  In the south east, tourism was a key economic driver.

Disadvantaged by peripherality, Kerry is more dependent on tourism than any other county.  In every category of the Southern Regional Assembly and the Covid-19 Regional Economic Analysis published yesterday, Kerry presents as the county worst affected by the crisis.  Nationally, tourism employs more than 300,000 and contributes &euro;2 billion to the coffers.  In 2019, 11 millions visitors came to Ireland.  Two-thirds of visitors to Kerry are international.  This market has disappeared.  By and large, the tourism industry consists of businesses that pay VAT at 13.5%, purchase school uniforms for children and pay registration fees and rent for students.  Over 14,000, or 20%, of jobs in Kerry are tourism related, the majority of them in hotels and accommodation in a tourist season which has been carefully crafted over many years.<\/p>  <p>  As previously stated, tourism is worth over &euro;650 million to Kerry.  The current crisis could cost the county half a billion euro.  In the town of Killarney the loss could be in the region of &euro;300 million.  The towns of Dingle, Kenmare and Killarney are among the top 11 Irish towns most exposed to significant economic disruption.  Domestically, the social fabric of County Kerry has been torn to shreds.  The staples of its summer season, including Listowel Writers' Week, a possible Munster final, Puck Fair and the Rose of Tralee have all been cancelled.  The concerts, the colour and all events have been obliterated.<\/p>  <p>  Kerry County Council, which advises on grant aid and start-up through its excellent local enterprise office, LEO, and helps businesses to adapt and survive, is the driving force and chief sponsor of many festivals.  It is planning a series of greenways which will be the envy of the world, from Kilmorna to Ballyroe, Tralee to Fenit, Glenbeigh to Renard and the Big River Walkway in Tralee town.  These will be walkways for tourists and locals alike.  Kerry County Council is anticipated to face a budget shortfall this year of &euro;25 million, almost 20% of its annual budget.  Crisis meetings are taking place, probably as we speak, to avoid near bankruptcy of Kerry County Council.  The required matched funding of 25% for vital projects such as the Tralee-Fenit greenway, the urban regeneration and development funding for Tralee town centre, and the redevelopment of the old Denny site, is now in danger.  The long-term affects of this crisis cannot be overstated.  The small family-run hotels, restaurants and town centre businesses in the west, which are the backbone of the economy, are totally deflated.  Recent start-ups and coffee shops, retail outlets and bars may not reopen, and the greyhound stadium is closed.  I ask the Minister if State, if social distancing can be properly observed, to consider an earlier opening for the greyhound stadium.<\/p>  <p>  &Oacute; Chuas an Chaisle&aacute;in go dt&iacute; an Caladh-Portmagee, &oacute;n gCoire&aacute;n in Waterville suas go dt&iacute; Corca Dhuibhne in iarthar Chiarra&iacute;, suas go dt&iacute; Baile an Bhuinne&aacute;naigh, t&aacute; toradh Covid-19 i bhfad n&iacute;os measa in &aacute;iteanna at&aacute; ag fulaingt leis an iompar poibl&iacute; is measa in &Eacute;irinn.  N&iacute; bheidh na hoibrithe s&eacute;as&uacute;racha taobh amuigh den sc&eacute;im PUP, pandemic unemployment payment, in ann stampa a chur suas le haghaidh a gcuid saoire agus n&iacute; bheidh siad in ann c&iacute;os n&oacute; a dt&aacute;ill&iacute; col&aacute;iste a fh&aacute;il.   T&aacute; formh&oacute;r na hoibrithe sna h&oacute;st&aacute;in agus sna tithe t&aacute;bhairne sa chaoi ch&eacute;anna &oacute; bhliain go bliain agus d&aacute; bharr sin ba ch&oacute;ir go gcuirfeadh an Rialtas iad sa sc&eacute;im nua PUP.  Is cinnte go leanfaidh an dam&aacute;iste seo ar aghaidh.<\/p>  <p>  Unless drastic action is taken, this damage will continue and it will be 2022 before a full recovery is realised.  The seasonal worker, the short-term leaseholder and the start-up are uniting and demanding that the tourism sector be supported.  While I welcome the Government aid package, two-thirds of it is reserved for medium and large enterprises with 250-plus employees.  Most of it will not apply to small business.  The restart fund targeting micro and small businesses, which are the backbone of the economy, is crucial.  The finer details of the scheme will no doubt be developed by the relevant Departments in the coming weeks but, to me, it seems totally inadequate.  We must provide employment grants in the form of wage subsidies so that workers will be paid and the industry can survive.  Grants for Covid-19 required infrastructure must be considered.  Domestic holidays must be incentivised, perhaps by way of a voucher scheme.<\/p> <p>While the commercial rates rebate or waiver is welcome, a three-month rebate is not enough.  The local authorities, particularly in Kerry, must be subsidised by way of a vastly increased subvention.  I ask the Minister of State to commit to an increased subvention for Kerry County Council or a waiving of the matched funding requirements so these vital walkways and greenways can be put through.  Tasked with the job of creating employment in a county where IDA investment is not as large as in other counties, the council should not be shackled by continued lack of funding.  Some funding must also be reserved for the self-employed, similar to the scheme introduced in Stormont by the Minister, Conor Murphy, for the self-employed and those working from home, who have no history of a rates base.  Inshore fishermen should also be facilitated within the recent scheme.  The rebates, however, cannot be entirely State-led and insurance companies which, not surprisingly, have behaved as badly as some landlords in this crisis, must provide refunds on at least a <i>pro rata<\/i>basis.<br\/><br\/>Only a fair scheme prioritising the interests and rights of cleaners, bar staff, tour guides, coffee shop employees and bus drivers will do in a county which was the birthplace of the great Mike Quill, the union leader.  The interests of the workers and workers' families must be the priority. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600037#OO00200","speaker":"1488","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588777200,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Frankie Feighan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600038#PP00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1588777200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I hope to speak for five minutes and the Minister of State might answer my questions for five minutes, if that is okay.  I very much welcome the Minister of State's address to the House on the impact of Covid-19 on Irish tourism and his plans to support the sector in recovering from this crisis.  First, we must think of the more than 1,300 people who have passed away from Covid-19 and our thoughts are with their families and friends, as well as those who are recovering.  Again, I want to pay tribute to the front-line staff and all who are working so hard in this crisis.<\/p>  <p>  To come back to the tourism sector, in Sligo-Leitrim, where I come from, tourism makes a vital contribution to the local economy.  Before the crisis, it supported 4,900 jobs and generated &euro;178 million in local tourism revenues.  Sadly, some 90% of hotels are now closed, which is creating enormous uncertainty for the owners, employers and employees.  We know what the Wild Atlantic Way has done in recent years but when I look at Enniscrone, Strandhill, Rosses Point, Sligo town, Mullaghmore, Bundoran, Ballyshannon, Rossnowlagh and Carrick-on-Shannon, I can see there is huge uncertainty.  One area where I was involved is Lough Key Forest Park, where the local authorities have become very involved with what I will call the necklace of tourism providers in the region, and Roscommon County Council and Sligo County Council have worked with Coillte and others.  We need to be very conscious of this aspect.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to caravan and camping sites, there is a huge issue in that they were the first to close and, unfortunately, they will be the last to reopen.  Many hoteliers and restaurant owners have been in contact with me as they are very unsure about the future of their businesses, as things stand.  They welcome the business supports, the wage subsidy scheme and the rates alleviation but they need greater clarity to plan ahead.  We need to help them to understand the measures better.<\/p>  <p>  I have several questions.  Will the Minister of State support calls from the different industry bodies for a 0% VAT rate for the hospitality sector until Covid-19 damage has been rectified?  Knowledge of this is vital in order to plan ahead.  Tour operators are looking for rates for 2021 and 2022.  I appreciate that VAT was reduced from 2011 but we are already 4.5% ahead on VAT when compared to countries such as Germany.  Does the Minister of State believe that, following on from the crisis in this sector, and as we are about to enter Government formation discussions, there is a need for a dedicated Minister for tourism, given the sector's importance to the economy, especially in rural areas such as along the Wild Atlantic Way?  We need to start thinking of a dedicated Minister for tourism.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the roadmap, there are a number of outstanding issues which the industry does not understand and on which it needs clarity.  These include the question of the opening of hotels on a limited occupancy basis, with a number of people per square metre, and with this number increasing over time.  We do not know what this means for the bars in those hotels and there is also a huge issue in regard to social gatherings and weddings.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State said he will work with the sector, which I have no doubt he will, but we need people at the table who are able to make these decisions.  I hope a Government will be formed, and in whatever Government we have, we definitely need a dedicated Minister for tourism at the Cabinet table.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600038#PP00300","speaker":"1608","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588777800,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  Around this time last year, I was up in his constituency with him and I would dearly love to be able to go back there again.  It is a fabulous part of the country with huge potential.  Massive progress has been made in recent years and I hope we can drive it further.<\/p>  <p>  To answer a couple of the questions the Deputy asked, with regard to VAT my view is that while it is a matter for the Department of Finance primarily, in the current context a 0% VAT rate would be appropriate for the industry.  To answer the question directly, I absolutely echo the calls from various bodies.  These days, I spend most of my life on the phone to people in the industry whom I have met over the past three years and gotten to know.  There are great people in the industry.  These are issues we are constantly discussing.  It is something that is necessary to give us a fighting chance to recover as quickly as possible and take on the significant international competition.  It is only when we go to events such as the World Travel Market in London or ITB Berlin and see the huge number of exhibitors from throughout the world that we realise how competitive it is for Ireland and how well we do relatively speaking as a small island with regard to the numbers we attract every year.  We were up to almost 11 million before this happened.  I hope we can get back there again.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to dedicated Ministries, many sectors will need intensive work to get them going again and tourism will be no different.  The size of the tourism industry is enormous, comprising 11% of the workforce, and this is very important.  I am not Taoiseach yet so I do not get to decide which Ministries go where but it would be very beneficial to our industry and I certainly think it would be a positive move.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to what is happening at present, Tourism Ireland is monitoring its markets but it is not spending as it normally would because people simply are not booking at present because of the huge uncertainty.  However, the organisation is making the most of people looking at social media and looking for escapism when they are in self-isolation or lockdown.  Tourism Ireland has been very active online in promoting Ireland and imagery from Ireland.  Very recently, that imagery included Sligo and some of the cinematography in \"Normal People\", which was partly filmed there.  They had to be selective with the cinematography as not everything is suitable for worldwide distribution from a tourism perspective.  Sligo always looks fantastic on screen and Tourism Ireland has been working on that front so that when things start happening again, it will be able to get going as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600039#QQ00200","speaker":"1581"},{"type":"speech","time":1588777800,"counter":109,"content":"<p>With regard to \"Normal People\", my father comes from Tubbercurry where much of it was filmed, and I like to think we are all normal people down there.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Harkin will agree with me that one aspect we need to look at is that approximately 90% of businesses in Sligo are tourism-related.  I found it incredible that one hotel was paying between &euro;75,000 and &euro;175,000 in rates a year.  This is absolutely enormous.  Sometimes as politicians we do not fully grasp the tourism industry.  Not alone does it provide employment, bring people to the regions and make us all feel very proud but it also makes a contribution to local authorities through rates.  It is wonderful.  The amount paid by the hotel was exorbitant.  If these hotels and tourism businesses are not supported, the loss to the taxpayer and local authorities will be significant.  The contribution they are making really struck me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600039#QQ00300","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"speech","time":1588778100,"counter":110,"content":"<p>We know the system of rates we have traditionally is probably not responsive to the modern economy in certain areas and certainly needs further modernisation.

That is why I very much welcome the decision that was made on the scrapping of rates for the initial three months.  As stated earlier in response to a previous question, that will be reviewed as the situation evolves.  The roadmap we announced on Friday is just that.  It is subject to change depending on how the overall health situation evolves.  We hope that if we are looking at any changes, it will be moving forward the phases but that is not guaranteed.

We now know that our tourism industry will not have a summer season this year.  As a result, we urgently need to plan for the following year instead.  We have a chance right now to redefine our tourism strategy and how it will work for us in the future, especially for areas outside Dublin.  Ireland is divided in the country, with a few high-profile tourist attractions which are isolated from the nearby villages and towns where many of us live.  It was great last year to see the Destination Towns scheme operated by the National Tourism Development Authority.  Many regional towns and cities, including my city of Limerick, benefited.  However, the scheme was hampered by a narrow focus.  It did not have an integrated approach to our destinations.  Many wonderful rural towns and villages lost out because of requirements in the scheme that winning destinations had to already have 300 tourist beds to qualify, together with a standing large tourist attraction.  There can be no doubt that there is great potential for tourism to be a strong driver for regional development but only if we break down the barriers between what is good for people living in the regions and what is good for people visiting them.  My point is that vibrant towns and villages are needed for both residents and tourists.  Tourism and regional development policy must have this core principle as its premise, taking advantage of the rich built, natural and cultural heritage in our regions.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Department run a scheme similar to the Destination Towns scheme in order to aid the upcoming crucial 2021 tourist season in Ireland?  Will it work with other relevant Departments to make sure that our small regional towns and villages are eligible to apply, so that both the residents of and visitors to these towns and villages benefit from the development and maintenance of their public spaces, market squares and historic streets?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600040#RR00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speech","time":1588778100,"counter":112,"content":"<p>The Destination Towns scheme was an important landmark in terms of how we do tourism.  Regional dispersal of tourists was very much at the heart of the thinking behind the scheme.  It was, first and foremost, administered by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  As an initial attempt in that sphere, it was very positive.  It was only in December that the successful towns were announced and, unfortunately, only a matter of weeks later this outbreak occurred.  All schemes such as Destination Towns would normally be measured in terms of the expenditure, as to whether value for money has been recovered by the towns and, therefore, by the agency in terms of the money that was granted.  It will obviously be difficult to measure the impact this year of Destination Towns grants that were announced at the end of last year.  Certainly the way ahead for tourism on this island has to be very much about the less well-known and more off-the-beaten-track destinations, those places where one can get the authentic experience but also where one is not contributing in a negative way to the lifestyles of people who live in those areas.<\/p> <p>The great southern greenway in Deputy Leddin's own county and into Listowel also has the Tralee-Fenit element.  There is a great opportunity for all of that to be linked up and for further progress on the Deputy's side of the city and beyond.  There is a massive opportunity there, especially with the Shannon.  These are the types of things I would like to see happening into the future.  This seismic shock event has changed everything.  All our future plans will have to be looked at.  Everything that we plan to do and what we had planned to do for tourism into the years ahead will have to be reassessed and re-evaluated.  Of course a lot of money will be required to stimulate activity in the sector at our current level and from a capital perspective.  When we look at the space in which consumers may be into the future the outdoor and less congregated settings will become even more important.  These are the issues we will look at.  I will go back to F&aacute;ilte Ireland and look at the work it has done to date with what it had intended to do to follow up on destination towns.  I ask Deputies to bear in mind that because of what has happened it is hugely impacted by the fact that we have not yet gauged the effectiveness of the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600040#RR00300","speaker":"1581","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588778400,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I put it to the Minister of State that following the economic crash of 2008-2009 agriculture and tourism were the two sectors that led the recovery of the Irish economy.  Unfortunately, with Covid-19, tourism is now taking a sustained hit from which it may never fully recover.  We have heard Deputies talk of their own counties, and in my constituency of Kilkenny city our economy is largely based on tourism and festivals.  Just last weekend we would have had our roots festival.  They need to be supported to survive and that is very important.<\/p>  <p>  We hear that the staycation should now become the mainstay of Irish holidaymakers.  It is the patriotic thing to do.  It is the safe thing to do and is hugely enjoyable.  Many of us have yet really and truly to discover Ireland.  It is also the climate-friendly thing to do right now.  Outdoor activities and safe spaces will be more attractive as tourist options for local communities as we emerge from the pandemic.  Will the Department continue to fund the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme, ORIS?  Will the Department continue to look at the greenways and blueways, which the Minister of State has just spoken of, many of which are shovel ready?  Local authorities will find it very difficult to find the match funding and the Green Party believes that we should be looking at 90% funding for those projects.  They will add greatly to the local economy and add greatly to construction jobs.  A call for ORIS projects is expected this month and local authorities will struggle to meet the match funding for those projects.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities will continue to try to support festivals.  Hopefully the Kilkenny Arts Festival will still take place in some form but it and the Galway Arts Festival, among others, will struggle this year.  Many are trying to adapt to using social distancing, or simply cannot adapt and will not go ahead this year.  If we support them to trade through this year and to survive into next year they will continue to support local economies.  I refer the House to an excellent document, commissioned by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and penned by Justin Green, Let's Celebrate - the Cultural and Economic Contribution of Live Entertainment Events in Ireland, which illustrates the economic value of this tourism to Ireland.  Every &euro;1 spent in the local economy has a multiplier of another &euro;4 in return.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Leddin spoke of destination towns.  It is important that F&aacute;ilte Ireland takes a much more proactive role in our planning system, and especially in becoming more vocal in commenting on the destruction of natural and built heritage.  We need to look at more collaboration at strategic level and at the link between policy proposals for built and natural heritage.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland should play a key role in that.  We should also be looking at environmental and sustainability indicators around the impact of tourism and the promotion of the EU Ecolabel flower logo for ecologically conscious visitors.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to look at the disproportionate spend by people who travel abroad with &euro;5 billion spent on foreign holidays and a &euro;2 billion spend on domestic holidays.

As the Deputy will know, last June our Department announced significant funding for a number of greenways around the country as part of the national greenway strategy, which kickstarted the development of strategically located greenways and high-value tourism throughout the country.

All of us in the House share an immense sense of pride in our country as a beautiful, welcoming and varied tourism destination.  As we observe the initial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is clear that tourism is one of the sectors in Ireland that faces a cliff edge from which many of us worry it may not be able to recover.  We know now that it is the most impacted sector in terms of the number of people out of work due to the crisis.  Figures show that 128,000 workers in the tourism and hospitality sectors are now in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment, compared with 90,000 people in retail and 70,000 in construction.  The figures for all these sectors are eye-watering and I do not think the impact this crisis has had has fully sunk in for many of us.  It must also be pointed out that in hospitality and tourism, it is predominantly women workers, seasonal workers, part-time workers and undervalued workers who are impacted.<\/p>  <p>  It is impossible at this point to overstate the scale of the crisis that has engulfed tourism.  As has been mentioned by other Deputies, we know that the domestic tourism sector will be crucial to sustaining any kind of tourism industry in the months and years ahead.  We are blessed to have such a varied offering of attractions and amenities.  We are proud to have been part of the Government before the previous one that was involved in developing the Wild Atlantic Way and the many new greenways.  Credit where it is due, the impetus and momentum on the part of the outgoing Government in developing greenways throughout the country in recent years - the Minister of State has been passionate about it - has been excellent.  They are just one of the many examples of the sort of domestic amenities we have that are compatible with social distancing and that will be the key to us getting out of this crisis in the tourism sector.<\/p>  <p>  The hospitality and tourism industry is vital to Ireland and it is key that we work to keep it going.  Its workers have some of the most precarious working conditions and pay of any sector in the country.  We must ensure that any Government finances used to help the industry recover include agreements on employment legislation to ensure a fair living wage and fair contract hours, as well as the fundamental right to union representation and collective bargaining, with no option for businesses to ignore or disregard that right.  As we all know, during the previous crisis beginning in 2008, the hospitality sector received support from the Government and the taxpayer in the form of a lower VAT rate.  That was key in helping the tourism and hospitality industry sustain itself and recover.  As Deputy Noonan said, along with agriculture it was one of the key drivers in getting us out of that economic crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned his support for a 0% VAT rate.<\/p> <p>We need to be careful about bandying about fiscal policies at this point until we have a holistic approach to getting out of this.  We do not need to set expectations that a new Government might not be able to deliver upon.  During the last crisis, the taxpayer and the Government purse sacrificed a significant percentage of taxation with the measures that were provided for the hospitality sector and that has an impact on delivering vital public services from which the entire country needs to benefit.  These are the key decisions that will have to be made in the coming weeks and months.  Any package for the industry must ensure the delivery of a functioning joint labour committee, JLC, for the hospitality sector.  For the Labour Party, that is a bottom line.  We are open to any other creative measures that will keep the hospitality and tourism sectors alive.  We will support those measures with every fibre of our being.  We like the idea of a State-funded voucher scheme for domestic hotels and guest houses.  This would be a great boost to the domestic economy in the latter half of 2020 and beyond into 2021 but we need to see a JLC as part of any agreement.<\/p> <p> With the roadmap out of the Covid-19 restrictions having been published, it is good to see some light at the end of the tunnel with some of the activities that will benefit our internal tourism economy.  We know golf will be resuming under social distancing restrictions and, hopefully, as further restrictions are lifted, this will lead to people being able to travel within the country for such activities.  I commend Inland Fisheries Ireland on clearly communicating how the reintroduction of angling can take place as we move through the phases of lifting restrictions.  Angling tourism at its peak is worth &euro;280 million per year to the domestic economy.  While such a figure, or anywhere near it, will not be reached this year, salvaging some sort of economic boost from angling tourism will be beneficial.  The benefits of angling for mental health and for fostering an affinity with nature and wildlife are well known.  The Government should be proactive in encouraging activities such as this, which can be safely practised in terms of social distancing, to help our tourism economy to recover.<\/p> <p> We are seeing some anomalies, however, and I know there has been a lot of discussion on when pubs will be reopened.  Rightly or wrongly, and probably wrongly, the opening of pubs is seen as some sort of finishing line for the Covid-19 crisis.  We know this is not accurate but it demands a clear communication strategy from the Government.  For example, there is an inherent contradiction in allowing restaurants with bars to reopen on 29 June but not allowing bars without restaurants to open until 10 August.  Like many, I look forward to the day when I can meet my friends in my local pub for a pint but I am in no rush to get there if it compromises public safety.  On the anomaly I have just mentioned, we ask that both pubs and restaurants be open on the same day, as long as the establishment in question can adequately meet public health requirements.  I am agnostic on when in the unwinding of restrictions that will take place but we need a clear and coherent policy in this regard.<\/p> <p> Any return to a long term vibrant and healthy tourism sector will be predicated on the existence of a viable airline industry.  I deliberately use the word \"existence\".  We are worried about our aviation sector and there are many people working in aviation who are deeply worried about their future careers.  In Dublin Airport today, there are only nine scheduled departures and ten scheduled arrivals, five of which fly to domestic airports.  Thousands of jobs depend on the airport reopening but many daily flights are to other EU member states and our ability to reopen the airport also depends on whether those countries have reopened to air travel.  We are worried about jobs in Dublin Airport and Shannon Airport.  In fact, we are worried about the viability of Shannon Airport due to this crisis.  We are worried about jobs in Cork Airport.  Both Aer Lingus and Ryanair have projected difficult times and job losses ahead.  When An Taoiseach spoke last week about the liberalisation of the airline market and how this has benefited workers and customers alike, we have to disagree.  The liberalisation in the free market of any sector has led only to an increase in the wealth gap in many countries and has further condemned workers in those industries to fewer protections and further economic inequality.  That is how the workers in these airlines are feeling now.  They feel unprotected and vulnerable.  That is why I need to ask, in light of the recent reports of massive lay-offs of workers in the aviation sector in companies such as Aer Lingus and with concerns about the DAA, is the Government willing to ensure the wage subsidy scheme will be extended for a longer period as we transition towards life with the Covid-19 pandemic?  It must be also noted that companies such as Aer Lingus and Ryanair are some of the most cash-rich companies in the global airline industry.  Therefore, a combined approach to protecting workers between the State through the extension of the Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme and with the companies through the companies' own cash reserves, needs to be found.<\/p> <p>With so much cash on reserve in these companies we need to ask why they are planning to lay off workers.  The only conclusion we can draw is that these companies are seeking to protect those private properties over the ability to maintain the employment of a dedicated workforce.  Has the Department liaised with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment?  Going back to my original point in respect of tourism, in this sector where low wages are quite prevalent, will any bailout of industries there be tied to employment legislation to ensure the industry puts much greater value on the jobs within it and pays a fair wage to its workers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600042#TT00200","speaker":"1564","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588780200,"counter":120,"content":"<p>The Deputy said a great deal-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600044#VV00200","speaker":"1581"},{"type":"speech","time":1588780200,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600044#VV00300","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speech","time":1588780200,"counter":122,"content":"<p>-----and some of the questions are primarily for ministerial colleagues.

Speaking as somebody who ran a pub for three years in the past, it is a very difficult environment in which to put in place the social distancing that would be required, but that is not to say we are not open to suggestions and ideas on how it could be possible.  We want to try to be fair to everybody.  These are matters we are working on.  It is similar with regard to sports.  The Deputy referred specifically to golf.  We have been working with all the national governing bodies in sport on developing plans for how their activities could return as soon as possible but, again, public safety and health are at the heart of everything we are doing.  These are things that are critically important to people's well-being and have a huge economic impact as well.

Previously, it would have been difficult to imagine that we would be having this type of debate.  I accept that a crystal ball is required to some degree in terms of what is likely to be the timeline for dealing with this virus in a way whereby we will not be talking about it because it is in the past.  We must ensure that businesses get back to operating, but do so safely.  A message comes out of that as well because it reflects on the country in terms of a place to visit for people who will want to come here.  We are looking at places such as New Zealand, which dealt very well with the coronavirus.  It has almost highlighted that country from that point of view.<\/p>  <p>  The other issue is that we must ensure people are able to return to work and that there is the least amount of permanent damage to a very important sector of our economy.  I have listened to Members talk about different parts of the country and how tourism is different.  The hospitality and tourism sector reaches into every part of the country.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland says it is a &euro;9.4 billion industry employing 260,000 people.  That is absolutely enormous.  Now, many people are out of work and some of them are lucky to be on the subsidy scheme.  Some businesses are staying open even though I do not believe it is entirely viable.  For example, one sees restaurants doing a take-out service.  There should not be a disadvantage to them if it comes to a rates relief because often it is about keeping somebody employed, keeping suppliers and maintaining that chain.  Small things like that are going to be important and we should not disadvantage them.<\/p>  <p>  It will be essential that the task force the Minister of State spoke about is not exclusively about the business side, the Department and organisations such as F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The employee side is critical.<\/p> <p>There are some very vulnerable employees in the hospitality sector.  Very often, they are temporary workers or low-skilled workers.  There are many women employed in the sector.  It is important that the recovery be just.  I am supportive of alterations to VAT and excise duty but they must recognise that if we are all in this together, very vulnerable workers must also be included.  We will want to see their jobs back.  There will have to be job-rich growth when there is a return.  <\/p> <p> Some measures are being criticised by stakeholders as unworkable.  That is partly why we need a task force with practitioners from all dimensions who know the industry.  It may be some time before the tourism sector is fully back.  Concerts and sports events must be borne in mind in this regard.  They are a big tourist draw.  Essentially, they are at some considerable distance from having permission to safely return.  Reopening a hotel without having the bar open might make reopening unviable.  With sports clubs and golf clubs, it is the bar, amenities and societies that make them viable.  Therefore, it is important to have the task force up and running as quickly as possible.  The Minister of State might give us his thinking on that in his response.<\/p> <p> There are small points that must also be considered.  The Minister of State referred to space in his contribution.  Quite an amount is paid to put chairs on the street.  Nearly &euro;1,000 is paid to put a table and four chairs on the street in the city centre.  These matters will need to be addressed if space is to be provided.  It will mean a loss of income for local authorities.  The rates initiative will also mean a loss for them.  There is a consequence to this.  What dialogue is there between the Minister of State and the Minister responsible for local government?  What is being thought about?  The loss of income has a knock-on effect with regard to some of the initiatives local authorities can take in this sector.  The Minister of State might address some of the points on the task force with regard to employees and rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600044#VV00500","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588780500,"counter":125,"content":"<p>A conversation like this was unimaginable just a few short months ago, when we had almost 11 million visitors to the island last year.  This is where we are, however.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that a task force developing a plan have as much expertise but as few people as possible.  The task force needs to be workable but at the same time it needs to have experience.  My view is similar to that of Deputy Catherine Murphy in that the perspectives of the various parts of the industry need to be reflected.  No part can operate without everybody working together so it is important that those on the front line be represented.  These are discussions that are ongoing in the Department, including between both Ministers in the Department.  It is important that we get this happening as quickly as possible and get as many heavy hitters in the group as possible because business worth billions of euro will be at stake over the coming years.  The work of the task force and the subsequent plan are important in terms of the level of recovery we can achieve.  I would like to see a group that acts well together but that is at the same time as representative as possible, comprising a broad cross-section of the industry.<\/p> <p>That is what we have tried to do so far in the group we have already convened in this survival phase.  We have tried to bring people in from the bed and breakfast sector as well as people representing coach tour operators, hotels, pubs, restaurants, the aviation sector and from a broad range of sections within the industry and I want to keep working on that.<\/p> <p> As Deputy Catherine Murphy indicated, rates are a matter for a different Minister.  I have been in contact with the Departments of Finance and Housing, Planning and Local Government about my feelings on rates.  We cannot just leave local authorities high and dry.  If local authorities are not collecting rates they will have to be compensated.  The types of projects we discussed earlier such as greenways that we know will be integral to a future recovery plan cannot be jeopardised, as we will need them to act as catalysts for economic activity.  We need appropriate economic activity in areas such as outdoor recreational infrastructure.  These are the parts of the jigsaw that will have to slot together if we are to have a recovery plan that works.  The discussions will be ongoing.  I am very cognisant of the need for local authorities to be funded.  As a former member of a local authority I know the money has to come from somewhere and if it is taken from one from source it must be replaced or cuts will be required to services or the type of infrastructure local authorities provide or service.  In a recovery phase, that is the very last thing we should do.  We need to stimulate activity, not do something that would halt it.  The discussions will continue but I will advocate strongly for a fair deal for local authorities as a result of any much needed help that is given to people operating in the tourism and hospitality sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600045#WW00200","speaker":"1581","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588780800,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Mick Barry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600046#XX00200","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speech","time":1588780800,"counter":128,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

That is the case across the world.  Many people in Ireland, regardless of whether they live in rural or urban areas, rely on seasonal work in the tourism sector.  Some of those workers are shut out of all Covid-19 supplements and payments.  My first question is whether the Minister of State can commit to providing support for such seasonal workers, in particular over the six or seven months of the tourism season that would qualify.<\/p><p>My other question relates to when tourism begins to come back to some semblance of normality.  To some degree, the date we are all looking at is 20 July which is when people can travel across the State.  When workers are again employed in hotels, bars and suchlike, will they be given a guarantee on their health and safety in particular?  Will an agency such as the HSE provide guidance and monitor workers who are in situations where they could be put at risk?  At this stage, most people will take staycations, which is a good thing.  Ireland is an incredible country that has everything to offer, although sometimes we are a bit unlucky when it comes to a lack of sunshine.  That said, it is a beautiful country whether there is rain or sun.  My two questions are about support for seasonal workers and guidance on health and safety for workers when they come back into the tourism and hospitality sector.

While we have had progress regarding people who were on X's and O's at the start of this outbreak, people who had not returned to work were left without the Covid-19 payment.  This is something I feel very strongly about.  I met many such people in the past three years in my role as a Minister of State.  I meet those people who are working on the front line day in and day out through my interaction with hospitality businesses.  My father was one of those people for almost 40 years.  He worked in the hotel industry.  For the first 30 of those years, he did not work until about March and then he worked six or seven days each week right up to October or November.<\/p> <p>I met the Ministers for Finance and Employment Affairs and Social Protection on this.  Whereas there has not been progress on the matter to date, it is something I will continue to advocate.  Ordinarily, these people would be back at work and making a significant contribution to the economy.  Many are the unsung heroes of the industry, some having worked seasonally for 30 or 40 years, and they were unfortunate not to have been back working at that time.  Many people return to work around St. Patrick's Day but the cut-off point was just before that.  I will continue working on this as it is very important.  Looking at the numbers in the sector who are out of work due to Covid-19 and those who are either under the subsidy scheme or on the Covid payment, I estimate that there are probably 30,000 or 40,000 people in that bracket, although I am open to correction.  It is very unfortunate for those people.  Many will also not be able to get their stamps for next year which has a knock-on effect in 2021 where people are not working now, and there are also people whose jobseeker's payment entitlement will be running out.  The Department has given me a commitment to address the issues which might arise in 2021 around this but I would like those people to be included in any future extension or longer term arrangement.  We cannot allow those people to go without payment.<\/p> <p> On workers' health and safety, we are engaging with all people in the industry to see how they can safely return to their normal activity.  Health and safety of employees must be at the forefront; it is quite simple.  As consumers, few people would be comfortable in a situation where their own health and safety is not guaranteed and that is difficult if one is not also ensuring the health and safety of the people working, due to the nature of the virus which is transmitted so easily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600046#XX00500","speaker":"1581","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588781100,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Barry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600047#YY00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1588781100,"counter":133,"content":"<p>That will have to be to the fore and it is why we cannot give specifics or certain dates about the return to normality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600047#YY00300","speaker":"1581"},{"type":"speech","time":1588781100,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for fighting for my corner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600047#YY00400","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1588781100,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I fight for everyone's corner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600047#YY00500","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1588781100,"counter":136,"content":"<p>We are an island nation.  We cannot have a fully rounded discussion on tourism without discussing the aviation industry and air connectivity.  Questions on that must be directed to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport first and foremost, but I wish to raise some points during this debate as it is greatly relevant to tourism.<\/p>  <p>  Two key airlines in this State, Ryanair and Aer Lingus, have been heavily impacted by the coronavirus crisis, as has every airline across Europe and the globe.  Ryanair has spoken of 3,000 redundancies, a 20% cut in pay for employees and the closure of bases throughout Europe.  Aer Lingus has spoken of a 20% cut in its workforce, approximately 900 people.  There should be no job losses and no cuts in income for people working in the airlines.  Companies such as Ryanair are in a position to absorb those losses.  Ryanair has lost out to the tune of &euro;300 million due to coronavirus.  It made &euro;1 billion profit last year.  If it says it cannot afford to keep 3,000 jobs or to maintain wages, then I say we cannot afford to keep these companies in private ownership, run on a for-profit basis.  They should both be nationalised and combined into one publicly owned national aviation company.  I favour paying compensation but on the basis of proven need.  Since 2008, Ryanair has paid out &euro;6.8 billion in dividends and share buy-backs, most of them to the idle rich.<\/p> <p>Aer Lingus paid &euro;225 million in dividends in 2018 alone.  I agree absolutely with compensation for worker pension funds euro for euro and cent for cent, but not at all with compensation for the majority who have benefited from the bonanza during the past decade.  Not one cent should go to them.<\/p> <p> I believe a publicly-owned aviation company in this country would not only be good for tourism but also for facing the climate challenge that the State and the globe will face in the coming ten years.  If we cut out the profit motive, we are in a far stronger position to organise a just transition with a reduction in air travel and maintenance of jobs and living standards in a reasonable fashion for employees.  That will not be done with a for-profit model.  It will not be done with the likes of Michael O'Leary at the helm.  It can be done.  It is a challenge but it can be done on the basis of public ownership and democratic control.<\/p> <p> My final point is on democratic control.  We are not talking about public ownership the likes of which we had with the banks ten years ago where they were nationalised but still run in the interests of the rich and the establishment in society.  We need industry run in the interests of the majority of the working people.  That means public ownership with democratic control, worker control and worker management.  I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600047#YY00600","speaker":"1522","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588781400,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I will convey the Deputy's suggestions to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.

We offer solidarity for those in recovery.  I congratulate our wonderful healthcare workers for their efforts.  Our continuing debt of gratitude to them can never be overstated.<\/p>  <p>  2020 is presenting the most significant of challenges to our national economy.  Nowhere is this more evident than in our tourism and hospitality industries.  They largely comprise privately-owned small and medium-sized operators.  They have provided our national and rural economies with a sustainable economic dividend for many years.  Tourism has helped transform the image of Ireland, cementing our reputation for business and social interaction.  A wide range of enterprises draw business from our tourism sector, including retailers, pubs, restaurants, entertainment venues and public transport operators.  The tourism and hospitality sectors have seen steady growth year-on-year shaking off the effects of the financial crash.  Dublin, the south west and the north east generate the most visitor numbers but destination events and activities in the regions have helped to create a pull factor to garner revenue share as well.<\/p>  <p>  In 2019, overseas tourist visitor numbers to Ireland topped 11.2 million.  More than 5.6 million of these visitors came on an extended holiday.  These visitor numbers support much of Ireland's commercial tourism offering, including its 7,200 pubs, 3,100 off-licences, 2,400 restaurants and 983 hotels.  Employment in the sector pre-Covid-19 was estimated at 260,000 people.  It was generating annual revenues of &euro;7.5 billion with net tax receipts to the Exchequer of &euro;1.9 billion.  Nothing, however, could prepare the sector for the impact of coronavirus, which has devastated the medium-term outlook.  These impacts now represent a mirror reflecting the challenges facing the entire SME sector in Ireland.  The tourism and hospitality industries have been among the first to close, thereby cutting off all available revenue streams.  When green-lighted to open, international visitors will be absent because of travel safety and financial concerns impacting on their countries.<\/p> <p> The development of a vaccine, triggering a restoration of financial and business confidence in customer countries and here at home, appears some way off.  The only clear pathway to sectoral recovery in Ireland is domestic market activity.  This will be hampered with the restrictions of Covid-19 management.  Social distancing requirements, for example, will reduce customer numbers, thereby reducing the consequent revenue return available.  Without a seismic change in current national financial planning regarding the overall SME sector, Ireland Inc. is heading for an employment meltdown and consequent economic damage that could last for a decade or longer.  Solutions are being offered for the tourism and hospitality sector, where 175,000 workers have now lost their jobs.  I ask the Minister of State to consider the following suggestions proposed by industry experts with whom I have recently consulted.  They highlight ten key areas for immediate strategic review.<\/p> <p> The sector needs a task force made up of trade representatives from hotels, restaurants, airlines and State bodies.  I welcome the Minister of State's commitment to that.  I hope to see it expedited as soon as possible.  There should be a reduction in the VAT rate to 0% for tourism and hospitality for the period of the crisis and for 12 months thereafter, then reverting to 9% for a period of five years.  There should be rent legislation to protect commercial leaseholders, a rents incentive package and a scheme such as that France has implemented, namely, the 60-20-20 scheme, whereby Government supplements rent by 60%, the landlord reduces rent by 20% and the commercial tenant pays 20% for 12 months of the crisis.  Insurance reform is required.  Payouts under business interruption and notifiable disease clauses are required.  There should be forbearance in policies for the period of closure and no suspension of cover while businesses are closed.  Wage supports should continue for restaurants and the hospitality sector until a vaccine is found.  There should be support for people over the age of 66 and seasonal workers in the wage subsidy schemes.  There should be a liquidity grant package through the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation to cover outgoings in the first six months following the return of normal trading.  There should also be a commercial rates write-off for restaurants and the hospitality sector for the full crisis period until a vaccine is found.  I welcome the three-month deferment but it is, unfortunately, not enough.  There should be a ban on utility providers cutting off services and demanding payments when businesses are closed and a review of standing charges for the closure periods.  In addition, our bankers need to provide a suspension of banking fees for the hospitality sector.  Interest on loans should be at the ECB interest rates, and a moratorium on existing loan repayments should be provided.  Finally, there should be a waiver of licences for outdoor tables and chairs for one year in order to enable businesses to reopen and adapt to social distancing by using outdoor spaces.  If I may add a suggestion of my own, I would like to see the Minister of State's Department lead on a \"buy local, spend local\" campaign as soon as possible to support local indigenous businesses.<\/p> <p> The financial packages at present under consideration do not meet the needs of the SME sector or the tourism and hospitality sector.  These businesses need money injected by way of grant support to compensate them for acting in the national interest.  They cannot sustain more debt.  They need deferments and incentives such as those I have mentioned to allow them repair their businesses and adapt to the new commercial realities of life after Covid-19 but before any vaccine becomes available.<\/p> <p> We socialised an extraneous debt in 2011 for our financial sector.  We took that decision not to save lives but to prevent financial contagion to the wider economy.  We now face a similar dilemma but for very different reasons.  To preserve life we place the economy into an induced coma.  Having done so we must now resuscitate it and support it in every way to see it fully recover.  The tourism and hospitality sector is a mirror that reflects the wider difficulties in our SME sector, which employs 70% of our present working population.  We need to make dramatic financial provisions in order to resuscitate our economy successfully.  Government mobilised a war effort and used all tools at its disposal to fight Covid-19.  It must now demonstrate the same singular purpose and vision to support financially our tourism and SME sectors to secure an enduring, sustainable economic revival.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600048#ZZ00300","speaker":"1616","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588781700,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Deputy's interest in this topic and the suggestions he made.  We have referred to many of them throughout the course of the debate.  I appreciate that everybody is coming at this in good faith in their suggestions and ideas for supports for business.<\/p> <p>However, we cannot lose sight of the fact that all of these suggestions and elements of assistance for businesses will come at a cost that will have to be paid by somebody.  All of that money needs to be paid back, whether by the local authorities or the Government.  It is important that there would be a business case for those interventions and proposed measures that are being looked at, whether in the short, medium or long term.  We cannot lose sight of the fact that businesses will require assistance but there must be a balance struck in terms of how much the State spends to try to return to some level of normal activity, when the State spends that money and where exactly it is directed.  That is the key challenge and having a plan from the tourism sector that is backed up with strong economic arguments about the types of supports that are needed and how they will generate further economic activity and make sense will help everybody in the sector.  I am keen for that to happen as soon as possible.<\/p> <p> I am from the south west and know that the regions and other rural areas will be slower to recover from this crisis.  The areas most likely to recover quickly are around Dublin, although that remains to be seen and factors such as population density might have an effect.  For many rural communities, tourism is the only show in town.  There may be some agriculture and fishing businesses but tourism is a lifeline for many enterprises.  There must be a targeted response to ensure those areas are supported.<\/p> <p> I am keen to see further utilisation in the future of our fantastic coastline from Dublin to Cork.  We have seen how important the Wild Atlantic Way has been for many communities along the western seaboard and there is potential to do more with the coastline running down the east and south east from Dublin to Cork.  That is just one idea among others I have heard but it would be positive for Deputy Shanahan's area and would complement the Waterford greenway, to which we recently gave further funding to enable it to extend.  I had the pleasure of cycling the greenway two years ago.  Areas such as that will benefit in the post-Covid-19 era.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600049#AAA00200","speaker":"1581","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588782300,"counter":143,"content":"<p>There can be no doubt that tourism is one of the sectors that has been most adversely impacted by the Covid-19 crisis.  On 5 March, the Minister for Health made a statement on the floor of this House recognising that fact.  At that time, the Minister noted that the Government was mindful that any sustained period of significant flight restrictions would lead to impacts on tourism and business in Ireland.  That has come to pass.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the fact that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, and the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, regularly convene a meeting of the Covid-19 tourism monitoring group to assess the disruption to the sector.  The group has been in contact with public transport operators, the National Transport Authority and other transport operators.<\/p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is creating a set of operational guidelines to help businesses when they reopen at the appropriate time.  As I understand it, these guidelines will be published in the coming weeks to provide advice on various systems that can be adopted and will help instil public confidence and reboot business while adhering to Government and public health directives.  In terms of the grants that are being rolled out to help businesses, small businesses are telling me that they will be landed into more debt and more supports are needed.  I understand that this is a difficult time and that decisions need to be made but it will be more productive in the long term if we give small businesses more supports rather than grants that will sink them deeper into debt.  That will also help the economy in rural regions.<\/p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has known since at least early March that the tourism sector was going to be badly hit.<\/p> <p>We now have a statement issued in the past few days telling us that it will be weeks before it rolls out advice to local tourist operators.  It must have been possible to have a strategy developed at greater speed than that.  I am aware there is a huge frustration in regard to the delay.<\/p> <p> We have also seen the recent report from EY Ireland which acknowledges that the rural economy will be disproportionately impacted because it is dominated by two sectors - agrifood and tourism.  The EY report goes on to note that the development of Irish tourism is at the heart of Project Ireland 2040 aspirations to build a more sustainable and resilient economic model, less dependent on Dublin, with a higher focus on indigenous rather than multinational businesses.  All of that is now at imminent risk of collapse thanks to the devastation that is being experienced in rural communities.<\/p> <p> I welcome the fact that the following concerns have been raised by the Irish Road Haulage Association and the Freight Transport Association of Ireland.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has also liaised with ferry companies in seeking to ensure that, insofar as possible, HGV drivers are not at this time required to share cabins with other drivers and that, where that is not possible, HGV drivers are offered reclining seats.  That is a sensible and pragmatic approach but what we need is more collaboration from the stakeholders since they are the experts.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State mentioned that there were some stakeholders represented on the committee but more are needed.  Some sectors believe they are not properly represented.<\/p> <p> In terms of the response of the insurance sector, and particularly the airline sector with respect to refunds, I think the Minister of State will accept that the response has been far from ideal.  As he will be aware, under EU regulation 261\/2014, airlines must reimburse passengers whose flights are cancelled with the choice of a refund or a re-routing within seven days.  I note that Ireland co-signed a letter with 13 other EU members calling on the European Commission to adapt the rules on how passengers can be refunded.  That is welcome.  The Minister of State might be able to tell us if there has been much resistance to that from the airlines and the European Commission.  We have to remember that we are talking about small sums of money in respect of the airlines.  Most families will have saved for some time to purchase these tickets.  The situation is unfair.  They need to receive prompt reimbursement and not just vouchers or the offer of rescheduling flights, which I have seen from some airlines.<\/p> <p> Local tourism is what sustains many villages and towns in Ireland, from bed and breakfast accommodation to retail and other services.  I hope the VAT rate on the hospitality sector and hairdressers will be reduced to 0%.  I believe that approach is needed.  We need to take radical action.  I stated in the Chamber two years ago that the VAT rate should not have been increased because rural towns and villages did not feel the recovery in the same way as the cities.  It was wrong to begin with but we now have a chance to undo that somewhat and support them by reducing the VAT rate for hairdressers and the hospitality sector.<\/p> <p> It will take a whole-of-Government approach to deal comprehensively with the particular challenge faced.  I can only hope that sufficient measures will be rolled out to respond accordingly and, as I have stated previously, that there will be increased collaboration with the experts from the different sectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600050#BBB00200","speaker":"1592","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588782600,"counter":145,"content":"<p>I am happy to speak on the tourism sector.  I welcome the Minister of State's frank comments and replies, and his understanding.<\/p>  <p>  I want to mention at the outset a wonderful, proud Tipperary woman, Nora de Buitl&eacute;ir, who was laid to rest in An tAonach, maidin inniu.  She was a powerful woman of song and history.  She regaled us mainly in Br&uacute; Bor&uacute;, in Cashel, but also all over Ireland, in this House at the Culture Night events, and all over the world with the Br&uacute; Bor&uacute; tour.  Nora was a font of wisdom and a wonderful woman who gave a huge amount of guidance to the young people at Br&uacute; Bor&uacute; every year.  She was great fun also.  Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; sent his eulogy today for somebody else to read.  I sympathise with Labhr&aacute;s and Una, and everybody involved in the music, song and culture.  Nora was a proud Tipperary woman but also a proud Gaeilgeoir and Irishwoman.  N&iacute; bheidh a leith&eacute;id ann ar&iacute;s.<\/p> <p> We all know how important the tourism industry is, in its many facets, as outlined by colleagues to the Minister of State today.  The Covid-19 crisis is going to have a massive impact.  We must do something to put manners on the insurance companies.  Deputies have called many times for action on these issues.  The companies show no respect for and no understanding of the hoteliers.  We see at the moment that at least the power companies and utility companies are waiving their standing charges.  It is about time.  However, the insurance companies have just been ripping people off and now the hotels, pubs and roads are empty.  We need to acknowledge that there have been no road accidents, thankfully<\/p> <p> There are many areas of tourism in Tipperary I would like to mention, going from Carrick-on-Suir up to Clonmel and the new blueway, on to Cashel and its famed rock, and into Holycross, Nenagh, Roscrea and other parts of the county.  Where Tipperary leads, the old adage says, Ireland follows.  We are ready and willing to get going again, and I thank the Minister of State for his visits.  However, we need the supports to do so.  We need zero VAT sorted out and more supports rather than loans, because we cannot have the banks breathing down our necks.<\/p> <p> There are many other aspects of tourism that one might not even think of, such as educational tourism.  Can the Minister of State provide some clarity for education tourism providers?  I am sure he is familiar with the foreign students who come to our country every summer for English language courses and exchanges as well as the students who enrol in our secondary schools.  Many of the programme operators are now in limbo, like many others, as a result of the current crisis.  They do not know whether they are coming or going.  One such wonderful operator is Kim Connelly O'Grady who runs Gift Life Experience Limited in south Tipperary.  She co-ordinates and facilitates travel arrangements and education courses for up to 200 students from Spain every year, offering a mixture of three-week summer programmes and school placements.  We see these students and we get a lot from them.  They love it here and get involved in the community and then they send their families to visit.  There is huge tourism linked with that.<\/p> <p> Kim has highlighted a number of issues to me.  She has no choice but to cancel all plans for her three-week July programme due to the uncertainty and also the likelihood that students would have to self-isolate for 14 of their 21 days here.  She is currently unsure as to where she stands financially in respect of deposit and flight refunds, as mentioned by Deputy Nolan and others.  She is also at a significant loss because more than half of the students who signed up and are pre-booked to start school here in September have dropped out due to the uncertainty.  These students contribute a lot to the local economy and our many tourism sites in Tipperary.  The company employs four permanent staff and offers many other summer and temporary jobs.  I will provide all these details in writing to the Minister of State and I hope he will keep educational tourism to the forefront of his mind.<\/p> <p> We must also keep in mind the publicans.  The Licensed Vintners Association is out there lobbying, and rightly so, but one size does not fit all.  There are many small pubs - the pubs I like to go into - many of them family-run pubs and some of them hundreds of years old, which do not have the same space as the larger pubs.  It is the same with other tourism products.  Knockmealdown Active, the Rhododendron Walking Festival in Clogheen, Cahir Castle, run by Tipperary Tourism Company, and many other businesses such as those need to be supported.  We need to tailor supports, as the Minister of State mentioned, to different-sized businesses and different facets of the tourism industry.  It cannot be one size fits all.  The vintners lobby is strong but we must ensure that everybody, including non-vintners, are supported.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600051#CCC00200","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588782900,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Harkin.

A good report was done by the local authorities providing a regional analysis of the economic impact of the Covid-19 environment.  It shows that the north west is supremely impacted, perhaps more so than any other part of the country.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to ask the Minister of State about what State measures are in place to assist small tourism businesses in meeting their ongoing costs and enabling them to reopen and stay in business.<\/p> <p>The beginning of July has been mentioned as a possible timeframe for the reopening of this sector, but we do not yet know if that will be possible.  There could be slippage in regard to that timeframe, depending on the response across the board.  This year is impacted severely and probably gone for most tourism industries and businesses.

The Deputy is right in terms of being concerned for those businesses.  I, too, am concerned for them.  The Government has introduced a number of measures across the economy to try to support employers and employees at this time.  The Deputy will be aware of the schemes that have been announced, including the wage subsidy scheme and the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment.  The future of these schemes will be have to be reviewed as the situation evolves.<\/p><p>In regard to the tourism sector, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has been working closely with us and affected businesses in terms of preparing supports and assistance for tourism companies and organisations.  As part of this work, F&aacute;ilte Ireland established a business supports task force and a Covid-19 business support hub, which is available online.  The supports available include business liquidity information and advice, human resources advice, temporary lay-off and redundancy advice, how employee welfare can be protected, management of temporary closures, safeguarding future revenues, jump-starting sales, operational guidance, Government supports, brand and reputation and employee well-being.  As I said, all of this information is available online and via webinar, which I understand from people have been quite well received.  There is also a detailed FAQ section.  This is a useful resource to which the Deputy could direct people.<\/p><p>As I said earlier, the overall situation is evolving and so too is the response of Government.  In the early stages, a Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment of &euro;203 was introduced.  This payment was subsequently increased to &euro;350.  The suite of supports announced by Government on Saturday is just that, namely, the latest suite of supports.  We know that further measures will be needed for enterprises, large, medium and small.  As the situation evolves, further supports will have to be developed and put in place, not only for the survival phase, which for some will be a long phase, but the recovery phase as well.  The supports that might be put in place for survival might be entirely inappropriate for recovery and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  The State will have to continue to move as the needs of enterprises change.

I support the call of many Deputies here today for the establishment of a task force to deal with the myriad issues that will have to be managed as we begin to reopen our tourism industry.  As a prelude to that, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport needs to meet all of the main players, from the Irish Hotels Federation to the aviation sector, the tour operators and everybody in between and to use that as a template for the task force that is to be established.  It is urgent that tourism businesses get clarity around what is going to happen.<\/p> <p>As I said, tourism is crucial in rural areas, including in my constituency, and it provides over 30,000 jobs in the north west, in Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon and Donegal.  It is important to listen to what that industry is saying.  One of the things it is saying is that while the announcements last weekend were welcome, they do not go far enough.  I heard the Minister of State say there are a lot of moving parts, which there are.  However, to take the issue of rates as an example, the rebate is for three months yet no tourism business can open before the end of June and that is not even part of the Government's own roadmap.  Therefore, these businesses, looking at the scrapping of rates for three months, see that it is no good to them.  It needs to be a minimum of six months and, ideally, 12 months, with a guarantee that when they are back in business, they will be paying some kind of <i>pro rata<\/i>rate, depending on the trade they are doing.<br\/><br\/>There is also a big issue around commercial rents.  There has to be burden sharing between tourism businesses, the Government and landlords, and this applies to businesses across the board.  This kind of triumvirate needs to set in place some kind of structure whereby businesses can remain on life support until the opportunity presents for them to reopen.<br\/><br\/>Other Deputies have asked for a 0% VAT rate and I add my voice to that.  I am pleased the Minister of State is considering it and I hope it will be part of the programme for Government.<br\/><br\/>In response to Deputy Shanahan, the Minister of State said that money has to be repaid and he also said that tourism is the only show in town for many places.  It is true that the money has to be repaid.  However, I honestly believe that a portion of the Covid-19 debt has to be ring-fenced at European level, whether through corona bonds or otherwise, and put to one side because that is the only way the European economy can be kick-started.  If we do not pump-prime tourism projects, there will be no show in many different towns.<br\/><br\/>I mentioned earlier that tourism needs certainty.  These are uncertain times but hoteliers are asking me whether they can book weddings for August and September, what they should do about numbers, does it depend on the floor space they have, do they need two metres between each of the tables, can there be entertainment afterwards and how they manage check-in.  Those are all practical details and while we are in uncertain times, we can give more certainty to these businesses about them.  I ask the Minister of State to consider that.  When these businesses reopen, they will need grant aid because they already have a mounting wall of debt and they cannot afford to examine their businesses to see what needs to be done around social distancing.<br\/><br\/>I know of businesses which, regrettably, have decided to close their doors.  Certain companies, in this case telephone companies and energy companies, are insisting on extortionate penalty clauses of over &euro;400 per company to terminate contracts.  While I will not name the companies today, I ask the Minister of State if there is any way his Department or the Government can use their influence to stop these companies basically terrorising businesses which are no longer able to trade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600053#EEE00300","speaker":"1605","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1588783800,"counter":152,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 4.35 p.m. and resumed at 5 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Business of D\u00e1il","time":1588784100,"counter":153,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600055#LLL00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1588784100,"counter":154,"content":"<p>On foot of the Order of the D&aacute;il of last Thursday I wish to announce for the information of the House that the following Members have been appointed to serve on the Committee of Procedures: Deputies Peter Burke, Hildegard Naughten, Mary Butler, Se&aacute;n Haughey, Michael Moynihan, Rose Conway-Walsh, Pa Daly, Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh, Catherine Martin, Duncan Smith, Jennifer Whitmore, Br&iacute;d Smith, Peter Fitzpatrick, Mattie McGrath and Thomas Pringle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600055#LLL00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Covid 19 (Childcare): Statements","time":1588784100,"counter":155,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600055#LLL00300"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1588784100,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I am pleased to be in the D&aacute;il this afternoon to outline the measures the Department has taken to ensure the care and protection of our children and young people during this pandemic.  I will begin by placing on the D&aacute;il record my gratitude for the ways in which our children and young people have responded to what is happening in Ireland and in our world at this time.  They have co-operated with the ways in which their lives have been restricted.  They have responded with great care for their friends and the adults in their lives, especially their families.  They have lifted our spirits with their innovative ways of minding our communities.  For all of this and more I thank the children and young people of Ireland.  Their courage and kindness leads us all on.<\/p>  <p>  When childcare services closed on 12 March, the Department and I moved quickly to put in place the best possible supports for the childcare sector.  Our key focus was to ensure that when we emerge from this crisis our childcare sector would be in the best shape possible to reopen.  For those working in early learning and school-aged child care, the children they care for and educate, the parents and our economy, a functioning childcare infrastructure is critical.  The sector is an extension of our education system.  This has been recognised by the Government in approving significant bespoke supports for the sector.  A sustainable functioning service needs to retain our early learning and childcare professionals.  At a very early stage, we identified the need to ensure they could receive at least &euro;350 per week to keep them with their employers so families would not lose them.  I also introduced a measure to contribute towards the overheads of providers.  In addition, the Department brought forward a proportion of the programme support payments to providers to assist with cashflow issues.<\/p>  <p>  Every year, childcare services close.  In the past three years, approximately 150 services a year have closed.  In each of those years, new services opened and almost every year we had net additional capacity in the sector.  As a result of increased investment, the average size of services has grown from 33 places in 2015 to 47 in 2019.  During the months of March and April, Tusla was notified by seven services of their intention to close and we are monitoring this closely through our city and county childcare committees.  I am hopeful  the measures we have put in place will go a long way towards sustaining the majority of current services.  On 5 May, 3,733 providers had signed up to the wage subsidy childcare scheme, which is 83% of our providers.<\/p>  <p>  Our challenge is to hold as much of the current capacity as possible.  I and the Department have worked consistently to keep all of our stakeholders updated on developments through ongoing consultations with individual providers and representative bodies.  We are constantly updating our frequently asked questions and they are being updated again today.  They now consist of 60 pages on the Department's website.  I believe the introduction of the scheme was a relief for many parents who will not be requested to pay childcare fees or a contribution to childcare fees while services are closed.  Through the scheme they will maintain their child's place when restrictions are lifted and so many of these parents are themselves struggling financially and worried about the future.  They may lack certainty about whether their jobs are secure.  They may be on the pandemic unemployment payment or the wage subsidy scheme in the hope they will return to work, and do not need the additional or impossible strain of having to pay childcare fees during this time.<\/p>  <p>  Thankfully, we now have a roadmap for the future.  As has been reiterated many times in the past few days, the speed at which we progress is dependent on our ability to control the spread of the virus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600055#LLL00400","nonspeaker":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Katherine Zappone)"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1588784400,"counter":157,"content":"<p>From 18 May, my Department will oversee the provision of childcare in the homes of essential healthcare workers.  This is part of the first phase of easing the Covid-19 restrictions.  Tomorrow, we will invite registered childcare services to participate in this much-needed measure.  I will also outline how families can access the scheme.  Participation will be voluntary.  Many services have expressed an interest in supporting this initiative and being part of Ireland's call during these challenging times.  We have been planning this for a number of months and have listened to suggestions from the childcare sector.  Yesterday, we had an extensive question and answer session with the early years forum.  Based on current figures, we are planning for provision for 5,000 families.  We estimate that the cost of the scheme will be in the region of &euro;4.7 million per week.  The majority of this cost will be borne by the State.  There will be a shall parental contribution required of &euro;90 per family per week.  This will provide essential healthcare workers with 45 hours of childcare a week.  We are recommending that childcare workers volunteering for the scheme are paid on average &euro;15 per hour.  As part of the scheme, we will also cover employer PRSI, leave accrual and any management and administrative overhead to providers.  In the coming days, eligible health workers will be advised to contact a Pobal parent support centre to request the service and to indicate their childcare needs and preferences.  It is initially intended to run the scheme for a period of four weeks.  There will be a review after two weeks and also at the end of the four-week period.  We have also commenced planning for phase three, which will see the phased reopening of cr&egrave;ches and preschools for the children of essential workers.  This is the first step in the phased reopening of centre-based childcare.<\/p>  <p>  It is inevitable that childcare services will not open at full capacity.  Fewer children attending a childcare service will increase the cost of the provision of childcare for these children.  As outlined previously, 70% of the costs of provision of childcare are related to pay costs.  I do not anticipate that services will be in a position to absorb all of these costs.  Parents will also be unable to pay the associated increase.  I will be inputting into future Government decisions to make the case for the need for State subsidies to compensate.  However, I would like to take a moment to reflect on the current State investment in childcare during the Covid-19 crisis.  Prior to Covid-19, the State invested approximately &euro;638 million per annum in early learning and care and school-age childcare services, and parents contributed approximately &euro;400 million per annum in fees.  Initial projections anticipated that the Department's temporary wage subsidy childcare scheme would cost on average approximately &euro;6 million per week for the Department itself, subject to the level of scheme demand.  This weekly cost, though, does not include the cost of the Revenue wage subsidy scheme on which the Department's scheme is built.  The total estimated cost of State supports to early learning and care in school-age childcare during the Covid-19 crisis far exceeds the total State expenditure prior to the pandemic, and demonstrates my commitment, that of my Department and that of the Government towards the sector.  Parents previously contributed approximately 40% of the sector's income and the State 60%.  The new Government-wide package of measures for the sector, across the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, Revenue and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, retains the State investment which was there previously and compensates for the loss of some of the parental income. <\/p>  <p>  The Secretary General of the United Nations, Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, has called on the global community to build back better.  We need to share that vision for the future of childcare.  This will form the basis of the options that we are considering into the future.  I held a meeting with the early years forum yesterday evening and committed to engaging with it on how we plan for the phased reopening.  Our objective will be to continue to support as many services as possible and to retain as many educators as possible in the childcare sector. <\/p>  <p> Many providers are already exploring the design of the guidelines for reopening.  We will welcome all suggestions and co-operation to guide and drive the safe reopening of services.  Tusla has recommitted to a fair, reasonable and pragmatic approach to inspections for reopening.  Consideration needs to be given to how children are prioritised for returning to childcare.  This will be done in consultation with the sector.  It is my hope that significant additional investment will be provided to the sector as it reopens.  It seems to me to be the primary requirement to ensure that capacity will be sufficient for Irish families as the pandemic recedes.  These decisions, however, are yours not mine.  The road ahead will have twists and turns.  We will work at it step by step and hand in hand with the sector.  We all want to achieve the same goal.  We can get there and I believe that we will get there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600056#MMM00100","nonspeaker":"","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588784700,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The two aspects of childcare I will address are the provision of childcare services in any programme for Government and childcare for front-line and healthcare workers throughout this pandemic.  The ethos of a programme for Government must be to meet children's right to a quality service in policy, in provision and in practice.  Before Covid-19 we saw 30,000 childcare providers and workers march outside this building protesting a crisis that already existed in the sector.  With more than 60% of workers earning less than the living wage, and with parents paying some of the highest fees in Europe, I put it to the Minister that this is unsustainable.  Before Covid-19, the sector was at breaking point as a result of escalating insurance costs, various guidelines arising from different regulations and low wages.  Currently, Ireland takes a very mixed approach to childcare whereby there are private cr&egrave;ches and community sector providers.  This ends up with one part of the sector pitching against others and there is no level playing field.  Commercial rates, spiralling insurance costs and poor pay and conditions inevitably lead to a high staff turnover, which leaves managers in a terrible position that is clearly unsustainable.  Any new Government must develop an integrated, systematic and quality support system that engages all the relevant sectors.  I feel very strongly that it is important to establish a single comprehensive streamlined inspection system instead of five or six groupings giving different guidelines to the sector.<\/p>  <p>  There has been an absolute failure on the part of the Government to provide adequate childcare for front-line workers during this pandemic.  Although cr&egrave;ches have been closed, many parents' obligations have increased.  They have increased dramatically in the case of front-line workers such as nurses, garda&iacute; and doctors.  The lack of availability of childcare has caused considerable distress.  I am aware of this from cases in my constituency but I have no doubt that the position is the same across the State.  The head of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, has clearly stated that after the personal protective equipment issue, concern regarding childcare is the most common issue for front-line workers.  I put it to the Minister that many front-line staff had no choice but to put grandparents, their children and themselves at risk because up to now the Government has not provided an alternative.  That is truly unforgivable during a global pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600057#NNN00300","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1588784700,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I wish to speak on the impact the ongoing lockdown is having on young people and children.  All of us recognise that back in March it was absolutely necessary, in order to protect elderly people and the vulnerable, to introduce emergency measures.  When we saw what was happening in Spain and Italy, it was imperative that we introduced measures for the purposes of ensuring that our intensive care units were not overrun like those in the countries to which I refer.  It would have been reckless for us not to do so.  Those regulations and the lockdown have had a significant impact on and caused inconvenience to people..<\/p> <p>We have been prepared to go along with it, however, because it is for the common good.  Nevertheless, there is one category of people who have not been given sufficient attention for the sacrifices they have made, namely, children and young people.  All of them have had their social, personal, educational and sporting development affected by the lockdown and regulations.  They have behaved selflessly and have been prepared to go along with the measures.  They have subordinated their own interests to the interests of the common good and those who are vulnerable in society, particularly the elderly.  We need to recognise that and the role played by young people and children.<\/p> <p> The Government and the Minister need to place greater emphasis on trying to reinstate some normality into the lives of children and young people.  We need to get a plan in place in order that they will know when they are going to go back to school and to playing or exercising with their friends.  We have done well in reducing the spread of the virus in this country.  We have flattened the curve but we will not eliminate the virus until such time as we have a vaccine, which will take a number of years.  We cannot indefinitely put our children's and young people's lives, or the lives of others, at a standstill while we await the development of a vaccine.  We need to learn to live with the virus.  That means we need to have a proper, efficient and speedy testing system in place.  It is the only way in which we can live with the virus.  With such a system in place, people could be tested and know within 24 hours whether they are positive or negative.  Those who are negative can go about their ordinary lives without any inconvenience, while those who test positive will have to isolate themselves for a period.  That is how countries that have handled the pandemic well have succeeded.  Unfortunately, to date the Government has not handled the issue of testing well.  We need to ensure that our testing is much more efficient and speedy in order that we can get our children and young people back to normality and back among their friends.<\/p> <p> I would have liked, if I had more time, to talk about the particular issues of children in direct provision, who are greatly affected, and young women who have been smuggled into the country and are suffering as a result of being part of the sex industry.

I have been contacted by several constituents in Carlow-Kilkenny who are worried about whether the scheme will operate this year.  It provides funding for an extended school year for children with a severe or profound general learning disability or with autism.  The extended year is commonly known as the July provision or the July education programme.  Where school-based provision is not feasible, home-based provision may be granted.  As the schools have been closed and are not due to reopen this academic year, parents and caregivers are concerned that no clarity has been given on applications for next year or on whether, like in previous years when an eligible school has participated in the programme, an additional month's education will be provided to a pupil who meets the scheme's criteria.  Already there have been marked repercussions due to the difference in homeschooling opportunities.  Some schoolchildren have much access to learning, whereas others do not.  Some children who live in rural Ireland do not have the ability to see their friends if they do not live in estates or in streets where they can see others.  Some do not have access to video-calling facilities, an issue especially in homes where there are children with special educational needs.  I would appreciate some clarity on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  I echo calls for action on the deep unfairness that is the exclusion from the wage subsidy scheme of those returning from having received maternity benefit.  This needs to be rectified and we need more information on it.<\/p>  <p>  I highlight the need for childcare provision for front-line workers.  Many of those on the front line do not have cr&egrave;che-age children.  I join with many principals of primary schools throughout the country in expressing disappointment that while other countries have included such measures in the first phase of easing restrictions, we did not, making caring for schoolgoing children more difficult.  There are many issues we all still need clarified while we work through this pandemic, and information is crucial.<\/p> <p>That is what people are constantly asking for.  There is a lack of information.  If we could get more information on the different phases, it would be a great help to parents and to their children, who are really feeling the impacts of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600058#OOO00200","speaker":"1511","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588785300,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her address earlier on.  With the seating arrangements, we are continuously rotating to get space in here.<\/p>  <p>  With the usual funding streams such as the early childhood care and education scheme, ECCE, suspended, the majority of cr&egrave;ches have signed up to the wage subsidy scheme, which has been welcomed by most staff, providers and parents.  From speaking to several providers and representative groups yesterday, there are numerous issues with how the scheme operates, such as self-employed cr&egrave;che owners being placed on the Covid-19 payment, the 15% overhead falling well below what many providers need to pay their bills, the returning from maternity leave - as my colleague has mentioned - and the lack of clarity around how many staff members and how much they will have to pay back to the Revenue when they reconcile their payments.  This extended period of closure will have considerable impacts on the long-term viability of the sector, which was already struggling.<\/p>  <p>  I want to highlight three areas of concern with the Minister and hopefully we can get some clarity on them.  They are mainly questions.  Will the Minister clearly outline the public health advice that the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, has issued for the scheme?  What is the definition of an essential worker?  Nurses and doctors are clearly included but does it include the cleaners and porters in hospitals, for example?  Can staff of section 38 companies avail of the scheme?  What payment model is being used?  Is it possible for the Crowe report to be published while the Minister is still in office?  If a childcare worker gets sick while placed in someone's home, what are his or her entitlements and who will be paying them?  What is the small flat rate that we can expect that parents will have to pay?<\/p>  <p>  On capacity, there is considerable concern that many childcare providers will be forced to close their doors for good as a result of this period of closure, worsening already dire capacity constraints.  The reopening of cr&egrave;ches to all workers is scheduled to take place during phase 4, which begins on 20 July.  The Government's roadmap says that when it happens, it will be for one day per week to begin with.  I need an explanation on how exactly the one day per week of childcare will be rolled out.  The Department needs to be clear on how the reopening of cr&egrave;ches will work as we face the majority capacity crisis.  Transparency and planning are key in this.  For example, there could be a cr&egrave;che that normally has space for 100 children that is now reduced to being able to cater only for 50 children due to social distancing.  If the parents and providers have already entered into a contract to secure a space and they then want to see if they can get access to their service, how does the operator prioritise and decide who comes in and who does not come in after phase 4 has come into place?  How do we decide, when all businesses and various sectors are opening up, which sector is more important than the next?  This will all impact on females.  Are we doing a little bit of outside-the-box thinking, therefore?  Are we thinking about using some of our national schools for the month of August?  Are we thinking about using our community centres and GAA pitches?  I would like to know what engagement is taking place and what the NPHET is saying about the roadmap in conjunction with the Department.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to future funding.  We all know the access and inclusion model funding has been sent out to the providers but they have used that to pay some of their wages in recent weeks and now it is being recalled.  That is under the control of Pobal.  Is there any way Pobal can halt the recall of that funding?  While there was a gap, some providers were using that funding to pay wages.  I would love if the Minister could respond to those points in the time remaining.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600059#PPP00200","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1588785300,"counter":166,"content":"<p>Am I to respond to all of the questions of all of the Deputies in the two minutes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600059#PPP00300","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1588785300,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Insofar as you can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600059#PPP00400","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1588785300,"counter":168,"content":"<p>Is that right?

We will do our questions and answers within each of our time slots.<\/p>  <p>  Among the matters I wish to raise are the logistical issues with the wage subsidy scheme.  Some of them have been mentioned already.  Sole traders, for example, seem to be outside this category.  It is ironic for them because they are administering the scheme and ensuring staff are paid, yet they cannot access the payment.  I know the Department is aware of these issues but it our first opportunity to put them on the record in the Chamber.  There are also difficulties for people who are either returning from or going on maternity leave.  Given that they are technical issues, I believe some solution should be found.  It is not good enough that it is seen as a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  We need to examine solutions for providers and services in that situation.<\/p>  <p>  Sustainability is the key issue in all of this.  I welcomed the fact that staff were to be paid by the State.  As somebody who has long advocated for a publicly delivered childcare model, the idea of staff being paid by the State would appear to be a first step, but if there are inadequate funds available to keep services open and if some services did not even sign up for the scheme because they felt there would not be adequate funds to keep their businesses afloat, it is bittersweet in a way.  There is a fund of approximately &euro;2 million which is ring-fenced for the community sector as a sustainability fund.  I would like if we could explore if it can be expanded and also take in the private services as well as the community sector, but obviously we would have to see a great deal more investment and money being ring-fenced for that.<\/p>  <p>  This discussion is mainly about childcare but given that domestic violence is in the remit of the same Department, I wish to mention domestic violence services.  We have all seen the reports of an increase of approximately 30% in the incidence of domestic violence.  That is only the incidents that are being reported, but we are all aware that a large amount of domestic violence is unreported.  While it is tragic and sad that we have this virus and people are dying from it, we also have a situation where many women and children are potentially going to die as a result of the increase in domestic violence.  We must do a great deal more in terms of increasing funding to that sector.  Many refuges have had to decrease the number of places they can provide due to social distancing.  While they must abide by that, they are left in a very difficult situation.  I give the example of a refuge in Carlow-Kilkenny.<\/p> <p>The Minister is well aware of it because she came down to visit.  Everyone was delighted with that.  A problem arises if the refuge is full.  People from Carlow have to travel to Kilkenny, which is not great, but if the refuge is full, the victims have to find a refuge elsewhere, perhaps in Clonmel, Waterford or Wexford.  Many of them will just walk away and end up going back into very violent and difficult relationships.  It just seems there is no hope.  If we were able to provide more spaces, they could be precisely what the women and children need to get out of their circumstances.<br\/><br\/>I have seven minutes and I want to give the Minister some time to respond.  My final point does not even relate to her but to an article in <i>The Sunday<\/i><i>Business Post<\/i>that referred to some talk in the negotiations on forming a Government to getting rid of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I hope that was an error.  Unfortunately, the talk is coming from our colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il.  I am open to correction, and really hope I will be corrected because I cannot emphasise enough how much of a retrograde step it would be to get rid of the Department.  As somebody who has been critical over the years, who will always continue to be constructively critical and who has a lot of difficulty with areas within the Department, I believe the solution is not to get rid of the Department but to work on it and reform it.  All one has to do is look at the history of how this country has treated women and children over the years.  I am totally opposed to even considering getting rid of or axing the one Department we have that deals primarily with women's and children's issues.  Sinn F&eacute;in is totally opposed to it.  I commit to doing everything in my power to ensure it is not axed.  It would be a very dark day for this country, given our record on women and children.  I hope the proposal does not represent a widespread view in Fianna F&aacute;il and that people will be strong enough to voice their opposition to it.  I am going to give the Minister the opportunity to respond, within my allowed time, on sustainability, domestic violence and the logistical issues.  I would also be interested in hearing her opinion on my point on the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600060#QQQ00500","speaker":"1449","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588786500,"counter":177,"content":"<p>The Minister has two options.

We made strong representations.  The solution was not the perfect one but at least those affected could have access to a payment of &euro;350.  This did not feature originally in terms of the initial negotiations for the bespoke model.<\/p>  <p>  I agree absolutely in respect of all the other issues the Deputy identified.  We continue to represent those concerned.  Some of the issues have been identified and are part of the revenue scheme that sits underneath the childcare scheme.  We are aware of those.<\/p>  <p>  I agree absolutely on the issue of sustainability .  As I believe the Deputy will be aware, everything we have done since the outbreak of the pandemic has been with the objective of having sustainability, in addition to the significant number of different supports, provided in different ways, for the sector itself, whether in respect of wages or overheads.  Programme support payments were brought forward to support the cash flow.  All of these must be borne in mind.  As she identified, there is a sustainability fund that takes in the private sector, etc.  Conversations in this regard are ongoing in the Department.  I am supportive of anything in favour of sustainability.  We want to find ways to ensure we keep the sector with us.  Of course, everyone decides for themselves whether they will sign up to schemes such as the temporary wage subsidy scheme for the childcare sector.  The figure of 83% is really good.  At the same time, it means 17% are not encapsulated.  There are all sorts of reasons for this but most of the employees are probably supported in some way because they may be on the pandemic unemployment payment.  We will, however, continue to find ways to see whether we can keep them with us.  Maybe when we open the childcare for healthcare workers and move on to the next phase of reopening, some of the other services would come to that scheme.  To be clear, as the Deputy will be aware, the current temporary wage subsidy scheme for the childcare sector is one scheme and there is another for the childcare for healthcare workers.  Those are two different schemes.  Some may opt for the second who have not been able to opt for the first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600061#RRR00500","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1588787100,"counter":181,"content":"<p>  I agree with what Deputy Funchion said about domestic violence.

I will start by extending my condolences to all the families that have lost people to the virus.  I thank the front-line services across the sectors who have kept everything open for the rest of us.<\/p>  <p>  It is an honour to stand here on behalf of the premier county.  It has taken us 102 years to make a bit of history and win back a Sinn F&eacute;in seat in Tipperary.  For that, I thank the party members in Cashel and all over the county who worked day and night and covered a massive amount of ground in the canvass.  I will be forever grateful for that.  I thank the 10,000 voters who placed their trust in me and assure them that I will work tirelessly on their behalf.  I assure those who did not give me a vote this time around that my door is always open to them, as is my phone.  I will represent each and every one of them to the best of my ability.<\/p>  <p>  I thank a few people who are not around, who are looking down on me and who would be very proud, such as my own mother and father, and Frankie, Timmy and Mickey as well.  They were a great help to me down through the years.  I thank my own family for all the support that they have given me.  Only for them I would not be here.  I again thank Helen, Gavin, Katie, Molly and Murty.<\/p>  <p>  At the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis, when all of us were faced with the uncertainty that lay ahead, early childhood educators in particular were left in limbo by the Government which had failed to act on the concerns raised by the representatives of the sector prior to the election.  The challenges facing the sector were well known by all of us prior to the election.  On the doorsteps in every corner of Tipperary, the costs to parents and the working conditions for staff and providers were a common concern during the election and they have been since.  Unfortunately, since the start of the crisis there was an initial lack of clarity regarding staff wages.  After immense work by the sector itself and my colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in, among others, it is welcome that the Minister saw sense on this issue.  However, many other serious concerns remain.  The larger challenges facing the sector have not been addressed.  In our election manifesto, Sinn F&eacute;in called for a fully publicly funded early years model of childcare and it is clear now that this is exactly what is needed to protect this vital area of service.<\/p>  <p>  What long-term measures to support the early years sector have been considered as part of the Government's roadmap for reopening Ireland.  As the early years sector goes back to work from 18 May, we cannot simply go back to the dysfunctional system that existed before the lockdown, which providers, workers and parents had united in protest against through the Big Start campaign.  In Tipperary, I have been contacted by workers and providers in the early years sector who are concerned with the lack of engagement on this issue.  They are worried that in the rush to reopen, that the concerns they spent months trying to get the Government to act on will be ignored.  Many of them are smaller providers whose very viability, which was already precarious, has been threatened even further by the lockdown.  They fear that the Government will settle for getting back to normal.  Unfortunately, normal was not good enough for parents, children, workers or providers in the early years sector.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to ask the Minister two questions.  The first is what long-term plan the Government has to support the early years sector.  The second is whether the Minister will commit to supporting a publicly funded childcare model that would reduce the cost on parents and improve the pay of workers in the sector.  The Minister can provide written responses.

Last week, the Taoiseach announced that childcare services would open on 29 June for the children of essential workers.  That was a major announcement but childcare workers have told me that there has been virtually no discussion with the sector about how this will work.  If I may, I will put the questions that those workers have asked me to put to the Minister and ask that she respond in a written reply.  <\/p> <p> Given that other educational settings will not reopen in June, how does the Government intend to ensure the safety of staff and children in cr&egrave;ches?  Will PPE be provided to all staff?  Will children be expected to wear masks?  If so, will childcare workers be expected to keep the masks on the children?  Will the staff be expected to operate social distancing with and among children and how will this be done?  This must be considered not only with toddlers running around but also feeding, changing nappies and putting children to sleep.  What provisions will in place in those instances?  What is the childcare worker to do when the four year old in their care wants a hug?  How will a parent hand over a baby to staff while observing 2 m physical distance?  What of childcare workers whose partners are also front-line workers - who will mind their children?  What of single parents working in childcare whose children are usually cared for in school or by an elderly relative?  The cost of their childcare may be almost equal to their wages.  Will the Government pay for that?  What of childcare workers who live with vulnerable people?  Will they be exempted or will they be penalised if they are unable to go to work for fear that they might bring home an infection?  As the Minister noted, many cr&egrave;ches will operate below capacity in these circumstances but they will still have full outgoings such as rent, wages and other bills, as well as additional expenses such as sanitation costs.  Will the Minister give a commitment that the Government will make up the shortfall?<\/p> <p> Has the Government considered the wide array of childcare settings?  What will happen in the case of those located in bigger premises such as shopping centres or community buildings in which there is considerable other activity and where facilities such as toilets and washrooms are sometimes shared?

She answered my question on the number of childcare providers that have engaged with the wage subsidy scheme.  The figure she provided was 3,733.  How many employees will benefit as a consequence?<\/p>  <p>  On the sector's ability to rebound after the Covid restrictions have been entirely lifted, how many facilities will resume activity and at what capacity will they do so?  The Minister said she had been notified by seven providers that they plan to close.  I expect that number will rise.  Has she done any work on that?<\/p>  <p>  During the Minister's engagement with key personnel in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, Tusla and Members of the Oireachtas, I raised, on behalf of one of my Green Party colleagues, the issue of insurance coverage and rebates to providers for the period of closure.<\/p> <p>Does the Minister have any analysis or results in respect of the work she was undertaking?  What ongoing supports, outside of those being implemented during this period, does she envisage will be required in the coming months?  I appreciate that this is a somewhat open-ended question but the Minister might endeavour to answer it.  Should there be a second wave of the virus in the winter, as Deputy Carty mentioned, what expectation is there that childcare providers will be given personal protective equipment?  Are there plans afoot within the Department to cater for that scenario?  What additional supports does the Minister envisage for the access and inclusion model for children with additional needs?  Deputy Rabbitte rightly raised the issue of the clawback by Pobal, the impact that might have on certain providers and whether the Department will step in.<\/p> <p> From time to time, capital grants have been made available to the industry.  I appreciate that we will most likely be entering a difficult financial scenario as a result of this pandemic.

Therefore, some comment on the record would be appreciated.

My thanks also to all our front-line and essential workers who are keeping us safe during this time.  My thanks to everyone who is leaving their family day in and day out to join the fight against Covid-19.  Others are spending day in and day out with their families.  I wish to pay tribute to them as well.<\/p>  <p>  In particular, I wish to pay tribute to parents throughout the country.  Parenting in Covid-19 is tough out.  It comes with considerable added pressure, heightened tensions and raw emotions.  Parents' skills have been stretched and their patience has been tested.  Today, in over 850,000 households, parents are double-jobbing as home school teachers.  They have had to become technologically able to access schoolwork online and intellectually able to teach it.  If they have teenagers, they are trying to coax them away from their friends on the green, smartphones or online games and encourage them instead into the possibly less attractive world of schoolwork and exercise.  If they have children preparing for the leaving certificate, then they have had to become guidance counsellors leading them through what is traditionally a stressful time during a unique period of uncertainty.  If they have toddlers, they have had to become preschool teachers, experts at arts and crafts and ways of developing their child's creativity and imagination in an entertaining way.  If they have a child with special needs, then they are doing their utmost to create a new routine amid chaos.  Many parents have children spanning different age groups and they have had to learn how to prioritise what is virtually impossible.  All that is before they start cooking, cleaning or, as in the new trend, baking.<\/p>  <p>  Every parent has had to parent at a new level.  They are managing their children's anxieties and worries through uncertainty.  They are managing their children's development and education through unprecedented times and it is tough going.  They love having more time at home with the children but it is full-on.  It is particularly challenging for working parents who are struggling to balance all of these new demands with working from home or working on the front line.  These parents are not simply double-jobbing; they are triple-jobbing.  I have many friends in that situation and I am in awe of them.  I am so proud of them and so impressed by their ability to do it all.  However, I know that many parents are feeling the opposite of impressive.  Instead, many are doubting their abilities or feeling guilty about having to juggle so much.  They are afraid they are not doing enough or that they are neglecting their child or professional responsibilities or both.  They are afraid they are not as good at this as some of the people who share their perfect stories on Instagram.<\/p> <p>However, I would say to any one of those parents, \"Please know that it is enough.\"  Their best is all they can give and all anyone can expect of them.  I know there will be many parents looking forward to getting a break when this is all over.  For some that will be a holiday down the country; for some it will be reuniting their kids with their grandparents and for others -  there is no shame in admitting it - it will be going back to work.  The only way to make sure those parents can go back to work and contribute to rebuilding our economy is to make sure their childcare services are back in operation.  We have seen the plan to reopen childcare gradually but we are still missing the plan for the childcare service itself.  I am working with childcare providers in Lucan, Clondalkin, Palmerstown, Newcastle, Rathcoole, Saggart and Brittas, many of whom have not charged one family since March.  They have had no income from families in all that time and, like every other business in Ireland that has had to shut its doors, their rents, rates and bills are all still coming through those closed doors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600064#UUU00500","speaker":"1566","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588788900,"counter":205,"content":"<p>The time is up.

Much of this is about planning for the future.  I will address that a little.  Many have asked a variation on Deputy Higgins's question.  Needless to say, like other Departments, we have begun planning for the phased reopening of services.  As the Deputy knows, when the pandemic hit we immediately started the wage subsidy scheme.  We have it planned and are implementing it, and we have been planning for childcare for healthcare workers.  That was the next thing we did.  That scheme is about to open.  That is the first part of the phased reopening, as I said.  The next phase of reopening concerns going back to centre-based childcare, especially for essential workers.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies Higgins and Rabbitte asked whether it was 29 June or July, what the dates are for the phasing, and the plans for all that.  One of the most important things to say is that the services will not open at full capacity - I think the Deputies are aware of that - due to the ongoing public health restrictions.  That will impact not only access to the services, but also their sustainability, the cost to parents and the cost to the State.  One of the reasons for the cost of childcare services is that it is heavily shaped by the adult-child ratios.  As I have said at other times, 70% of the costs are associated with pay.  Part of our planning is looking at what the initial adult-child ratios will have to be.  We must be in conversation with NPHET and the Department of Health in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  As for the early years forum consultation, on which many people joined me yesterday evening, we have begun that planning with the sector.  We have invited members of the sector to meet us again in a couple of weeks.  We will put together a small group of the representative bodies of the sector to help us plan many of those things.  I will have to address some of that as we move along.  Deputy Rabbitte asked earlier about the statement in the phased reopening map that we will start with one day a week.  That was just to give people an example of what it might look like.  It does not mean those decisions have been made, to be clear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600065#VVV00700","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speech","time":1588788900,"counter":211,"content":"<p>We now move to the Green Party, which has ten minutes.

I thank the Minister for her update.  I have just a couple of questions from that and then some general points.  The Minister stated 83% of providers have engaged with the scheme, which leaves, by my very quick calculations, 764 who have not.  When we had our briefing last week, the Minister's Department said it would engage with those providers to find out why.  Has she had any engagement with those 764 who have not signed up?<\/p> <p>Can she provide any information as to why they have not signed up?  Are we likely to lose those providers?  The Minister stated that only seven providers have closed so far but that number of 764 would dwarf everything that has happened in the past three years.  Some information about that prospect would be useful.<\/p> <p> W all talk about essential workers whereas the Minister is carefully using the words \"healthcare workers\".  As Deputy Rabbitte indicated, there are many more essential workers who require childcare and early years support.  The people in my local supermarket are as much essential to our survival at this point as any other workers.  Some clarity on the phasing and who will be able to access these services would be welcome.  The phasing is important.  The Minister stated that she is consulting with providers.  That is great to hear and I accept that this issue is difficult and complex, with many moving parts, including the guidance from NPHET.  I encourage the continuation of engagement with the early years forum and providers because it would be a shame to lose providers that are unable to engage with the phased opening when we have held onto them so far.<\/p> <p> It is important to remember that many of our early years and youth work settings, for which the Minister has responsibility, as well as the family resource centres and these sorts of services provide much more than care and education.  Many of these services are also providing a simple hot meal to children who might not otherwise get one.<\/p> <p> Deputy Funchion mentioned the increase in domestic violence and we know that there has been a fall in the number referrals to Tusla at this time.  It is important to remember that these services provide supports for vulnerable people and I would hope that, in any phased reopening, we can focus on those who are more vulnerable and who need the wider protections that these services offer.<\/p> <p> I echo the comments about July provision.  I have been lobbied by several parents in my constituency who rely heavily on July provision and asked me to raise the issue because of how important it is to them in dealing with vulnerable young people.<\/p> <p> I will pick up on something from our briefing the other day during which the Minister mentioned a change to fostering regulations.  Would she be able to provide the technical details of those proposed changes in writing?  The wording of the change would be useful.  I do not know if it has happened yet but it would be fine if the Minister could provide that in writing.<\/p> <p> There is plenty of time left so the Minister should feel free to reply to Deputy Funchion about any thoughts or comments she may have about newspaper articles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600065#VVV00900","speaker":"1570","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588789500,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  It is good to continue the conversation.  In addition to the early years forum briefing and consultation I had last night, I met many of the Opposition spokespeople a few days ago and answered their questions.  It is good to meet Deputy Costello again.<\/p>  <p>  Why did 764 providers not sign up to the scheme?  We are continuing to discuss that with the various representative bodies.  I agree with the Deputy that we need carry out that analysis.  We are today publishing some new frequently asked questions which might assist.  There may be issues in getting workers who originally went onto the pandemic unemployment payment to move to the wage subsidy scheme.  As I indicated earlier, we tried to create the best possible supports in the wage subsidy scheme so that people would come back to the industry.  We are attentive to the issue and the Deputy is right to continue asking those questions.<\/p>  <p>  I indicated that the first phase of opening will be childcare for healthcare workers and perhaps some providers will come back for that.  That may be more attractive to the workers when we are able to release the details of what that actually means.  I indicated in my opening remarks that we are suggesting an average rate per hour.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about the distinction between essential workers and healthcare workers.  I am using that language because it is the language of the roadmap and what NPHET has recommended.  The recommendation is that we begin with providing services to healthcare workers and then move on to the other essential workers, to the extent that we can attract the workers to provide that childcare.<\/p> <p>As indicated, many of them want to answer that call.  That is the reason for the difference in the use of language.<\/p> <p> The Deputy made a point about when we start to reopen in that third phase.  In the childcare sector, we hope that we will have more of the essential workers, which is a wider group than the healthcare essential workers.  What children have priority in terms of coming in?  My view, which I have already shared with the Department, and it agrees, is to find a way in which we can begin to recommend those children who are most vulnerable, who have additional needs and who have not had the kinds of supports that other children have had during the pandemic because of their particular backgrounds, circumstances or whatever.  I agree with that but those are things that have to be decided in the planning as we move forward.  As I have indicated, we are engaging with the sector in order to do that and are preparing that.  I expect that the Deputies will be part of what happens in this regard.<\/p> <p> I wrote down the word \"emergency\" when the Deputy asked his final question.

We do not know that we need it yet but if there are additional children who need foster care parents it is to try to get them to those as soon as possible.  To ensure that the regulations have the best possible protections, I invited the special rapporteur on child protection and the Ombudsman for Children Ombudsman to look at what we have done.  This has now happened.  They have added a few more suggestions.  We are amending the regulations and I will be signing them as soon as I can in order to implement that.<\/p>  <p>  I read in the newspapers about documents relating to plotting the demise of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs but I also note that it is the sixth largest spending Department with a budget of &euro;1.6 billion.  That has increased over the past number of years thanks to good negotiation on behalf of the great team I work with.  I have also heard that 60 NGOs have come out, at least under the leadership of the Children's Rights Alliance, and made the points made by Deputy Funchion.

I propose to make a short opening statement and then have a rapid-fire round with the Minister.  I, too, welcome the competence of the Minister in respect of the vital role the Department plays in Irish society.  I know there are Members present in the House who are part of a tentative Government who would be very sensitive to the needs of children and ensuring that we, as a society, recognise the role of children and the importance of maintaining a Minister at Cabinet level.  That is vital.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister sincerely for her work to date.  I say without any pl&aacute;m&aacute;s that she has been one of the most progressive Ministers that we have had in respect of her role.  I genuinely wish her well for the future and thank her and her officials for the progressive role they have played in terms of protecting and progressing the rights of children in society.  I thank her for being here today.<\/p>  <p>  I want to outline in brief terms that there is an element to this crisis that has not received the attention it deserves.  For working mothers, the burden of childcare continues to fall predominantly on them during this time.  As progressive as we like to believe we are as a society, the demands that have fallen on working mothers in the absence of a proper childcare structure means that women are effectively being held back because they are again assuming traditional household roles for the most part.<\/p> <p> That is the sad reality of the situation.  As a parent of two young children, as progressive and all as I like to think I am, I know the reality is that working mothers still assume the vast bulk of the role of maintaining and managing a household.  It is having an impact on their career progression as we speak.  That is why it is vitally important that we restore the childcare system and have a pathway or roadmap which ensures all workers have access to the service in the shortest period of time possible.  It is vital that we step up the energy levels that are required to achieve that.<\/p> <p> I wish to make a point regarding the wage subsidy scheme as it relates to women who are returning from maternity leave.  The Minister may not be able to answer it as she is probably not the line Minister for the issue.  It is vitally important that the legislation be amended, as articulated by SIPTU, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the National Women's Council of Ireland and Members in this House today, so that those returning from maternity leave are eligible to apply for the wage subsidy scheme.  The Labour Party lends its voice to that call.  If we are to talk about equality and the progression of women in society, we must ensure this anomaly is corrected by way of legislation.<\/p> <p> I thank the Minister for giving us some clarity today regarding the roadmap.  My questions in regard to it are very simple.  The first is specific and relates to the &euro;15 per hour the Minister says will be paid to workers to go into the homes of healthcare staff.  Has there been an assessment in real time of demand for that service?  Do we know how many healthcare workers are actively looking for this provision?  Second, what is the anticipated supply of workers?  Third, where is the incentive for somebody who is currently availing of the wage subsidy scheme or Covid-19 payment as an employee to move off that payment and into work in the home of a healthcare worker?  Fourth, what protocols will be designed around ensuring the safety of the worker going into the home?  We recognise the needs of healthcare workers but we must also ensure that where a childcare or early years worker decides to volunteer, he or she can feel safe going into a particular house.  Will there be Garda vetting of members of the household to protect the volunteer who is going in?  Will that be a requirement of the scheme?  What are the insurance permutations for the household into which a worker is coming?  Those are my opening questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600067#XXX00500","speaker":"1514","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588790100,"counter":221,"content":"<p>The time is running out but I will give the Deputy plenty of opportunity to come in again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600068#YYY00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1588790100,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I hope I will be able to come in with a second round of questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600068#YYY00300","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1588790100,"counter":223,"content":"<p>We will get the answers to that set of questions from the Minister first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600068#YYY00400","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1588790100,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions and his opening comments regarding the importance of childcare and the reality of, although he did not use that phrase, the double jobbing and extra responsibility on mothers.

I already indicated that even in the reopening phase there will be a substantial requirement in order to begin offering childcare again because of the social distancing and staff-child ratio requirements, etc.  I agree fully with Deputy Sherlock's points in this regard and with the point Deputy Funchion made that if we are now paying the full wages of people in the sector, it may be the right time to move towards a really substantial increase in provision that would make the sector more affordable and, therefore, less burdensome, particularly for women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600068#YYY00500","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1588790400,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I understand the House recently established a cross-party committee to examine the issues related to Covid-19.

As the Deputy knows, these are private providers and we cannot tell them what to pay.  I think it is significant that we are indicating that amount and I would hope that they can reach it.  On the Deputy's question regarding an audit, the HSE did carry out an audit to try to get a sense of the demand among the 8,000 families it was indicated anticipated supply.  The Deputy is correct on the need for incentives.<\/p>  <p>  We know that Early Childhood Ireland and others have engaged with the members of their organisation on whether they would be willing to participate and many responded that they wanted to but, obviously, it was dependent on what was being offered.  I hope that when I am able to identify more of the detail tomorrow at the launch it will be attractive to some people in terms of the wage and proposed working hours.  As I said earlier, this scheme will provide for up to 45 hours per week of childcare.

To date, the focus has been on the immediate health impacts which have been devastating for so many families.  However, the impact of Covid-19 goes far beyond the immediate threat to physical health.  It will leave a long-term scar on our society that will take time and effort to heal.<\/p> <p>One group that will find this period particularly difficult are our children and teenagers.  Unfortunately, much of the discourse around children and teens since Covid-19 has arrived has been negative.  They have been described as super-spreaders and as vectors, they have been banned from shops, which makes it nearly impossible for lone parents to shop for food safely, and teenagers in particular have borne a considerable amount of negative commentary.  In reality, our children have done an amazing job over the last few months.  What we have often forgotten in all of this is that their world has literally been turned upside down.  They can no longer hang out with their friends in school or in their clubs and many have missed out on the rites of passage that accompany their big milestones, such as moving from primary to secondary school.  They have had to adjust to remote learning, which may be difficult for many and impossible for some.  Their routines have been completely interrupted, impacting on children with additional needs in particular.  Social distancing measures, while necessary from a health perspective, mean that many children's social skills may regress.<\/p> <p> Therefore, while many children will do okay, many others are lonely, confused and anxious.  Some are experiencing digital poverty, some are facing issues of food poverty and some will be isolated at home with their abusers.  We do not know what we are going to find when we finally get to open the door on homes across the country.  There are some certainties, however.  Our children will need help to reintegrate.  From an educational perspective, the usual summer slide, where the long summer break means that children lose some of the skills they gained over the previous school year, will be greatly increased.  Our usual summer slide will now be super-charged into a Covid-19 slide.  This will disproportionately impact on children and young people who are already at a disadvantage, whether educationally or socially.  The gap will widen.  Unless this is addressed, some children will never be able to make up the time and the learning experiences they have lost.<\/p> <p> While we can say we could never have imagined the Covid-19 crisis that has hit our shores, we will not have that excuse when it comes to protecting our most vulnerable children into the future.  What we need is a cross-departmental task force that develops a transition plan specifically for children and young people.  It needs to involve the Departments of Health, Education and Skills and Justice and Equality, as well as the children's rights organisations.  It needs to pre-empt, plan and prepare the supports that children require as we move through the next number of months.  Vulnerable children and those with additional needs should be a priority and the resources of the State should be directed at those children.  For example, could schools open for children who are currently under the care of Tusla, for those children who require educational supports or for children of front-line healthcare workers?  As this has happened in other countries, is it something we could do here?<\/p> <p> Transition questions need to be asked and answered in a proactive manner.  How will our children be reintegrated into the school community?  How will we make sure every child has access to mental health and wraparound supports if they need them?  Does the curriculum need to be revised to take into account the six-month educational gap?  How do we make sure that our schools are better prepared for remote learning?  How do we make sure that childcare is being provided in a safe manner that is appropriate for children and families?<\/p> <p> The Department of Children and Youth Affairs needs to be the lead agency on this transition task force.  It has demonstrated that it can work successfully across agencies and Departments, representing the best interests of children.  This is the key reason the reported proposal by Fianna F&aacute;il to disband the Department would be such a regressive step.  There needs to be a Department and a Minister whose sole purpose is children and that has children and young people at its heart.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is needed now, more than ever, to ensure that children are protected as we move through the recovery.  Will the Minister set up a transition task force, led by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, that specifically deals with children and young people, and that develops a child-focused transition plan, working with key agencies, and ensures that children and young adults get the supports and help they need over the coming months?<\/p> <p> My next questions relate to childcare.  Our childcare sector, much of which is already operating on a knife-edge, faces an uncertain future.  I am aware of some providers which, unfortunately, have closed their doors.  This is obviously difficult for those businesses and the families they support, and, unfortunately, it is likely that many others will follow suit, despite the best efforts of the Department.  When parents are in a position to rejoin the workforce, they will need to know their children have a place with their childcare provider.<\/p> <p>As a parent, I know how important it is for a family to click with a carer.  Families would absolutely hate to give those people up.  It is very important for these relationships to continue.  It is important for the Department to consult and engage with providers, listen to suggestions and make all efforts to ensure the sustainability of the sector.  It is a key cog in the context of restarting our economy and for families and children.  Previously, I requested that the Department expand the remit of the sustainability fund to provide additional financial supports to those providers who may find they just cannot make it through the next few months.  I reiterate the importance of this additional support for providers and ask the Minister for an update on my proposal to repurpose that fund to support at-risk childcare providers so they can be there when parents go back to work and need them most.<\/p> <p> There also needs to be some clarity on the reopening of cr&egrave;ches, and the Minister has gone through some of this, because there is considerable confusion as to how that will happen.  Home-based childminders also seek clarity on where they fit into the phasing plans, and whether there is an opportunity for them to look after one family in particular and be that family's provider.  This could help them open up earlier than is in the phasing plan at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600069#ZZZ00700","speaker":"1627","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1588791300,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Whitmore.

I tried to indicate some of this in my opening remarks, to acknowledge their agency, resilience and actions, and to be aware in particular of those who have additional needs or backgrounds that require additional supports when we come to reopen in a different way.  We are conscious of this.  In this regard, for 2020 I got an additional &euro;10 million for the Department's access and inclusion model.  This money is still in the budget and will be used for children with additional needs.

It seems like an eternity since, on 5 February, we saw the biggest national demonstration by childcare workers calling for a national investment in childcare.  It seems like a different century almost, and it was three days before the general election.  I was at it, like others in this Chamber, and it was an unprecedented demonstration.  There must have been about 20,000 people at it.  There was an incredible atmosphere.  The main issues were in respect of low pay, retention of staff, high cost of cr&egrave;che places, affordability and insurance costs.  Those issues almost created a perfect storm around childcare.  One of the main messages from that demonstration was the fragmented nature of childcare in Ireland.  Generally the Minister has done a good job in her position but childcare is - I do not like using the word - slightly dysfunctional in Ireland.  One thing that needs to come out of the post-pandemic world is that childcare for all workers, front-line and essential workers, should be free and should be funded from the point of central taxation.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome that places will be available for front-line workers.  I think a figure of 5,000 was mentioned for the home setting.  Why did it take so long for that to happen?  Why did it take nine weeks to happen after all the schools were closed in the State?  A large number of front-line workers were extremely frustrated about getting access to childcare.  Before, sometimes they would give their children to grandparents and so forth, but that was not feasible whatsoever.  This shows the dysfunctional aspects of childcare in Ireland.  If there is one thing that needs to come out of the post-pandemic situation, it is that childcare needs to be looked at and made free at the point of availability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600072#CCCC00100","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speech","time":1588791600,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  Starting with his last question first, and I think I tried to answer this before, it is reasonable to ask why it took so long.  I heard the frustration from the healthcare workers as well and I spoke to many of them myself.  I went on radio and was public about saying I thought we should have it, and this was before there was a decision by Dr. Tony Holohan and the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET to say yes, it was okay.  The issue they were grappling with was the potential public health risk.  Ultimately, they made a decision that we could begin and it will begin on 18 May.  My Department and officials have been preparing for that for a number of weeks.  We will put that in place and we hope we are ready.  It is not going to be straightforward, I am sure.  There is a lot in that.  That is why it took so long.  We are ready.  It is not going to be straightforward and I am sure there are going to be difficulties and challenges.  From my perspective and that of my Department, we were not responsible for that.  It was the responsibility ultimately of the experts who were offering the advice to Government.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy talked about the issues within the sector, of which I am fully aware and, as I indicated, I have tried to address many of them in different ways over the past four years.  By the way, in the last year before 2000, I think I was actually the first one to hold a childcare march when I was chief executive of the National Women's Council.  We went down O'Connell Street and I had lots of people behind me.<\/p> <p>As the Deputy knows, I believe in marches.  Yes, there is criticism that it is something on which we did not move fast enough, but part of the work I did as Minister was to encourage the voice to be raised, and that is what they did.  I am proud that that happened.  At the same time, I point out that there are still a lot of issues and problems.  I have said before that I, too, believe childcare should be free.  Ultimately, I would love to see that.  This is why affordability was so central to the work as well as the professionals who work there.

We need to develop a national childcare service in this country, and it can be done.  The question is, is now not the time to do it?  Our so-called normal model of childcare was a failure.  It was a failure for families who were spending, on average, one fifth of their income on childcare, which was one of the highest in Europe.  It was definitely a failure for workers who were not getting even the &euro;15 per hour the Minister has spoken of, which would be a big improvement for many, but were on barely over &euro;10 per hour, part-time contracts, casual work and so on.  It was also a failure for many small cr&egrave;che owners who were faced with a crisis in insurance costs and everything else.  The Minister said earlier that the State was already paying 60% of the total costs.  Now the State will pay more than ever.  Is now not the time to seize the moment and say goodbye to that privatised model of childcare and instead to begin to build that sort of national childcare service today?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600073#DDDD00200","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1588791900,"counter":239,"content":"<p>Deputy Murphy will not be surprised if I say that I do not think it was all a failure.

If this is the case for those childcare workers, and it very definitely should be the case for them, should it not also be the case that all childcare workers at a minimum going forward should be on &euro;15 per hour?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600073#DDDD00400","speaker":"1628"},{"type":"speech","time":1588791900,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I am glad the Deputy asked that question.

I highlight four of the measures in particular.  The first is the fact that parents or guardians will not have to pay for childcare while the cr&egrave;ches and preschools are closed, which is an important step; second, that the children's places will be protected and assured for the duration of the crisis; third, that the salaries of the staff will be paid in full, which is a fantastic measure; and fourth, that there is a contribution from State funds to the overheads of the cr&egrave;ches and preschools, which works out as 15% of the staff costs, a significant contribution.  By any measure, this is the most substantial support being provided to any sector of Irish society during the Covid-19 emergency, and the Minister and her staff should be commended on securing such a deal.<\/p><p>I had a list of approximately ten questions but I am happy to report that eight of them have been answered so I will not ask them again.  I nonetheless have two specific, technical questions that the Minister might assist me with.  The first relates to insurance, and while the issue has been mentioned, my question is in a slightly different capacity.  Our cr&egrave;ches and preschools will be closed for at least four months, which works out as approximately one third of the year, and only one insurance company provides insurance for the vast majority of centres in the sector.  Would it be unreasonable to look for a <i>pro rata<\/i>rebate for one third of the year in the policies?  It would be worth negotiating.  If it is not possible, or if the insurance company says &quot;No&quot;, another approach might solve the issue raised by Deputy Sherlock.  If we are looking for insurance for childcare professionals to go into healthcare workers' houses, could that risk cover be transferred onto the childcare professionals going into those houses?  It is only an opinion of mine that I give freely and the Minister may do with it what she wishes, but it would be nice to know whether any negotiations have taken place between her officials and the insurance company mentioned.  If not, is it something that might be considered in the future?<\/p><p>My second question relates to term-time contracts.  Many Deputies may not be aware than many childcare professionals are not on full-time contracts but instead are employed for only nine months of the year, specifically for the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme.  Traditionally, these precariously employed workers are laid off at the end of June every year and re-employed in September.  They are out of pocket, therefore, for three months.  Can we get the Minister's assurance that they will not be laid off from the Covid-19 payment, at least?  Will any measures given to their peers who normally have a 12-month contract be extended to ECCE workers, who are on a term-time contract?<\/p><p>I wish the Minister the best of luck in whatever endeavours she takes from here on and thank her very much for her contribution to Irish society in recent years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600074#EEEE00100","speaker":"1587"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1588792500,"counter":249,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's first question, Deputy Farrell raised something similar but I did not get to it.  Allianz will give a rebate for insurance costs and Early Childhood Ireland is working with it further to maximise the return.  An absolute sum has not yet been decided but Allianz has agreed to provide a rebate.  On the other insurance issue, Allianz has agreed that when childcare workers go into homes, the way in which they normally insure will be extended to them.<\/p>  <p>  I think the Deputy will be aware that we have sanction to continue the wage subsidy scheme until 18 June and we will consider what further measures will be appropriate beyond that point, including for ECCE, which the Deputy mentioned.  We are planning the introduction of childcare for healthcare workers, as I have indicated.  It is open to anyone working on ECCE to apply to volunteer for this so, potentially, some wages will continue to work towards the measure to retain the childcare workforce in line with plans for a phased opening.  Whatever the measures are that move into the future, those workers will be part of it somehow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600074#EEEE00200","nonspeaker":"Katherine Zappone"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1588792800,"counter":250,"content":"<p>We hope to find a way so that what we are doing is done in tandem with measures that are agreed by Government when the current scheme comes to an end on 18 June.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1588792800,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Mattie McGrath.  The response to childcare needs, especially with respect to the front-line healthcare workers and essential workers has been disappointing overall.  I accept that it is an issue complicated by public health advice but the fact remains that the approach to date has been fragmented and marked by much confusion.  I note that on 1 May, the Minister issued a statement to say that existing registered childcare services will be invited to participate in overseeing the provision of childcare in the homes of healthcare and essential workers from 18 May.  That is almost two weeks away and it is of great concern to these workers, who are doing fantastic work in our communities and who have to be commended.  Initially, it was reported a fortnight ago that the HSE had estimated that more than 8,000 healthcare staff are in need of childcare support.  Subsequently, another report estimated that the figure was much higher, which shows there is an urgent need for quick action.  Is it acceptable that a voluntary scheme that aims to respond to this will not be in place until 18 May?  It is putting those workers under incredible pressure.  Can actions be taken urgently in this respect?  Can a process be sped up and can the bureaucratic difficulties that are holding it up be dealt with?  I would like the Minister to take that on board and to answer those questions.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue I would like to raise is how child welfare is being prioritised in this time of crisis.  As I understand it, Tusla, as a critical provider of essential front-line services for children and families, remains engaged in several key areas: child protection and children in care; emergency out-of-hours services; and domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services.  I noted the comments made by the chief executive of Tusla, Bernard Gloster, that all referrals or concerns about children are being screened and assessed in line with normal practice and that where a child is at immediate risk, he or she will receive an immediate protective response.  However, the chief executive also noted that Tusla is seeking indications that the number of referrals to child protection and welfare services are lower than usual at this time.  Some of this may be down to school closures and the lowering of referrals through that route but some of it may be more concerning.  Is the Minister certain that Tusla is capable of responding to the potential scale of this problem?  I know my colleague, Deputy Mattie McGrath, has previously noted from his research on this matter that a shocking 248,000 referrals across all categories of abuse, including physical and sexual abuse, were made to Tusla during the period from 2011 to 2018.  Those children are still out there and they need our assistance.  We have to ensure that child welfare remains a top priority, and I hope the Minister will engage with this particular aspect during her reply.<\/p>  <p>  The third issue I wish to raise relates to the concerns that have emerged around the increase in the incidence of domestic and gender-based violence.  From what I can see, there are clear indications that the number of such incidents are increasing in recent months.  Will the Minister outline the practical support measures she has put in place to respond to this in terms of increased refuge supports or access to volunteer helplines?  I wish to mention also that I am very aware there is a chronic lack of refuge supports and services in County Laois.  I ask the Minister to put emergency services, such as refuge services, in place immediately because it has been raised a number of times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600075#FFFF00200","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speech","time":1588793100,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I will call Deputy Mattie McGrath and the Minister can then reply to both Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600076#GGGG00100","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1588793100,"counter":253,"content":"<p>If not, we can get a written response.  I welcome that the Minister has come to the House despite the fact that she lost her seat in the election.  I wish her well in the future.<\/p>  <p>  There are serious concerns among self-employed owner-managers of childcare facilities who have been forced onto the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment while all their staff are receiving the wage subsidy scheme aimed at the retention of staff, which is good.  These owner-managers are still working with parents, supporting the staff and carrying out large amounts of administration duties, but are left on unemployment payment.  Will the Government examine this important cohort of managers, who appear to have fallen through the cracks, and ensure that they too are put on the wage subsidy scheme?  What will happen after mid-June?  Can they claim unemployment benefit for the summer months as well?  These people are vital.  They are owners and managers.  They planted the seeds for those cr&egrave;ches, built them up and employed their staff.  They are very good staff.  We do not want to have a \"them and us\" situation with the staff.  It is a team, an important team that grows around the love of caring for children.<\/p>  <p>  Ar an dara ceist, there are major concerns about the capacity issues in the early childcare sector after Covid-19.  While the wage subsidy scheme is welcome in the context of the retention and support of staff, there is great concern regarding the large loss of revenue that some services are facing.  Many services are reporting losses of over &euro;600 per week.  There is great concern about whether these services will be able to reopen.  They cannot sustain such losses.  They were already struggling and had experienced huge rises, sometimes a quadrupling, in the cost of insurance.  Some could not even get insurance.  We must address that.  At present, the sustainability fund is only available to not-for-profit services.  Can this fund be extended to include all services to improve the chances of reopening in September?  It is unfair; it is not a level playing field.  It should include everyone.<\/p>  <p>  On the wider childcare sector issues, given that all childcare facilities are currently closed, with staff paid directly via the wage subsidy scheme and a top-up from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, this is an opportunity to examine, regenerate and reinvest in the sector.  It is ironic to think that it takes a pandemic such as this to force a root-and-branch review of what is happening in the sector.  I salute all the workers and the public and private providers.  I was a founder member, and am still a board member, of Na&iacute;onra Chaisle&aacute;n Nua, which works through the medium of Irish, so I am aware of the work they do.  I also know about the onerous duties that fall on the voluntary board members.  They are getting more onerous due to regulations.  Deputy Nolan mentioned Tusla.  There is a need for that, but we are over-regulated in many areas and there is no proper, sustainable funding stream for the future.  Live horse and one will get grass.  One is always waiting.  There are also big pressures in all areas, including rural areas.  Children from 60 miles away are attending our cr&egrave;che.  It is a wonderful facility at the foothills of the Knockmealdown Mountains in Newcastle.  I pay tribute to the voluntary board, the staff and the management.<\/p>  <p>  I note that a new model is being proposed.  The Minister's programme for the period 2020 to 2025 was outlined before the election.  We must reinvest in what we have and look at the anomalies that exist and try to close them.  That is very important.  Despite the lip service paid to them over the years, there has been totally unfair discrimination against the carers in the home, be it mothers or fathers.  There is also the great effort and support provided by grandparents and the wider family.  The people who stay at home to mind their children must not be discriminated against.  There is discrimination against families in many areas across the Minister's Department, and I have raised this with her previously.  That is unacceptable.  We are making it almost undesirable for parents to stay at home.  There is no better place for the child to learn than the home.  That has been proven by studies carried out across the globe.<\/p>  <p>  This is a timely opportunity.  I believe many blessings will come out of this sad pandemic as well.<\/p> <p>We must insist that Governments, Departments and officials have due regard for the family as the best vehicle to rear children and do not have it discriminated against, as under many of the schemes in the past.  I have debated this with the Minister across this floor but nothing has changed.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  We support the parents in the first instance and, indeed, the local and voluntary cr&egrave;ches, in addition to the public ones.  I would appreciate answers.

I wish her well in the next phase.<\/p>  <p>  I have three brief questions.  Covid-19 has upturned everything.  From my conversations with providers and workers in the sector, I realise that many of them feel right now that they are in a kind of limbo.  Let me explain.  I refer to the email that arrived on Monday asking staff to volunteer to work in the homes of people who need childcare.  Issues arise regarding the provision of a proper service, personal protective equipment and guidelines on how specifically staff should operate.  We have heard about the low wages.  Are staff expected to travel to the houses?  Who will bear the cost?  There are many issues.  I am aware the Minister is trying to find a solution at a difficult time but the providers have to deal with the matter on a day-to-day basis.<\/p>  <p>  On the reopening of the sector, there are many issues.  The sanitisation of the centres comprises an extra cost.  Are there proposals to help the sector in this area?<\/p>  <p>  On the model of childcare, the Minister has given her view.  She spoke about her support for a fully funded childcare sector.  The Big Start campaign, supported by Siptu, is a measure we can consider.  Many of the community childcare providers are run by volunteers.  They survive only because of voluntary effort and the effort of other community groups.  Given where we are now, many of them may be unsustainable in the future.  I would like the Minister's views on that sector in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020050600077#HHHH00300","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1588793400,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her kind comments.  I acknowledge her extraordinary work over the years, which I have observed from a distance.<\/p>  <p>  In making her first point, she referred to an email calling for childcare for healthcare workers.  I understand what she is saying about the response and the feeling of being in limbo.  We felt we needed to at least begin the process so we could be ready when called on in that regard.  We are working with representative bodies of the childcare services to put together suggestions and guidance on how to move forward, and we are doing so as fast as we can.  We are responding but I understand it is not at the speed we, the workers and professionals would like.  I believe we will have the package relatively shortly, and it will be a good one.<\/p>  <p>  On the reopening and the proposals, I have talked a little here already.  We have begun the planning.  We have been engaging with the representative bodies, and individual service providers are sending us ideas on guidelines on what we need to lay out that would ensure the best possible safety for the children and workers and the ways in which we move forward in terms of the phased reopening.  That process has begun and we are working with the people who know best what is required.  We hope to meet again, within a two-week period, members of the early years forum, whom I met just yesterday or the day before to begin to talk about this process.<\/p> <p>I will refer to the model as we move forward.  A number of months ago, I established an independent expert group that is looking at a new model of public funding.  The group is continuing to do its work.  I hope it will be a resource for the new Government.<\/p> <p> In terms of the community and not-for-profit sector, we have always had our eye on that group of services which have particular and extraordinary gifts and resilience.  We have found ways to continue to support that sector.  Given its special circumstances and what I spoke about earlier, the Department will initially provide services to children in that sector, whatever their special needs or socio-economic circumstances, who have lost the most during this period.

She certainly took the constructive criticism very well.<\/p><p>I was most alarmed by the kite that was flown at the weekend in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>.  It has already been mentioned by Deputy Funchion.  I welcome the Minister's clarity on that.  In particular, I was alarmed that a kite would be flown suggesting that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs would be abolished in a year when we are waiting on a report from the commission on mother and baby homes, which is looking at a period from 1922 to 1998.  It is looking at 14 mother and baby homes and four other county homes.  We have had five interim reports.  I note the disrespect alone in that regard.<\/p><p>We know that the referral rate to Tusla is way down.  Given the background of the Charleton report, the HIQA report and the various other reports into Tusla &ndash; I mean no disrespect to its staff - it is clear there are gaping holes in the protection of children, yet a kite like that is flown in a Sunday newspaper.  The Minister has answered that point.<\/p><p>She also answered the question regarding the delay, which I welcome.  I have looked at the minutes concerning the delay in setting up emergency childcare for essential workers.  It was first mentioned in a NPHET meeting on 16 March.  The matter was also to be placed on the agenda for a meeting on 24 or 26 March but it did not.  It came up on 31 March as an <i>ad hoc<\/i>item.  Interestingly, we went from essential &quot;healthcare staff&quot; to essential &quot;workers&quot;, a more general term.  It seems that a paper was presented on 16 March.  It was mentioned <i>ad hoc<\/i>on 31 March and again on 3 April that there was a deliberative paper.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's view on whether the paper could be published.  I ask that it would be published.  It seems that there was a deliberative paper &ndash; that is an interesting word &ndash; entitled Emergency Childcare Provision for Essential Healthcare Workers.  We are back to &quot;healthcare&quot; workers again, yet nothing was done.  Then we move forward to 7 April.  At this point, the Department of Health refers to two recent reports, one from the ESRI, which is very interesting, on &quot;essential&quot; workers again &ndash; a broader term &ndash; and the need for emergency childcare.  It told us that essential workers constituted 20% of the workforce and 40% of them had children and would need assistance with childcare.  However, nothing was done and it is now May.  The Minister is now in a position to announce something.  I thank her for giving us as many details as she can, but it raises the question as to why this was not done before now.  The Minister said she was waiting.  The minutes say it was an essential item but it then went into never-never land.  The minutes state that the Minister was notified twice.  I ask her to respond to that point.<\/p><p>I take the opportunity to raise children with a disability, an issue that has been raised by other colleagues.  I do not have the time to read out the letters I received but I will read three of the words used in one letter.<\/p> <p>This is a child with autism and very special needs and who is doubly incontinent.  He needs and breathes routine, structure and certainty.  Who was the voice for that child on the NPHET committee?  Who was the voice who made those needs known for that child, one of many at home who are begging us to reopen the schools in some way so they can go forward?  They do not want computers or to talk about technology.  They want human contact.  Who was the voice for that child and those children?<\/p> <p> I will stop at that.
