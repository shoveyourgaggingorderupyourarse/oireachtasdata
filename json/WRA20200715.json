The Local Authorities make grant payments to the bank account of qualifying businesses, in accordance with the scheme.<\/p><p>The Restart Grant is, however, just one part of a wider assistance package for business and for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, the pandemic unemployment payment for the self-employed, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst SMEs.<\/p><p>Currently, any business (Sole Trader, Partnership or Limited Company) with less than 10 full time employees and annual turnover of up to &euro;2m may apply to Microfinance Ireland for funding from &euro;5,000 &ndash; &euro;50,000 where the business is not in a position to avail of finance from Banks and other commercial lending providers. The loan incurs 0% interest for the first six months and Zero repayments. Thereafter a reduced interest rate of 4.5% APR applies to loans applied for through the Local Enterprise Office. <\/p><p>All COVID-19 Business Schemes are under constant review in terms of the evolving situation and will be adapted as circumstances dictate, including adaptations to the phased opening of our economy. <\/p><p>In that regard, while the Restart Grant scheme has been broadly welcomed by business owners who benefited from it, I am aware of certain exclusions as the application and assessment processes have been rolled out.In line with an undertaking given in the Programme for Government, my Department is carrying out a general review of the Restart Grant.

The BCV Scheme provided up to &euro;2,500 in consultancy costs, to develop short and long-term strategies to respond to the initial pandemic and to plan for the eventual recovery and reopening of the economy.   The purpose of the scheme was to provide expert guidance and advice to SMEs employing up 50 people and enable business owners make informed decisions about what immediate measures and remedial actions could be taken at the outset of this crisis, to protect staff and sales and eventually help the business recover. The scheme was a resounding success in terms of uptake, the product of it being an appropriate support for that point in time. <\/p>  <p>  As the reopening of the economy continues apace, more and more businesses are transitioning from the planning to the implementation phase.  It is in this context that the BCV was phased out and superseded by the new &euro;250m Restart Grant which was introduced to assist micro and small businesses with the costs associated with reopening and re-employing workers following COVID-19 closures. <\/p>  <p>  The Restart Grant is available to businesses with a turnover of less than &euro;5m employing up to 50 people, which were closed or impacted by at least a 25% projected reduction in turnover to the end of June 2020.

In general terms, a company is permitted to initiate a winding up where it has complied with the requirements of the Companies Act 2014.  A company, both during normal operation and in a winding up process, must also of course abide by all relevant legal requirements including in relation to the treatment of employees and creditors and disclosure to Revenue.<\/p>  <p>  However, the provisions of the Companies Act 2014 provide safeguards to prevent the abuse of the liquidation system.  These include preferential payments under section 621 which provide for categories of employee entitlement such as wages owed, holiday remuneration, superannuation benefits, ill health payments and social welfare contributions.<\/p>  <p>  An insolvent company is defined by the Companies Act 2014 in section 818 as a company that is unable to pay its debts, and this is further defined in the Act. <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, insolvency cannot be merely asserted: insolvency is defined in the legislation and scrutinised in the courts.<\/p>  <p>  The Companies Act 2014 also provides provisions which may be utilised by liquidators or creditors of an insolvent company in appropriate cases, including section 608, regarding the court power to order return of assets which have been improperly transferred; and section 599 where a related company may be required to contribute to debts of company being wound up.  A range of factors will be involved for liquidators or creditors in deciding whether to pursue litigation based on these provisions of the Companies Act 2014. Such statutory provisions and the associated civil and criminal penalties also provide an important deterrent effect.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the liquidator of an insolvent company must report to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) on its demise and must also apply to the High Court for the restriction of each of the directors of the company, unless they are relieved of that obligation by the ODCE.  <\/p>  <p>  When it comes to workers, the Protection of Employment Act 1977 imposes a number of obligations on employers who are proposing collective redundancies, including official notification to the relevant Minister and a 30 day consultation period to allow employee representatives adequate opportunity to consider the employer&rsquo;s proposals and to make constructive proposals in response. While this legislation is currently the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, it will shortly transfer to my Department as part of a wider transfer of functions Order.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to redundancy entitlements it is the responsibility of the employer in the first instance to pay statutory redundancy and other wage related entitlements to eligible employees.  However, the Social Insurance Fund, under the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection provides a safety net for employees in situations where the employer cannot pay due to financial difficulties or insolvency. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has committed in the Programme for Government to:<\/p>  <p>  -  Review whether the current legal provisions surrounding collective redundancies and the liquidation of companies effectively protect the rights of workers;<\/p>  <p>  -  Review the Companies Act with a view to addressing the practice of trading entities splitting their operations between trading and property with the result being the trading business (including the jobs) go into insolvency and the assets are taken out of the original business;<\/p>  <p>  -  Examine the legal provision that pertains to any sale to a connected party following the insolvency of a company including who can object and the allowable grounds of an objection.<\/p>  <p>  As part of its next Work Programme, I will be requesting the Company Law Review Group to examine these Programme for Government commitments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071500081#WRB00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":86,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071500081#WRB00950"},{"type":"question","counter":87,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[16216\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071500081#WRB01000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the timeline for the appointment of the SME recovery task force; if relevant small and local business representative bodies will be consulted in the process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1616","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":88,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government identifies a number of groups which will be led by Government in shaping the engagement of enterprise and SMEs in the formulation of the policy responses at the different stages of the recovery.

Officials in my Department are alert to issues raised directly by the public and these inform the Department&rsquo;s ongoing engagement process and policy formation.<\/p>  <p>  The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme is one of the main tools with which we are protecting the income of employees who otherwise would not be working. However, whilst I acknowledge the seriousness of the issue you have raised and its impact on those affected, what I cannot do is mandate how temporary payments received under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme are treated in lending sustainability evaluations by regulators and lenders.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance I cannot mandate or overrule the internal risk assessment processes in any bank, even one in which the State has a shareholding. Furthermore I am specifically precluded from intervening in the case of any individual customer with any bank, even one in which the State has a shareholding. Decisions in this regard are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The independence of banks in which the state has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore the banking crisis we faced over ten years ago was fuelled by unsustainable lending. There are now thankfully far firmer regulatory controls and restrictions on lenders. Speaking on this particular issue, on 7 May the Governor of the Central Bank publicly noted that if an individual borrower&rsquo;s circumstances have changed such that doubt is cast over the sustainability of potential borrowing, it is in the best interests of the borrower and the bank if the situation is reviewed.<\/p>  <p>  The European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) apply here. These mandate that before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness. That assessment must take appropriate account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement. The CMCAR also provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement. The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders. Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower.<\/p>  <p>  This overall regulatory framework means a decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit is a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity. Where a formal loan offer is made by a lender, the loan offer may contain a condition that may allow the lender to withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the loan offer is also a commercial decision for the lender.<\/p>  <p>  These overlapping and complementary regulations are designed to protect consumers, prevent risky unsustainable lending, protect the integrity of the financial system and preserve competition in the market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071500084#WRF01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":212,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071500084#WRF02100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Caiteachas Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta","counter":211,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071500084#WRF02000"},{"type":"question","counter":212,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[16274\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071500084#WRF02100","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"mionsonra&iacute; a thabhairt faoi c&eacute;n f&aacute;th go ndearna an St&aacute;t Iarratas Plean&aacute;la (Uimhir Thagartha: 20683) i mB&eacute;arla amh&aacute;in chuig Comhairle Contae na Gaillimhe i dtaobh Auqaculture Business Park a th&oacute;g&aacute;il i nGaeltacht Chonamara; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&iacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1577","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":213,"content":"<p>T&aacute; P&aacute;irc na Mara, p&aacute;irc nu&aacute;la&iacute;ochta muir&iacute; &iacute;seal-charb&oacute;in nua-aimseartha aitheanta mar cheann de thionscnaimh strait&eacute;iseacha &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta chun f&aacute;s san earn&aacute;il mara a chur chun cinn agus chun f&aacute;s eacnama&iacute;och agus fosta&iacute;ochta i gceantar tuaithe a chumas&uacute;.

This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts can continue in these posts for the next school year in the normal way.<\/p><p>- Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. <\/p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, will not be necessary for this process.<\/p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030\/2014, remains unchanged.<\/p><p>It is expected that schools will as a first step review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030\/2014. <\/p><p>Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, will be dealt with by way of an exceptional review process. <\/p><p>The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations will be available to schools throughout the 2020\/21 school year. <\/p><p>Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071500085#WRG01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education Policy","counter":236,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071500085#WRG01200"},{"type":"question","counter":237,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[16215\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071500085#WRG01300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the way in which a registered educational and membership body here can be awarded chartered status and confer individual charter status to its members; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":238,"content":"<p>My Department has no role in awarding or conferring chartered status on a registered educational or membership body.

The work involved in doing this is complex, with people joining and leaving the scheme each week, along with management of overlaps between the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Revenue Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  During the month of March, my Department received and processed jobseeker claims equivalent in number to a three year claim-load.

These periods were not social insurance credits and could not be used for any other purpose other than improving the rate of pay for those who qualified for the State Pension (Contributory).  Those who have a 40 year record of paid reckonable social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of credits \/ homecaring periods, qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines, and the National Action Plan. <\/p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24th June 2020. Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. The HSE is currently developing a Service Continuity Roadmap for the resumption of services across the health system. My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working together to evaluate the impact of Covid 19 on Scheduled Care waiting lists, in order to be prepared to address pent up demand. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.<\/p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to investigate the matter and provide you with a direct response. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071500089#WRL00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances","counter":369,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071500089#WRL00500"},{"type":"question","counter":370,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[16209\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071500089#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if updates are available for women affected by pelvic mesh implants.","asker":"1449","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":371,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[16240\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071500089#WRL00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the report published recently in the UK titled, First Do No Harm; if so, if he has considered the findings of the report; and if similar measures are being considered here.","asker":"1626","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":372,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 148 and 159 together.<\/p>  <p>  I note the recent publication in England of the report of the Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety (IMMDS) review, &ldquo;First Do No Harm&rdquo; which was chaired by Baroness Cumberlege.  <\/p>  <p>  International evidence and learning play an important role in health policy considerations to promote safe, high quality care for patients. This report may add to that evidence and learning.<\/p>  <p>  Over the past two decades, Uro-Gynaecological (Transvaginal) Mesh has been widely used in the surgical treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) and Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) in women.  Mesh devices are certified as compliant with relevant EU legislation, and as such, European regulatory competent authorities consider that the benefits outweigh the risks for these devices.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, considerable work has been done to date and continues to progress on patient safety in relation to mesh implants; and the patient voice is central to our understanding of these, and similar, issues. As part of the ongoing policy response, my department officials are examining options to establish a process for an independent, compassionate engagement for women affected by mesh to have their voices heard; and will make proposals to me in this regard.  Any engagement process will need to take account of the wider context relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  Concerns were raised in Ireland regarding complications associated with the use of mesh devices in late 2017, including a number of Ministerial representations from the women affected or on their behalf.  At that time, the Minister for Health requested the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) to prepare a report on the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both:<\/p>  <p>  1. the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and<\/p>  <p>  2. an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures.<\/p>  <p>  This CMO Report was published in November 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Importantly, the CMO report was informed by the available national and international evidence and the personal experiences of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery. <\/p>  <p>  Since July 2018, the HSE has paused all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so. This was at the request of the CMO and undertaken in advance of completion of the final CMO report. The pause was instigated pending confirmation by the HSE of the implementation of initial recommendations relating to (i) professional training requirements, (ii) patient information and consent and (iii) the development and maintenance of a national data set for all mesh procedures carried out in HSE funded hospitals.  <\/p>  <p>  The CMO report identifies that for many women, surgical procedures using synthetic mesh devices have provided a more effective and less invasive form of treatment than traditional procedures.  However, mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women, which are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.<\/p>  <p>  The CMO report made a number of recommendations, the implementation of which will provide significant assurance that both women presenting for treatment and who develop mesh-related complications, receive high quality, multi-disciplinary patient centred care in accordance with the evidence and supported by robust clinical governance mechanisms.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE published a detailed Implementation Plan for the recommendations in the report in April 2019. The HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme (NWIHP) is progressing treatment pathways and referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications. <\/p>  <p>  A multidisciplinary National Specialist Centre is being developed over 2 sites at Cork University Maternity Hospital (CUMH) and the National Maternity Hospital (NMH) Dublin.  In addition, two translabial scanners, were procured by the HSE in late 2019, and are now onsite in both hospitals.  However, the first scanning clinic, which was due to take place last March had to be postponed, due to the pandemic.  <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has published a dedicated webpage about vaginal mesh implants, including contact information for women suffering complications, which I hope is a useful resource. This can be found on the HSE website. <\/p>  <p>  I would strongly encourage all women affected by mesh to engage with the relevant HSE contact points provided, to ensure that their service needs can be identified and provided for. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071500089#WRL00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Addiction Treatment Services","counter":373,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071500089#WRL00900"},{"type":"question","counter":374,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[16210\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071500089#WRL01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the corporate and clinical governance arrangements of the new rehabilitation unit in the Phoenix Park.","asker":"1568","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":375,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[16211\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071500089#WRL01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the costs associated with the new rehabilitation unit in the Phoenix Park.","asker":"1568","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":376,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[16212\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071500089#WRL01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if external bodies were involved in funding the new rehabilitation unit in the Phoenix Park.","asker":"1568","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":377,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149 to 151, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for attention and direct reply to the Deputy<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071500089#WRL01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1608"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Respite Care Services","counter":378,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071500089#WRL01600"},{"type":"question","counter":379,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[16213\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020071500089#WRL01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his views on planned changes to outpatient respite care in a nursing home (details supplied) in Dublin 9;
