She is familiar with this long-standing issue.<\/p>  <p>  The opening of a new school in any community is an important milestone, particularly for younger generations.  In Ballincollig, we have a fantastic network of education infrastructure, but we need new school buildings for Gaelscoil an Chaisle&aacute;in, which has been in temporary accommodation for four years.  This September will see Le Ch&eacute;ile Secondary School opening its doors for the first time.  I wish its principal, Ms Nicola Barrett, and staff every success.<\/p>  <p>  We want permanent accommodation for these schools.  On average, the Department's timeframe from the point of identifying a site to turning the key and moving into a new school is approximately five years.  This means that the pupils who are now in second class in the Gaelscoil's current accommodation at the rugby club in Tanner Park will never see the new school.  We need to get a move on.  We have been at this for some time.  I appreciate that site acquisition is not easy, particularly in a rapidly growing town such as Ballincollig where there is a great deal of pressure on the available land.  I had hoped that the Minister would be in attendance so that I could urge her to take a hands-on approach and drive the conclusion of the acquisitions for these new schools in Ballincollig.

Under the memorandum of understanding in place between the Department and local authorities, officials in my Department are working with Cork City Council on the identification and acquisition of suitable sites for the two schools.<\/p>  <p>  Gaelscoil an Chaisle&aacute;in opened in September 2017 in temporary accommodation on Ballincollig Rugby Football Club's grounds.  Additional temporary accommodation was provided to the school for the 2020-21 school year.  A new 16-classroom school will be provided when a suitable site has been acquired.  Following a recent patronage determination process, Le Ch&eacute;ile Secondary School was established and is due to open this September in temporary accommodation at Ballincollig GAA.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy mentioned, the identification of suitable sites for schools in Cork has proven challenging for the Department and Cork City Council.  In 2016, a potential site was identified as most suitable for Gaelscoil an Chaisle&aacute;in.  However, it was not possible to progress the acquisition at the time because access to the site had to be established.  Subsequently, the Department was advised that the land had since gone to probate and, therefore, the acquisition process could not proceed.  In 2018, the need for a 1,000-pupil post-primary school for Ballincollig was identified and sites to accommodate the two schools were sought.  In 2019, two further sites were identified, but one of them has been identified by the council as a future cemetery and the other proved unsuitable following technical assessment.  Another site suitable for a campus was identified in 2020, but the landowner is proving an unwilling vendor.  Further discussions were held in 2020 by the Department with Cork City Council regarding the urgent need for a site to accommodate the campus.<\/p>  <p>  Two further sites have been identified this year, one for each school.  The Deputy will be glad to hear that negotiations with the landowner of one of these sites recently commenced.  The other site has just been valued and the next stage will be to commence negotiations with the landowner.  A significant number of potential site options have been identified.  Each of these has been technically assessed.  This assessment required the consideration of complex technical issues in conjunction with Cork city and county councils.  However, for reasons of suitability, availability or unwillingness on behalf of the vendor, the acquisition of a suitable site has proved difficult.<\/p>  <p>  I have noted the Deputy's remarks, including about the five-year timeframe.  I join him in wishing Ms Barrett, the principal of Le Ch&eacute;ile Secondary School, the best of luck for the future.  I acknowledge his remarks that the acquisition of any site is not easy.  The process of identifying a suitable site takes time.  There are various ways of doing that.  The site must go through a technical assessment, a valuation must be performed and negotiations need to proceed.  Even when there is agreement, due diligence needs to take place.  There are a number of necessary steps in acquiring a site.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300003#A00600","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1624435920,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I do not mean to sound ungrateful in any way, but this is the fourth time I have raised the issue in the House.

I note what the Deputy said in this regard about spatial planning and sustainable transport options.  All of these matters need to be considered and taken seriously when we speak about building a school.  It cannot be done in haste.  Due diligence has to be done on the right location, apart from the technical aspect of acquiring a site.  Of course, the best value for the Exchequer needs to be taken into account also.

I am disappointed the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, is not here because this is a significant issue and it has slipped under the radar somewhat.  It is having very real consequences for families.  I will give the Minister of State the short version.  Families who are under the income thresholds for social housing are being removed and excluded from applying for social housing.  They are being taken off list because of a circular the Department issued.  This is the long and the short of it.  The Department has issued a circular that is now forcing local authorities to take a very blunt approach, not of their own volition but at the Department's behest.  It means that people with eight, nine or ten years' credit are being removed even though their income falls below the threshold.<\/p>  <p>  This came about in March when the new household means policy was introduced.  It replaced the 2011 policy, which has some detail on what is accessible and what is not accessible.  This is not the only problem with it but I will focus on this particular element today.  It is high time the income thresholds were reconsidered and brought up because there are so many families for whom a private mortgage is impossible.  Some of the affordable housing schemes are also out of reach but they do not qualify for social housing.  This needs to be revisited.<\/p>  <p>  Even for those who should be able to qualify, there is now a new complication because the main revisions to the household means policy issued on 26 March 2021 include that a number of payments are to be included in the disregards, such as income relating to pension-related deductions.  The key issue is that according to the circular the determination of whether an applicant household meets the income criteria will now be based on a calculation of the preceding 12 months net average income prior to the date of receipt of application.  It states this will ensure the most comprehensive picture of a household's current and previous income is available at the point of assessment.  This is the new policy.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State knows that families and households have peaks and troughs in their income.  It will not be a uniform picture all the time, especially in the context of the pandemic but not only in this context.  People get periods of overtime, people get laid off, people are given reduced hours and people's hours are increased.  This changes all the time.  A person's income might be at four or five different places within one year.  Previously, under the 2011 policy, local authorities were asked to assess the income.  Of course, 12 month's worth of financial details needed to be submitted and appraised but income at the point of application, review or offer was key to the decision and it was on this that ineligibility was based.<\/p>  <p> I have come across an example of a family that has been removed after eight and a half years on the housing list.  It has now lost all of this time.  The family is now under the income limit, having briefly exceeded it if it is averaged out, but it is now under the income limit and it has lost all that time.  Members of the family are going to their respective parents in two different locations in order to save.  Another family on the list for seven years suffered a major drop in income and was made an offer which was refused on the basis of this circular.  This is denying families.  I do not know whether it always percolates to here that credit time is money in the bank for people and if it is taken off them they cannot just regain it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300004#B00300","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1624436520,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for tabling this matter, although the response may not exactly be on topic in terms of the specific issue he has raised.<\/p>  <p>  Applications for social housing supports are assessed by the relevant local authority, in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended.  The 2011 regulations prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority in three different bands according to the area concerned.  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%, and, separately, an additional allowance of 2.5% for each child.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the limits introduced also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area has commenced.  The review will have regard to initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordable housing for purchase and for cost rental.  The programme for Government commits to putting affordability at the heart of the housing system.  Delivery on this commitment is evidenced in the measures contained in the Affordable Housing Bill 2021, which is before the Oireachtas.  It provides for three schemes that will increase the supply of affordable homes, through affordable homes on local authority lands, the introduction of a new form of tenure in cost rental, and the new affordable purchase shared equity scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300004#B00400","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1624437120,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I would appreciate it if the Minister of State addressed my point rather than just use a script.  It is not going to be a complete solution by any manner or means but he can help if he can tell me that local authorities have discretion to take account of a change of circumstances in income, that they can take account of where the household income is at the point at which people are offered accommodation, the point where people are being assessed for an initial application or whether there is a review happening.<\/p>  <p>  In general, we must be much more realistic and flexible with respect to the income thresholds.  Credit time for housing is like money in the bank for people.  If a person qualifies for eight out of nine years and for one year he or she does not, we should be looking for a freeze for that single year.  It is not that a person would be getting offers if he or she exceeds it but that he or she keeps his or her credit time because a person could well return to it.  A person could have one good year out of ten.  However, that is an aside.  We must be much more realistic and pragmatic and the income thresholds must be revised.  What I really want to know from the Minister of State is whether local authorities can be realistic.  Can they assess a person on the basis of his or her current income?  The last 52 weeks matter and must be taken into account but have the authorities discretion where a person's circumstances have changed significantly?  I know there is a PUP disregard but far wider changes to circumstances are possible.  These could include overtime that disappears, redundancy, changes in hours and all of these kinds of things which used to be taken into account.

I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, for stepping in on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, whose area this is.  The dental treatment services scheme, DTSS, provides access to dental treatment for adult medical card holders aged 16 years or older.  Medical card holders are entitled to a free dental examination in each calendar year as well as any extractions required, along with a number of other services.  Last November it was reported the number of private dentists participating in this scheme had dropped by 16%, from 16,054 to 13,093 in the ten months between January and October 2020.  That is a large percentage reduction.  It is estimated around 200,000 medical card holders are facing delays for treatment as result.  On foot of these alarming reports I have submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister seeking a breakdown of the number of dentists per local electoral area in County Wexford.  The response said there were ten dentists in Wexford and four in New Ross.  Unfortunately, based on the following correspondence, it seems the situation may have worsened since those figures from last November.  I quote an email from a constituent:<\/p> <blockquote> \tDear Verona,<br \/><br \/>My dentist informed me that they have stopped treating medical card users and to contact Grogans road for further information.  They told me that 4 dentists in Wexford and none in New Ross were still in the scheme.  However when contacted they all told me they had left the scheme.<br \/><br \/>I am a pensioner in me 70s taking Warfarin which needs regular dental checks free under the scheme and now face heavy fees.<br \/><br \/>Is there any hope that there will be a dental medical scheme any time in the future. <\/blockquote>  <p>It appears, therefore, that in the space of the eight months since last November, the number of dentists in the scheme from just two local electoral areas in County Wexford has reduced from 14 to 4.  That is pretty alarming.  I hope the Minister of State can confirm whether these figures are correct and what steps will be taken to address the issue of why so many dentists are now finding it unfeasible to continue in the scheme.  I understand the Irish Dental Association, IDA, has met with Department of Health officials to discuss its concerns.  I ask the Minister of State to outline in her response whether anything has happened as a result of those discussions and what solutions have been proposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300005#C01200","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1624437120,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy very much for raising this very important issue.  I welcome the opportunity to address the issue of the current difficulties in the dental treatment services scheme.  The DTSS provides dental care, free of charge, to people with medical cards aged 16 years and over.  These services are provided by independent dental practitioners who have a contract with the HSE.  Patients may choose to have their treatment undertaken by any dentist who participates in the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that there has been a reduction in the numbers of dentists participating in the DTSS since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.  HSE figures indicate that up to the end of April 2021 approximately 213 dentists had left the scheme or had notified the HSE of their intent to leave the scheme. Of those, approximately 27 had left or had notified the HSE of their intent to leave between January and the end of April 2021, with 112 applications for new contracts being processed.  To answer the Deputy's question directly, there are approximately 1,200 contracted dentists at present, with approximately 700 claiming per month.<\/p>  <p>  Some people have been experiencing problems in accessing dental services close to their home as a result of dentists leaving the DTSS and there is probably not a Deputy in the House who is not aware of it.  However, the HSE has assured the Department of Health that its local services on the ground will assist any individuals who are experiencing problems in accessing a service.  Officials in the Department of Health have been engaging with the Irish Dental Association since the start of the pandemic.  My colleague, the Minister for Health, met with IDA representatives in November 2020 to discuss their concerns and he addressed their annual conference last month.  The Minister has asked officials in the Department to work with the HSE and the IDA to develop solutions that will ensure the sustainability and viability of the DTSS.  The Minister is committed to ensuring all eligible persons should continue to receive the services that they deserve from their local dentist of choice.<\/p>  <p>  The future provision of oral healthcare services will be informed by the national oral health policy, Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte, which was published in 2019.  It includes proposals for the introduction of packages of oral healthcare for adults with medical cards at different intervals during their life course.  The packages will focus on preventive dental services.  Routine care, including additional fillings and complex care, will continue to be available in addition to the preventive packages of care.  The Minister is committed to ensuring the sustainability and viability of the DTSS.  It will need to be revised to align with up-to-date best practice and evidence.  This will mean - and this is the really important part - moving away from symptom-led attendance and an emergency focus, to encouraging attendance for preventive care and the provision of evidence-based oral health care tailored to each individual's needs.<\/p> <p>There was an intention to commence a review of the contract between dental practitioners and the HSE last year.  Unfortunately, due to the pandemic this was not possible.  However, the Minister has asked officials in the Department to engage with the Irish Dental Association to commence this process.  A meeting between the Department, the HSE and the Irish Dental Association is being organised for next week and the Minister is confident that progress will be made in resolving the current difficulties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300005#C01300","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624437720,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.  I am heartened to hear what she said because this is an urgent matter.  She will have noted from the email I received from one of my constituents, which I read into the record, that this man is in his 70s and had been working.  He received his over 70s medical card but it is of no benefit if he is unable to get an appointment.  I heard what the Minister of State said with respect to the Irish Dental Association and the Minister.  Apart from him asking his officials to engage, the number of dentists leaving the scheme is astounding.  The Minister should engage directly to make sure the scheme is not eroded further or we will have a very serious crisis on our hands.<\/p>  <p>  The same issue arises when it comes to doctors, although not with medical card patients.  Many of my constituents email me complaining they cannot access the doctor as a private patient, for example, when they have moved into an area.  One man told me recently he lives in my area but has to return to Navan for a standard GP visit.  <\/p>  <p>  The gentleman whose email I read into the record takes Warfarin and he does not make an appointment at the last minute.  He needs regular dental check-ups.  Equally, many people attending for medical or operational procedures in our hospital healthcare system have to visit the dentist before they will be given an anaesthetic.  Those people cannot always pay for the service.  They may be under the medical card scheme and the dental treatment services scheme.  I know the Minister of State will report to the Minister the urgency of the matter and the detrimental effect it will have if the numbers leaving the scheme continue to be eroded in this vein.<\/p>  <p>  If the Leas Cheann Comhairle will permit me, I would like to briefly ask the Minister of State to consider speaking with the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, NIAC, on the roll-out of the second vaccine for those in the 60 to 69 age cohort.  That second vaccine is primary for the protection of those in a vulnerable age category against the Delta variant and it is important it is rolled out as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300006#D00200","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1624437720,"counter":33,"content":"<p>To answer the second query the Deputy raised, that is ongoing and something of which I am very much aware.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, met the Irish Dental Association last November, he spoke at its conference last month and is acutely aware of the challenges.  We have discussed it.  The reason some dentists say they are leaving the scheme is that they have been seeking a review, including increases in fees, for a number of years.  There have been significant changes in dental practice since the current contract was agreed, particularly during the past decade, including new radiographic standards, new technology and higher standards in infection prevention and control, which has added to the cost of running a practice.  Dentists also claim the costs associated with the current Covid-19 pandemic, including the additional cost of the personal protective equipment, social distancing of patients and staff being less available, have placed an additional burden on dental practices.  <\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte, the national oral health policy, provides the guiding principles to transform our current oral healthcare service over the next eight years.  I look forward to the pending meeting next week between the HSE, the Department and the Irish Dental Association because it is imperative people can get that care when they need it.  As we all know, the worst pain one can ever have is toothache.

We have seen the closure of Bord na M&oacute;na and ESB operations and we were sold the specifications of an &euro;11 million just transition programme as the catalyst for revitalising the region.  Unfortunately, people in the region are currently disillusioned and worried the just transition process is simply coming apart at the seams.<\/p>  <p>  Almost a year on, just &euro;116,000 in funding has been paid out to community groups and business ventures.  One example would be the Lough Ree Access For All project, which seeks to employ and train former Bord na M&oacute;na workers and involve them in an exciting new project that will provide access to the River Shannon and Lough Ree for the disability community.  The group was awarded &euro;472,000 under strand two of the just transition programme, but drawing down this funding has proved challenging in the extreme.  This and many other entities approved for funding are also facing the potential of a 30% increase in construction costs following on from their applications.  There is a real risk that up to 30 of the original job creation projects deemed eligible for just transition funding at the end of last year are now unlikely to go ahead because they simply cannot meet the matching funding demands of 50%, they cannot satisfy EU state aid rules in some areas or they will struggle to finance escalating construction costs.<\/p>  <p>  We have not yet seen a single job created as a direct result of the just transition programme.  With momentum now gathering behind the climate action Bill, there is a real fear our region is set to carry the greatest burden, pay the greatest price and suffer most in this process.  The expected support package is unfolding at a snail's pace and there are genuine fears and concerns locally as to whether the funding will ever flow while escalating construction costs are punching holes in the &euro;11 million fund.<\/p>  <p>  There is frustration too that the midlands regional transitional theme lacks any real clout.  That is something we need to examine as a matter of urgency.  At this stage it should be reasonable to expect we would be seeing the genesis of new job creation opportunities for the region but this simply is not the case.  There is a growing fear and concern the ESB, in particular, has been let off the hook at this stage.  I would ask the Department, Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB to assess the just transition programme in tandem with the midlands regional theme as a matter of urgency.  We urgently need to streamline the drawdown process for approved groups while the ESB must return to the table with additional funding to revise this flagging programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300006#D00500","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speech","time":1624437720,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to respond to the question posed in the Deputy&rsquo;s Topical Issue matter and to acknowledge the genuine concerns of people in the midlands about the transition, the major changes in the economy and the funding that is there for it.  In the programme for Government we copper-fastened support targeted towards the midlands to support a just transition.  There is a major amount of money involved in funding that, but as in any project which involves hundreds of millions in funding over a decade there is a ramp-up period, a period of time when projects have to be examined and approved before the funding starts to flow.  I acknowledge the frustration with that, but I want to say it is there and it is coming.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to set out the actions which are being taken by the Government in response to the announcement of the closure of the peat-fuelled power stations and the end of peat harvesting by Bord na M&oacute;na.  The Government is committed to a just transition in the midlands region and has dedicated significant funding to supporting workers, companies and communities affected by the closure of the two power stations at Lanesborough and Shannonbridge.  The Government appointed Kieran Mulvey as Just Transition Commissioner in November 2019 to assist the midlands region in the transition process.  The commissioner has made a series of recommendations to Government on taking forward the Government&rsquo;s just transition response in the midlands. <\/p>  <p>  A significant package of supports worth &euro;177 million has been put in place in the midlands to ensure the transition away from peat-fuelled power is indeed just.  This includes &euro;20 million for the midlands retrofitting project; &euro;108 million for the Bord na M&oacute;na peatlands restoration project; the just transition fund, with up to &euro;30 million available for approved projects; and &euro;19 million for the National Parks and Wildlife Service peatlands restoration scheme.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications approved &euro;108 million for Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s large-scale peatlands restoration project on 24 November 2020.  The plan will protect the storage of 100 million tonnes of carbon, sequester 3.2 million tonnes of carbon out to 2050, enhance biodiversity and deliver significant benefits and contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s target of being carbon-neutral by 2050. <\/p> <p>The scheme will encompass 33,000 ha of Bord na M&oacute;na peatlands previously harvested for peat extraction for electricity generation.  The Government funding, which will come from the climate action fund, will be bolstered by an &euro;18 million investment from Bord na M&oacute;na, which is committed to a brown to green transition.<\/p> <p> The National Parks and Wildlife Service peatlands scheme received funding of &euro;5 million in 2020, supported from the carbon tax fund, which enabled the commencement of peatland restoration measures on almost 1,900 ha of raised bog on up to nine raised bog designated sites in the midlands region, along with the development of drainage management plans and other peatland management and conservation measures.  Bord na M&oacute;na has been contracted to manage this programme.  Work has commenced on this project and an additional &euro;14 million in 2021 has been allocated to the programme for the restoration of a further 2,500 ha of protected raised bog, together with other peatlands conservation measures.  These projects will support a just transition by avoiding job losses based in the Offaly works and across the midlands and by creating opportunities for skilled employment in these areas into the future.<\/p> <p> The just transition fund was established to respond to the closures and to support the transition away from employment in peat harvesting in the affected communities in the region.  Eight of the most affected counties in the region were eligible to submit funding applications to the just transition fund.  The Government has announced provisional funding offers totalling almost &euro;30 million to some 60 projects throughout the region for projects from the private sector, local authorities and communities to create a strong, green and sustainable economy.  These projects will contribute to making the midlands a more attractive and sustainable place to work.  Of these, 16 projects are already up and running in the midlands with support from the just transition fund since last September.  These projects have created 28 full-time jobs and will also support a further 175 indirect jobs.  A further 13 projects, with funding of &euro;6.5 million to be provided by the just transition fund and additional funding of almost &euro;1 million, have now entered into a grant agreement with the Department and further projects will conclude grant agreements in the coming weeks.  The Department has worked directly with projects, particularly smaller-scale projects and those from community groups, that received provisional offers to support them in the process of finalising grant agreements, while ensuring all projects are able to meet the fund rules.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300006#D00600","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624438320,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I believe that the Minister of State will agree it is critical that we get just transition right for the midlands region.  It is also critically important that the ESB is not allowed off the hook.  It was extremely disappointing to hear the ESB's announcement last week that it plans to proceed with the demolition of the two power stations.  There was a genuine expectation in both communities that the buildings could be retained and repurposed for alternative energy uses.  A glib ESB statement said that \"having considered commercial and climate action realities in particular, no viable solution was found to repurpose the plants.\"  The region is growing sceptical about the ESB's role in this process.  The company has made much out of its &euro;5 million contribution to the just transition programme and yet we are hearing that it is already seeking this money back via a refund from the energy regulator.  There is a real fear that the ESB never properly scoped alternative uses for the power stations and that it is in fact more financially beneficial for the ESB to proceed with the demolition plans for the two stations, and to seek compensation afterwards through the regulator.<\/p>  <p>  As the just transition process flounders, we are seeing an increase in imports of replacement peat and fuel products, while the horticultural peat production sector faces termination in Ireland.  It is now critically important that the ESB liaises with the midlands transition groups and the local groups to explain properly the rationale for the demolition of these two buildings, and to also scope adequately any local proposals for alternative uses for the facilities.<\/p>  <p>  The company must return to the table with a compensation package, commensurate with the midlands' massive role in energy production over the past 60 years: &euro;800,000 per decade, or just &euro;1,600 per week, is derisory, and the ESB must be held to account.  I encourage the Minister of State and the team in the Department to go back to the ESB once again and engage.  The ESB simply cannot be left off the hook with this derisory compensation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300007#E00400","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speech","time":1624438320,"counter":41,"content":"<p>The Deputy is right that the ESB has a key role, and it is important that my Department engages and continues to engage with the ESB on the future of the midlands.<\/p>  <p>  I will address specifically the Shannonbridge and Lanesborough power plants and what their future is.  The just transition commissioner made a recommendation in the first progress report in May 2020 that a study be undertaken on the future potential of ESB power stations at Lanesborough and Shannonbridge for the establishment of a dedicated energy hub in the midlands.  This is a commitment in the programme for Government and we take that seriously.  The ESB has been deeply engaged with my Department, the result of which is a planning application to be lodged shortly to develop additional energy services at these two sites.  These will include synchronous condensers and energy storage capabilities at both locations.  This type of energy infrastructure is key for the success of renewable energy projects in the area.  Offaly has always been a centre in Ireland for energy, whether it was Bord na M&oacute;na or ESB.  Now it is wind power and solar power, both of which need that balancing technology to allow stable power to be given to the grid or into energy storage and so on.  I believe there will be a bright and hopeful future for the midlands, and especially in areas like Offaly where there have been worrying closures of plants.  It is a difficult time to go through a transition.  The Government is absolutely committed to making sure there is a just transition, sufficient funding and investment, retraining, bog restoration, retrofitting, support for community projects and State strategic support to allow this region to transition from its successful past to a successful future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300007#E00500","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1624438320,"counter":42,"content":"<p>That concludes Topical Issue matters.

the core values of the original SVHG constitution, which are based on Catholic ethos, are restated in full in the constitution of SVHs;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Religious Sisters of Charity received conditional permission from the Holy See to transfer their shareholding to the new company SVHs, with the proviso that &lsquo;the provisions relating to the validity and lawfulness of alienations, found in Canons 638-639 and Canons 1292-1294 of the Code of Canon Law and in Proper Law, are to be observed&rsquo;, and this requirement provides that the transfer of the Religious Sisters of Charity&rsquo;s shareholding in SVHG must observe Canon Law and Canon 1293 paragraph 2 requires precautions to be taken to &lsquo;avoid harm to the Church&rsquo;

and calls on the Government to ensure that the proposed new publicly-funded National Maternity Hospital is constructed on land owned by the State, and that, to guarantee its secular ethos and safeguard this public investment, the new hospital be fully owned and governed by the State. <\/blockquote>  <p>The decision to co-locate the National Maternity Hospital with St. Vincent's University Hospital has had a long and tortuous history.  When the plan was announced in 2013, there were three overriding concerns: ownership, governance and religious ethos.  The same concerns remain today.  Nothing that has happened in the interim has done anything to dispel them.<\/p><p>For a long time, this Government, and the last one, refused to concede any problems existed.  They said that all that was needed was time and a legal framework, and the matter would be resolved.  In May 2017, the then Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, promised that we would have a legal framework &ldquo;in the coming month&rdquo;.  In 2019, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, assured this House the details of the legal transfer would be resolved over the next couple of weeks.  The current Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, gave similar assurances last year.  This charade came to an end last week, when the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, finally admitted the blindingly obvious, that the deal is fundamentally, potentially fatally, flawed.<\/p><p>Where did it all go wrong, then?  The obvious place to start is in 2016 and the mediated agreement that was hammered out between the two hospitals: St. Vincent's University Hospital and the National Maternity Hospital, NMH, Holles Street.  It concluded that the new national maternity hospital would become a wholly owned subsidiary of St. Vincent's University Hospital.  It was no longer co-location, but full integration, essentially a takeover.  Private interests were represented in this mediation, but what about the public interest?  That was conspicuous in its absence.  The deal was silent on safeguarding a valuable public investment, on ensuring a secular ethos and on mandating public governance of a public hospital.  Handing over a valuable public asset to a private religious entity was deemed the reasonable, even sensible, thing to do.  The public felt very differently and made their feelings known with large public protests.<\/p><p>The Religious Sisters of Charity Ireland then announced its intention to withdraw from St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  It said it would no longer be involved in the ownership or management of the new national maternity hospital and would set up a holding company into which they would transfer their shareholding in St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  While this holding company has been incorporated as a private company with charitable status, as of today, the Religious Sisters of Charity has not transferred its shareholding to this holding company.  It should also be noted that, having said it would give the gift to the site to the Irish people, it gifted it to its own holding company.<\/p><p>The proposed new corporate structure of this deal bears further scrutiny.  It entails three tiers.  At the top is the holding company, whose directors are self-appointed.  They will be the sole shareholders of the entire St. Vincent's operation and they can stay in office for up to 14 years.  Below this unaccountable company will be the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, which will oversee four hospitals, including the proposed new national maternity hospital.  Below that again, will be the national maternity hospital board with its own four directors, four directors nominated from St. Vincent's University Hospital, and one ministerial nominee.  The deal is manifestly bad for the public.  The public pays the construction costs, equipment costs, staff costs, and maintenance costs.  In return, St. Vincent's Holdings graciously retains ownership of the site and control of the governance structures.<\/p><p>The deal not only flies in the face of reason and rationality, it is also in direct contravention of a Government report by Dr. Catherine Day on publicly-funded health services.  That the report is unambiguous where it states that &ldquo;where the State decides to build any new hospital or facility, it should endeavour to ensure that it owns the land on which the hospital or facility is built&rdquo;.  The report goes on to state, &ldquo;Where the State is unable to secure the purchase of land &hellip; any capital investment by the State should only be provided subject to prior agreement on the services that will be delivered&rdquo;.  Crucially, the report concludes that legally the State cannot compel private Catholic entities to provide services that are contrary to their ethos.  Remarkably, this deal fails every limb of this test.  The State does not own the land.  It has no means of ensuring the full range of reproductive and sexual health services currently available in Ireland, and that they are provided by the hospital.<\/p><p>This brings me to religious ethos.  The Religious Sisters of Charity Ireland&rsquo;s proposal to transfer its shareholding into St. Vincent's Holdings required Vatican approval and is subject to Canon Law.  This obligation requires the nuns to ensure that they avoid harm to the church in the transfer.  In this case, harm expressly includes activity which gives rise to great harm to ecclesiastical teaching.  It is not disputed that the Catholic Church does not sanction the full range of reproductive and sexual health services that are legal in Ireland.  The Catholic Church stands firmly against abortion, which it calls a &quot;grave sin&quot;.  It has judged <i>in vitro<\/i>fertilisation as immoral.  It opposes same-sex relationships, rejects the existence of transgender people, and condemns gender reassignment surgery.  We know Canon Law will be followed during the sisters' transfer of their shareholding, but what about future governance?<\/p><p>The constitution of St. Vincent's Holdings espouses the same core values of Mother Mary Aikenhead, the founder of the Religious Sisters of Charity Ireland.  In 2017, the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group annual report stated what future directors of St. Vincent's Holdings will be obliged to do, that is, that they will be obliged to uphold the values and vision of Mother Mary Aikenhead.<\/p><p>The Government may deny Catholic values will persist at the new hospital, but that is what the corporate structure is designed to facilitate, namely, the continuation of the ethical code of the Religious Sisters of Charity Ireland, not only for the three existing hospitals in the group, but also for the new national maternity hospital.  When the Government was negotiating this deal, it is now clear that the parties were mismatched.  It was a David and Goliath situation, and the sisters were not diminutive.  It is not the first time they have run rings around the Government.<\/p><p>When the sisters built St. Vincent's University Hospital at Elm Park, they did so with public money.  Not only did they use public money for, they negotiated a deal whereby the State would have no involvement in the control and management of the hospital, despite the more than &pound;5 million the order received between 1934 and 1969 when Elm Park opened.  There was also another proviso, that if the sisters sold their old hospital at St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green, the proceeds would be given to the State via the hospital trust fund.  Predictably, that never happened.  The sisters sold the old hospital, but the proceeds were never handed over.  Commenting on that deal in the D&aacute;il in 1972, No&euml;l Browne said, &ldquo;surely, this is an extraordinary principle to permit, that an organisation - I do not care who they are, whether they are religious orders or others &hellip; - should be allowed to sell off property, keep the money and then be given a 100% grant to build a new hospital?&rdquo;  I wonder what Dr. Browne would have to say about this current quagmire.  I think most of us can guess.  No&euml;l Browne spent his political life trying to disentangle the church from the provision of health care services and to create a proper public health service.  It is extraordinary that this House, all these years later, is still convulsed by these exact same issues.<\/p><p>The State's record on the provision of public services is a long litany of failure.  The new national maternity hospital is a chance to finally get it right.  It will be a public hospital, paid for by the people.  There is no justification whatsoever for the ownership and the governance structures to be in the hands of a private company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300008#F00200","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1624439520,"counter":46,"content":"<p>After everything that women, past and present, have gone through in this country to defend the right to healthcare, it is an absolute fallacy to believe that it is possible for a privately-controlled hospital, built on Catholic lands and founded under a Catholic ethos, to provide healthcare that is based solely on medical science and that religious ethos will not influence it in any shape or form.  The vote to repeal the eighth amendment could not have been clearer.  Women and men in Ireland will not allow for their health and that of their loved ones to be dictated by any organisation that places ethos above science.  For women in my constituency of Wicklow, the new national maternity hospital will be the hospital they will go to for maternity services.  I get many emails, as I am sure the Minister does, on this issue.  People are very concerned that the Government seems intent on making the same mistakes of the past, not learning from them, and walking straight into another scandal in the provision of women's healthcare in this country.  Many ask, after the repeal of the eighth amendment and the treatment of women in mother and baby homes, can this Government seriously consider gifting a publicly-funded new national maternity hospital worth &euro;800 million to a private company established by the Religious Sister of Charity.<\/p>  <p>  In December 2018, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, insisted during D&aacute;il questions, \"I am not giving any hospital to the nuns.\"  Three years later, the nuns still hold the keys and control of this hospital, despite what they say.  St. Vincent's Hospital Group has stated in recent days that \"the new national maternity hospital will be clinically independent\".  From whom will be it be clinically independent?  Will it be independent from the HSE?  The group has stated, \"There will no religious or Vatican influence.\"  It will be an absolute miracle if that is the case because nowhere in the world is healthcare that goes against the ethos of the Catholic Church provided if the lands concerned are owned by the Catholic Church.  The group also stated that all medical procedures will be provided in accordance with the laws of the land.  In 2017, the Mater Hospital was in the media because it would not provide prescriptions for contraceptives.  At the time, the HSE stated it would not get involved or intervene because it was a matter for the Mater itself, as a private institution.<\/p>  <p>  The St. Vincent's Hospital Group has also stated it needs to own this site for the delivery of integrated patient care on the campus.  It beggars belief that the group thinks we will fall for that.  It wants us to believe it can provide integrated care if it is offered a 150-year lease but cannot if the State owns the land.  That makes no sense.  The question that all of us, including the Minister, need to ask is why the church and nuns want this complex structure.  Why will they not just gift the site to the State as promised?  It is clear that this is about power and ethos and not about healthcare.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to the Minister's radio interviews this morning and have a few things to say about them.  Women do not want tea and sympathy on this issue.  We do not want to hear that the Minister understands our concerns.  We want action.  We want to see this resolved, once and for all.  We want healthcare that is based on science and that will put our needs before those of a religious organisation.  We will not be fobbed off by an extra 50 years on a 100-year lease or by so-called ironclad guarantees because, as the Minister said this morning, there is no solution that will keep all the stakeholders happy.  The Government is trying to square a circle and that is not going to be possible.  The Minister has also said that it would not be conducive to enter these negotiations with a red line in mind but he absolutely must enter these negotiations with a red line in mind.  That red line is our healthcare.  He cannot go in and negotiate away our rights to healthcare.  That must be a red line and if the Minister does not believe that, I ask him to send someone else to negotiate with the nuns.<\/p>  <p>  We refuse to fall foul of power plays any longer.  We refuse for our healthcare to be up for discussion or negotiation.  It must be based on science and medical need.  There is no wrong time for one to admit one has made a mistake and I believe the Government must admit it has made a mistake and do the right thing for women and their families in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300009#G00200","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1624439520,"counter":47,"content":"<p>The story of maternal healthcare in Ireland is the story of how we have treated women in this country.  It is far from a happy story; it is a lot closer to a horror story.  Irish maternal healthcare was a place where misogyny reigned, where women were defined solely in terms of their reproductive functions and where they were denied control of themselves, their bodies and their lives.  In the early days of the Free State, as the D&aacute;il limited women&rsquo;s opportunity in public life, we had disgracefully high maternal and infant mortality rates.  Maternity services were under-resourced and the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 1935 made the use of contraception a criminal offence, an actual criminal offence.<\/p>  <p>  A twisted version of Catholic morality and Irish misogyny created the mother and baby homes, a system of Church-run, State-funded institutions in every county which intentionally incarcerated, abused and dehumanised women and girls for being pregnant.  It punished rape victims, women with disabilities and women from disadvantaged groups, while the rapists, predators and men of good character washed their hands.  This system, administered in many cases by nuns, abused generations of girls and women, and led to the death of thousands of infants and young children.  This included the Religious Sisters of Charity who ran Magdalen laundries and residential institutions for children.  We are still dealing with the legacy of these abuses as the State rallies to limit survivors' rights, their access to the truth and proper redress.<\/p>  <p>  In the late 1940s, Dr. Noel Browne&rsquo;s mother and child scheme aimed to reduce high rates of child mortality by modernising healthcare and providing free service for mothers and children.  This chance of real progress to save lives and help empower women was strongly opposed by the Catholic Church, the Irish Medical Association and many of Dr. Browne&rsquo;s colleagues.  Pre-empting liberalisation and secularity in Irish society, lay Catholic organisations pushed for the eighth amendment which introduced one of the most oppressive abortion regimes in western countries.  For 35 years, it not only restricted bodily autonomy but it caused immeasurable damage and suffering.  It was only thanks to the activism and dogged determination of women that it was repealed.  Politicians delayed and obstructed, opposing even giving the Irish people a vote until the pressure was too much for them to hold back.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the historic victory for women&rsquo;s rights, we know women still have to travel long distances, especially in rural areas, for medical terminations and families are still forced to go to the UK for care when they need terminations for medical reasons.  These barriers are even greater for young people, people with disabilities and women from minority groups.  We are still living in the remnants of this history.  It is not the past, it is the present.  Much of our health and educational infrastructure is still controlled by the Roman Catholic Church which has limited people&rsquo;s access to procedures and even information.  This motion is a reminder that this struggle for women&rsquo;s healthcare continues today.  It may not be as acute, but many of the fundamental points remain the same.  Do we want a system based on medical science and the informed decision-making of individuals or do we want one that prioritises harmful religious teachings?<\/p>  <p>  Women&rsquo;s healthcare is still overlooked.  Take the Government&rsquo;s failure to ensure the consistent easing of restrictions in maternity hospitals, Deputy Catherine Connolly&rsquo;s motion highlighting the need for an implementation plan for the National Maternity Strategy 2016-2026, or the fact that the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, has consistently highlighted that our midwife-to-birth ratio is much higher than it should be.<\/p>  <p>  Women&rsquo;s healthcare is still restricted.  In religiously-controlled settings, the morning-after pill, IVF, abortion, vasectomies, sterilisation and trans-healthcare are all obstructed.  Perfectly standard, normal and necessary healthcare is banned because of religious teachings.  These are not practices of the 1930s or the restrictions of extremist regimes, it is the reality in Ireland today.  That is unbelievable. <\/p>  <p>  Women&rsquo;s healthcare needs to be legally guaranteed.  Without absolute certainty, we allow for the hard-won rights of individuals to be chipped away or denied.  We need the national maternity hospital to be fully owned and run by the State.  The situation is complex but the situation has been made complex.  The Sisters of Charity wanted full ownership of public hospitals.  After public pressure, they have set up a separate company with self-appointed directors who will be bound by a religious ethos.  Legally, this separates the nuns from control of the site but in a practical sense, their control will remain and dominate.<\/p> <p>The just and decent thing would be for the Religious Sisters of Charity to give the land to the women of Ireland in reparations.  However, if the order will not do the moral thing, then the Government must itself ensure public ownership and State governance.  For a horrifyingly long time, this country was run on shame and it was a powerful force.  Shame was weaponised against women and girls for the so-called crime of getting pregnant and that shame still lingers.  Shame and religious control have no place in the future of maternal healthcare in this country.  Our new national maternity hospital must be wholly secular: Irish women have fought too hard and too long for anything less.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300009#G00300","speaker":"1525","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624440120,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for raising this important issue in this motion.  The Government will not be opposing it.  I hope to address the various points raised in the motion and to outline the huge amount of work done so far to make this hospital a reality.<\/p>  <p>  All four stand-alone maternity hospitals, while they have incredible staff and provide a superb service, are now outdated.  The buildings do not cater for the needs of modern maternity care.  Today&rsquo;s debate specifically concerns the National Maternity Hospital, NMH, currently located on Holles Street.  The starting point for the new national maternity hospital is that women, mums and babies urgently need such a new, modern maternity hospital.  The hospital should be co-located with a major adult teaching hospital to ensure the best possible care, and continuity of care, for women.  The hospital must have clinical and operational independence, providing the full range of healthcare services.<\/p>  <p>  Co-locating the National Maternity Hospital with St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital makes sense.  Granting the operating licence to the National Maternity Hospital makes sense.  The detailed design is complete, including physically connecting the new hospital with St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital.  Planning permission for the new hospital was secured in 2017, the contract for enabling works was awarded in 2018, and a full business case has been prepared to support the final investment decision.  While the capital project has progressed significantly, the ownership and governance arrangements have proven complex.  This is largely due to the National Maternity Hospital and St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital being independent voluntary hospitals.  I fully recognise that some people have genuine concerns regarding the ownership and clinical independence of the new national maternity hospital, and these must be addressed.  Significant work has been and continues to be undertaken in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  As the first phase of that work, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, appointed Kieran Mulvey in 2016 to mediate between the hospitals.  The Mulvey agreement was finalised following an extensive mediation process between the National Maternity Hospital and the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group, and the agreement was published in 2017.  It provides for the establishment of a new company, the National Maternity Hospital at Elm Park, which will have clinical and operational, financial and budgetary independence in the provision of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services.  Following on from the Mulvey agreement, a draft legal framework has been developed to copper-fasten these arrangements and to address the State&rsquo;s core objectives.  These are, first, to ensure all clinically appropriate services that are legally permitted are provided for women who need them in the new national maternity hospital and to prevent any undue influence, religious or otherwise, in the operation of the new hospital, and, second, to protect the State&rsquo;s investment for the public good.<\/p>  <p>  As noted by Government in 2017, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, formally asked St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group to consider an outright site transfer.  However, this was not agreed, and the current position is that the draft framework provides that the new hospital will be owned by the State and will be built on a site which will be held on a lease by the State for 99 years.  As colleagues will be aware, an extension was agreed earlier this year for an additional 50 years, so essentially it is a lease for 149 years.  The HSE would in turn provide an operating licence to the new national maternity hospital to facilitate the provision of health services in that building.  Nonetheless, as I have stated previously, it is my strong preference that the hospital would be built on land owned by the State.  I assure Deputies and everyone interested in this matter that all options continue to be explored and that I intend to engage further with the stakeholders in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  Questions have been raised regarding any potential future involvement of the Religious Sisters of Charity in the National Maternity Hospital.  That religious order will not play any role in the governance or operation of the National Maternity Hospital.  It has been confirmed to me that the Religious Sisters of Charity order has resigned from the board of the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group and that it has secured Vatican approval for the proposed transfer of its shareholding to a new charitable entity, St. Vincent&rsquo;s Holdings CLG.  Under the terms of its service level agreement, SLA, the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group requires the consent of the HSE to the share transfer, and the HSE intends for that to take place in the context of finalising the draft legal framework.  The governance structures continue to be examined closely by the Department of Health and the HSE.  I state again that I will only bring a recommendation to Government on a governance structure for the new national maternity hospital if I have clear, unambiguous and watertight confirmation of the full clinical and operational independence of the National Maternity Hospital.  It is certainly the case that full independence can be achieved without owning the land.  Many primary care centres around Ireland are in buildings and on land owned by third parties, and nobody would reasonably suggest that those landlords could dictate what services general practitioners, GPs, and other clinicians could or could not provide in those buildings.<\/p>  <p>  I understand very clearly the concerns raised today regarding the new national maternity hospital.  We are all well aware, as has been appropriately stated by the previous contributors, that the women of this country have been failed in the past when it comes to health, and particularly when it comes to sexual and reproductive health.  It is for that reason that delivering the new national maternity hospital relocation project is crucial.  It is why we must continue our efforts to bring the project to the next phase, and with all the necessary assurances concerning the services to be provided for women.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland needs a revolution in women&rsquo;s healthcare and, in spite of Covid-19, much is happening.  This year the national maternity strategy was fully funded for the first time.  It was a five-fold increase in funding, meaning more choice for women, more midwifery-led care, more specialist care, among other improvements set out in that strategy.  Some 24 additional lactation consultants are being funded and hired, a specialist endometriosis clinic is being established and legislation on surrogacy is being prioritised.  For the first time a women&rsquo;s health lead has been funded at the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, with the intention of specifically looking at the issue of women's health within general practice.  Two new regional fertility hubs are being set up, one in Nenagh and one in Galway.  We are establishing or, in some cases, expanding services across nine \"see and treat\" gynaecology clinics this year.  These will be located in Dublin, Drogheda, Waterford, Wexford, Letterkenny, Kerry, Mayo and Portlaoise and will provide same-day services for women across many clinical areas.  The women&rsquo;s health task force is being funded to continue and expand its excellent work, and policies are being developed, in consultation with the task force, in areas including menopause, wellness and mental health. <\/p>  <p>  We also, of course, want to get going on building a state-of-the-art modern national maternity hospital.  It is an essential part of our plan to build women&rsquo;s healthcare service to the level they need to be at and that has been needed for so long.  I refer to providing the necessary infrastructure and environment to realise our common goal of the provision of woman-centred, modern, safe, quality healthcare for women and their families, which is delivered with compassion and dignity. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300010#H00200","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1624440120,"counter":50,"content":"<p>Having heard the Minister's comments, I am more concerned now.  I am particularly concerned about what the Minister said about the nuns not having any more involvement and that he is taking some assurance from that.  We have been saying for some time that one of the key issues here is the company that has been set up by the nuns, with their ethos and values, and the role that company will play.  It has been a key concern raised by people.  I refer not to the nuns withdrawing, but to the manner in which they are withdrawing and in the manner in which they are carrying out that handover to reflect their values and ethos.  We have been raising that key concern and the Minister has not addressed it.  In fact, he seems to take assurance from the very point we are raising as a key concern.<\/p> <p>This is not, or at least it should not be, complicated.  This is about ensuring that we own the national maternity hospital that we will pay for as taxpayers.  That is what the outcome of this process should be.  There should be full public control and ownership and there should be no questions or ambiguity in that regard.  If we are to remove all doubt, we must insist on full public ownership.  Then we will not have the complex arrangements to which the Minister referred, with the hope that the result will be unambiguous in how the hospital is run.  Let us remove all doubt from the situation and ensure full public ownership, with no complex arrangements giving rise to concerns.  In that way, we can draw a line in the sand on this.<\/p> <p> The fundamental, core question is whether we are content to continue to outsource healthcare to private entities or whether we insist, once and for all, that hospitals built with State funds should be in full public ownership and under full public control.  There could not be a more important question for us to answer in healthcare.  Why are we in a situation where the State would even contemplate settling for an arrangement involving anything less than full ownership?  How are we in that situation?  How can the Government even think about spending in the region of &euro;800 million of our money on the national maternity hospital without having full public ownership and control?  <\/p> <p> This is about who runs the State and for whom the State is run.  Is it run to ameliorate private interests or in the interests of the public?  As Deputies Shortall and Cairns said earlier, this is not an issue that has just arisen since 2013.  It is an issue that has been with us over the past 100 years, since the foundation of the State.  We saw it starkly in the 1950s with the mother and child scheme that Deputy Noel Browne tried to progress, a scheme was all about improving maternity services and healthcare.  It is incredible that 70 years later we are still having discussions in the D&aacute;il about private interests and the role they play in shaping the way publicly-funded healthcare is delivered.  <\/p> <p> Now is clearly the time for this D&aacute;il to catch up with the public in this area.  People came out in their thousands during the grassroots campaigns on repealing the eighth amendment, marriage equality and on other campaigns to say clearly that they no longer think it acceptable for this State, this republic, to function in that manner.  This is not just about the national maternity hospital.  It is about how all of our publicly-funded healthcare services are delivered.  It is also about how our publicly-funded schools, some of which are owned and controlled by private entities, are run.  It is fundamentally about the kind of republic and society we want.  The practice of continuing to spend public money to provide healthcare, education and other public services while maintaining private ownership and control must end now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300010#H00300","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624440720,"counter":52,"content":"<p>This is not just about a new national maternity hospital.  This is a moment in history and the Minister has to decide what side he will be on.  Are we going to build a truly public healthcare system, which we are already paying for?

A gun is being put to the head of this State.  Why is this happening?  In 2013, it was decided that we would build a new national maternity hospital, which would be co-located with another hospital.  Since then, we have seen nothing but procrastination from the former Minister for Health and Children, James Reilly, who announced the new hospital and Deputies Varadkar and Harris, as Ministers for Health.  The latter told us that he would get this sorted within a month back in 2017.  We are now being told that we cannot take the compulsory purchase order, CPO, route because it will delay the project but the delays to date have happened because of procrastination.  <\/p>  <p>  We are spending &euro;800 million on a new national maternity hospital, which will be a public asset.  On what planet would it be okay to hand that over to a private entity?  We have listened carefully to the language that is being used and we know how to decode it.  The Minister is saying that he would prefer it if the land was owned by the State but it is not a question of preference.  It is essential that it is so.  The statement from the St. Vincent's Hospital Group reads: \"For the delivery of integrated patient care on the Elm Park Campus, SVHG must retain ownership of the site\".  Does the group think we are total idiots?  Is it seriously suggesting that it cannot provide healthcare unless it owns the ground?  There is something more going on here.  Is it an issue of ethos, control or money?  We cannot allow this to happen.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister does not appreciate how strongly people feel about this.  This is not just about our daughters and granddaughters, but about their granddaughters.  This is about our future care needs.  He has to decide what side he is on.  He told us that the Government is not going to oppose this motion but will it actively support it?  Will the Government do what the motion calls for?  Will it make sure that the new hospital is publicly owned and governed by the State, rather than by a private entity?  Will that happen?  Will the Minister give this House a categoric assurance that this is what he is aiming to achieve, rather than just preferring the land to be owned by the State?  After everything that has happened in this State, as outlined by my colleagues, the idea that we would allow ourselves to be held hostage in this way is just not acceptable.

I discussed this privately with the Minister a number of weeks ago and have raised it a number of times in the D&aacute;il and at meetings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health.  In recent months the Minister has given us some assurances, as he would see it, regarding religious ethos in the context of the management and running of the new national maternity hospital but those assurances were not strong enough.  Indeed, when the Minister was in opposition, he accepted that there are real difficulties and challenges in respect of the ownership of the site and the governance structures that are being proposed.  The T&aacute;naiste, in response to questions from me and Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith last week in the D&aacute;il, agreed that there are fundamental issues of concern here.<\/p> <p>In fact, he went as far as saying that he agrees with us more than we would have thought.  Some would argue that it is a little late in the day for the T&aacute;naiste to finally come to the conclusion that there are fundamental issues with regard to governance matters and the ownership of the land.  This is a mess, and it is entirely of Fine Gael's making.  It dates back to when the former Deputy, Dr. James Reilly, was Minister for Health as well as to when the T&aacute;naiste and Deputy Harris were the Ministers for Health.<\/p> <p> The statement yesterday from St. Vincent's Healthcare Group was also very telling in that regard.  It made it clear that, from the group's perspective, it understood it had an understanding from the Department, and I would argue from the Government, that the lease, governance and ownership arrangements that are being put in place were signed off by the State and the Department in principle, and what had to be worked out is a little more detail.  That is a far cry from what the T&aacute;naiste said in the D&aacute;il last week.  As usual, Fine Gael has come to this with too little and too late.  Deputy Stephen Donnelly is now the Minister and it falls to him.  I agree with the previous speakers that this is a test of the State's ability to ensure we do the right thing if we are going to build a new national maternity hospital.  We all want to see it built as quickly as possible and without delay.  It is already about six years behind schedule and subject to additional costs.  Initially the cost was to be &euro;300 million, then it was &euro;500 million and it is now potentially &euro;800 million, with some saying it will be &euro;1 billion.  We do not know what the full cost will be in respect of the capital cost and the fit-out cost, but it will be very substantial.  It is a very important hospital and we all want to see it built.  However, we also must get the foundations right in terms of both the governance foundations and the ownership foundations.<\/p> <p> It was disappointing to read the statement from St. Vincent's Healthcare Group yesterday.  While there is now a tug-of-war taking place between that organisation and the Government, the problem is that, again, women and the future of maternity services are left in the middle.  The group referred to integrated hospital patient care and offered that as a reason the land cannot either be gifted or sold to the State.  It wants to ensure integrated hospital patient care.  I believe it is talking about integrated care within the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, but we are talking about integrated care within all the maternity hospitals, which must be publicly owned, managed and governed.  That is the integrated hospital care that concerns me and, I hope, all Deputies in the House.  The fundamental question is: what happens now?  I very much hope that we will not be sold a pup again and told that the lease will be extended from 99 years to, perhaps, 149 years and that we will look at tinkering around with some of the legal and contractual arrangements but, essentially, we will proceed with the convoluted process that has been put in place.  It simply is not good enough.  It beggars belief that the State would build a new, state-of-the-art hospital and pay for the building, the fit-out, the staff and the management and running of the hospital, yet some private charity would own the land, with a board of governors put in place where the Minister would not appoint all the people on the board.  It cannot be argued that the board would be fully governed by the State on behalf the public.  None of that makes sense.<\/p> <p> While we are discussing the ownership of the new national maternity hospital, I must point out that there are other maternity hospitals that are chronically underfunded.  The Minister is aware of the situation in the Rotunda Hospital.  I have raised it with him on previous occasions.  A report by KPMG identified real clinical risks in the neonatal emergency department, the inpatient and outpatient departments and in other areas.  The hospital cannot wait for the co-location option with Connolly Hospital before it gets a resolution to its problems.  There are capacity issues in St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny and in University Hospital Waterford.  There are problems with capacity across all our maternity hospitals.  There is a need to continue to invest in the national maternity strategy.  I welcome the additional funding that was made available last year.  We must continue with that, but we also have to increase capital funding for those maternity hospitals to ensure we provide services to the highest standard across all maternity hospitals.<\/p> <p> Women's healthcare has been left behind by successive Governments for far too long.  We all know the track record, which includes CervicalCheck, symphysiotomy and even the mother and baby homes.  We can chart the history of the relationship between women, healthcare and the State.  It is not a very rosy one.  We want to put that behind us and to move to a healthcare system that is truly secular, that delivers for women and in which there is absolutely no ambiguity about the type of healthcare that can be provided in hospitals.  Notwithstanding any legal guarantees or assurances that the Minister can offer this House, and he spoke about this on national radio, when there is a doubt, where ambiguity exists and when there is a convoluted process that involves a board and company that are not owned and managed by the State, there is a problem.<\/p> <p> My final point relates directly to the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  The State and the Minister have a responsibility, but the Religious Sisters of Charity is telling us that it is essentially gifting the land to the State.  If it is genuine about that, why not go the full distance and simply gift the land to the State, as opposed to gifting it to a private charity?  What is the reason for this?  I do not buy the argument that the need for integrated patient care is the reason the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group will not gift the land to the State.  That does not make sense.  It only makes sense if one wishes to have some level of control.  For that reason, it arouses a suspicion that is genuine, real and profound, and to which the Minister must respond.  We need a resolution to this, and the resolution can only be public land, a public hospital, public ownership and a hospital governed by the State for the women of the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300011#J00300","speaker":"1615","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624441320,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to support the motion proposed by the Social Democrats.  It would be a great start for children to be born in a national maternity hospital that is owned and run for the State, by the State and by the rules of the State, without any sleight of corporate hand or torture of language and logic as to ownership and ethos.  The St. Vincent's Healthcare Group's statement last night that the group must retain ownership of the site for the delivery of integrated patient care on the Elm Park campus is mysterious.  We have had too much mystery, and decades of sorrowful mysteries in the treatment of women's and girls' health and in their reproductive lives.  Quite simply, the nuns must gift or sell the site to the State and to us, the people who will be using the hospital, funding it and running it, without any corporate or incorporated detours through holding companies.<\/p>  <p>  The State has a rotten history in how it treats women and girls in pregnancy and in childcare, most of it caused by professional and institutional devotion to the Catholic church where men made the rules, even those who did not wear the trousers.  Other men in suits and white coats, with stethoscopes around their necks, did their bidding and oversaw barbaric practices such as symphysiotomy.  In ensuring their physical capacity to reproduce, women were reduced to breeding beasts.  For those damaged by those shameful practices, there was a veterinarian quality to their treatment, although the veterinarians I know would have been a great deal more compassionate.<\/p>  <p>  In speaking about how women were treated in the past, I wish to speak up for women in the present as well, particularly the women who have written to me, some of whom were 40 weeks pregnant and counting, to tell me that in labour they faced an invasive and unnecessary internal examination, not for a clinical reason but to confirm established labour so their partners could be admitted for the delivery of the child.  Again, this bovine treatment is unmistakable.  Women are put upon to fit the system as opposed to the system fitting their needs when they are at the limits of their coping and at their most vulnerable.  Chosen birth partners are not visitors and they are not an accessory to the process of pregnancy.  The Minister said we need a revolution in women's healthcare.  Absolutely, and he will not be alone at the barricades in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  Frankly, it is farcical that in 2021 we are tiptoeing around the ownership of our national maternity hospital with a religious order.  The gift should not be to a company but to the State, which will pay for and run the hospital for the public good and for women of every faith and none as well as for the good of our children.<\/p> <p>From the moment we give birth to our children, the church and State must separate.  The Government must be out of its mind allowing a private holding company to have an input into women's healthcare and all that entails.  The hospital must be owned and run by the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300012#K00200","speaker":"1585","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624441920,"counter":57,"content":"<p>As a State we have, unfortunately, made a virtue - perhaps that is the wrong word - or certainly a strong tradition of devolving essential public services and the State abdicating responsibility for them.  That did not start with the Minister.  We have a long history of that.  We see it in education and all sorts of areas.  We see it very strongly in healthcare.<\/p>  <p>  If we are going to take a step away from that, as we should - the State should intervene in places that it is not directly involved in such as childcare - this is an essential part of that process.  It is right and proper.  The objective should be a publicly funded and run healthcare system.  A national maternity hospital should be at the heart of that.  The dangers here are obvious. <\/p>  <p>  I note the commitments given by the hospital group yesterday, which I welcome.  Let us move forward ten or 15 years. Let us suppose a controversy arises because a woman is denied a termination or tubal ligation, or there is some change in legislation and SVHG refuses to go along with it because there has been a change in the internal politics of that group or whatever.  The commitments given ten or 15 years prior will no longer stand.  The Government of the day will say there is not much it can do about that, it is afraid the State does not own the site and it cannot intervene or that it has contacted the hospital group to try to see if the matter can be resolved.  The strength of the hand of the Government will have been severely weakened by decisions being taken here and now.  It is right and proper that at the heart of our public healthcare system is a national maternity hospital that is well funded and publicly owned. <\/p>  <p>  Ar an &aacute;bhar sin, t&aacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh an t-ospid&eacute;al seo i seilbh an phobail agus go mbeadh s&eacute; ag rith ar an mbun&uacute;s sin.

It appears to me that he is now listening, which I welcome.  I welcome in particular the emphasis that he has put on the full duration of labour.  As Deputy Cronin just said, the arbitrary decision about how dilated a woman is should not dictate when she gets care.  It should only be a start.  The Minister and Mr. Paul Reid need to be on top of the hospitals to make sure they are implementing that.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to deal with all of the key appointments, in particular, but not exclusively, for women who are at high risk or are experiencing pregnancy loss.  As well as that, after birth is a crucial time for partner support.  We should not be talking about this in terms of slots for visitors.  Of course there needs to be policies for all of that, but partners are an essential support.  They are not visitors.  That applies to all appointments as well as after birth.  This needs to be just the start.  The Minister needs to stay on top of this and I will keep an eye on it.  I welcome the fact that he is listening, in particular around the difference between established labour and labour.  There is just labour.

We have one of the lowest levels of consultant obstetricians and gynaecologists in the OECD, which is shameful.  Maternity services have been pockmarked by multiple investigations and inquiries into care, standards and practices.  Sadly, the development of a new and improved national maternity hospital has been in the pipeline since the 1990s.  Since 2013, it has been in each programme for Government which in and of itself is telling of how much of our priority maternity services are to this and previous Governments.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017, my party moved a motion that received unanimous support to ensure that the new national maternity hospital remained entirely within public ownership, and rightly so.  Despite support from every side of the Chamber, its provisions were never implemented and here we are today.  <\/p>  <p>  The public rightly want clarification from the Government about who, in effect, will run this hospital.  The motion notes that nearly four years after the Religious Sisters of Charity committed to departing St. Vincent's Healthcare Group it remains the sole shareholder.  Why is the ownership of the capital lands being transferred to a proxy church charity rather than being handed over to the State?  What has been going on within the engagement? <\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Donnelly, spoke on the radio earlier and essentially tried to deny the relationship between who owns land and the governance of the hospital.  That is not good enough.  The Mulvey agreement that emerged as a resolution in 2016 is not fit for purpose.  The State must own the land.  A 100-year lease is not good enough.

I spoke during that debate and said, and it remains true today, that for an order that takes a vow of poverty, chastity, obedience and service to the poor, the Religious Sisters of Charity appear to have a fixation with land and property that would make a property speculator or vulture fund blush.  I do not know why we keep having to have these conversations, but I will tell the Minister one thing.  He will have the unanimous support of the House in his dealings with the religious orders.  He has a very important job to do and there are two issues that concern me.<\/p>  <p>  When I thought about the motion and came to the Chamber, I was reminded of the photograph of the majority of elected Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies and Senators holding \"Vote No\" posters, making their position on women's rights and the right to reproductive healthcare very clear.  That worries me because I worry the Minister will not get support at the Cabinet table.  Some of those people now sit at Cabinet, which is a concern.  The Minister will have the support of Sinn F&eacute;in and, I hope, the majority of Members. <\/p>  <p>  The second person I thought about when I came in here today was Sheila Hodgers, who, along with her baby, died in 1983.  She was a friend of my parents and I knew her.  We could argue all day about what caused her death and the clinical reasons, etc.  I believe that Sheila's life could have been saved were it not for the religious convictions and persuasions of the people involved in delivering her care.  When we reflect on what is needed, we need to remember people such as Sheila. <\/p>  <p>  This is not a zero-sum game.  This is important.  Access to healthcare for women is important.  Healthcare free of religious influence has to be paramount.  Nuns and priests have no business in our hospital.  Why they want to own this land, or profess to say they need to own this land, baffles me because there is no good reason for it.  What we need to do, and we pledge our support for this to the Minister, is ensure that the hospital is built on public land and is entirely free of any religious influence whatsoever.  We will support him in that.  It is important work and needs to be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300013#L00400","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1624441920,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I thank my colleagues in the Social Democrats for bringing this forward.  The Minister has been handed a hospital pass, pardon the pun.  It has been handed down to him by bad advice from officials and his predecessors.  He will have to, in some way, manage to take that pass and turn it around for the people of Ireland because he has no other option.<\/p>  <p>  The letter from the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group yesterday was two fingers to the Minister.<\/p> <p>I spoke to the Taoiseach yesterday in this Chamber and asked him straight up what was happening.  He said the Minister for Health would be negotiating and talking with the hospital group as regards ensuring that the site would hopefully be gifted to the State.  That is what I took from what he said, to be fair.  I believed what the Taoiseach said was accurate and I believe that was the Minister's intention.  I can see the Minister nodding.  I accept it.  I genuinely feel the Minister has been left in a situation now where he has very little options.<br\/><br\/>After the contributions made in the Chamber yesterday, and after the coverage in the media, the hospital group then decided to issue this statement, which gives two fingers to the Minister and to the Irish people.  It basically said the Minister is not entitled to do those negotiations and it will not negotiate in good faith.  The critical line refers to point 5, for the avoidance of doubt, which states that, &quot;for the delivery of integrated patient care on the Elm Park Campus, SVHG must retain ownership of the site&rdquo;.<br\/><br\/>The most important question to be asked in the Chamber today is &quot;Why?&quot;  In fairness to him, I can guarantee that is also the Minister's question.  Is it for the national maternity services of Ireland, as part of the greater national maternity strategy, of which I am a huge supporter?  Or is it because the hospital group does not want to relinquish control?  It is the latter.  The documents, which the group had to release, in fairness, because my colleague, Senator Bacik, who has fought on this for years, submitted a freedom of information, FOI, request, demonstrate that.<br\/><br\/>This also demonstrates huge failures of the Department of Health and its officials in the way in which this was dealt with, which are nothing to do with the Minister.  It completely missed the thinking of the Irish people and what the Irish people would tolerate.<br\/><br\/>Four years ago at our national conference, when this story broke, I stood up and got an emergency motion passed.  We have been fighting on this for years, taking the advice of people like Dr. Peter Boylan, Dr. Gerry Burke and many others.  There has been historic failure here.  When one looks at what the Religious Sisters of Charity said it was going to gift to the State, under the transfer of holdings, one can identify when it got the permission of the Holy See.  It got its letter of grant, as it is called, which stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe provisions relating to the validity and lawfulness of alienations, found in Canons 638-639 and Canons 1292-1294 of the Code of Canon Law and in Proper Law, are to be observed. <\/blockquote> <p>Canon 1293 requires the congregation to have &quot;a just cause, such as urgent necessity, evident advantage, piety, charity, or some other grave pastoral reason&quot; to make the transfer.  That is the foundation of what we are talking about here.  No hospital group with such a delineation and those conditions attached can be in charge of the national maternity hospital, full stop.  If the foundations are wrong then the hospital cannot be built.  I believe the Minister knows that in his heart and soul.<br\/><br\/>We are now scrambling.  I would also like to know why St. Vincent's Hospital Group, which is willing to give a 149-year lease, is not willing to gift the site?  Why is it such a big difference?  That is another critical question because of what I just read out regarding Canon Law.<br\/><br\/>This is a crossroads for our country with regard to the influence of the Catholic Church, particularly, over hospitals, healthcare, education - over everything.  The Minster has to make the right decision.  I believe he wants to make the right decision.  We will support him in doing so.  The programme for Government, though, is deadly weak on this.  It does not actually commit to it being a hospital in public ownership.  It states that it will &quot;Conclude the governance arrangements and commence the building of the new maternity Hospital at St Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, Dublin.&quot;  It does not say it will be fully owned by the Irish people, its governance will be dictated by the State and the land will be owned by the State.  It does not say that.  The Minister will have to go further than the programme for Government commitments.<br\/><br\/>Options A, B and C as regards what was going to happen here have all failed.  We are now down to option D.  The Minister needs to have backbone here.  He needs to have leverage.  We do not have any options.  Our options are either to acquire the site by means of compulsory purchase order, CPO - I say &quot;we&quot; because it is all of us - or else look at St James's Hospital or Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown.  This has to be co-located for best clinical needs.  After all the work that has gone into it, however, why should we move?<br\/><br\/>So my suggestion is that if it is not willing to gift the site, the Minister should acquire it with a CPO.  Why only speak about acquiring this piece of the land with a CPO?  We all know we need to invest in our national hospitals post Covid.  Why not acquire the whole site with a CPO?  I am sure that will make St. Vincent's Hospital Group think about what it is saying to the Minister and the Irish people after the two fingers it gave to everyone last night.  Why do we not acquire the whole lot with a CPO and turn it into one national campus for everyone, which will be fully owned by the State, including the public, private and maternity parts - everything?  I am sure that will give the Minister leverage.  I am sure watching this debate will make the St. Vincent's Hospital Group think.  We need to build up leverage here because this is completely unacceptable.  What was done by the Department of Health here was so weak and wrong.  The Minister has now been left to pick up the ball.<br\/><br\/>On behalf of the Irish people, I ask him please to make a decision.  Either acquire the site with a CPO, or in my view, the best option here is to acquire the entire thing with a CPO.  As the Minister knows, I have always believed in this.  I am not being different in my approach; I have been saying it for years.  Given what has happened the last 24 hours, this scenario has confirmed my view that that is the best solution to this situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300013#L00500","speaker":"1610","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624442520,"counter":62,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Kelly.

I thank the Social Democrats for the motion.  It is really important that we discuss this.  No doubt lots more facts, figures and realities will emerge over the next period.  After all, it is only less than a week ago when, to the alarm of everybody, we discovered that the Government shared the concerns of the Opposition on this issue.  Much has emerged since then.  I want to say to the people of Ireland, however, that anyone who shares the concerns of the majority of this House should now see their role as really pushing this issue over the next period and should join us in protest outside Leinster House this Saturday at 1 p.m.  I am aware that is also Pride day.  I take the opportunity to wish everybody a very positive and happy Pride day.  The protest takes place at 1 p.m. outside Leinster House, however, which leaves plenty of time for people to party with their gay community afterwards.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, a week is a long time in politics and we know much more now than we did a week ago.  When one finds oneself on the same page as senior Ministers in Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, it feels a bit uncomfortable to say the least from my point of view.  Nevertheless, we are living in extraordinary times when we see what is going on here.<\/p>  <p>  To play devil's advocate, let us say we take the Religious Sisters of Charity at its word when it says it is withdrawing from healthcare and does not want to have any involvement in the ethos.  Then, let us look at the detail.  One week ago, we were told by the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group that this land was being gifted to the people of Ireland.  Then, after a closer look at the detail, one finds that it is not being gifted to the people of Ireland but to a private charity.  Nobody is denying that now, including the group itself.<\/p>  <p>  One week ago, we had a 99-year lease.  We now have 149-year lease without any religious ethos or influence involved.  However, a search of the charities register today shows us that St. Vincent's Holdings Group still holds the charitable purposes of Mother Mary Aikenhead.  How, therefore, can the Minister reconcile these two opposing positions?<\/p>  <p>  I believe yesterday's statement from the St. Vincent's Holding Group was deeply flawed and disingenuous.  It was not just insulting to the women of Ireland.  After the likely outcome of this debate today, when the vast majority will agree to the motion, the insistence of the board on maintaining ownership of the land is deeply insulting to the democratic will of the people of this country.<\/p>  <p> The St. Vincent's Healthcare Group has said it must retain ownership of the land for clinical governance and operational reasons but why is that the case?  This makes no sense at all.  When required, patients are routinely transferred from one hospital to another all over this country and this has been the case for decades.  This is not rocket science.  The group refers in its statements to the golden share of the Minister for Health but why should we have to rely on extensive and complex legal agreements and commercial terms when it comes to an asset that the State will pay for fully with taxpayers' money.  That includes the workers and investors in this country.  Why should there be any ambiguity and why should the State invest in an asset of a private company?<\/p> <p> The only answer is that the State is not fully committed to shifting away from the privatisation of healthcare and removing healthcare from the hands of religious orders.  In particular in this case, we are talking about reproductive and maternity health.  This is not good enough.  It is not about the integrated needs of women and babies.  It is not the reproductive needs of this cohort that is driving this approach.  This is about the integrated investment interests of the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group and the Sisters of Charity.<\/p> <p> Mr. Fintan O'Toole tweeted today a chart published by the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group on 14 May, which was very recently, demonstrating the hierarchy of private control of the healthcare system.  Ultimately, it demonstrates that the St. Vincent's holding group will have the power to sell, mortgage and do its bidding as a commercial entity with this hospital.  It is big business interests versus the interests of our health services.  Public services, particularly health and education, should be removed from the grasp of the church.  The slogan of separating church and State will gather momentum.<\/p> <p> It is really important the people of Ireland get behind this.  We have shown time and again with the likes of the same-sex marriage, repeal of the eighth amendment and water charges that what changes the course of history is not what happens in this House on its own but what happens on the streets, in our communities and in our workplaces.  It is people power combined with the democratic will of the House that will bring forward these changes.  We should not put up for another minute with any more of this nonsense that the St. Vincent's holding group can determine the future of women's health in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300014#M00300","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624443120,"counter":65,"content":"<p>It is time to take off the gloves with the Sisters of Charity.  Let us remind ourselves of who we are dealing with.  The Sisters of Charity were heavily involved in the illegal adoptions racket.  The St. Patrick's Guild that they ran handed over files to Tusla in 2016, leading to the discovery that the guild was involved with 126 illegal adoptions.  However, this is unlikely to have been the entire story and experts reckon there may have been as many as 10,000 illegal adoptions in the State.  How many of these involved the Sisters of Charity?

I stand to be corrected but the latest information I could obtain indicates less than half of this - a mere &euro;2 million - has been paid and no payment has been made for the past eight years.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister will be mandated by the House to tell the Sisters of Charity that the hospital will be owned and controlled by the State and that it will be built on State land.

This seems to be the only aspect of the current plans that is not shrouded in uncertainty.  Plans to provide a modern maternity hospital at Elm Park date back to 2013 and at that time, the project had an estimated cost of &euro;150million.  The following years were dominated by disputes over governance of the new hospital and this included a frustratingly long period during which legalities moved at snail's pace as the Sisters of Charity waited for permission from the Holy See on transferring the shareholding to the newly formed St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group.<\/p>  <p>  We now know that despite the efforts of the Government to purchase the site, St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group is insisting on retaining ownership of the site.  The Mulvey arrangement was put on the table as the solution in 2017 but why did it take so long for the penny to drop in Government circles that this formula was unacceptable to the Government?  Here we are eight years later still in stalemate.<\/p>  <p>  Despite efforts by the T&aacute;naiste to remain focused on the fundamental issue of ownership of the site, the public and media debate has now switched focus to what range of services will be provided at the new maternity hospital.  I fully understand the correlation and the concerns about future services but until we have finality on the site we do not have a hospital to provide services of any kind.  Other matters of importance must not overshadow this fact.  Until this matter is successfully concluded and concerns on safeguarding public investment are addressed, the new national maternity hospital will remain, as it has been for years, an architect's drawing.<\/p>  <p>  As with the national children's hospital, nobody is disputing the absolute need for a new national maternity hospital.  These purpose-built, modern and vital facilities are needed.  The mothers of Ireland deserve modern accommodation, high-tech equipment and top-class support services.  Despite the clear need, they cannot be provided at any cost, financial or otherwise.  They cannot start out at one figure and then double, triple and quadruple as time goes on.  They cannot be built on sites that may result in legal wrangles for future generations.<\/p>  <p>  Based on the lessons we have learned and continue to learn from the children&rsquo;s hospital, we must ensure our successors are not standing here again in years to come grappling with issues arising from a national State-owned hospital standing on charity-owned ground.  This is the primary matter that needs to be set in stone before we concentrate on the provision of services that we have already been assured will be provided at the State-owned hospital.  The horse must remain in front of the cart if we are to progress this project.<\/p>  <p>  Issues such as those that arose with the national children&rsquo;s hospital and those that have emerged in relation to the new national maternity hospital beg the question as to why we struggle in this country when it comes to the delivery of major projects.  Why are they permitted to drag on in an open-ended fashion, causing frustrating delays and alarming cost overruns without serious repercussions, after years of procrastination and prevarication?  After years of dancing around the ownership issue, we are now back to the crossroads.  We are told that the cost of the project has shot up to &euro;800 million.  It really is a mess and an embarrassing saga that reflects poorly on the competence of our national administrators.<\/p>  <p>  Why are we so inept at delivering State-funded facilities?  Our abject failure to address the alarming issues of responsibility and accountability is a damning indictment of our procurement structures and procedures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300015#N00400","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speech","time":1624443120,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \t(<i>a<\/i>) To delete the following:  \t&quot;&mdash; women&rsquo;s reproductive healthcare would be put at risk and their safety endangered if subject to Catholic ownership and ethos;&quot;<br \/><br \/>and <i>(b) <\/i>To insert the following after &quot;the new hospital be fully owned and governed by the State&quot;:  \t <blockquote> \t&quot;and further: <blockquote> \t&mdash; commits to no private healthcare services being carried out on the site of the new National Maternity Hospital, pursuant to the Private Members' Motion on National Maternity Services [Vol. 983, No. 8] brought in June 2019 by then Fianna F&aacute;il Opposition Spokesperson on Health Stephen Donnelly, who is now the incumbent Minister for Health;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; calls on the Government to explain the reasons why, on occasion, in cases of medical negligence, brought against the National Maternity Hospital, the State has also provided, at a financial cost, legal defence to private clinics named alongside the National Maternity Hospital as defendants in certain court cases and to commit to ensuring that this does not happen going forward;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; criticises the continued spikes in cost of the National Maternity Hospital project, rising from an initial estimate of &euro;150 million to &euro;350 million, and now to in excess of &euro;800 million, and calls for the Minister to come before the D&aacute;il to explain the more than 500% increase in the projected cost of the new Hospital; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; calls for the full provision of financial estimates and figures to the Oireachtas Public Accounts Committee and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.&quot; <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>Yesterday in the courts, liability was admitted by the defendants in a case taken by a couple whose healthy unborn baby was aborted in the National Maternity Hospital after they were wrongly told their son had Edwards syndrome in March 2019.<\/p> <p> Every party member who has spoken in the House today on the National Maternity Hospital has been completely silent about this case.  Over the past two years, I have heard of no other political party raising this case in the D&aacute;il.  These parties need to ask themselves why they have remained silent.  Christopher's parents were incredibly courageous in fighting against all the odds for justice for their son.  They have been treated shockingly by senior staff in the National Maternity Hospital and two Ministers for Health.  For two years, Christopher's parents did their utmost to simply identify this threat to public health to ensure the necessary changes were made to make sure this would never happen again.  I have raised this in the D&aacute;il over and over again with the Taoiseach and Ministers; none of them delivered on the simple request to have an investigation regarding what happened to Christopher.  They have not carried out the necessary changes to ensure that more couples do not find themselves in this situation.  I now call on the Minister to hold a full public investigation into what happened.<\/p> <p> It is also astounding that the couple was referred for a test from the National Maternity Hospital to the Merrion Fetal Health clinic, a private clinic run by the obstetricians themselves.  It is stranger still, and this is an incredible situation, that the State announced at the time it would cover the legal costs, not just for the public hospital but for the private hospital too, which is an unprecedented move.  It is imperative that the new national maternity hospital in St. Vincent's is a fully public hospital.  We should not just have separation of church and State but separation of the State from private facilities operating on those grounds.<\/p> <p> I also raise a point about the language used in the motion.  It may not have been purposeful, but it happened nonetheless.  The Social Democrats motion states that the Catholic ethos is a threat to the health of women.  This is a gross insult to millions of practising Catholics in Ireland.  Some of this language, not necessarily used by the Social Democrats, but by others, including the media, has bordered on significantly intolerant and sectarian.  I ask Members to moderate their language.  Last week, teachers came before an Oireachtas committee and stated that practising Catholics in schools are being singled out for bullying at the moment.  Many people around the country who are Catholics feel Ireland is becoming a cold place for them.  As a State, we are celebrating a whole sector of society being taken out of the closet.  We should not seek with our language to put another sector of society into the closet in this particular debate.  The Republic of Ireland should be pluralist, a republic where everybody, no matter what their colour, creed or orientation, should be able to be who they are to the full extent, without fear or favour. <\/p> <p> My colleague, Deputy Matt Shanahan, asked me to raise the incredible ongoing situation of partners of mothers still being unable to attend appointments, or the birth of their children, in certain hospitals in this State.  It is absolutely wrong that this debate has been going on and on for months, without the Government getting it together.  Let this go no further. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300015#N00500","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624443720,"counter":69,"content":"<p>The national maternity hospital project was first announced in 2013.  That is now eight years ago.  Like the national children's hospital, the real scandal of the development are the skyrocketing costs.  In 2018, the original cost was in the region of &euro;150 million.  In 2017 and 2018, the costs had risen by over 100% to an estimated &euro;350 million.  In 2021, last Friday in fact, we were told by the Minister for Health that the building infrastructure costs have been priced at &euro;500 million.  Further commissioning costs, including fit-out and transferring an entire hospital to a new site, will be a further &euro;350 million.  That is &euro;800 million, which is four times the original estimate.<\/p>  <p>  We have to look at the utter lack of competence of the Government, and official Ireland, to manage major projects, such as the children's hospital, broadband and everything else.  The ineptitude is frightening.  We will have to get some foreign authorities in, I mean outside people, who will oversee this and bring it to book.  It is disgusting and is just madness.  Any business would not survive a week if it behaved like that.  As I said, this is the real issue surrounding the national maternity hospital.<\/p>  <p>  Taxpayers will once again be left to carry the can, as always.  They are sick, sore, sorry and tired of this.  How, eight years on, can building work on the site at St. Vincent's campus in south Dublin still be at a preliminary stage?  You can blame the Religious Sisters of Charity all you like; it has nothing to do with them.  Meanwhile, each year, more than 8,000 women continue to give birth in wholly unsuitable, crowded conditions in the Victorian-era building at Holles Street.<\/p>  <p>  Government politicians rehearse the same arguments that have failed to deliver the project from the beginning.  It is the very same mantra.  Under the plan that was once a statement of the State's ambitions for modern healthcare, and for a messy compromise rooted in a century of official neglect in the same area, the Government will build an &euro;800 million hospital on this site, if it ever gets to build it.  This is where the problem is.  I am very concerned.<\/p>  <p>  Only yesterday, Tuesday, 22 June, the St. Vincent's Hospital Group stated it must retain ownership of the site the new national maternity hospital will be built on.  This means the hospital group is happy to proceed with the arrangements with the Religious Sisters of Charity.  I heard the Minister say on radio last Sunday, and on \"Morning Ireland\" this morning, that he was going to meet them.  When will he meet them?  Why not sit down and talk to them rather than bashing them up and down the country and everywhere?  Why not meet them, sit down and respect them for what they are and what they have done for this country?<\/p>  <p>  Clearly, this announcement from the hospital can be viewed as a direct message to Government parties to stop playing politics with this issue.  That is what the Government is doing.  In a statement, St. Vincent's Hospital Group stated it is \"more than willing\" to meet the Government to discuss the relocation of the hospital from Holles Street.  However, it added: \"For the delivery of integrated patient care on Elm Park Campus, [St. Vincent's Health Group] must retain ownership of the site.\"  That is their position.  Why not meet them and talk to them?  As I said, the whole saga this week is now more to do with the by-election in Dublin Bay South.  It is a sad state of affairs that we can kick the Sisters up and down the street and all over the country and bash them.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n is right.  There is an apartheid, a bigotry and hate speech here, which we are jumping up and down every day of the week talking about.  Horrible things were done by some members of different orders and by priests.  Are we still going to bash all the rest, the good ones, forever?  These are good people that have given so much service to educate our people and run the hospitals.  When the matrons ran the hospitals they were clean, there was no MRSA and they were run properly, not like the shambles of a health service we have now.  It is appalling the way language has been used, the way the Sisters have been harangued, bullied and sullied, and that the Minister will not sit down to meet them.<\/p>  <p>  Members of the Government would rather try to gather votes in the by-election.  They delay and procrastinate while the good Sisters, up and down the country, who educated most of us, have their good names tarnished and destroyed.  I have no truck with the bad ones; they should be rooted out and dealt with.  Anyone who suffered abuse, and I met someone outside today, should be compensated and helped.  However, the bashing of religious orders in this House makes me sick to my core.  It is a Christian country but the unchristian attitudes to our religious are shockingly disgusting.  The Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and everybody else has engaged in it.  The T&aacute;naiste started this off because of the Dublin by-election.  There was a big repeal vote in that constituency, around 70%, and this is the electorate they are playing to.  It is so sad they have dumped the Sisters under the bus but, worse than that, have allowed women give birth to babies in hospitals that are totally unfit.  Why does the Government not go and buy a site elsewhere and leave the Sisters alone?  It should buy a site, compulsory purchase order, CPO, it or whatever, and move on. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300016#O00200","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1624443720,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I will speak about the matter at hand, which is the national maternity hospital and the fact that this project was first announced in 2013, almost eight years ago.

Do we really think the taxpayers can be treated in this way?  When we talk about the State and the State's money, there is no such thing.  It is the people's money.

If the situation remains as it is with the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group refusing to sell the site to the State, is the Government preparing to compulsory purchase order, CPO, the site, and if it is too costly and if it is too lengthy is the Government preparing to abandon the St. Vincent's Hospital site and begin the process of looking elsewhere?  Women have to draw a red line on this.  It cannot go on.  This would obviously create a new problem as there is an urgent need for a new up-to-date national maternity hospital but the Government must make its position clear.  The day when religious institutions or, in this case, their proxies can dictate to the State and to the women of this country while enjoying 100% State funding are over.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the Social Democrats for tabling this parliamentary motion in a timely fashion.  I am pleased the Government is not opposing it but it will still not solve the problem.<\/p>  <p>  The decision to locate a State-built, State-funded and much needed modern national maternity hospital without clarification as to the ownership of the site and the governance and ethos of the hospital has resulted in the present mess, and mess it most certainly is.  The situation could only arise because the public service is a mess.<\/p>  <p>  What we have is a public health service grafted onto an inherited system from the 19th century based on the ideology of the Poor Law and the provision of health for the poor as a charitable act provided, in the main, by the Catholic Church.  In 2015, while I was a member of the committee which drew up the Sl&aacute;intecare report, research showed that, of a State health budget of &euro;13 billion, &euro;3.6 billion went to non-statutory agencies.  Fifty-three per cent of this went to acute voluntary hospitals and 47% to non-acute agencies.  Section 38 and 39 agencies, numbering at least 3,000 different agencies, received some &euro;3 billion.  The level of outsourcing of essential services to charities and NGOs is simply mind-boggling.  They should be directly employed by the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  The current impasse on the National Maternity Hospital is a consequence of the fact that the political parties which have dominated the State for the past 100 years, the mandarins in the Department of Health, the leadership of the HSE and particular sections of the medical profession have all been happy to live with the situation, and that leaves aside the role of the Catholic Church in demanding a leading role in the provision of essential public services, such as health and education.<\/p>  <p>  The situation in relation to the National Maternity Hospital is a test.  Are we to have high quality free-to-use public services as a right for all in a modern secular Republic or will there be a shabby compromise with the State spending at least &euro;800 million to &euro;1 billion to build a hospital on land it does not own with the State funding 100% of the cost of staff, the board of governors nominated by a private charity and absolutely no certainty that all the medical procedures legal in the State will be provided to women who need them?  Rights are exerted; charity is bestowed.<\/p>  <p>  I want to make a point about what has happened in the past week.  We had a statement from the Sisters of Charity to say they were going to gift the site to the Irish people.  It then transpired quite clearly that the intent was that they were going to gift it to, in fact, a charity - their own holding company.  Then we had the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Taoiseach and the Minister stating that the land must be in public ownership and that the governance should be in State control.  Then we had the Sisters of Charity issue a statement saying that the ownership of the land was not an issue and the Government never raised it before - we know, in 2017, the then Minister, Deputy Harris, did.  Then we had the statement yesterday from St. Vincent's Healthcare Group saying it must retain ownership of the land for clinical governance.  We must as a State publicly own the land.  We must retain the ownership of the land for clinical, governance and operational reasons, including the provision of the safe integrated system of our care.<\/p>  <p>  I hear the Minister say this morning that he will meet the Sisters of Charity privately.  I thought they were out of the equation since 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300017#P00300","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speech","time":1624444320,"counter":78,"content":"<p>T&aacute; s&eacute; breis agus 70 bliain &oacute; a for&oacute;gra&iacute;odh an t&iacute;r seo ina Phoblacht.

I do not want the Minister's assurances.  What I want is a national maternity hospital on public land fully owned and operated by the State for the people of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Social Democrats for bringing this motion and for allowing their Private Members' time to be used in this manner.  This is the second motion within three weeks where we put the spotlight on national maternity services.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister talks about a revolution in maternity care that is needed.  That was supposed to have been done with the national maternity strategy that has not been implemented.<\/p>  <p>  If we look at the topic under discussion today, May 2013 jumps out for some reason.  In May 2013, the then Minister, James Reilly, announced co-location.  That was following a report from an accountancy firm in 2008 which stated co-location was the way forward.  In May 2016, we had mediation through Mulvey.  We had a ridiculous outcome of that where the Government would be satisfied with a golden share.  In 2017, there was outrage, and rightly so, from the people of Ireland and the Religious Sisters of Charity told us they were withdrawing.  Why the Minister would be needing to meet them, as my colleague has said, is beyond me because they have withdrawn out it.  Fair play to them.  They said they withdrew out of it.  In May 2020, they tell us they gave the site as a gift to the people of Ireland.  That now is also not accurate.  We know it is going to a specially set-up company.<\/p>  <p>  In between, of course, we have had so many things.  We must remember that St. Vincent's rejected the co-location.  They were totally against it in 2014 and, obviously, proceeded in that manner with the collusion of different Governments which sought to facilitate that situation where there would not really be co-ownership but a taking over of the hospital.<\/p>  <p>  In between, thanks to Dr. Peter Boylan, thanks to ourselves and thanks to the Social Democrats, different facts have emerged.  I thank Dr. Peter Boylan for his effort.<\/p> <p>It cannot have been easy for him.  It is not easy for him and still he has persisted.

The contributions that Deputies have brought to this topic are testament to how critically important the new national maternity hospital is.  When I spoke on the topic of maternity services recently, I noted how the attention and investment in those services are commensurate with the importance that we, as a society, place on women and babies.  I reaffirmed the commitment of this Government to delivering better health outcomes for the women of Ireland, as well as our determination to ensure that the success achieved so far in women&rsquo;s health is built on for generations of Irish women and girls into the future.<\/p>  <p>  What we are talking about today is a huge part of that ongoing work.  It is worth remembering that the new national maternity hospital will be the single greatest investment in maternity and women&rsquo;s healthcare in the history of the State.  It will provide state-of-the-art facilities for the provision of modern healthcare for generations of women and families to come but it is more than just a hospital.  It is an investment in our services and in the dedicated people who provide those services.  Most importantly of all, it is an investment in the women of this country.  That investment is long overdue.<\/p>  <p>  We all want to see modern, safe and compassionate services delivered with dignity and respect to those who use them.  To ensure we can deliver on that aim, the Government has provided a significant increase in funding for women&rsquo;s healthcare in 2021, reflecting our commitment to improve services in this area.  The &euro;12 million that has been allocated to the national maternity strategy and to gynaecology services this year, and the additional &euro;5 million provided to the women&rsquo;s health task force, will ensure there is a renewed focus on delivering the best possible care for women and babies across the country.<\/p>  <p>  I can reassure the Deputies that delivering improved outcomes for women will remain our core aim.  The National Maternity Hospital&rsquo;s move, as planned, to the Elm Park campus is a key part of achieving that aim.  The development of modern hospitals, co-located with adult teaching hospitals, will ensure we can provide the best possible healthcare to women and babies, delivered by the right person at the right time and in the right place.  The new hospital is, therefore, a vital piece of infrastructure and one that will help to underpin the development of maternity services and the implementation of the national maternity strategy into the future.<\/p>  <p>  We know that concerns have been raised regarding the ownership and clinical independence of the new national maternity hospital.  These concerns are not surprising, given the chequered history of women&rsquo;s experiences of care in this country in the past.  However, as the Minister has outlined, a considerable amount of work has been done to address these issues and to ensure the new hospital will remain in State ownership to serve women and families for years to come.<\/p>  <p>  Several Deputies who proposed the motion have stated that the Government is gifting the hospital to the Religious Sisters of Charity.  This is inaccurate, untrue and misleading.  The corporate and clinical governance arrangements for the new maternity hospital are set out in the Mulvey agreement, which was agreed between the National Maternity Hospital and St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital in 2016.  A key element of that agreement and a core objective in the subsequent negotiations around the legal framework was the need for the new national maternity hospital to have clinical and operational, as well as financial and budgetary, independence.  This means that the full range of health services available at the new hospital will be provided without religious, ethnic or other distinction.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister for Health stated earlier, the other core objective in this project was and remains that the State&rsquo;s significant investment in the new hospital must be appropriately protected.  In this regard, as part of the initial negotiations in 2017, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, sought the outright transfer of the site for the new hospital.  Following extensive engagement between the HSE, the National Maternity Hospital, St. Vincent's Healthcare Group and the Department, the current position is that St. Vincent's Healthcare Group has agreed to lease the site to the State for a period of 99 years.  There is the potential to extend this lease for a further 50 years.  Lest there be any confusion, I want to reiterate that neither the Government or the Minister will be gifting the national maternity hospital to anyone.  Language is extremely important here.  The finalisation of the draft legal framework and associated arrangements are still ongoing, with a view to ensuring the safeguarding of women&rsquo;s healthcare services and the State&rsquo;s investment are affirmed beyond doubt for the public and for women in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the governance of the new hospital, as set out in the Mulvey agreement, a new company, the national maternity hospital at Elm Park designated activity company, DAC, will be established, which will operate the hospital under licence from the State.  The Minister has received assurances that the positions on the board will be filled solely on the basis of competency.  Furthermore, in addition to the four directors nominated by the National Maternity Hospital and St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, respectively, the Minister will also nominate a public interest representative to the board.<\/p>  <p>  The Religious Sisters of Charity will not have any role in the governance or operation of the new national maternity hospital.  The Minister has been absolutely clear about this previously, and clarified the situation once again today.  The Religious Sisters of Charity have resigned from the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group board and will be transferring their shareholding to St. Vincent&rsquo;s Holdings company limited by guarantee, CLG.  It is also clear that the constitution of St. Vincent&rsquo;s Holdings CLG makes no reference to canon law and that canon law will have no impact in the provision of care at the new hospital.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to reiterate to the House that this Government remains fully committed to its focus on the development of maternity and women&rsquo;s health services in this country.  We are investing more in these services to ensure that developments are achieved, improvements are made and outcomes for people using the services are enhanced.  The relocation of the National Maternity Hospital is a significant part of that development.  I want reiterate what the Minister said.  He will not countenance developing any new maternity hospital where there is any risk that religious or other influence will put women's reproductive healthcare at risk or endanger their safety.  This is a commitment from the Minister on the floor of this House.  He can assure Deputies that the clear legal advice provided to the State is that the ownership and clinical and corporate governance structures ensure that all legally permissible medical services will be provided in the new hospital.<\/p>  <p>  I want to respond to an accusation that was made here earlier.  In case there is any concern on the part of Deputy O'Reilly, Fianna F&aacute;il fully supports the new national maternity hospital being built on public land and in State ownership.  The Minister has the full support of Fianna F&aacute;il on this.  However, language is important and any attempt to demonise the Catholic faith for political gain is unnecessary and disappointing.  Unfortunately, we have seen this happen more and more recently.  The Minister and the Government remain committed to progressing this critical project, and to providing the highest quality infrastructure and environment for it, with all of the necessary assurances, to enable the delivery of modern, safe and quality health services for women and babies for many years to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300018#Q00200","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1624444920,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I begin by bringing into the Chamber the words of the American poet, feminist and lesbian activist, Adrienne Rich, who said, &quot;Every built thing has its unmeant purpose.&quot;<\/p> <p>It should be a source of celebration the Irish State and people should be getting a modern maternity hospital, free of Nightingale wards and with single-room occupancy.  The fact hundreds of millions of euro will be spent to provide the highest standard of healthcare should be a cause of celebration in a modern republic.  Yet the dark clouds of an old Ireland once again start to gather because we will not own that hospital.  We will not own the site on which it is built.  Rather, the hospital will be owned by the St. Vincent's Hospital Group which has been set up by the Religious Sisters of Charity whose legacy is clear in my constituency of Dublin Central.  One can walk up the road from the Convention Centre to Se&aacute;n McDermott Street and see a big building in which they once incarcerated women who committed no crime.  That is the legacy of the Religious Sisters of Charity I see when I walk through my constituency.<\/p> <p> Those same people want us to believe their control of that hospital will be benign, they will have a hands-off approach for 99 years and they will not get involved or dictate in any manner.  They have provided assurances in which I have no faith.  The people of this country who have suffered at the hands of such organisations have no faith in their assurances.  That is why we are bringing forward this motion that our new national maternity hospital should be publicly owned, on public lands and provide the highest standard of healthcare to women and people in this country, without any risk of ethos interfering in the treatment they would be given at any point in the future.<\/p> <p> We need this hospital so badly.  The people of this country need our maternity hospital so badly.  That fact has been weaponised.  Every built thing has its unmeant purpose.  For the St. Vincent's Hospital Group, the Religious Sisters of Charity or the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, in terms of who one has to answer to, the unmeant purpose is clear.  It is about control.  It is about the long game of Catholic control, which it will not concede in this country.  It is the dark shadow it will not unclench its grip from.<\/p> <p> That is not a demonisation of people of the Catholic faith in this country.  Let me be very clear, the people of the Catholic faith in this country suffered more at the hands of the hierarchy than anybody else.  A lease of 99 years is nothing to an organisation which has existed for thousands of years.  There is a battle for our new national maternity hospital, one which strikes to the very heart of what it means to live in a modern, secular republic.  We have fought too hard to concede an inch here.<\/p> <p> Like many people of my generation, I knocked on doors with women who had to outline their stories, hurt and grievances just to get access to basic healthcare.  Before that, I knocked on doors with people from the LGBT community who were asking to be able to marry the people they loved.  When we did that, we stood on the shoulders of people who came before us and suffered a substantial oppression and showed courage beyond what they should have to, in terms of contraceptive trains and those who were incarcerated in Magdalen laundries, suffered the horrors of the asylums and were kept in mother and baby homes.<\/p> <p> Those legacies are still there.  That pain is still there and we will not concede.  Do we honestly believe, given half the chance, the hierarchy of the church would not do exactly the same thing again?  To those naive enough to believe that, I point them in the direction of Poland, or even closer to home, our schools.  Deputies talked about it being a cold place for those of the Catholic faith in this country, but if one goes into any school or class in this country one in five teachers of the LGBT community cannot profess the manner in which he or she loves, for fear it would prohibit his or her career advancement.  This has been a cold, dark place for people in the LGBT community and that ethos still exists in our schools.  I will not be fooled into believing it will not exist in our hospitals, given half the chance.  We stand wholly against it.<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister to demonstrate the courage expected.  When he walks into the room with the Religious Sisters of Charity, he should not be deferential.  We owe them absolutely nothing.  Nothing.  The history of this country is 90 years of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael conceding ownership of the basic public amenities of healthcare and education to the church.  We will stand for that no more.  When the Minister walks into that room, he should not be deferential.  He should remember who is talking to and the legacy of hurt, pain and trauma which they have inflicted and which is still being inflicted on and experienced by people in this country today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300018#Q00300","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624445520,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I thank all Members who contributed to this debate.  I also thank the cross-party Oireachtas group, which was formed last month, for helping to put this issue centre stage in politics.  I wish to acknowledge and thank Dr. Peter Boylan for the important role he has played and the assistance he has provided.  He has been a tireless advocate for women's healthcare.  I also thank and acknowledge the role of the campaign against church control of women's healthcare, as well as the National Women's Council, for their help and campaigning on this vital issue.<\/p>  <p>  These and other efforts have resulted in some in government - belatedly - sitting up, talking notice and facing up to the fact what is proposed for the new national maternity hospital is simply not acceptable.  It is not acceptable because it fails to protect the public purse.  It fails to achieve public ownership and governance.  It fails to guarantee the full range of women's healthcare services and ignores the strong public demand to separate church and State.<\/p>  <p>  In a statement yesterday, St. Vincent's made a number of claims, some of which are simply untrue and do not stand up to any kind of scrutiny.  Its claim it was imperative it retained ownership of the site for the delivery of integrated patient care at Elm Park is nonsensical.  The comments and contribution from the Minister for Health has been extremely disappointing.  He continues to be in denial and seems to think he can hide behind the phrase  that \"it is my preference\".  He needs to spell out exactly what he will do to address this mess before us and the fundamental issues at its core.  He must address ownership of the site, but he must also address the issue of ownership of the national maternity hospital company.  It cannot become a subsidiary of St. Vincent's, wholly owned by St. Vincent's.  That is what is proposed in the Mulvey agreement.  The Mulvey agreement is the problem.  It is not the solution.<\/p>  <p>  The new national maternity hospital must be publicly owned and governed.  It must be a public hospital.  I am calling on the Minister to bring proposals for the future, much needed new national maternity hospital to this D&aacute;il for debate, prior to the Government signing off on any proposals.  It is the least we deserve.<\/p>  <p>  I talked earlier about issues of ownership, property and money, issues which arose with St. Vincent's in the 1970s.  I could also have talked about similar issues in the 1990s, when St. Vincent's mortgaged the public hospital to fund its private hospital.  It is an issue which has created a toxic public-private mix and all of what goes with that.<\/p>  <p>  The nuns have understood the importance of ownership and control of their own hospitals since the 1930s.  Why has our Government, in 2021, failed to learn that fundamental lesson?  This has gone on long enough.  It must stop now, and not just for us, but for future generations of Irish women.  The Government has said it will not oppose our motion.  That is not enough by the Minister, and it is not enough by the Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  This Government must actively support the principles of this motion and make a solemn promise to the people of Ireland.  That promise must be that it will not give away ownership or control of another hospital.  Nothing else will suffice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300019#R00200","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1624445520,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1624446120,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Insofar as a vote has been called, it is deferred until division time later today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300020#S00100","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna \u00f3 Cheannair\u00ed - Leaders' Questions","time":1624446120,"counter":86,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300020#S00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1624446120,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Last week, the T&aacute;naiste, on his own behalf and presumably on behalf of the Government, made remarks that can only be described as woefully belated in respect of the new national maternity hospital.  It is fair to say that we are now looking at a mess with the fingerprints of successive Governments all over it dating back to 2013, when James Reilly was Minister for Health and Children, which is more than eight years ago.  Yet, to this day a situation persists where women in this State cannot get the care that they and we deserve in a world-class hospital facility.<\/p>  <p>  Why is it that the Government is so late in expressing concerns about ownership of the land on which the hospital is to be built and about the governance model?  It cannot say that it was not told about this.  The level of public concern and, indeed, anger at any involvement by the Sisters of Charity in the governance of the hospital has been very well flagged for many years, as have the very well-founded concerns regarding the ownership of the land on which this hospital is to be located and what this means for the State&rsquo;s substantial investment in the new hospital.  This project is six years behind schedule and costs have escalated, ballooned by more than &euro;500 million in that time.  This project could easily top the &euro;1 billion mark.  Ghosts of the children&rsquo;s hospital, in financial terms, echo through this whole saga.<\/p>  <p>  A Sinn F&eacute;in motion was passed by the D&aacute;il in 2017 and supported by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s party, Fianna F&aacute;il, at the time.  It called for the new national maternity hospital to remain entirely within public ownership with legally guaranteed independence from all non-medical influence in its clinical operations.  That remains the absolute bottom line and is not a matter of preference.<\/p>  <p>  It is now beyond belief that more than &euro;40 million has been invested in respect of a site that is not in the full ownership of the State or that anyone or any Government would countenance investing hundreds of million of euro in public moneys in infrastructure on a site that is not fully owned by the State.  <\/p>  <p>  The Sisters of Charity say that at no stage did any Government or Minister approach them on the subject of purchasing the site in question.  We also know, and they confirm, that the Department of Health did agree in principle to a convoluted process of establishing a private trust with a board not appointed by the Minister and with the State spending hundreds of millions of euro on a hospital on land that it does not own.  <\/p>  <p>  This is a mess that goes way back to former Ministers, James Reilly and Deputies Varadkar and Harris, and it is now unfolding on the watch of the Minister, Deputy Donnelly.  This needs to be urgently sorted.  What does the Taoiseach propose to do on this matter?  It is clear in yesterday evening&rsquo;s statement that the Sisters of Charity are resisting handing over and transferring freehold of the site in question.  They cite governance reasons for that.  That will raise very deep concerns and suspicions as to the full bona fide independence of the hospital.  Where do we go now to secure this hospital in full public ownership?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300020#S00300","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1624446120,"counter":88,"content":"<p>The Deputy has laid out the chronology of the situation on the new national maternity hospital and a new modern facility.  The first prerequisite and objective of Government is to make sure that we can build a hospital that serves the women and children of the nation into the years ahead and that we build a first-class maternity facility with a neonatal facility co-located with a tertiary hospital.  This has been the strategy in the development of maternity hospitals now for quite some time.<\/p>  <p>  That said, there has been a dispute between the two voluntary hospitals involved.  This is well-known and we had the Mulvey report and mediation that the then Government facilitated for the two hospitals.  We are very clear that parallel with ensuring the best of modern care for women in this country in a modern, state-of-the-art maternity facility, there has to be proper State governance and ownership of the hospital itself.  There have been ongoing negotiations.  This Government is in office for 12 months.  The Minister is treating, and will treat, this matter urgently and is engaging in consultations and meetings with the stakeholders involved.<\/p>  <p>  There is an issue around the governance model and in the public interest being represented in respect of that governance.  I do not intend to discuss detailed costs because that is not helpful until we see tenders, and so on.  We cannot be specific about costs and people should not be bandying around hundreds of millions of euro because those are just guesstimates at this stage.  We need more in terms of the public articulation of figures.  The tendering processes, etc., will dictate to a certain extent that reality.  The programme for Government committed this Government to conclude the governance arrangements and to commence the building of the new maternity hospital at St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital Dublin and that is what we intend to do through engagement with the stakeholders.  <\/p>  <p>  However, I am very conscious of the fact that when it comes to the ownership issue, the State is investing here and that it is taxpayer funding that is facilitating the construction of this hospital.  Equally, in the new era that we are in now and as we go forward, as the State invests, the State should own.  <\/p>  <p>  There is a history to this, which predates this Government.  We have to deal with but it involves two voluntary hospitals coming together on a site that is owned by one of the hospitals.  The State has made significant investment in St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital Dublin over the years and continues to invest in both current and capital expenditure in the hospital proper.  The State will fund the construction of the maternity hospital itself in its entirety and that has to be taken on board in respect of agreements and the conclusion of discussions on both the issues around ownership and governance arrangements.  That is the intent of Government as it engages with the stakeholders on this particular issue.<\/p>  <p>  I am deeply conscious and acutely aware of the less than optimal conditions and facilities now obtaining in the current facility and that has been the case for quite a number of years.  That is why there has been a genuine sense to bring this to a conclusion because the women of Ireland deserve better facilities than are currently available in Holles Street.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300020#S00400","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1624446120,"counter":89,"content":"<p>It is not only in the National Maternity Hospital that facilities are suboptimal.

He is right; I could not agree more.  The leverage the Government needs is that, if the group is not willing to gift the land to the State, which it can do without all the connotations of Canon Law it is trying to delineate, we should CPO the entire site.  Who paid for it in the first instance?  As the Taoiseach said earlier, it was the taxpayer.  In a spirit of co-operation and conceding that he inherited this, I ask the Taoiseach whether, given where we are today and the statement yesterday, we should not just CPO the entire site - public, private, maternity - and create one fantastic campus owned by the State, on land owned by the State and run by the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300021#T01200","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1624446720,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I appreciate the sentiments the Deputy articulated and the support he has offered the Government in dealing with this issue.

T&aacute; s&eacute; thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach, aonta&iacute;m leis an Taoiseach, go mbeadh an t-ospid&eacute;al m&aacute;ithreachais neamhsple&aacute;ch ar an eaglais.  Is &iacute; an cheist at&aacute; os comhair na D&aacute;la anois n&aacute; cad a dh&eacute;anfaidh an Taoiseach agus an Rialtas chun an neamhsple&aacute;chas sin a chur chun cinn?<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach mentioned that yesterday&rsquo;s statement came from the board of directors of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  This is not to cast aspersions on anyone but it is to state the facts; the people of Ireland should know who is on the board of directors of that group.  They are James Menton, chair, Dr. David Brophy, Deirdre Burns, John Compton, Gerard Flood, Ann Hargaden, Myles Lee, Sharen McCabe, Dr. Rhona Mahony and Imelda Reynolds.  We need to find out what they are thinking and why they think the way they do.  As I said in the debate on the motion earlier, this is not about the integrated healthcare needs of women and babies; this is about the integrated needs of the investment of that board of directors, and the future, because they hold the privilege of being able to remortgage or sell that land.  That land belongs to the people of Ireland and that hospital should fully belong to the people of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I notice that many Ministers have eulogised the history of the Sisters of Charity in jumping into gaps that were there, and that these gaps just happened in the history of the State.  These gaps were created.  Although the Taoiseach has said that this history predates his Government, which it certainly does, it does not predate his party.  Fianna F&aacute;il were at the heart of the arrangements with the church to provide health and education in this country.  The question for the Taoiseach is a defining one.  Will he ensure that the State will now do what it is supposed to do and take full control of the ownership, ethos and delivery of services of that hospital?  It is not just the idea of ownership and control that matters; it is also ultimately about the accountability of the State to the women and people of Ireland, including the accountability of the Minister, the Taoiseach, the Government and, indeed, future Governments as it is not just about the current one.  Who controls the land matters.  It means that if we get control of the land as a State and a society, we will control the ethos and the business that goes on there, who gets employed there and who runs it.  It is clear, and it has been said time and time again, that the constitution of this group does not prioritise the people of Ireland.  It actually prioritises an ethos that dates back to the era of Mother Mary Aikenhead.<\/p>  <p>  I do not accept that the Sisters of Charity have no interest in this.  The St. Vincent's Holdings group has indicated that it has full interest in this.  The way we see it as a people and as a gender - women who can reproduce in this country - this is a very dangerous move if we do not get full ownership and accountability of the new national maternity hospital that workers are paying for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300022#U01300","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1624447320,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Ar dt&uacute;s, t&aacute;im den tuairim go mbeidh an t-ospid&eacute;al seo neamhsple&aacute;ch ar an eaglais.

That will not be the case, but the Deputy raised an interesting point about ownership.  I will not get into the historic view which she, very simplistically, linked a single party to how the State evolved, and so on.  We can argue that point on another day.  I note people like Paddy Hillery, for example, who developed the first major State education at second level, and comprehensive and community level, and Se&aacute;n Moylan who, years earlier, developed the vocational education committee.  Indeed, there were the free education initiatives of Donogh O'Malley.  People evolve and one cannot telescope the views of today back to earlier decades.  I have a very open view on history but I do not ideologically affix my perspectives on history.  I do not intend to do so now, but I take the point that ownership is important and there should be no remortgaging of this site in the future by the hospital group.  The Government is not satisfied that this should be the case at all.  It is clear and united on that issue.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate the point I made to Deputy Kelly that, as the church exits institutions of this kind, what replaces it should concern us more in terms of governance and who trustees or various companies will represent.  That is a more fundamental point going into the future, given the scale and nature of State investment in the facility.  I am very much of the view that if the State is building something, the State should own it.  This has a history because of the fact that two voluntary hospitals have come together.  The public interest demands that there be co-location; let us be clear about that.  It demands that.  I sometimes ask why it takes so long to build hospitals in this country.  We had the same issue with Tallaght many years earlier, with protracted negotiations.  I was involved in getting the maternity and neonatal unit built in Cork University Hospital.  Thankfully, two State hospitals were merging, and the private hospital agreed to cease operations to facilitate the establishment of one major maternity hospital for that region with a state-of-the-art neonatal facility.  It has taken much longer to get this facility in Dublin up and running.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300022#U01400","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1624447320,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach.

Let us remember Dr. Noel Browne and the struggle he engaged in to get free maternity care for women.<\/p>  <p>  As the church exits, the Taoiseach asked what will replace it and that is a very good question.

The Taoiseach has said he is not in favour of that, yet we are building a national children&rsquo;s hospital with private suites already allocated in it.  We must move away from two-tier medicine.  We need a national health service and I agree entirely with the great socialist, Deputy Alan Kelly, who said the Taoiseach should nationalise the entire St. Vincent&rsquo;s complex.

He is getting those questions today because he still has not clarified his position on the new national maternity hospital.  The decision to locate a State-built and funded, much-needed, modern national maternity hospital without clear clarification as to ownership of the site or governance and ethos of the hospital has resulted in the present mess.  That mess has developed - and here I disagree with the Taoiseach - over the last century because of the role of the State and of vested interests in the way our hospital and health services are run.  Regarding the new national maternity hospital, we face, because of the role of the church and through the Religious Sisters of Charity, what is called a very complex situation.  It has developed into a complex situation and it is an issue we must deal with.<\/p>  <p>  The situation in relation to the new national maternity hospital is a test for the Government and for the people, particularly women, of Ireland.  Are we to have high quality, free to use public services as a right for all in a modern secular republic?  Alternatively, will we have a shabby compromise with the State spending at least &euro;800 million to build a hospital on land we do not own, funding 100% of the cost of staff, the board of governors nominated by a private charity and no certainty that all medical procedures legal in the State will be provided to women who need them?  Rights are exerted, charity is bestowed.  We must move away from this.  I heard what the Taoiseach said before but this is the line we have to get it over.<\/p>  <p>  I know what the preference of the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, is, but the stance the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group outlined yesterday was that it must retain the land to have control of clinical governance for operational reasons, including the provision of a safe, integrated system of care for patients.  If that is the case, the Taoiseach must prepare for CPO of the land.  If he thinks that cannot take place because of cost, length of time or whatever, he must be prepared to move away from that site.  He must make that clear to the Religious Sisters of Charity who he is negotiating with over the coming days.  Seemingly, they have been out of the system since 2017 but now are a key part of it again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300023#V00200","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speech","time":1624447920,"counter":130,"content":"<p>The key motivating factors behind the decision to co-locate the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, with St. Vincent&rsquo;s were safety, optimal healthcare and outcomes for women and babies plus the deteriorating conditions in the existing physical facility of Holles Street.  Those were the key motivating factors in the decision, eventually announced in 2013 after ongoing discussions between the two voluntary hospitals, to co-locate the new national maternity hospital on the St. Vincent's site.<\/p>  <p>  The expert medical view and all international research says that maternity should not be stand-alone.  It is a feature of the improvements in our health service that we locate a maternity hospital adjacent to and integrated with a major national tertiary facility so that if women become ill, have certain conditions and so on, the expertise is on-site to intervene quickly to save lives.  The fundamental motivating public interest in this is to save lies and have better outcomes in circumstances where risks are present.  That does not happen across the vast majority of maternity care but the informed advice and recommendations to successive governments has been to co-locate maternity and neonatals in tertiary hospital settings.  That will apply to Limerick, is in Galway and will have to apply to the Coombe and the Rotunda hospitals as well.<\/p>  <p>  The difficulty here was that this location was on a private hospital group owned by a religious order.  That issue has dragged on since 2013.  First, there was a dispute between the two hospitals as they endeavoured to reach an agreement.  Kieran Mulvey mediated between them and produced a report in 2016.  In 2018, planning permission for a new hospital was secured.  Enabling works were completed thereafter, in terms of a pharmacy and car park.  That is where we are now.<\/p>  <p>  A CPO is easily called for but, coming back to the original objective, if we move off-site, what tertiary hospital do we suggest it should go to?  If we CPO, is everybody in the House prepared to say we will wait another number of years as conditions deteriorate?  These obvious questions arise in the event of a CPO.  We know how long CPOs go on. <\/p>  <p>  That said, the three fundamental points I mentioned that have to be addressed relate to ownership, governance and, without question, the fact that there can be no religious involvement, good, bad or indifferent, in the running of the hospital or in what is allowed there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300023#V00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1624447920,"counter":131,"content":"<p>We all want a safe modern national maternity hospital.

I begin by thanking the former Senator, M&aacute;ire Devine, on the Trojan work she did on this Bill in the last Seanad.  This is a progressive mental health Bill that acknowledges and supports our young people.  It will give autonomy to 16- and 17-year olds and allow them to consent to and avail of appropriate mental health treatment.  This legislation is about destigmatising mental health treatment, something that is alien to any other medical intervention.  Under Irish law, adolescents aged 16 and 17 can currently consent to physical and dental health treatment but do not have the explicit right to consent to mental health treatment.  This Bill will bring parity to youth mental health.<\/p><p>It is also very fitting that we introduce this Bill during Pride Month.  Conversion therapy is not yet prohibited in this State, despite Senator Warfield having introduced the Prohibition of Conversion Therapies Bill 2018.  Lack of political will from successive Governments has seen this Bill stymied.  This is 2021 and so-called conversion therapy has no place in a modern Ireland.  The Bill will close the loophole in legislation that still permits 16- and 17-year-olds to be subjected to conversion therapy against their will.  Currently they do not have the legislative right to refuse this draconian practice.  This Bill will change this.  So-called conversion therapy should have no place in our society.  It is harmful, destructive and has been condemned and discredited worldwide by institutions such as the UN Committee Against Torture, the European Parliament and the Irish Council for Psychotherapy.<\/p><p>We have seen some progressive movements in this country over the years such as the marriage referendum, but we still have some way to go.  Recent homophobic attacks on the Pride flags and other premises have highlighted the need for a fully inclusive society that the vast majority of us hope for.  I spoke about this subject recently and have been subjected to some right-wing bile; I must be doing something right.<\/p><p>That the conversion therapy needs to be legislated against under the area of health is also wrong.  This is a human rights issue, not a health issue and definitely not a mental health issue.  This Bill will simply stop the inhumane practice of forced conversion therapy to 16- and 17-year-olds against their will.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300027#Z01000","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1624450320,"counter":208,"content":"<p>Commendations must go to the previous youth advisory committee of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Mental Health Services which campaigned on this issue during the previous Oireachtas term.  My colleague and former Senator, M&aacute;ire Devine, also worked tirelessly to progress this issue during her time in the Seanad and began this important work that we are now carrying on.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is fundamentally about the rights and protection of young people.  Children aged 16 and 17 years should be presumed to have capacity to consent to or refuse admission and treatment.  This change would be in line with the principle of Article 12 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child - the right to be heard.  This right needs to be expressly stated in mental health legislation, which is what this Bill will do.<\/p>  <p>  The expert group that reviewed of the Mental Health Act 2001 in 2015, the national youth mental health task force in 2017 and over 50 other organisations have called for this legislative change.  The change was also included in the programme for Government.<\/p>  <p>  I understand there may be some difficulties for 16- and 17-year olds if they are suffering with their mental health and might not have the capacity to consent.  It is important to note that this Bill does not take away any existing protections from vulnerable young people.  As we know, capacity legislation has protections for vulnerable adults.  These protections also apply for 16- and 17-year olds.<\/p>  <p>  Young people should not need to wait any longer for this long-recommended change.  It is time we recognised and respected their ability and their capacity, and increased their legislative protections in accessing mental health treatment.<\/p>  <p>  The Mental Health (Capacity to Consent) Bill 2021, above all, and without prejudice, gives a voice to children and gives them an equal opportunity to be heard.

This is further emergency legislation, but it will not deal with the issues in respect of which renters need a break.  We need to close the loophole in regard to the 8% rent increase.  The Bill, as published, does not do that.  It merely extends protections for those who proactively register as financially impacted by Covid-19 and makes exceptions for people experiencing an extreme financial impact.  The numbers registering as being financially impacted are very low, at approximately 475 to date, compared to the thousands of people renting who will not be covered by the Bill and will be subject to the 8% rent increase in rent pressure zones.<\/p>  <p>  Many tenants, especially those living in Dublin, are already paying an average of &euro;2,000 per month.  They cannot afford an 8% increase, which will cost them an extra &euro;160 per month or &euro;1,920 per annum.  This is not feasible or fair and it is not sustainable.  What does the Government propose to do in this regard?  The Labour Party has tabled amendments that seek to freeze rents for tenants up to 2023.  We have also tabled another amendment to address the 8% issue.  We expect the Government will not accept them, but why not?  This is a crisis issue for renters, particularly young people and young people in Dublin.  The Government needs to address these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300028#AA00200","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1624450920,"counter":230,"content":"<p>There are several hundred musicians and performers outside the D&aacute;il as we speak who have come here to protest about the abysmal failure of the Government to engage with them about a roadmap back to work, clarity as to when they can get back to work and their concern about the plans to essentially make them jobseekers.  As I previously told the Taoiseach, the cliff edge for them is a reduction of their pandemic unemployment payments when, as a result of Government measures around public health, they have not been able to work, they have no idea when they will be able to get back to work and potentially they will be forced to identify as jobseekers.

In terms of the well-being framework, I would urge the Government to follow the model of our colleague, the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, who in her deliberations over the rescheduling of the leaving certificate, ensured the students had an equal voice to that of the parents, the teachers, the management and all the stakeholders.

The European Commission is set to reopen its public consultation on reform of the fiscal rules in the coming weeks.  The Commission is widely expected to put forward proposals for simplifying the rules and providing greater incentives for productive investment and changes to debt levels.  These rules are almost 30 years old.  As long as they have been with us so, too, have been calls for their reform.

The Taoiseach will know that, on 12 June, the mackerel quota for this type of hook and line fishing by the fishers of our small coastal communities was reached and this type of fishing was stopped.  This quota is approximately 0.05% of the entire national quota.  I will put this in the perspective of the total quota for the entire country for hook and line mackerel fishing.  The market for mackerel caught in this way, which is the most environmentally friendly way of fishing mackerel, has recently increased.  It is sustainable ecofishing involving no catching of dolphins, whales, turtles or any of the other poor creatures that get caught in the nets of the big factory ships.  One of these big factory ships could use up the entire annual quota available to the hook and line fishers of the entire country in one day.  This industry is of immense benefit to our coastal communities, many of which have shrunk and continue to shrink.  The Taoiseach is going to have to intervene to ensure that benefit is not restricted by this small national quota and that these fishing communities are allowed to thrive.  They have lost the right to fish wild salmon and spurdog and there has been a depletion in crab and lobster.  They need these hook and line fisheries which, I reiterate, are eco-friendly and better for the other species in the sea.

Deputy Lahart's comments on children and young people not having a sufficient voice during the pandemic struck me and resonated with me.  I take his point of view on board very seriously with regard to providing for the expression of their perspectives as we move through the summer and into the autumn period, particularly with regard to the reopening of colleges, further education and third level education.  We are committed to this reopening and to making sure their voices are taken on board.  We are also committed to facilitating young people's return to college and their early vaccination in the third quarter.  Yesterday, the Ark centre, in an innovative initiative, brought children in to communicate with Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and the Oireachtas generally with regard to their perspective on the pandemic.  This was covered on RT&Eacute; yesterday evening.  It was excellent.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Kelly raised the issues affecting the younger generation, young people and renters.  I accept that renters need a break.  The rent protections legislation the Minister is bringing in later is important and should be supported.  It will provide for an extension of the Covid rental provisions for a further six months, until 20 January 2022.  It will also involve the first ever cost-rental units, which will be rented at 25% lower than market rents.  More than 400 such units will be built and occupied before the end of this year.  That is a start.  We need to do far more.  Rent pressure zones are being reviewed and rental supports will be dealt with through new legislation.  The Minister will engage late in the D&aacute;il with the various spokespeople for the different parties.  This is an issue of which I am very conscious, particularly with regard to the increases that are occurring.  We have also had a decline in the number of landlords of approximately 3,000 over the past year, which is problematic in terms of supply in the marketplace.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett raised an issue with regard to musicians and performers.  Again, I would argue that the Government has been very supportive through a range of schemes for artists and musicians in different settings.  The Ministers, Deputies Catherine Martin and Foley, have developed a new initiative in respect of artists-in-residence for schools.  This is a new and significant scheme.  The Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, has engaged with all of the interests involved on an ongoing basis and will continue to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300029#BB00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1624451520,"counter":238,"content":"<p>Why are they outside Leinster House?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300029#BB00400","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1624451520,"counter":239,"content":"<p>Deputy Barry referred to bank profits.  As I said earlier in response to Deputy Paul Murphy, in terms of its original investment, the State realised a cash surplus in divesting its Bank of Ireland shares.  There is no compelling historical evidence, which suggests that State banks do better than private sector banks.  Neither model is perfect by any means.  There are challenges with State banks as well although, to be frank, the percentage being divested is not one that would have resulted in significant influence with regard to bank policy or behaviour.  It is approximately 13.9%.  The Deputy completely exaggerated the impact of the sale of those shares as it pertains to the issue of access to mortgages or other loans.  I do not see the relationship between the number of shares that are to be sold and the issues he raised.<\/p>  <p>  As to the issue of the EU fiscal rules, which has been raised, the Government is engaging with and will be part of that review.  Our submissions and inputs will be there.  The Minister for Finance is the president of the Eurogroup and, given his position at European level, he is acutely aware of developments and movements on that front.  These rules do not put in jeopardy the State's investment plans with regard to the economic recovery fund.  Some of this is to be funded by the next generation funding from Europe, particularly with regard to the green economic recovery and jobs in the green economy and the digital transformation of our society in public as well as private services, towards which the plan provides resources.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the question raised as to the outdoor summer, Dublin city is actually one of the great cities for outdoors parks and facilities.  There has certainly been a lot investment in recent years and over the past 12 months to enhance those parks and public spaces and to provide additional seating and some gym facilities.  I visited quite a number of them during the pandemic in both the most recent and earlier lockdowns and many people are deriving great happiness and satisfaction from the amenities available across Dublin.  One of the city's strengths in comparison with other European cities is its public parks.  Dublin City Council and the various other local authorities are very keen to enhance those facilities.  Government will continue to support those.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to hook and line fisheries, I agree that these are very important.  I met with fishing representatives recently.  I met with all groups on Monday and at the weekend I travelled to Castletownbere and Union Hall to meet the fishers and various interests there.

We also need to ensure that the North-South and east-west structures provided for in the Good Friday Agreement meet regularly, with a full complement of Ministers if appropriate.

Is iad sin na h&aacute;bhair a bhfuil muintir an Tuaiscirt buartha f&uacute;thu ag an tr&aacute;th seo.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Haughey for his insightful comments.  I believe the potential of the Good Friday institutions, and particularly the North-South dimension of the Good Friday Agreement, needs to be fully realised and developed.  The New Decade, New Approach agreement in particular offers a pathway to realising some of that.  In the context of the shared island initiative, we have ring-fenced funding of approximately &euro;500 million, of which we have already allocated approximately &euro;13 million to the Ulster Canal, as well as funding for the Sligo-Enniskillen greenway.  There will be other projects, particularly in terms of an all-island research initiative, facilitating collaboration on issues of mutual benefit to everyone living on the island, between third level institutions North and South.  I am hopeful that we can develop an east-west dimension to that as well in respect of the research agenda.  There will be other infrastructural projects that we will be pursuing also.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct in saying that the agreements that have been reached should be honoured and that is also in respect of the Irish language.  I have never been one to weaponise the Irish language.  I have taught Irish and I think people want to speak Irish go n&aacute;d&uacute;rtha chun taitneamh a bhaint as.  T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeidh an t-atmaisf&eacute;ar ceart &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de sa Tuaisceart ar gach taobh.  Molaim go deo an m&eacute;id oibre at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag Linda Ervine, mar shampla, i mB&eacute;al Feirste agus an dul chun cinn at&aacute; d&eacute;anta aici chun an Ghaeilge a chur ar f&aacute;il do dhaoine sna d&uacute;ich&iacute; sin.<\/p>  <p>  The dialogues as part of the shared island initiative have been important and the Deputy is absolutely correct in articulating the primacy of dialogue in respect of Northern Ireland and in terms of creating space to allow progress to be made in fulfilling the Good Friday Agreement and the New Decade, New Approach commitments.  That is particularly important and, with the election of a new leader, the formal process of which will be concluded at the weekend, it is very important that we create space around the issues that matter.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Haughey spoke about the changing nature of politics and the alignments in politics in Northern Ireland.  That change is actually happening.  My sense is that many people in Northern Ireland are concerned about bread and butter issues.  It seems the biggest issue in the North at the moment is the restoration of health services.  People there need to get timely access to health procedures, diagnostics and treatments, no more than in the Republic, and politics should reflect those basic concerns.  Likewise, the development of integrated education is something that should be advanced and promoted within Northern Ireland.  There is an emerging and growing middle ground which has different perspectives on the future.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose and objective of the shared island initiative is to give a platform to new voices in terms of how the island should evolve into the future and how we should share this island together.  Seamus Mallon put it memorably at the launch of his book when he said that his neighbour's family had been living next door to his homestead for around 400 years and maybe it was about time that they learned how to share that spot of ground together.  It is in that spirit that the shared island dialogue is there to allow new voices, the new Irish about whom we spoke earlier, and find out what their perspective is.  I refer to giving greater voice to young people, and women in particular.  In various phases of the journey that Northern Ireland has been on through the past 30 years, it has been the voice of women that has been strongest in terms of the attainment of peace and the struggle to get peace back onto the streets of Northern Ireland.  Inclusivity is absolutely important in terms of that broader agenda.<\/p>  <p>  The protocol has created challenges and Brexit has created challenges.  Of that, there is no doubt.  That, in itself, will have an impact but I stress the importance of the British Government working with the European Union in a willing way to find a resolution to the protocol issue, creatively looking at the potential of a sanitary and phytosanitary measures agreement between Britain and Europe which would take out nearly 80% of the checks that potentially are involved.  I refer to identifying the benefits that can accrue from the protocol in respect of foreign direct investment finding its way into Northern Ireland.  The fact that the North will have access to the EU Single Market as well as the UK market creates opportunities.  There is the fact that the all-island market creates opportunities in terms of the dairy industry.  To pick one example, Ulster farmers sell their milk through co-ops into co-ops in the Republic.  It is an important industry.  It is now seamless across the island because of the presence of the protocol and the absence of any border or checks on the island of Ireland and that helps the dynamic in terms of the economy.<\/p>  <p>  That said, we have to be conscious that there are issues that need to be resolved and ironed out.  The trade between Northern Ireland and the UK is very important trade both ways and, therefore, there are mechanisms within the Trade and Co-operation Agreement between the UK and Europe to facilitate that, such as the joint committee especially and the specialised committees.<\/p> <p>The process between Maro&scaron; &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d and David Frost should be utilised fully to iron out those difficulties.

It is really the essence of the circular economy.  There are 34 live end-of-waste applications with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, at this time.  Unfortunately, there is a huge backlog.  Only one decision on an end-of-waste application was made in 2020 and four such decisions were made in 2019.  Given there are 34 live applications, it is clear there will be a significant timeframe before they are assessed.  The difficulty with that is there are companies waiting for their applications to be assessed.  I am aware that a number of companies are considering moving to Northern Ireland because they can get the same application assessed there in six months.

One is by way of a proper retrofitting programme, such as the warmer homes schemes, which allows old dwellings to be made more efficient in terms of loss of heat and energy usage.  At the moment, there is a huge backlog in that scheme because of the lack of available workers with the skills to do the work.  The second way is by people being given the opportunity and chance to work from home, thereby cutting down on commuting.

There is a simple measure that could be taken to address this and I ask the Taoiseach to look into it.  I put the same request to the T&aacute;naiste last week.  There is an ultraviolet treatment facility at Ringsend that is only being used three months per year, for the swimming season.

These reports highlight fatal flaws in the Government's climate policy and, indeed, the climate Bill.  It is Government policy, apparently, not to support the importation of fracked gas, but it refuses to legislate to ban LNG projects, saying we have to wait for the European Union to take a stand.

I will engage with the Minister in that regard.  We met recently with the environmental and social pillar.  We are broadening and expanding social dialogue.  In that context, we met with the environmental and social pillar.  We heard a good presentation on the circular economy from the NGO group.  I will engage with the Minister on making sure that we can progress more speedily the end-of-waste approval process.<\/p>  <p>  On Deputy Farrell's point regarding a clear roadmap ahead, the Government's economic recovery plan has been very clear in its emphasis and focus on public transport, a national retrofitting programme, biodiversity investment, particularly the all-Ireland pollinator plan, and across the board development of greenways.  There has been a dramatic increase in investment under this Government.  We will transform this country in terms of active travel.  There is no doubt about it.  Some of the funding for that will come from the carbon tax fund, which will help us to protect against fuel poverty, facilitate environmental farming schemes and to deliver to the national retrofitting programme.  The programme will help many people in respect of fuel poverty and in reducing dramatically their heating emissions.  It will take time but the carbon tax is an important part of that.  I know the Deputy's party opposes that, but I would ask that it be reflected upon.  People have aspirations for climate change, but ring-fenced funding is needed to enable step change in investments and retrofitting, public transport, active travel and the biodiversity agenda.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Sullivan rightly said that the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 will probably be the most significant legislation passed by this Oireachtas, and in the fullness of time, will be seen as such.  It will entail challenges in implementation, but it represents a fundamental and profound step change in legislation.  <\/p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy on the retrofitting agenda.  Part of the recovery plan is not just the allocation of funding through the carbon tax fund to retrofitting, but also the allocation of additional funding for reskilling and upskilling and providing additional places so that the skills are there to step up retrofitting activity.  Where a house is retrofitted, it provides enormous savings to the householder.  The issue of working from home and the technology and broadband provision is essential to facilitating that.  That will also have a very significant impact on our climate change agenda and targets.<\/p>  <p>  I do not disagree with what Deputy Boyd Barrett said regarding Dublin Bay.  I will engage with the Minister on the Ringsend treatment plant and the ultraviolet treatment system.  The Deputy said that it is only used for three months of the year.

Many people swim all year round.<\/p>  <p>  On Deputy Murphy's point regarding Amazon, I have not seen the programme to which he referred.  Amazon is building a fulfilment centre in Ireland in Dublin, which will create a significant number of jobs for many people.  That cannot be ignored either in the context of that investment in Dublin by Amazon.  Surely, it is in Amazon's interest, as it is in everybody' interest, to reduce waste and damage to products.  I have not seen the programme so I cannot comment accurately in on the points the Deputy made, other than to say that economies evolve and develop.  Amazon has grown and expanded.  The fulfilment centre in Dublin will create additional jobs for people in our city.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300032#EE00100","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1624453320,"counter":273,"content":"<p>Jobs cleaning up the mess.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300032#EE00200","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1624453320,"counter":274,"content":"<p>It will create jobs.

I thank the Chief Whip, the Minister of State, Deputy Jack Chambers, the members of the Business Committee and, in particular, the members of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage for enabling the Residential Tenancies (No.2) Bill to be read a Second Time here today.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is a further timely and proportionate response to the continuing threat and impact of the pandemic, particularly for the most vulnerable tenants.  The need for additional legislation and the time-sensitive nature of the Bill are an inevitable consequence of balancing the constant reassessment of the pandemic and legal requirements.  I thank Deputies for facilitating the Bill's passage in the same co-operative spirit that has enabled the swift passage of similar emergency Bills since Covid-19 erupted.  This is the fifth Bill that the Government has introduced to protect tenants during the pandemic since coming to office last June.  The virus has mutated and challenged us in different ways but we have responded to ensure the vulnerable are shielded from the unprecedented economic fallout.<\/p>  <p>  Today's Bill is a further important action to safeguard tenants in the face of an enduring pandemic.  In light of the prolonged challenges facing the most vulnerable tenants, I am asking Deputies to pass this Bill, enable its early enactment and provide technical amendments to the Planning and Development, and Residential Tendencies Act 2020, PDRTA, to extend the application of its enhanced, targeted and much-needed tenancy protections for a further six months, from 13 July 2021 to 12 January 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will also provide for some permanent amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, some of which I flagged several weeks ago.  The first is to restrict any upfront payment in respect of any deposit or advance rent required to secure a tenancy to a total value that does not exceed two months' rent and to restrict any ongoing advance rent payment to cover the forthcoming month only.  Other objectives are to provide an opt-out regarding the upfront rent payment restrictions for students residing in student-specific accommodation, should they wish to avail of it, and to require a student residing in student-specific accommodation to provide a minimum termination notice of 28 days to the accommodation provider or provide notice of a longer period should he or she wish to do so.  The last two requirements emerged specifically from our work and that of Opposition Members with the Union of Students in Ireland and other student representative groups.  I wanted to introduce these measures sooner than we had originally planned so they could take effect in the new academic year.<\/p>  <p>  Subject to the conditions of the procedural requirements, the PDRTA currently protects tenants in rent arrears due to Covid-19 and at risk of losing their tenancy from eviction and rent increases during the period 11 January 2021 to 12 July 2021.  It is considered that the ongoing threats and impacts of Covid-19 and its emerging variants require this Bill to extend protections for a further six months, until 12 January 2022.  This six-month extension is a proportionate response, balancing constitutional property rights and the common good and extending protections for those tenants who need it most.  While the number directly invoking enhanced tenancy protections has been relatively small, with 475 tenants having made the necessary self-declaration between August 2020 and May 2021, the emergency rental measures have provided a strong safety net to vulnerable tenants and, importantly, send a clear signal to the rental system that the State is and will continue to protect tenants.  In this context, and because of strong direct financial supports, we have prevented turmoil in the rental sector.<\/p> <p>Approximately 1% of all tenants have been issued with rent arrears warnings since last August.  This means that 99% of tenants are meeting their rent or, indeed, are benefiting from State supports.<\/p> <p> Crucially, I reiterate that State supports are available for renters, including the pandemic unemployment payment and the rent supplement and supplementary welfare allowances, including the exceptional needs payments.  I encourage anyone struggling with rent to avail of these protections which are available through this legal mechanism and, indeed, through the direct State supports.<\/p> <p> It is important to note that these protections are separate and distinct from those under the Residential Tenancies Act 2020 which provides for a moratorium on all evictions taking place, with limited exceptions, during a period of a 5 km travel restriction in an area specified by the regulations made by the Minister for Health, and during the ten days following the lifting of such restrictions.  Those important restrictions would again kick in for tenants in any area should the 5 km travel restriction be needed again which, I know, all of us hope will never be required again.  I do not expect that this scenario will arise again but the safety net is indeed in place if it is needed.<\/p> <p> In broad terms the protections under this Bill apply on foot of the economic fallout of the pandemic while the 2020 Act addresses the public health issues.<\/p> <p> As was previously stated, significant and enhanced State income supports continue to be available from the Department of Social Protection.  I encourage any tenant who needs assistance to reach out early to the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service and to seek every available State income support.<\/p> <p> Overall, the State through this Government has spent &euro;12 billion in Covid-19 welfare supports, and rightly so.  The Government has not been and will not be found wanting in supporting any tenant in difficulty.  It is important that landlords continue to show forbearance and afford tenants the time to stabilise their income through State support if necessary.  It is in the interests of both parties to sustain a viable tenancy.  According to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, 80% of tenants enjoy a good relationship with their landlord and the strong interaction has helped us to endure the challenges presented by Covid-19 over the past year.<\/p> <p> The Government and I recognise that 70% of landlords own just one rental property and 86% of landlords own just one or two such properties.  Covid-19 has also brought some financial difficulty, in particular, for individual landlords.  This Bill again aims to strike a balance between the rights and obligations of tenants and landlords in a very carefully calibrated manner which recognises the legitimate interests of both.  This achieves an equilibrium between the property rights and the common good in the midst of the pandemic.<\/p> <p> We have to and will address the economic and social consequences of Covid-19, protect as many jobs as possible, and ensure that families and businesses can manage financially.  The economic consequences of the pandemic are far-reaching but the hit for certain sectors and for some tenants has been immensely challenging.  The emergency measures introduced by this Government have prevented systemic problems in the rental sector.  The rental measures proposed under this Bill can once again help further.  <\/p> <p> On other permanent protections under this Bill, and as part of my continuing reform of tenancy and rental legislation, during the Second Stage debate on the Private Members&rsquo; Bill, the Residential Tenancies (Student Rents and Other Protections) (Covid-19) Bill 2021, which I did not oppose, I advised that impending rental reforms to restrict the level of upfront payments by tenants in respect of deposits and advance rent would equally apply to and benefit students residing in student-specific accommodation.  The measures that I have brought forward in this Bill apply across the board and to all tenants, including students.  These measures were originally intended to be included in the general scheme of the Residential Tenancies Bill but are now included in this Bill to benefit students and other tenants as soon as possible, and, in any event and in particular, before the commencement of the new academic year this autumn.  <\/p> <p> It is proposed to provide that students residing in student-specific accommodation may choose to pay larger upfront rent payments than are legally required under the Bill if it suits them better but there will be no obligation to do so.  It also restricts the total amount that any tenant can be obliged to pay to a landlord by way of a deposit or advance rent payment to secure a tenancy to no more than the equivalent of two months&rsquo; rent.  This has been put on a statutory legislative footing in this legislation.  The measures in this Bill will greatly reduce any financial exposure of tenants, including students, on foot of paying much restricted upfront payments and this is a very significant change.  I welcome the input of other Members in this House and, as I said earlier, the input of student groups in particular on this issue and commend them for their engagement.<\/p> <p> I will outline briefly now the main provisions of this Bill.  The Long Title and recitals of this Bill describe our policy aims and the context in which the targeted restrictions on landlords and constitutionally protected property rights will serve the social common good for six more months up to 12 January 2022.<\/p> <p> I will briefly outline now the purposes of the provisions of the Bill.  Sections 1 and 12 contain standard provisions dealing with definitions, Title and collective citation of the Bill.  Section 2 provides for a number of amendments to the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act, PDRTA, by updating various dates to reflect the extension under the Bill of the emergency period out to 12 January 2022.  The proposed amendments to the PDRTA provide, subject to conditions and procedural requirements under the Act, for its enhanced tenancy protections to continue to apply from 13 July 2021 to 12 July 2022, where tenants have been economic impacted by Covid-19 and are consequently unable to meet their obligations to pay rent and risk tenancy termination.  Rent increases and tenancy terminations will be prohibited for tenants who are protected by the PDRTA until 12 January 2022, when this Bill is enacted.<\/p> <p> Section 3 is intended to remove, in the context of student-specific accommodation, the legal possibility of tenancy agreements requiring a termination notice period of a greater length than those provided under Table 1 of section 66 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, the 2004 Act, for landlords other than the minimum 28 days' notice required to be given by students.  This is another significant change.<\/p> <p> Section 4 amends section 16 of the 2004 Act to provide a new reference to a deposit that a tenant may be obliged to pay.  Section 5 inserts a new section 19B into the into the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to restrict the total amount that anyone can be obliged to pay to a landlord or by way of deposit or advance rent payment to secure a tenancy of no more than the equivalent of two months' rent.  A restriction of the equivalent of one month's rent is also placed on the amount that a tenant is obliged to pay as a regular advance rent payment to a landlord during the course of that tenancy.  Provision is made for a student residing in student accommodation to choose to pay a greater amount of advance rent if he or she wishes to do so.  Section 5 will apply to tenancies created no earlier than one month after the passing of the Bill.<\/p> <p> Sections 6 and 7 are technical amendments to reflect that student-specific accommodation falls within the remit of the Residential Tenancies Act.  Section 8 provides that a student can provide more than a 28 days' termination period to a student-specific accommodation provider if they wish to do so.<\/p> <p> Section 9 proposes to require a student residing in student-specific accommodation to provide a minimum of 28 days' termination notice to the accommodation provider or provide a longer period of notice only should he or she wish to do so.  Section 10 is a technical amendment to provide that a dispute can be referred to the Residential Tenancies Board regarding a landlord&rsquo;s compliance with the new restrictions on the total amount that anyone can be obliged to pay in respect of a deposit or an advance rent payment to secure tenancy.<\/p> <p> Section 11 is, again, a technical amendment to extend the list of improper conduct by a landlord which can be sanctioned by the RTB to include the seeking by a landlord of a payment to her or him of an amount or amounts that contravene the provisions of section 19B in respect of the total amount that anyone can be obliged to pay a landlord in respect of a deposit or an advance rent payment.<\/p> <p> In conclusion, this Bill, like the previous Acts, is being introduced against the backdrop of the worst public health crisis in the history of our State and an economic collapse without compare.  The virus continues to cost us so much and to demand strong responses.  We need to continue to adhere to the public health advice and to avail of the vaccines on offer to ensure that the variants of concern do not undo all of the sacrifices that our people have made to date.  The Government and I will continue to do whatever it takes to protect our State and our citizens from the worst impact of the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>As legislators, we have shown how we can work together to react quickly to suppress the spread of Covid-19.<\/p> <p> In that spirit, I again ask for Deputies' co-operation in regard to the Bill.  I know they appreciate the negative impacts that Covid-19 has had and is having on many citizens.  The Bill aims to help the most vulnerable tenants through to next year and to help all tenants in restricting the payments required of them into the future for deposits and advance rent to secure a tenancy.  The Government and I are following through on commitments made to introduce further protections for tenants, including students, by restricting the scale of advance payments required of them.  This is the fifth item of tenancy legislation I have introduced on behalf of the Government and there will be more to come in the autumn, as I mentioned when we debated the Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members' Bill a number of months ago.<\/p> <p> The Bill before us is timely and urgent.  I have included the provisions on student rents, in particular, to ensure these measures will be passed before the summer recess and can take effect in the new academic year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300033#LL00200","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624454820,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies Quinlivan and Mitchell.<\/p>  <p>  In some senses, this is a Bill of two parts.  Part of it is very welcome, namely, that relating to the new protections for all tenants, as the Minister outlined.  That is included as a result of the strong campaign by the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, and the cross-party Opposition Private Members' Bill on that matter, tabled during Sinn F&eacute;in's time, which I will return to in a moment.  Nevertheless, as I said on the previous occasion the Minister brought forward an extension of the very limited and restrictive Covid-19 protections from the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act, it is disappointing he still does not accept that there is a larger group of tenants than those he has currently protected who need assistance, another matter I will expand on in a moment.<\/p>  <p>  I will deal separately with the two parts of the Bill.  The USI some months ago approached both the Minister and the Opposition party housing spokespersons and urged us to act.  The situation whereby students can be often forced to pay three, six or nine months' rent in advance was exposed for its flaws when many of those students and their families were unable to recoup that money when they were unable to take up student accommodation because of Covid-19 restrictions last year.  The fact that the Opposition united around that USI campaign, tabled the legislation we did and secured the full support of the House, and the Minister, to his credit, has fast-tracked key elements of that legislation in the Bill before us, shows the case the USI was making was not only eminently fair but needed to be acted on urgently.  That the Minister is today introducing those key protections for all renters, as he outlined, is very welcome.  No renter in future will be asked for more than one month's rent and one month's deposit in advance, and no student will be left unable to recoup more than 28 days' rent if the student-specific tenancy has to be terminated early.  They are very welcome measures, and while the Minister and I have many disagreements, one of which we are about to have in the context of this debate, I give him credit where it is due that he is bringing them forward.<\/p>  <p>  I have two concerns with the provisions before the House and ask the Minister to examine them urgently.  With respect to the provision regarding one month's rent and one month's deposit, a tenant can make a complaint that the landlord is not complying with that new rule only if the tenant takes up the tenancy.  If he or she does not or cannot do so, there will be no ability for the Residential Tenancies Board to investigate that independently because there will be no tenant's complaint.  I ask the Minister to reconsider that matter when he comes forward with the residential tenancies amending Bill in the autumn.<\/p>  <p>  I am even more concerned by the opt-out that, as presented by the Minister, would allow a student voluntarily to pay more than one month's rent and one month's deposit in advance.  I understand from briefings his officials gave to members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage that there is a very specific reason for that, namely, that international students often pay for a comprehensive package of tuition, materials and accommodation from universities here.  That is fully understandable and those students clearly should be exempt from these provisions.  I also understand the Minister's officials are working on further amendments to the Bill they will bring forward in the autumn.<\/p>  <p>  My worry is that between now and the introduction of those amendments, there could be some unscrupulous student-specific landlords, possibly in the private sector, who will try to apply informal pressure on students chasing much-needed student accommodation to \"voluntarily\" pay more than the required sum.  I urge both the Minister and the Residential Tenancies Board to be vigilant on this matter.  I have spoken to the USI and it is going to highlight the need for vigilance.  If any student-specific accommodation provider tries to exert that type of pressure - I hope none will - I would like to think the full force of the Residential Tenancies Board, as well as condemnation from the Government and the Opposition, will be brought to bear in order that students will be fully protected until that matter is resolved when further amendments are tabled in the autumn.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to the extension of the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act protections for what the Minister calls the most vulnerable of those affected by Covid-19, he will know from the most recent Residential Tenancies Board data that only 475 renters of 200,000 rental tenancies not accessing supports such as housing assistance payment, HAP, or the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, have availed of that protection.  He will also know that since he ended the blanket protection on evictions and notices to quit in August last, almost 4,000 rent warning letters have been issued from landlords to tenants who have fallen into arrears.  During that same period, accelerating particularly in the past three months, 1,122 notices to quit have been issued, not solely for rent arrears but also for other matters.<\/p>  <p>  The problem with this protection the Minister is extending, welcome and all as it is for those who can avail of it, is that many vulnerable tenants, including those affected by Covid, do not fit the criteria for this protection and will be excluded.  The process is incredibly complex and cumbersome, which leads many of us, not just in the Opposition but also in organisations such as Threshold, to believe there are tenants who would qualify for this protection but, for a variety of reasons, cannot or will not avail of it.<\/p>  <p>  My main concern, judging by the Residential Tenancies Board figures, is that now that the level 5 restriction on evictions relating to the 5 km travel limit has been lifted since 22 April, those 1,122 notices to quit will start working their way through the system, and there could be a slow, steady and deeply unfortunate increase in the number not only of evictions but also of presentations and entries into emergency accommodation.  I urge the Minister to reconsider expanding those protections to ensure that anybody affected by Covid, irrespective of whether they are getting a Covid-19 payment or whether they have submitted a written declaration, will get Covid-19 protections, at a minimum, until the end of this year from both rent increases and notices to quit.  I have spoken to many tenants throughout the country who have asked me to convey this to the Minister, and I urge him to examine it.<\/p>  <p>  It is also disappointing that the Bill does not deal with the 8% rent increases that were always possible under the original rent pressure zone legislation but are particularly relevant now because many landlords will not have increased last year, for a variety of reasons.  Moreover, tenants, particularly since the ban on evictions was lifted on 27 April, are being hit with two years' rent increases rolled into one.  An increase of 4% a year is bad enough but 8% is unconscionable, and I thought this would have been the time to do that.  Again, I urge the Minister to support, or at least consider, the amendments I have tabled to achieve that.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in will not oppose the Bill.  We support all its provisions, although we are disappointed by the limited nature of the Covid-19 protections.  The broader point has to be made that there remains a crisis in the private rented sector.  Rents are still much too high for far too many renters.  There have been very dramatic rent increases in recent months outside of Dublin and in areas that traditionally had lower levels of rent.  Therefore, not only does Sinn F&eacute;in strongly believe that for Covid-19 reasons there should be a ban on evictions and notices to quit until the end of the year for all tenants other than those breaching contract and wilfully not paying rent when they are able to do so, we still believe there is a need for an emergency three-year ban on rent increases.  Renters simply cannot take any more.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to find a way of reducing rents.  We have found that the simplest and quickest way to do that is through a refundable tax credit worth one month's rent.<\/p> <p>This was something which was supported by Fianna F&aacute;il, albeit in a more limited form, during last year's general election campaign.  We urge the Minister to revisit that in the context of budget 2022 in October.  We also need to see an urgent move to tenancies of indefinite duration.  I appeal to the Minister, when he brings forward his legislation in the autumn, to introduce real tenancies of indefinite duration.  That would mean ending the six-year cut-off point for Part 4 tenancies and, crucially, removing most grounds currently contained in section 34 of the Residential Tenancies Act, so that the only grounds upon which a tenant could be served a notice to quit would be for breach of contract, non-payment of rent, damage of property or anti-social behaviour, etc.  All of the other section 34 grounds - sale of property, use by landlord, use by family member - have no place in a modern rental system and must be phased out.<\/p> <p> I appeal to the Minister to do far more in terms of the level of investment in genuinely affordable cost-rental accommodation.  A few hundred units per year will not cut it.  We need to see thousands and thousands of genuinely affordable cost-rental units delivered annually by local authorities, approved housing bodies and others, each year starting from next year.  While the cost-rental equity loan is welcome, it is far too small.  The 390 units it will provide this year and next year are welcome, but the scheme is too limited.  We need much more ambition.  I look forward to what the Minister has to say on that come budget day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300035#NN00200","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624455420,"counter":286,"content":"<p>There is no doubt that the lives of our student population have been upended because of the pandemic.  I do not need to tell the Minister that.  However, people in third level institutions have adapted to the changed environment and course work has been completed online.  The third level experience is both an academic learning experience and a social development opportunity for our young people.  Unfortunately, over the last three years they have been deprived of the social learning experiences which the campus site has to offer.  For many students, it is their first time living away from home, having to pay bills and making individual choices on their future.<\/p><p>In Limerick, the city is not the same without the students and we look forward to welcoming them back as soon as we can.  People come from far and wide to attend the third level institutions in Limerick, of which we have many.  They are very good quality institutions.  Students are mainly renters and to date they have been treated differently from other renters.  They have been forced to pay deposits far higher than the amount a non-student renter pays.  If such a student needs to leave the rental accommodation within the notice period, the penalties are restrictive.  The Bill is welcome in so far as it sets out that the practices of charging excessive deposits and imposing long notice periods will end.  The deposits and upfront payments applied to student renters were always excessive, but the Covid-19 pandemic has brought to the fore the economic challenges they and their parents face.  Many of these students come from families who have been dependent on the PUP or temporary wage subsidy scheme for the last year.  While State support was, and is, very welcome, it is not enough to allow for the running of a family home or to meet the demands of upfront rent payments and deposits on students and their families.  Students deserve much more.  They deserve to be treated similarly to other renters and this Bill goes some way towards addressing that issue.  The inclusion of the proposed new section 19B is very welcome.  It provides that renters will no longer be required to pay an advance payment that is in excess of the amount of rent payable for a period of one month under the tenancy agreement, with a similar provision for the payment of a deposit.  The inclusion of this section will put all potential renters on a similar footing and will alleviate some of the economic challenges faced by parents in sending a son or daughter to third level education.  This will go some way in alleviating some of the pressures renters face, but more needs to be done.<\/p><p>The simple fact of the matter is that rents, in general, are far too high.  The rental system is broken and rents are far too high for many of those in need of accommodation.  Earlier, I referred to the third level institutions in Limerick, one of which is the University of Limerick, located in the Castletroy area of the city.  As we know now, during the third level off season, we have seen a decrease in rental prices in the area but they are still very high.  A quick glance at <i>daft.ie<\/i>shows that a two-bedroom house in Cois Ghr&uacute;da, Castletroy, is &euro;1,300 per month.  This seems to be the standard cost of rent in Limerick with a two-bedroom house in Dooradoyle, on the other side of the city, costing the same amount.  Having to pay this type of rent is extremely difficult for anyone, but particularly for a single person who is paying rent while saving for a house.  While the amendment to the 2004 Act is welcome, more needs to be done to support people in rental accommodation.  A plan is needed to reduce rent, to protect renters and to provide a pathway towards ending the crisis in the private rental sector.  Without this, we will be perpetuating the rental crisis and condemning families to homelessness.  Housing must be affordable, but for many renters and perspective buyers it is not.  In Limerick, we see the cruel situation of many people who are caught in the middle and are shut out.  They cannot avail of social housing because they earn just above the income threshold limit, and they cannot get a mortgage.  Even if they can, it is for an amount that is far less than the actual cost of homes in the city.<\/p><p>In Limerick, we have more than 2,000 people on the housing waiting list.  We have generations of the same family living in the same house, often small terrace houses, with few prospects of moving.  The situation has to change.  It is not fair on the younger generations who need independence of living outside the family home, and it is not fair on their parents.  Rent is 44% higher than it was in 2016.  In Limerick, there was a 6.3% increase in rent prices from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the same quarter of 2020.  While I welcome and support this Bill, there remains much more to do.  If we are to deliver for a generation of renters, we must deliver social and affordable housing - housing that is truly affordable.  We must give this generation the hope that they can aspire to own their own home.  We need the Minister to step up.  We need further action in the area of the rental market and we must see the delivery of affordable and social housing.<\/p><p>In their efforts to obtain a home, the odds are stacked against generation rent.  For many people, the challenge is even greater.  A single person who wants to buy a house can forget about it.  A single parent who wants to purchase a house sees hopeless ambition.  Indeed, couples with two incomes and no dependants struggle to get a foothold on the property ladder.  Today is a good step for some renters but so much more needs to be done if we are to rescue a generation from the pressures of the housing crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300036#OO00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1624455420,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I will share my time with Deputy Conway-Walsh.  I will begin by saying that those of us in Sinn F&eacute;in will support this Bill.  The latest Residential Tenancies Board report has shown that 1,100 notices to quit were issued despite a ban being in place.  Sinn F&eacute;in has repeatedly called on the Minister to ban evictions and to halt rent increases.  Rents are crippling people and they are robbing the majority of renters of their income.

I think the Minister will agree with me that they are eye-watering amounts.  How are young families or workers expected to afford these rental prices while they are trying to save for a home of their own, or trying to put food on the table or clothes on their backs?  Rents need to be going down, not up.  I cannot stress enough that we need more action from the Minister.  Rents need to be frozen and brought down, and we need to put a halt on evictions.

That is just plain wrong.<\/p>  <p> The Minister spoke about available payments and supports, such as the PUP, but the fact is that for the student population those supports will not be there from September.  Will he ask the Minister, Deputy Harris, to intervene because he seems to be turning a deaf ear to this?  Every time I ask him about fairness in regard to PUP payments for students, he pretends not to hear me.  Many students are excluded from the Student Universal Support Ireland grant just because they availed of the PUP.  That is having a knock-on effect on accommodation and what students can afford.

The rental sector was in crisis before the pandemic and that has been in some ways suspended and in others compounded by the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  We will support the Bill, although we feel elements of it could have been improved.  We ask the Minister to look at that on Report Stage, although I imagine that is unlikely.  The protections required need to look beyond this summer and take a longer term view.  Our legislation needs to be robust enough and take a sufficiently long view of the reality that the rental crisis will explode once this pandemic lifts.  The protection of renters and banning of evictions are key to tackling the homeless crisis and everything we have experienced, cumulatively building up over the last decade.  Maintaining the eviction ban when it worked at the beginning of the pandemic was a good thing.  However, this Bill does not propose that.  The original protections have been diminished and stripped away, which is difficult to stand over.  While Government spin is that it is taking drastic action to safeguard renters during a pandemic, it has done the bare minimum every time.  Each successive Bill it places before the D&aacute;il further erodes the protections put in place.<\/p>  <p>  The pandemic has not only affected the rental sector.  It has impacted on many other sectors, including construction.  Whatever building was in the works to provide housing, particularly the small amount of public and social housing that was due, has been further delayed.  This lag will be extended into next year.  People in private residential tenancies hoping to transition - and it is a small hope - to affordable housing, local authority housing or housing through an approved housing body need to be accounted for.  For the sake of simplicity and the security of renters, they should be safeguarded until at least the end of 2022, to account for the construction sector lag.<\/p>  <p>  Figures from the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, showed 1,100 households that were renting were given eviction notice over the last ten months, despite the Government ban being in place.  This highlights that we need a comprehensive renter strategy.  What was put in place certainly did not work for 1,100 households.  I, like many in opposition and, I imagine, even the Minister, have dealt with households that have received tenancy eviction notice over the last year.<\/p>  <p>  Rents in Ireland have significantly increased in recent years.  The statistics around that are eye-watering.  Despite this, no-fault evictions are still allowed.  The figures from the RTB show it is back to business as usual for landlords who choose to treat their tenants poorly.  We need greater security of tenure.  The figures show that for 73% of people evicted from their home in a pandemic, it was through no fault of their own.  It is unfair, inhumane and points to a systemic failure to treat renters as equal citizens in our housing system.<\/p>  <p>  The patchwork effort by Government over the last year has not helped renters to the degree it should have and is symptomatic of an ongoing failure to address the core problems of soaring rents and lack of security of tenure.  Limiting evictions has a direct impact on people entering homelessness and it is incredible that stronger measures were not put in place.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s latest Bill to protect renters will not stop the 8% rent rises a loophole in the law will allow.  The system is inherently cumbersome and complex with people self-selecting as being financially impacted, rather than the Government carrying out a thorough assessment of the state of play for renters.  The numbers registering as being financially impacted are ridiculously low at 475, as this is a self-declare process.  The system is cumbersome and does not give protection to the vast majority of renters impacted by this pandemic.  This means the vast majority of renters, approximately 200,000, face this 8% increase.  In allowing the increase, the Government shows it ultimately has little regard for renters.  To call this an oversight is an understatement; it is a dereliction of duty and responsibility to those people living in rented accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  In areas of Dublin where people pay, on average, &euro;2,000 per month, the increase will work out at approximately &euro;160 per month or &euro;1,920 per year.  These are astronomical figures.  We are in danger sometimes of becoming desensitised to them because they are repeated so often in debates in this Chamber but for people on low and middle incomes, these are huge amounts of money.  It impacts on bills, school clothes and books, light, heat and, ultimately, people&rsquo;s ability to keep that roof over their head.  It is unfeasible and unfair.<\/p>  <p>  The housing system is not working for renters and we need a comprehensive strategy.  The Labour Party wants to see an approach that protects renters through greater security of tenure, a short-term rent freeze and a State-led approach to building more affordable homes to address the chronic supply issues that have beset the sector for far too long. <\/p>  <p> The Government must immediately implement a rent freeze.  Despite promises from the Taoiseach to close the 8% increase loophole, this Bill, as published, does not address the issue but instead extends protections for those who proactively register as financially impacted.  The Government needs to intervene.  There is much hand-wringing from the Minister about young people and the burden they have borne through this past year.  Many young people currently pay hand over fist for box rooms or shared rooms.  News they will face an 8% increase on top of these sometimes intolerable living conditions will surely make up their minds to leave this country when they can.  That is what we are getting through our constituency offices and advice clinics.  People are now starting to talk in greater numbers about emigration because the living costs they face are too onerous.<\/p>  <p>  Dublin now accounts for almost half of all new graduate jobs but most of these graduates cannot afford to pay high Dublin rents.  This is unsustainable and destroying the quality of life.  It is not just graduates.  What about the people going direct to work, entering through low paid roles and trying to build a career in another sector?  They fall off the agenda and the map when it comes to renting and being able to afford to live.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of a rent freeze, it is not the Attorney General who decides on the constitutionality of any measure; it is the Supreme Court.  If there was ever a time for the Government to back renters and have someone test a Bill for the Supreme Court, it is with regard to the imposition of a rent freeze.  There is no time to delay on this.  We have seen the power of the State to intervene during this crisis in many ways we thought impossible.  This is not impossible and has been done before.  The Labour Party froze rents when we were last in government and it can be done again, if there is political will to do so.  That political will is obviously absent.  Rent caps need to be used until more homes are built and the housing crisis is at the point of being resolved or at least at the point where we can point to enough supply to get us where we want to be.<\/p> <p>When I listen to Members of the Government parties talk about the balance between landlords and tenants, the market and the property rights, it is very clear they believe their responsibilities lie with the landlords.  The Opposition tried twice to give the Minister the power to implement an eviction ban based on regulations and public health advice but not to have it tied to a 5 km limit.  At the time, this was disregarded.  There is such a significant difference in power between landlords and tenants that it is one of the key dividers in society.<\/p> <p> The deposit protection scheme, as had been promised and legislated for previously by my colleague, Deputy Kelly, has made little or no progress in the past five years.  Again, this is something the Minister could advance.  According to Threshold, queries on deposits increased by 43% last year.  People living in rental accommodation feel vulnerable and afraid.  Deposits play a key role in terms of access and for people who are exiting in terms of having the protections of the deposit they paid a year, two years or five years previously.  We need the Government to act to protect renters in a holistic fashion and not to focus solely on the costs, which is the reason we must examine deposits.  We must ban the practice of landlords requesting more than a month's rent as a deposit.  Agreeing a tenancy should not be a significant financial outgoing.<\/p> <p> We must introduce minimum standards so that tenants know the place they are viewing meets a strong national standard on many elements, including fire safety and building standards.  We must ensure rent and deposit savings are counted as part of credit ratings to help people, including renters, should they choose to become buyers in the housing market.  We need a rent-to-buy scheme where a person with a tenancy for three years who successfully pays all his or her rent would see it turned into a deposit for the property when the time comes.  We must offer something to renters and young people.  At the moment we are offering them very little, expect for despair and a ticket out of this country, because that is the direction we are going.<\/p> <p> We urged the Government to introduce a vacant home tax to bring empty housing stock into use for those who need it.  People are rightly outraged at the degree to which the Government is prioritising investors over ordinary hard-working people in the midst of the housing crisis.  We have so many vacant units that could be used either for first-time buyers or for renters.  The situation is crippling people.  The Labour Party housing spokesperson, Senator Moynihan, has called on the Government to take action to discourage the funds gobbling up the housing supply through a levy on vacant homes.  These are all measures that are at the Minister's disposal.<\/p> <p> I look forward to Report Stage when I hope we can get through some amendments in the short timeframe provided.  We will support the Bill tonight, as it offers some protections, which we welcome, but overall the crisis still exists and people are still being evicted from their homes.  When the pandemic ends, we believe the rug will be pulled out in such a dramatic way that what happened before the pandemic will pale in comparison to what happens after it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300037#PP00200","speaker":"1564","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624456620,"counter":292,"content":"<p>This is the fifth Bill that has been introduced by the Government since it took office last summer to safeguard tenants during the pandemic.  The Bill extends the protections to tenants affected by Covid-19 by a further six months until 12 January 2022.  The number of people that have directly invoked this legal protection has remained small so far, but the legislation has also had a chilling effect on all landlords and, as a result, has protected tenants.  The Government will continue to protect vulnerable tenants for the extent of the pandemic and those financially impacted by Covid-19 who have been protected in each of the Bills.  The Bill introduces a further extension of the protections for those negatively impacted by Covid-19.  The Minister has been consistently proven correct on this issue.  He has listened, acted and protected tenants, despite the suggestions of those in Opposition that he would do otherwise.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also introduces rental protections for students, not just those impacted by Covid-19.  This is another issue on which the Minister has listened.  The Bill introduces new rental protections that will restrict the total value of upfront payments for rent, which will apply to all tenancies.  I met with representatives of the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, who were very passionate and are genuinely concerned about the rental market for students.  We recently saw progress on the Residential Tenancies (Student Rents and Other Protections) (Covid-19) Bill 2021, which the Government supported.  I thank the USI for its engagement with all parties on this issue.  We see some of its suggestions in the Bill.  For example, any upfront payment upon the commencement of a tenancy will be restricted to a total value that does not exceed two months' rent, that is, a deposit and one month's rent in advance.  This Bill provides that a notice period to be given by students in respect of student-specific accommodation will be limited to a maximum of 28 days.  These new protections for students will be in place for the new academic year.  When it comes to student tenancies, students and their families, Fianna F&aacute;il has listened, acted and protected.  That is no surprise from a Minister who stood with students from the USI and other universities on protests such as the Shanowen Shakedown.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, commits to improve the security of tenure for tenants, through legislating for tenancies of indefinite duration, increasing enforcement by the Residential Tenancies Board and examining incentives for long-term leasing.  This is only the start.  I look forward to the additional rental protections the Minister has said he will introduce later in the year to further protect tenants.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to respond to the Opposition speakers who spoke this morning.  There are two areas where they are either deliberately attempting to mislead or are not communicating correctly.  One is the notion that the Minister could do more, while at the same time they advocate for a change in the Constitution, which would balance property rights with the right to housing.  It is one or the other: either we need a referendum for good reason or we do not need it and the Minister should be doing what he can now.  It is disingenuous to criticise the Minister for not having further extensions and, by the same token, saying we need a change in the Constitution.  I agree with amending the Constitution to include a right to housing, but we cannot pretend that need is not there when we are criticising the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  I heard a number of Deputies with their pre-prepared Facebook scripts pretending that the one Minister has been in place for ten years and that he has done nothing for the past ten months.  Of course the rental crisis is dire; it is one of the principal issues all of us heard on the doorsteps at the last general election.  Rents in Dublin and many other places are unaffordable.  It is the reason many parties sough to form a Government to try to ensure we could do something about it.  It is the reason the Minister has introduced five Bills on this issue, two further Bills on the Land Development Agency and the Affordable Housing Bill.  It is the reason that for the first time in the history of the State we have an affordable rental scheme.  To say the Minister has done nothing and stood over what happened in the past ten years is blatant hypocrisy.  It is a direct attempt to mislead people who might only tune in on one Facebook account for one contribution.  There is a deliberate attempt by Fianna F&aacute;il, the Green Party and Fine Gael to tackle the housing crisis, to change direction, to put in place protections for tenants and new forms of tenancies, such as the affordable rental scheme, to increase supply, to end the housing crisis.  I agree with the Opposition that we should keep raising the problems that exist because that is what will keep motivating us, but we must recognise that a policy change has been made, that we have a Minister who is implementing that policy and that the majority of Deputies in the D&aacute;il support the Government and support those changes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300038#QQ00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1624456620,"counter":293,"content":"<p>Figures released to my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, by the Residential Tenancies Board highlight how this Government is continuing to fail renters.  Since August, more than 1,000 notices to quit have been issued with a significant increase in the numbers since March.  The Government has failed to protect renters.  The limited protections in place are just not working.  The 2016 rent pressure zone legislation, which was supposed to limit rent increases to 4% per annum, has had the opposite effect.<\/p> <p>Instead of being a deterrent to increasing rents, it is now an annual increase that is imposed on renters.  I talk to renters in Clondalkin and Lucan, and right across Dublin Mid-West, who dread the annual 4% rent increase that drops in their door.<br\/><br\/>A quick look at<i>daft.ie<\/i>this morning reaffirmed what I already knew.  In my own area, for example, the average rent for a three-bed property in Lucan is &euro;2,000 per month or higher.  I will put this into the context of an annual 4% increase in rent.  If a person is lucky enough to get a property for &euro;2,000 a month in year one, in year two the rent increases to &euro;2,080, in year three it increases to &euro;2,163, in year four it increases to &euro;2,250 and in year five the rent is &euro;2,340.  Therefore, in the space of five years, the rent has increased by &euro;340 and a home that costs &euro;2,000 per month to rent today will cost workers and families &euro;2,340 in five years' time.  That is a whopping 17% increase.  It is not sustainable and is pushing workers and families who are already pinned to their collar into poverty and into homelessness.  Some &euro;340 in anyone&rsquo;s language is a huge increase in a family&rsquo;s outgoings.<br\/><br\/>When does this stop?  When is enough enough?  I have had several families contact me who are very worried about a potential 8% increase in rents this year.  Inflated rents and lack of affordability is a failure not just of this Government but of successive Governments, and Deputy McAuliffe agreed his party propped up the Government in recent years.  There needs to be a shift in Government policy that puts families and workers at the heart of housing policies, not sweetheart deals for vulture funds.  The Minister needs to step up to the plate and put these measures in place.  The Government needs to reintroduce the original ban on rent increases, notices to quit and evictions until the end of the year, which would address the potential 8% increase in rents this year.<br\/><br\/>I am the spokesperson on mental health for my party.  I believe that if the Government tackled the housing situation, that would have the biggest impact on people's mental health right across this State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300038#QQ00300","speaker":"1469","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624457220,"counter":295,"content":"<p>The Social Democrats support this Bill.  We would like to see much stronger legislation but we will, nonetheless, support it.  I want to strongly welcome the measures in the Bill which will provide some protection for all tenants as a result of the campaign run by the Union of Students in Ireland - Aontas na Mac L&eacute;inn in &Eacute;irinn and following the Private Members&rsquo; Bill that was put forward by the Opposition, which the Minister has worked constructively on and acted on.  I thank the Union of Students in Ireland - Aontas na Mac L&eacute;inn in &Eacute;irinn for its work on that and thank the Minister for his work in responding to that.<\/p><p>The Minister has listened and acted on that, and I hope he will listen and act on other measures that are needed as well, very specifically and pertinently the 8% rent increase that a number of tenants are facing now.  We were told a few weeks ago that this would be dealt with shortly and I certainly had the impression it would be dealt with under this Bill, so it is disappointing it is not being brought forward at this point.  While I know the Minister intends to address it in the autumn, I think it needs to be acted on urgently at this point.<\/p><p>On the Bill, I will be bringing forward amendments to ensure there is a legal definition of what a deposit is, which is missing from the Bill.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say on that.<\/p><p>In terms of the limited protections, which involve making a self-declaration, they need to be extended further and they need to recognise there is a fall in income for many due to Covid.  That fall in income will take time to recover in some sectors and will take longer, unfortunately, than 12 January for some.  A number of people have gone into debt during the pandemic and it will take time for their incomes to recover, and that should be recognised in the Bill.<\/p><p>While I understand the rationale for the opt-out in the Bill in terms of bundles that are sold to international students for accommodation and college fees during the year, I have concerns that, because it is a general opt-out, this could be exploited.  I appreciate there is an intention to correct that in the autumn.  However, that opt-out is currently too broad and should be removed from the Bill at this stage.  I will have amendments to that effect.<\/p><p>Blindboy recently commented on how striking it is that so many young adults in Ireland today are paying substantial mortgages each month, not their own mortgage, but that of their landlord.  He noted that at the end of this process, they will not own any property and they are unable to obtain a mortgage of their own due to spending the bulk of their income on rent.  We know that housing utility costs here are 78% higher than the EU average, that rents have almost doubled in the last decade and that more than 8,000 people are living in emergency accommodation, many of whom lost their home due to rents they cannot afford.  We know that, since 2014, 38,000 people have become homeless and ended up living in emergency accommodation, most of whom had their last stable home in the private rented sector.  During this time, the State has spent &euro;1 billion on services for people experiencing homelessness.<\/p><p>Deputy McAuliffe is right to point out that that is not this Minister's sole responsibility, far from it, and it is not this Government's sole responsibility, far from it.  Each Government and the entire political system has responsibility in this regard.  Trying to pin responsibility onto particular individuals may make for point-scoring but it is not the approach that any of us should be taking.  This is far too serious for that.  What we all need to do is examine what needs to be done to fix this.  If the Minister takes further action, I will fully support that.<\/p><p>What has happened on the Minister&rsquo;s watch is that, in the last ten months, more than 1,100 households have been given eviction notices and only 475 people were able to avail of the complex and limited protections the Government brought in by making self-declarations.  While they have had a value, it was not a sufficient value.<\/p><p>Research has just been conducted and published by Dr. Michael Byrne of UCD and Ms Juliana Sassi of Maynooth University on the experience of tenants in the private rented sector during the pandemic.  One of the things they found is that the blanket eviction ban had only a limited impact on tenants&rsquo; perceptions of security within their home.  The research found that overcrowding and poor quality housing conditions in the private rented sector were key issues for tenants during the pandemic, having impacts on their mental health and their physical well-being.  A particularly good part of the research is that it gives voice to tenants and their experiences during the pandemic, when many of them were at home more, and when conditions in their rented accommodation had an increased bearing on them because they were not out and about as much, in work or in the other aspects of life.<\/p><p>I want to quote a few of the tenants in this research because it is particularly relevant to what we are discussing.  Tenants were asked if they would describe their current property as feeling like home.  One tenant replied:<\/p> <blockquote> \tProbably not, I can&rsquo;t actually paint the wall and decorate, to make it more homely...  Even though I have been here for 10 years, at this stage, there isn&rsquo;t any decoration that I have put in there, if you know what I mean.  At one stage we had to replace the carpet, I didn&rsquo;t get to choose the colour or anything.  It&rsquo;s not my taste. <\/blockquote>  <p>Another tenant said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIt doesn&rsquo;t feel like a home, and in the back of my head I&rsquo;d always like to have a home where, you know, you could paint your own walls and you can feel more relaxed in, and you can do things to.  And I guess it&rsquo;s always in the back of your head with rentals, especially if the landlord is very...  Like [my current] landlord has a 20 page itinerary of things you can and cannot do.  You can&rsquo;t even hang pictures on the wall...  It has affected more negatively the way I would feel about my home. <\/blockquote>  <p>Another tenant said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI don&rsquo;t actually ever feel secure in a rental property because nine times out of ten they&rsquo;ll be sold, or something will happen.  So there&rsquo;s no security of tenure in Ireland anyway for most renters, and that&rsquo;s one of the really horrible things about it.  You can&rsquo;t make somewhere your home, when you know it&rsquo;s never going to be.  You know the lease here, there&rsquo;s a stipulation in the lease that says you can&rsquo;t even hang a picture, so it&rsquo;s very hard to make somewhere home when you can&rsquo;t even hang a ... picture. <\/blockquote> <p>We need security of tenure for people who are renting.  We need to remove the constant worry and threat of eviction for people who are good tenants who are paying their rent.  Tenants need to be able to hang a picture, paint their walls, and make themselves feel at home where they live without fear of eviction.  In 2021, it is not too much for tenants to ask for measures to make them feel at home where they are working hard and paying their rent. <br\/><br\/>Another tenant stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tI&rsquo;ve learned not to think of anywhere as home... I tend not to get attached to places... it&rsquo;s not worth the heartache. I don&rsquo;t ever feel secure in a rental property... you can&rsquo;t make somewhere your home...&rsquo;. <\/blockquote> <p>Another stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tIt&rsquo;s funny that. It&rsquo;s my home, I&rsquo;ve been there fifteen years, he&rsquo;s a great landlord, but you&rsquo;re never secure <\/blockquote> <p>Another stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tUnderneath it all I&rsquo;d feel uncomfortable because I am renting, at any moment the landlord could turn around and sell... There&rsquo;s no security renting in Ireland <\/blockquote> <p>Another stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tIt took me two years to put a flower pot outside because I had this weird thought in my head, if I start to make it look like a home then something bad would happen <\/blockquote> <p>Another stated:<\/p><blockquote>\t&lsquo;no, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t improve it&rdquo;, because you will be gone soon <\/blockquote> <p>Another stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tIt&rsquo;s your home, but it&rsquo;s not your home. Its where you live and you try and keep it nice, but at the same time you&rsquo;re not going to invest a lot of money in it, like sometimes if you&rsquo;re getting something for the garden you think, am I wasting my money here? <\/blockquote> <p>Another stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tI don&rsquo;t feel comfortable inviting people over, because I know the paint is coming off the walls, there&rsquo;s mould in the bathroom.. It is embarrassing to invite people over to a place, when there are obvious maintenance issues. <\/blockquote> <p>They are all people living in our rented sector.  They are all good tenants, paying their rent and contributing to society.  Some have been in their rented properties for years, yet the underlying message from many is that they still do not feel that these are their homes despite all the contributions they are making.  That is why we need the Government to urgently legislate for the private rented sector to improve security of tenure and indefinite tenancies.  It is positive that the Government is indicating that will be done soon.  It is regrettable, however, that it is not in this Bill at this point.<br\/><br\/>Since the eviction ban was lifted and widespread evictions have resumed, there has been a rise in the number of children and families living in emergency accommodation.  That shows that the single most effective measure to protect against homelessness introduced in many years was the ban on evictions.  It is crystal clear that the Government should seek to radically reduce the grounds for eviction, allowing evictions to happen only where there is failure to pay rent or anti-social behaviour, and that most other grounds should be removed urgently.  We need to make sure there is a ban on rent increases for the next few years and that in the future, rent increases are strictly limited to increases in the consumer price index or a similar measure.<br\/><br\/>We support this Bill.  I welcome that the Minister has acted on some of what students raised.  We have much further to go and we need to do so urgently to ensure people who rent in Ireland feel secure in their homes and have the peace of mind that people who are renting in other countries have.  When we achieve that, which must be done urgently, we will have taken significant measures to address the housing issues which face people in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300039#RR00200","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624457820,"counter":297,"content":"<p>At the beginning of the pandemic, the Government acted quickly to protect renters by introducing emergency legislation that froze rents and temporarily banned evictions.  In March, we extended this temporary legislation to ensure those who had lost their income due to Covid-19 and who needed the protection and support of the legislation would continue to receive it.  Three months ago, when I spoke in this House about the last extension to this legislation, I noted that unfortunately we were still in a difficult and delicate position with Covid-19.  I am relieved that we now see light at the end of the tunnel.  Thanks to the success of the vaccine roll-out and the admirable commitment of the public we are making progress that just three months ago felt out of our grasp.<\/p>  <p>  Despite this progress, renters who have been negatively impacted by the pandemic still need our support.  They still need the reassurance of these emergency measures.  Young families and working professionals in their 20s and 30s make up a large proportion of our renting population.  They have been hit hard by this pandemic and the uncertainty of being a renter adds to their hardship.  I am keenly aware of the difficulties facing renters and I know it is one of the most significant areas of concern for my generation.  That is why I firmly believe we must turn our attention to beyond the pandemic, to ensure that protections are in place to support renters in the future.<\/p>  <p>  In the long term, a key commitment of the programme for Government is the provision of housing for all and part of this commitment includes the delivery of Ireland's first cost-rental homes.  This initiative will provide Irish renters with the security of long-term, affordable and, most importantly, secure leases.  This is an initiative I will continue to champion through my work on the Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which I know is dear to the Minister's heart.<\/p>  <p>  In the short term, we must continue to protect renters however we can to ensure those who have lost their jobs or incomes will not lose their homes too. This Bill extends the emergency period in the legislation to 12 January 2022.  It will protect renters who have lost their incomes due to Covid-19 from being evicted from their homes until then.  The Bill will introduce new measures to ensure the deposit or advance payment a tenant must pay to a landlord will be limited to two months' rent.  I welcome that in extending the legislation, this Bill will provide for students who live in student-specific accommodation.  They will be covered by the new deposit measure and will not have to give more than 28 days&rsquo; notice when terminating a tenancy.<\/p>  <p>  The last year has been extremely challenging for renters, especially those who have lost their jobs or incomes.  I am proud this Government continues to act to protect vulnerable renters and it is right that we continue to do this until the pandemic is behind us.  It is my sincere hope and expectation that we will continue to support renters long after this pandemic is over and work to create a stable rental market with conditions that make long-term rental a viable, affordable, and attractive option for families and young people who feel trapped in the rental market.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to fixing the housing crisis and to ending the rip-off rental market.  If that is the shared ambition of politicians across this Chamber, let us work together to achieve that.  We should not have opposition for opposition's sake.  We should have meaningful collaboration because that is what the people who elected us deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300040#SS00200","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speech","time":1624457820,"counter":298,"content":"<p>The first issue I want to raise related to tenancies and tenants relates specifically to the pandemic.

It really would be unacceptable if that were the case.  That is my first point.<\/p>  <p>  We will, of course, support the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Bill 2021.  Insofar as it extends a small amount of protection to a very small cohort of people who self-declared that their income loss as a result of the pandemic has affected their ability to pay rent and that the protection against eviction and rent increases has been extended, of course we will support that.  Similarly, we support the measures the Government has taken to put into legislation what USI has campaigned for on students having to pay only one month's deposit and so on.  I welcome those developments and therefore we support the Bill.  We are more than willing to say that, when the Government is doing something progressive.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is not opposition for the sake of opposition to say this.  I will not use one of the most tired clich&eacute;s that we hear in this place about missed opportunities.  It is almost criminal neglect that Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Bill 2021 is not doing more to protect all tenants - not just a tiny cohort of a few hundred - against unfair evictions or no-fault evictions.  <\/p>  <p>  Figures from TCD and Focus Point in the last week or two indicated that 38,000 people in this country have been through homeless services since 2014, which is estimated to be 1% of the adult population.  I have a personal friend in that situation.  I have repeatedly raised with the Minister an entire block of tenants in St. Helen's Court in D&uacute;n Laoghaire who are facing that.  These are working people who have done nothing wrong.  They pay their rent and are good tenants.  It is a lovely community with elderly people, new communities and working people like taxi drivers who have had their income affected but will not qualify for the protection of this Bill.  They pay their rent anyway because they do not like being in arrears of their rent.  They are going to be put out on the street.  I have been pleading with the Minister and with officials in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to prevent this from happening.  I repeatedly hear the Taoiseach say that the Government wants to prevent people from going into homelessness.  Most of the people who are faced with homelessness are being evicted from the private rental sector and most of them have done absolutely nothing wrong, but there is no protection for them.  <\/p>  <p>  We have pleaded with the Minister and I plead with him again.  We have proposed amendments to the Bill to this effect.  We should extend the protection for all tenants against no-fault evictions at least until the pandemic has fully passed.  We also need to use the interim to stop no-fault evictions altogether.  Why should people who pay their rent be evicted?  The Minister frequently mentions the \"mom and pop\" landlords and that they can be treated as an exception, but not the default position.  We have legislation where the default position is that it is acceptable to evict people who have done nothing wrong.<\/p>  <p>  The default position should be that they should not be evicted unless there are exceptional circumstances which justify the kind of individual landlord the Minister is talking about having an urgent financial or other need to sell.  Other than that, landlords should not be allowed to evict tenants when they have nowhere else to go.  It is just not fair for 1% of the adult population to be going through homeless services with all that entails.  We cannot allow this situation to persist.  It is brutal and inhumane.  <\/p>  <p>  It is equally unacceptable for the tenants who in my area are paying &euro;2,000, &euro;2,500 or &euro;3,000 for two-bedroom apartments.  Those who are single can forget it.  Many of the people in St. Helen's Court are single.  They are paying &euro;800 or &euro;900 in rent which is a lot for people on a moderate income.  When they go looking for somewhere else in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, they will not get anything for less than &euro;2,000 for a one-bedroom apartment.  They will end up on the street.  The local authority says, \"Sorry, we have nothing for them.\"  Will they be sent into North Frederick Street in a few weeks' time?  These are ordinary decent working people.  It is not right.  These people are vulnerable with health conditions and other things.<\/p>  <p>  I plead with the Minister to do something now - not carry out a review, but do something now - to protect tenants from an 8% increase in rent on top of the &euro;2,000 or more they are already paying.  These people have a real terror that they might be made homeless and they need to be protected.  The wheeled-out justification of saying, \"What about the mom and pop landlord?\" pales into insignificance compared with people being put on the street.  That is not opposition for opposition's sake.  I am saying those things because I meet those people who are crying and shivering with fear wondering what on earth they are going to do.  It is just not right.  <\/p>  <p>  We have tabled amendments to the Bill.  We will support the Bill.  Given that the Bill is to be guillotined in any event, I do not expect that the Minister will accept them, although he should.  However, when is he going to protect these tenants?  We are talking about tens of thousands of people who are in constant fear.  These people have been working all their lives but their income is insufficient to pay the unaffordable house prices and they have been on a local authority housing list for 15 or 20 years.  The average waiting time in my area for council housing is now in excess of 20 years which is unbelievable.  They have nowhere to go if they are evicted.<\/p>  <p>  I know the Minister will say this is not all his fault, which fair enough as he is a new Minister.  However, in my view it is his fault if he does not do this.  While this unacceptable situation, which is the legacy of successive governments, pertains, if we want to stem the flow of people into homelessness, the first thing is to say that we must not put people out on the street.  We must not allow a further increase in rents on top of already unsustainable rents.  The Government should immediately bring in long-term protections for people against no-fault evictions and introduce real rent controls.  <\/p>  <p>  In other jurisdictions across Europe people regularly control rents; they do not just stop rent increases.  A rents board or a local authority determines a maximum rent for a particular property.  Will the Minister not introduce those kinds of rent controls?  He may say he cannot because of the Constitution.  Even though I am not sure that is true, we have introduced a right-to-housing Bill that seeks to address that and the Government could fast-track that Bill so that we can have the real rent controls we urgently need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300041#TT00400","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1624458420,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I start by quoting from James Geoghegan, the Fine Gael by-election candidate in Dublin Bay South.  On 28 May he released a press statement which stated, \"I am alarmed by the revelation today that tenants in the rental accommodation sector could potentially face a double rent increase of 8% when measures providing for a temporary ban on evictions and a rent freeze that were implemented during Covid-19 are due to end in July.\"  Of course, he did not mention that his Government is responsible for the legal situation where the 8% increase is proposed.  He also did not mention that the revelation came from People Before Profit.<\/p> <p>He said: &quot;However, the Minister must resolve this loophole as a matter of urgency and ensure that renters do not face a double increase when the emergency legislation is lifted in July,&quot;.  The Minister has not resolved this situation.  He has resolved the situation for 500 of the hundreds of thousands of private rented tenants in this country.  Those 500 renters will be able to avoid the 8% increase now, but they face a rent increase of up to 12% next January.  The remaining hundreds of thousands of people may continue to face an 8% rent increase and the Government and the Minister are doing nothing about it.  One month ago, I raised this matter with the Taoiseach on Leaders' Question, when I gave a number of real world examples, including Jane who lives in an ordinary house in Tallaght whose rent is set to increase by &euro;160, an almost 8% increase, to more than &euro;2,000 per month, Philip in Islandbridge who faces an more than &euro;100 increase per month, an increase of 7.7% and Samantha in D&uacute;n Laoghaire who is facing a 10% increase.  In response, during Leaders' Questions, the Taoiseach said:<\/p><blockquote>\tHe [referring to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, who has not left the House] is going to bring in legislation quickly to deal with the 8% increase with regard to those who are most vulnerable and most at risk.  He will respond in that manner. <\/blockquote> <p>Again, the Taoiseach and the Government have not delivered on what they committed to do.  Under pressure, they accepted that there is a crisis and we had a Fine Gael by-election candidate all of a sudden expressing concern about the treatment of renters.  We then had the Government saying it will do something about it, but what it has done is a pretence in that it affects only 500 people.  The Government is leaving renters at the mercy of landlords who are only interested in maximising their returns.  The result will be an increasing tsunami of homelessness from now until the end of the year.  That is very much definitely on the Government.<br\/><br\/>Why does the Government act in such a way?  It is no accident.  It is because in this State we have government by landlord for landlords.  One in three Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies are landlords and those who are not landlords nonetheless represent the landlord class in this country effectively.  The policies are always designed to incentivise their investment in the sector, to maximise their return and to provide for landlords to impose an 8% increase in rent, or 12% next year, guaranteeing them increases of 4% year-on-year.  If an increase is deferred in any particular year, it can be added to the increase for the following year.  We have pro-landlord policies consistently.  When the Opposition calls for a rent freeze, or better than a rent freeze, rent controls, to bring rents down to affordable levels, the Government says it cannot do that because it is unconstitutional.  We need to kick this Government out.  Those who are lucky enough to be in the Dublin Bay South constituency should take the opportunity to vote for the renters' candidate, the People Before Profit candidate, Brigid Purcell, and in so doing send a signal to Sinn F&eacute;in and others that we do not want any parties that are going to bring Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael into power through the back door in a coalition.  We need a left wing government that will stand up to the big corporate landlords and the developers and take the side of ordinary working-class people and renters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300041#TT00500","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624459020,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I first want to congratulate all of the students across the country who challenged the refusal of landlords, in the main corporate landlords, to refund the large rents paid by them last year before Covid hit and they had to up sticks and go home.  This includes students from University College Cork who highlighted the particularly scandalous situation at Amnis House on the Western Road where a corporate landlord was refusing to return four-figure sums that students had paid for their year's accommodation.  If it were not for the campaigning efforts of those students, the student unions and the Union of Students in Ireland, we would not be discussing the legislative change about to be passed by this House, which provides that two months is the maximum amount a renter can be asked to pay upfront.  I welcome that change and I again congratulate the students who campaigned for it.<\/p>  <p>  We need to reinstate the ban on all rent increases and evictions.  The limited protections being proposed by Government will not work.  There were 448 rent arrears warnings issued to tenants across the State, of which the RTB is aware.  Twenty of those tenants availed of the protections offered by the Government.  When one steps back and looks at the position for the past ten months, during that time 3,800 rent warnings were issued and 475 tenants were able to avail of the protections.  Within that 3,800, there were 1,100 eviction notices - notices to quit - and 475 tenants, less than half, were able to avail of the protections.  <\/p>  <p>  I want to talk briefly about the situation that pertains in Cork city.  My office is receiving reports of landlords in Cork city who are trying to impose the 8% rent increase on tenants this year.  They were not able to impose the maximum 4% rent increase last year because of the ban on rent increases, but now that the Government is lifting that ban in respect of some renters, landlords are trying to impose the double-whammy increase of 8%.  For example, this morning I was made aware of a landlord in the Blackpool area who is trying to impose the 8% rent increase on tenants there.  I would like to make three points about this.  First, landlords trying to get away with an 8% increase before we are fully out of a pandemic speaks to unbelievable greed.  Second, I appeal to all tenants in such a situation to make a declaration to try to avoid the rent increases that are being piled on them.  Third, the Government has to take responsibility for having allowed this situation to develop.  It needs to take heed of the points that I and other Deputies have raised and strengthen this legislation such that it provides not for a limited ban but a 100% ban on all rent increases and evictions.  That is what is needed.  It is what this situation calls for and it is what should be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300042#UU00200","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1624459020,"counter":306,"content":"<p>We are discussing relevant and potential legislation.  The housing crisis is an area of particular concern for Sinn F&eacute;in and so we are happy to see motions and Bills proposing solutions before this Chamber.<\/p>  <p>  The average rent across this country is &euro;1,256 per month.  Rent in Dublin is, on average, &euro;1,745 per month, but in many parts of Dublin rents are more than &euro;2,000 per month.  Across the country rents have risen by 2.7% over the past year.  In the commuter belt, there has been an increase of 5%.  In my constituency of Clare, those figures are above the average.  There has been a year-on-year increase of 2.9%, but more concerning an increase of 5.9% between the third and fourth quarter of 2020.  With more people relocating to County Clare through remote working initiatives, the area has seen a sharp spike in rents.  This inflation is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to locals not being able to afford to live in their locality.  In Clare, approximately 70 people are registered as homeless, but beyond first glance one realises that the figure is much higher.  For example, there are young disabled people living in nursing homes who do not feature in the homeless statistics and Travellers who have been consistently refused transfers to more adequate accommodation who also do not feature in the official numbers.<\/p> <p>The National Homelessness and Housing Coalition estimates that more than 50% of homeless people in Clare are Travellers.  While Travellers represent only 1% of the overall population, their representation in these figures is disproportionate, which is unjust.  According to the programme for Government, asylum seekers living in direct provision deserve accommodation that aligns with an own-door policy.  These too do not appear in homelessness figures.  The total number of hidden homeless is far greater than we are told and, by and large, comprises people from marginalised communities.  This means that the housing crisis to which we refer is only the tip of the iceberg.  The scale of the crisis is far greater than is depicted in the mainstream narrative.<\/p> <p> My party has been raising issues and, more importantly, solutions in these Chambers for a very long time.  Just last month, we tabled a motion proposing legislation that would implement an emergency three-year ban on rent increases and that would allow for tenancies of indefinite duration.  We would also introduce a refundable tax credit for tenants in the private rented sector to put a month's rent back in every renter's pocket and ensure that all rental properties are compliant with minimum standards by introducing a national car test-style certification system.  However, the political will needed to take concrete affirmative action to address the rental crisis simply is not there.  This Government has no plans to reduce rents, to protect renters from further rent hikes or to prioritise the supply of affordable rental properties.  This Bill is a movement in the right direction but falls short of the radical change needed to genuinely improve the system.  Although I will support it, I call for all tenants to be included in the emergency period for the rest of this year.  The provisions of this Bill are generally totally sensible.  They include prohibiting upfront payments for student accommodation and the introducing a standard of one month's notice for termination of residency for students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300042#UU00300","speaker":"1520","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624459620,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I am glad to speak on this Bill.  It has many good elements but we all know what the real issue is with rental properties.  For the first time in the history of the State, 80% of serviced zoned lands in Wexford and many other rural constituencies are to be effectively dezoned.  It makes no sense.  It will drive up the price of land, increase the cost of housing and magnify the current housing crisis in rural towns.<\/p>  <p>  Extraordinarily, the first thing planners will say is that commercial considerations are not planning considerations.  The inability of our directors of planning and planners to comprehend the most basic first principle of planning law and planning policy means that they, in turn, are unable to properly advise council members as to the best approach for their counties.  This was my experience in Wexford.  I recently listened to the director of services for planning in Wexford being interviewed on local radio and he confirmed that he is bound by the recommendations of the Planning Regulator.  He believes that the regulator is best placed to advise on policy for Wexford.  As we all know, the regulator has no such power nor is this his role.  In another radio interview, one Fianna F&aacute;il councillor said that he would have to seek permission from the regulator to make amendments to the draft development plan.  Directors of services for planning are paid a six-figure salary that is commensurate with that of a specialist in the area.  Occupiers of that position should be possessed of knowledge sufficient to properly advise councillors.  Regrettably, this is not the case in Wexford.  <\/p>  <p>  It is extremely worrying that councillors genuinely believe that the Planning Regulator has the power to countermand any decision of the local authority.  To be clear, eminent planning counsel, speaking on the respective roles of the local authority and the regulator, have said that the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, is not given statutory authority to make or give binding interpretations of statutes, guidelines, regulations or specific planning policy requirements, SPPRs.  While the OPR may have its own view on the meaning of such measures, individual planning authorities retain the right and duty to form their own bona fide views on the proper interpretation of such measures and to act accordingly, within the law.<\/p>  <p>  There is a serious problem in the system.  After a number of sustained exchanges between myself and others in the D&aacute;il and elsewhere and the Minister on this matter, the Minister, in fairness, did write to the local authorities on 23 April 2021 amending his guidelines with respect to densities.  Despite this correspondence, local authorities have failed, and are failing, to advise members that they can adopt any density they want.  What is the point of having a director of services for planning who apparently does not understand the import of such communication and if this director is simply going to ignore such correspondence and slavishly adopt the recommendations of the Planning Regulator?  It is the members and the council who have an obligation under section 15 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, not the Planning Regulator.  Local authorities, which have local knowledge of their communities, are best placed to ensure that housing needs are met and to know what policies to adopt, taking account of local considerations to ensure their plans are achievable.  This has been ignored by officials in advising members.  <\/p>  <p>  It is clear that the director of planning in Wexford has abdicated his responsibility to the Planning Regulator.  There needs to be specialist legal planning training for the directors of services and senior planners.  They should be forced to attend continuing professional development courses to ensure they understand their roles and responsibilities along with changing legislation and amendments to guidelines.  The provision of incorrect advice to members and the public will come at a great cost to the State arising from judicial review proceedings and other legal actions.  Certainty in the planning system is essential if we are to provide much-needed housing.  If our senior people in planning do not know the law, how can there be any such certainty?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300043#VV00200","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1624459620,"counter":309,"content":"<p>It is a disgrace that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage leaves when Opposition Deputies are speaking.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Sinn F&eacute;in changed the rules of the D&aacute;il so that their speakers would come first in these debates.  They pushed Opposition voices further towards the end of the debates.  That means that the Minister typically leaves before Opposition Deputies get to speak, despite having listened to his own Deputies in his parliamentary party meetings.<\/p>  <p>  Before Christmas, I raised the fact that, in Dublin, people who are homeless but not from Dublin were being refused homelessness services by Dublin City Council.  I raised this issue with the Minister, but he was not here.  He learned about the matter a couple of weeks later when \"Prime Time\" carried out an investigation into the issue.  Had he remained in the Chamber, the Minister could have learned a little bit about the homelessness crisis in the city.  The fact that he only listens to his own Deputies and not elected representatives from across the State who each were given tens of thousands of votes is absolutely wrong.  <\/p>  <p>  Housing is everything.  It determines whether people can get work, a decent education and decent nutrition.  It determines whether young people can socialise and people's physical and mental health.  If a person does not have a home, nearly everything else falls down around him or her, including physical and mental health.  The level of human misery brought about as a result of the housing crisis is incredible.  Right now, up to 1 million people in this State are in some level of housing crisis whether through mortgage distress, homelessness, spending years on housing waiting lists or paying grossly unaffordable rents and mortgages.  Of course, by the very definition of the term, it is the people who are most vulnerable who are hit hardest.  In my own constituency, I know it is people who have disabilities who are often left on the housing list the longest.  People who are single are also often on the housing list for far longer.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to Fine Gael stating at its recent online Ard-Fheis that it is going to build 40,000 houses.  Fine Gael has been in government for the past ten years.  Not once in those ten years did it meet the demand for housing.  It is always about the future with Fine Gael.  If one takes phrases in the future tense away from Fine Gael's statements on housing, it is left speechless.  This is a party that has been in government for ten years.<\/p>  <p>  It is also interesting that in mid-May we heard the political establishment state that there is a housing crisis right across this State.  For the previous four months, it had mentioned nothing about housing.  For those four months, the building sites in this State were closed.  Ireland was alone among European countries in stopping all construction of homes during that period.  It is absolutely true that we had a Covid crisis.<\/p> <p>It absolutely was necessary to make sure that certain construction sites, especially the big industrial ones, were closed, but the fact that no other European country thought it was good enough to close every single type of home-building at the time shows this country's real attitude towards housing.  Last year, only 5,073 new social houses were built.  Even if one includes the 1,314 targeted acquisitions by local authorities and approved housing bodies, the number of homes that were provided through social provision was less than the number of people who are homeless in this State.  That is incredible.  There are 70,000 people on HAP or RAS tenancies across the country.  That is proof, if proof were needed, that the strategy of Governments for the past ten years has been to outsource the issue of housing to the private sector.<\/p> <p> There were 79 homeless deaths on the streets of Dublin last year but the Minister failed to respond on a human level to those deaths.  His predominant concern was arguing about whether the deaths were caused by homelessness but the truth of the matter is that the number of deaths in 2020 is significantly higher than the numbers in 2018 and 2019.  The peak of homeless deaths last year in this city occurred at the same time that the political establishment was increasing the level of pensions to former Ministers.  It is ironic that the political establishment was feathering its own nest at a time when there were peak numbers of deaths on the streets of Dublin.<\/p> <p> Right now, no local authority other than those in Dublin records the number of homeless deaths.  If one tries to find out what is happening in the west of Ireland, one gets anecdotal information and estimates.  The fact that the political establishment and the Departments are not measuring the number of people who are dying in homelessness outside of Dublin is absolutely shocking because if one does not know the size of the problem or the reality of the problem, the chances are that one will not be likely to push resources in the direction of resolving the problem.  I know of cases in Cork, for example, where homeless individuals have died.  In January 2021, a 69-year-old homeless man was found dead in a laneway in Limerick.  The list goes on.  We need to make sure that we know what is going on around the country so that it cannot be covered up or swept under the carpet and so that we focus investment in that direction.<\/p> <p> We need to collect information but, more than that, we need to stop people becoming homeless.  If one asks Fr. Peter McVerry or any of the other individuals who work in those sectors what is driving homelessness, they will say it is evictions and the price of rents.  It is as simple as that.  It is not complex.  The fact that people who are already paying &euro;1,700 every month for rent are being told they are about to receive an 8% rent increase is bonkers.  There is no economic reason rents of &euro;1,700 need to be increased by 8%.   There are no drivers for that.  There is no landlord in this State who has an economic justification for that but it is going to happen.  The Bill does not resolve that issue and the Government will not resolve it either.  <\/p> <p> The crisis that is engulfing many families has come about because Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have been allergic to the building of social housing.  A couple of years ago, I asked Meath County Council how many social housing units it was building.  It told me it was building three of them in a county of 200,000 people and with a waiting list of approximately 4,000 people.  The situation has improved since then and, in fairness, the staff of Meath County Council who are involved in housing are doing their best to resolve that.  On the other hand, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Social Democrats, People Before Profit and the Labour Party have also prevented the building of thousands of homes.  They have an ideological straitjacket with regard to preventing the construction private houses.  In the jaws of a crisis, we need to make sure that public housing and private housing are at full tilt.  We need to make sure that people in rural areas are able to build homes for their families.  Particularly since the Covid crisis, many people want to move out of Dublin and there has been a spike in house prices in rural areas.<\/p> <p> Aont&uacute; believes several things need to be done to fix this housing crisis.  First, we are seeking a relaxation of the European rules in terms of State spending on housing, in line with the &euro;7 billion suggested by the Economic and Social Research Institute.  Many people often forget that the European Union has placed a straitjacket on our investment priorities in this country and that is wrong.  We need to ensure that builders have access to funds in order to build homes.  When we speak to builders, they tell us they cannot get the necessary credit structures to help them to build those homes.  The Government tells us the reason it has allowed international investment funds into the country is that they have the capital necessary to be able to build homes and that Irish builders cannot do that.  Let us fix that.  Let us make sure that builders have the necessary capital to build homes.  We need to delete the competitive tax advantages that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have given to international investment vehicles which puts them at a competitive  advantage against families who are currently seeking a home.  We in Aont&uacute; will launch a Bill tomorrow at the launch of Mair&eacute;ad T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's Dublin Bay South election campaign.  That Bill will walk significantly towards deleting the competitive advantages that international investment funds and REITs have in respect of competing for Irish homes.  It is an absolute scandal that Fine Gael rolled out the red carpet to these international funds ten years ago.  It may have had an argument at the time that there may have been a need to put a floor underneath the housing market and that it needed to strengthen the balance sheets of the bank but that argument has disappeared.  I laughed when the political establishment woke up in shock a couple of months ago and realised this is happening.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, had investments in these international investment funds.  The State had investments in them.<\/p> <p> I spoke to former Deputy Michael Noonan many years ago at the finance committee and he told me that the price of houses was not high enough; that they had to go higher if we wanted people to build them.  There were echoes of that from the T&aacute;naiste just a couple of days ago when he stated that the price of houses is lower than it was at the Celtic tiger peaks.  That shows the kernel at the heart of the Fine Gael housing strategy - to raise prices in some vain attempt to introduce more supply into the market.  Aont&uacute; wants to see a three-year rent cap in the housing market.  That is needed to make sure people are not pushed out of their homes.<\/p> <p> We want to see a proper tax on vacant sites to stop speculation.  The Government created a vacant site tax a couple of years ago.  Not every local authority currently has a register.  There are only a handful of houses on the registers that exist.  Indeed, construction companies are bringing the Government to court to stop their sites going on the register and being subject to the vacant site tax.  It is not good enough for developers to sit on parcels of land to see their speculation increase in value.  The land may increases in value by an amount higher than the tax on the vacant site, so the developer can absorb the tax and still make money by doing nothing on the land.<\/p> <p> We in Aont&uacute; want to provide a carrot in terms of grant funding to get the one in 33 homes that is lying empty back into use.  It is incredible that in counties such as County Meath there is approximately the same number of vacant building as there are people on the housing waiting list.  It is an illogical conundrum that this Government has not yet got its head around.  We wish to see a significant grant fund made available so that the families that own those houses can get them back into use.  However, we need a stick to go with the carrot.  If families, investors or individuals are purposely not using those homes or are looking for speculative reasons to keep them empty, there needs to be a tax on those empty homes.<\/p> <p>We want to see a situation where the regulations on spaces above shops in our towns and cities are changed to allow for families to move into those spaces and make them into homes.  I was raised in a house above a garage in the town of Navan.  Many people lived above their shops or garages throughout the country.  We need to make sure towns and cities are welcoming places for families to go back to, even more so after Covid.  The pandemic has shown us that the social and economic health of a town or city can be wiped out at the drop of a hat if there are no people living in it.  We must ensure action is taken in this regard in the future.<br\/><br\/>Key to all of this is having a government that will take action.  I have no confidence that Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael means business in this area.  I believe both parties have an ideological reluctance to do what is necessary to fix the housing crisis.  They may paint over that ideological reluctance with words and try to ameliorate the problems but they do not want to do what needs to be done.  This is especially true of Fine Gael, a <i>laissez-faire<\/i>political party that wants to sit on its hands on this issue.  Its instinct is to let the market solve the problems, but the market is in dysfunction and will not solve them.  The truth of the matter is that much of this dysfunction was introduced by Fine Gael in government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300043#VV00300","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624460820,"counter":312,"content":"<p>We move now to the Rural Independent Group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300045#XX00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1624460820,"counter":313,"content":"<p>The first question we must ask is what is causing the increase in rents in this country.  The answer is problems with supply and demand.  Covid had a massive impact on supply and demand but we also have a huge issue with the cost of the materials to build houses, which is causing a problem.  Rents are going up in Limerick.  Ordinary people who were paying &euro;800 a month are now being charged &euro;1,200 and rising.  The Limerick Twenty Thirty group was set up to help ease the housing crisis and is currently progressing 250 applications for planning permission in the city.  It has plans to move out to addressing the situation in the county, which the Land Development Agency will not do.  The latter has been set up and structured in such a way that the investment only goes to areas with a population of 30,000 or more, which only covers Limerick city.  It does not help me to build houses in towns, villages and rural areas.  I have to depend on the local authority for that and thank God Limerick Twenty Thirty has been set up to help.  Its membership includes a former council chief executive and local councillors who were elected by the people of Limerick to help ease the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  What can we do to help the situation?  I have listened to all the other speakers' views in this regard.  As I said, there is a problem with the cost of building materials in this country.  People have to rent for longer because they cannot afford to build a house.  There has been a 40% increase in the cost of materials and a similar increase in labour costs because of the shortage of skilled workers.  The shortage of labour is a huge problem but apprenticeship programmes have not taken off because there has not been investment in them.  We lost ten years in this regard following the crash in 2008.  The infrastructure is not there to address the problems that are arising.  It is next to impossible to get anything through the ports and into the country, which is leading to an add-on cost for the building and renovation of housing in the case of materials such as steel, insulation and timber.  The knock-on effect of this is having a large impact across the country.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue is forestry licences for tree felling.  Again, the problems in this area are leading to a supply and demand issue for the housing market.  The Government has not got this right yet.  People cannot get the felling licences to produce the timber needed to roof, renovate and build houses.  All of this is common sense but the Government is not addressing the issues.  We need infrastructure, investment and the workers to provide the labour.  We have none of those because the Government has failed in every respect to get the changes through that would help people.  If we are to reduce rents, we need to address the supply and demand issues.  To do that, we must get building materials into the country at a reasonable price.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300045#XX00300","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1624460820,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I welcome the provision in the Bill that sorts out the situation whereby students were being asked for all kinds of bingo numbers for deposits.  That is being outlawed in the Bill and it is the one good thing about it.  I am worried that the rest of the measures are futile.  I admire the Leas-Cheann Comhairle every time she speaks from her knowledge and experience.  I agree with her that we get only futile efforts in this country that involve talk and more talk.  I was on the housing committee for four and a half years and I became pure disillusioned with it.  If talk could build houses, we would be building millions of them.  Deputy O'Donoghue is speaking as a builder of some renown.  He understands the industry.<\/p>  <p>  I am not here to bash public servants but they are not fit for purpose in any Department.  I spoke this morning about the situation with the maternity hospital, where the cost has gone up from &euro;150 million to &euro;800 million.  The cost of the children's hospital has increased from &euro;400 million to &euro;2 billion and growing.  We also have the broadband fiasco.  It is one fiasco after another.  Deputy O'Donoghue referred to problems with the importation of materials through the ports as a result of Brexit.  I do not know whether the staff there are not working, are working from home or something else.  I apologise for diverging a bit but I spoke to a fellow recently who bought a bailer.  He got it into the country from Germany no problem.  However, when he needed a mechanical part for it to allow him to continue his work in the hay season, it took six weeks to get it from England.  The blackguarding of people that is going on is crazy.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding housing, the cost of building has gone through the roof.  Deputy O'Donoghue told me last night that to build a 2,500 sq. ft house now costs more than &euro;400,000.  We have had the Taoiseach, or it may have been the T&aacute;naiste, saying that an affordable house in Dublin is one that costs &euro;400,000.  This is crazy stuff.  How are we going to deal with the issues?  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n touched on one aspect.  I have been like a broken record for years talking about using the spaces where shops have closed and the spaces above shops in our towns.  This would do two things.  It would create living towns and it would make an impact on the housing list.  Instead, the Government is putting billions of euro into the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme.  That is dead money and it is going down a black hole.  While people are getting roofs over their heads,  it is not solving the situation.  For God's sake, we built houses from the 1940s through to the 2000s but now we cannot build them because we are tying ourselves up in red tape.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, will not deal with the issues regarding tree felling licences for timber.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is adding cost increases to insulation.  Every move the Government makes is about regulation.  Deputy Verona Murphy is spot on that the new Office of the Planning Regulator is another quango.  We have another jumped-up, powerful man who got into a powerful position and is destroying areas.  In the town of Cathair Dh&uacute;n Iascaigh on the River Suir, 50 ha of land around Cahir Castle were zoned.  That was probably too much but the new plan that was done recently, which my daughter, Councillor M&aacute;ir&iacute;n McGrath, has railed against, will see 40 ha dezoned.  Where are people going to go?  I do not blame people for thinking there are conspiracies going on.  We are being herded into the cities and it is all about control.  Everything is about regulation and more regulation and it is adding costs, inefficiencies and bureaucracy.  It is creating more problems with homelessness.  We cannot get the figures for homeless people and homeless deaths or anything else.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Verona Murphy is right that directors of services in many councils are not up to the job because they do not understand planning law.  If the Planning Regulator says \"Jump\", they go through the roof.  This is nonsense.  The democratic right of elected councils to draw up their county and town development plans is being diminished.  Every legislative provision we bring in here diminishes the rights of the people and the rights of their duly elected representatives.  It is diminishing progress in our country.  We will be starved with the hunger in this country before we are finished.  This week we banned fur farming and next week we will ban something else.  It will be horse racing and sheep farming eventually.  Where are we going in all of this?  Who will take a rain check and say \"Wake up and smell the coffee\"?  We are going down the Swannee very fast.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300045#XX00400","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1624461420,"counter":315,"content":"<p>The purpose of this Bill is to extend the emergency period specified in the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 until 12 January 2022.  The aim is to further assist tenants who are being financially impacted by Covid-19, while recognising and balancing the rights of the landlord.  Under the new regulations, which the Government plans to have passed into law by the summer, renters will only be required to supply a deposit and a month's rent in advance.  The total value of that will not be allowed to exceed the value of two months' rent.  The measures also apply to those who are living in student-specific accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to spend some of my time speaking to the issue of students and the difficulties that they are having in getting accommodation and those they have experienced over the last number of months in paying rent for accommodation that they have not accessed, and the difficulties they have faced in trying to get back the moneys that they paid.  It has been a nightmare for many students.  Our offices deal with these issues on a regular basis.  It is most unfair that so few safeguards are put in place for the students of this country.  The deserve respect.  They are trying to start out in their lives and are working really hard.  In respect of trying to access a SUSI grant, if they are just 10 cent over the threshold with the small amount of earnings that they may have got from working over the summer, they are disqualified from getting a SUSI grant.  The odds are stacked against the young people in this country in relation to student accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  The overall lack of housing in this country is an absolute scandal.  During the week, I heard the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar's promises on housing.  He must have woken up on some side of the bed one morning and thought that the had dreamed that he could build 40,000 houses.  He was long enough in government and he built nothing.  I cannot understand how he can dream that up and try to sell that whole story to the public.  Of course, RT&Eacute; and the media give him lots of air time to talk about the nonsensical dreams he has, whereas other people who have realistic thoughts and views on people getting housing do not get the same air time.<\/p>  <p>  That leads me onto the issue of the crisis that we face in relation to rural planning.  I can assure the Minister of State that we are looking at the very same situation as we have seen today with the protest on fishing rights.  There was a fine, peaceful protest, and thousands of fishermen from west Cork, Kerry, Donegal, Wexford and Galway came to Dublin to fight their case.  The Government faces the same situation with rural planning.  Young people genuinely want to work and live in their communities and do not want to be a burden on the State.  They want to get a loan to get out there and build a happy home for themselves.  They are being denied this opportunity.  In west Cork, every planning application has been refused.  That is a Green Party policy anyway.  Its policy is to make sure that it ruins people's lives going forward.  It is scandalous beyond belief that every planning application is met with an excuse or a hurdle.  I would not mind if there was an architectural issue, because such issues can be addressed.  If there was an issue in respect of a genuine entrance, changes could be made.  However, it is all just scenic nonsense.  There is a planning application in respect of a site that cannot be seen anywhere.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has decided that there is a scenic landscape issue with the application.  We are dealing with an awful crisis in relation to planning in this country.  It is going to lead to an outcry.<\/p>  <p>  That is not to mention the sewerage issues that have not been dealt with in west Cork, such as in Castletownshend and Goleen.  I have been mentioning these places forever.  Looking at the county development plans, they are telling us that towns can grow.  Towns are going nowhere.  In rural towns and villages people living over the shop.  There is no encouragement for grants to be awarded to people to turn around their lives and try to live in rural communities.  Rural communities can offer so much to young people out there and to young couples who want to start off in their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300046#YY00100","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1624461420,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this very important Bill.  One of the biggest elephants in the room, and one of the biggest issues facing students who are seeking accommodation, is the need to increase the availability of affordable accommodation for students.<\/p>  <p>  Increasing accommodation is the most effective way to provide real choice and options.  The lack of student accommodation is very much linked to the lack of supply of housing in university and third level education towns throughout the country.  It is also worth noting and offering congratulations to the Union of Students in Ireland, which has campaigned for the new measures contained in this Bill.  It has been its campaign for this change that has brought it about.<\/p>  <p>  While the new regulations have been designed primarily to help students who are seeking college accommodation in advance of the new academic year, the measures will also apply to all renters who are moving into new homes.  As far back as 2017, the Government was urged to tackle rules around deposits and upfront payments, with some examples being highlighted over the years of private landlords asking prospective tenants for two months' rent as a deposit, as well as the first month's rent.  That is, of course, mainly a practice that is used here in Dublin.  It is only reasonable, right and proper that any property owner be entitled to ask for a deposit and for up to a month's rent in advance.  Asking for more than that puts the person who needs the accommodation in the awful position of being priced out of the market for that property.  That is wrong.<\/p>  <p>  When we are having a debate such as this one, I hear some people professing that they represent the working man.  We all know who those people are.  They are the people who would not do a day's work to save their own lives.  We are getting sick of hearing them speak about this working man that they are always talking about.  Those people would have us believe that there is something wrong with the group of people who provide student accommodation and accommodation in the private sector.  I wish to highlight that every one of those people pays tax of more than 50% on the money they earn and they are providing accommodation that the State is unable or unwilling to provide.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to highlight that we need balance, but we definitely need more accommodation to be provided.  There are a number of amazing factors at play in Ireland at the moment, including, for example, the fact that it is now impossible to build an apartment because it is not financially viable.  One cannot come to a place like Dublin, Cork, Galway or Limerick and build an apartment and rent it out, because it quite simply does not make sense to do so.  For a normal person wishing to buy such an apartment, he or she cannot afford it because the cost is so high due to the fact that the cost of building has risen steeply.  It is an awful situation.  In many cases, the price of timber and steel has gone up by 60% and 70% in the last year and a half.  That is absolutely frightening.  We desperately need to do more for people.  However, knocking the very people who provide accommodation is not the way to do it.  If we are going to rely on the State, we will be waiting a long time.<\/p>  <p>  I, too, want to take particular issue with what went on at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis over the weekend.  I refer to the T&aacute;naiste-Taoiseach or Taoiseach-T&aacute;naiste - it makes no difference what we call him.  We can call him Taoiseach or T&aacute;naiste.  He is both of them any day of the week.  He said that Fine Gael wants to build 40,000 homes and will do so.  For God's sake, he was the Taoiseach already.  They were in power for long enough.  Why, in the name of God, did they not build the houses then?  If they are going to be able to do it in the future, whey did they not do it in the past?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300046#YY00200","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1624461420,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill.  I appreciate the attempts that have been made to reduce the cost of renting for students and, indeed, for all renters.  There are many of them out there.  Something needed to be done because some landlords were looking for two months' rent as a deposit and a month's rent upfront.  For many people, that is not attainable.  They cannot pay that amount and have not been able to do so.<\/p>  <p>  One of the biggest hurdles that a family has to overcome is to provide the necessary funds for accommodation when their son or daughter comes of age and needs to go to university.  Many people are lucky enough to get the SUSI grant, but many other members of hardworking families do not qualify for the grant.  Whatever happens with Covid-19 pandemic, I appeal to the Minister of State not to let happen what happened last August, when the Government advised that colleges were opening.  Families from all over, including Kerry and west Cork, drove to places such as Cork, Limerick and Galway cities, and indeed to Dublin, to look for accommodation for their sons and daughters.  They paid deposits and rent for accommodation that was not used and had great difficulty in getting their money back.  Surely, the Government knew in the days leading up to the start of September and the start of term that the colleges were not going to open.  <\/p> <p>I do not believe the Government is going to allow the pubs to open for indoor dining and drinking given the way it is talking.  I would say it is after changing its tune.  I hope it does not change its tune on the students like it did last year.  Many of them did not get their money back.  That was very unfair and wrong.  Of course, the way to sort it out is to build more accommodation.  The Minister has stood up on various days and said money is not an obstacle.  If money is not an obstacle, put the bloody money on the table and build apartments in places such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway for the students.  It is an awful problem and issue.  There is a big event in every family's life when one, two, three or four children go to university.  They are entitled to do so.  They are entitled to be educated to the highest degree.  I am glad that, back over the years, Irish students have graduated and become professors, engineers, teachers, doctors and surgeons.  We are proud of them but we need that to continue.  We need to ensure accommodation is available.<\/p> <p> Costs are spiralling in the building industry.  We see ridiculous things happening.  Despite what the Green Party is saying, the cost of insulation is going up.  It is applying the highest rate of VAT to it.  What do the Greens stand for if they do not back up what they have been talking about?  What have they been doing?  They should not think they can cod the people because that will not happen.  They might cod some of the people some of the time and all of the people some of the time but they will not cod all of the people all of the time.

I am fed up talking about the levels of rents people are dealing with.  We are all aware that the rent pressure zone protections are not providing the protection required.<\/p>  <p>  We all support the restriction on the deposits that can be sought from students because deposits put them under extreme pressure.  This measure is necessary and needs to be implemented but, in the town of Dundalk and throughout County Louth, people are very lucky if they are paying only &euro;1,000 per month for a regular house.  Usually, it is &euro;1,200, &euro;1,400, &euro;1,600 or more.  Such sums are completely beyond the means of an awful lot of families.  They are competing against people who come to the area to work in some of the foreign direct investment factories in Dundalk.  These are all to be welcomed but the fact is that there is just not a sufficient supply.  That is the problem.  A large part of the Government's report card will be based on whether it addresses this.<\/p>  <p>  There has been an abject failure over many years on the part of many Governments in that they moved away from building social housing and, to a degree, half expected the market would kick into place and solve all the problems.

It is important that the mechanism has been put in place.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout Covid, the Government has stood resolutely behind renters.  This is its fifth Bill since it took office to safeguard renters throughout the pandemic.

Equally welcome are safeguards to ensure students will not be required to give notice of a period longer than 28 days before terminating their lease.

Just 475 renters have been able to avail of the Government's Covid-19 rent protections, despite 3,800 being in rent arrears.  The current legislation is simply not working.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that we recognise that we are all facing a period of economic uncertainty before the economy recovers and people are fully back to work.  Renters who work in the hospitality sector, for example, face a very uncertain period.  Many of them face reduced hours and precarious circumstances owing to the amount of work available to them.  Until the recovery, we need to provide protection across the board for renters who have been put in this precarious position through no fault of their own.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has submitted an amendment to the Bill to deal with the issue of tenants who face an increase in rent in the region of 8% due to a loophole in the legislation.  This concern has been raised with me by constituents, even those in rent pressure zones, who expect many landlords to take advantage of the loophole in the legislation that currently allows them to increase rent by 8% following the rent freeze during the Covid period.  Only three municipal districts in Laois&ndash;Offaly are designated as rent pressure zones, namely the Portlaoise&ndash;Abbeyleix district, the Portarlington&ndash;Graiguecullen district, and the Tullamore municipal district in Offaly.  The Mountmellick&ndash;Borris-in-Ossory district in Laois and the Edenderry and Birr municipal districts in Offaly are not covered.  In these areas, it is the Wild West.  Landlords are free to raise rents any way they wish.  That is no way to provide housing.<\/p> <p>An emergency three-year rent freeze is required to stop rents from escalating further and to ease the significant pressure on low paid workers who are renting.  Many families, particularly those in precarious employment situations, will simply not be able to meet significant increases and this can and should be dealt with as part of this legislation.  I appeal to the Government parties to accept our amendment.<\/p> <p> On a final note, we need more supply and everybody knows that.  This is not said in support of the nonsense that the T&aacute;naiste came out with last weekend where he was going to magic up 40,000 houses, but we do need increased supply.  Increased supply does not automatically translate into reduced rents or house prices.

I refuse to believe that any of them are living in the real world.  If they were, they would see how damaging our private rented sector is.  The only reason there has been reducing numbers of families and individuals evicted into homelessness has been the emergency measures introduced as a result of Covid-19.  The measures that we in opposition have been pleading for for years now, including a moratorium on rent increases and on evictions and longer notice periods, were all magically introduced in what were described as &ldquo;unprecedented times&rdquo;.<\/p><p>In the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI&rsquo;s blog, Time to tackle the private rental sector, published in April 2020, Paul Goldrick-Kelly wrote that despite the protection measures introduced to protect renters during Covid-19: <\/p> <blockquote> \tThreshold reports a surge in calls from private renters since the onset of the pandemic who fear they will not have a place to stay and warns that we may see a surge of homelessness as the emergency measures expire.

We used to have a really high rate of homeownership in Ireland.  In the 1990s and early 2000s, nearly four out of five households owned their homes but census 2016 showed that almost 500,0000 households were renting, an increase of 4.7 % on 2011, so for almost 30% of all occupied dwellings in the latest census, renting was the identified tenure status.<\/p><p>The NERI blog also stated:  <\/p> <blockquote> \tDevelopments prior to the current Covid-19 crisis coincided with substantial growth in asking prices for houses.  Between 2012 and 2019, the average price of a new home in Dublin nearly doubled to &euro;380,400 from &euro;200,000.  Under Central Bank rules, household income would need to be &euro;100,000 to qualify for a first-time mortgage for an average Dublin property.  This would place homeownership out of reach of over 85% of Irish households. <\/blockquote>  <p>We know that these prices have continued to increase alongside a Fine Gael narrative around &ldquo;generation rent&rdquo;.  Threshold reported that, in 2018, fewer than one in three private tenants was renting by choice.  The NERI blog speaks of &ldquo;inhospitable conditions on the market&rdquo; and that &quot;96% of private renters recently surveyed said it was difficult or extremely difficult to find accommodation.&quot;  Rents surpassed Celtic tiger levels.  The blog continues:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe RTB rent index shows that adjusted national private rents in the third quarter of 2019 were 25% above pre-crash levels and 67% above 2012 lows.  This rental inflation was particularly severe around Dublin, where adjusted rents were up by more than a third relative to the end of 200...<br \/><br \/>Insecurity in the private rental sector represented a leading contributor to homelessness. 58% of surveyed homeless families left their last stable home because of tenancy issues. <\/blockquote>  <p>Other civil society organisations have also presented evidence over the past number of years regarding the high numbers being evicted into homelessness from the private rental market.<\/p><p>In February of this year, Michael Byrne, school of social policy, social work and social justice, UCD, published a paper entitled, The impact of COVID-19 on the private rental sector: emerging international evidence.  The introduction states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe COVID-19 pandemic emerged at a time in which the private rental sector (PRS) in many countries was already undergoing change and facing a variety of issues and challenges.  PRS tenants are often most exposed to some of the major issues in housing systems, for example lack of affordability, insecurity, poor quality dwellings and overcrowding.  In addition, PRS households typically disproportionately face challenges associated with precarious employment, and are often concentrated in the service sector and indeed in frontline sectors, such as healthcare.  From the outset of the pandemic, many researchers highlighted the potential for these four sets of factors to interact in ways which were, and indeed are, extremely concerning with regard to PRS tenants.  The four sets of factors are: the COVID-19 pandemic, housing insecurity, economic implications of public health measures, and labour market issues. <\/blockquote>  <p>It is quite a depressing paper.  The financialisation of housing globally has led to insecure housing situations in many countries.  The four main issues affecting those in the private rental sector are listed in the paper as &quot;lack of affordability, insecurity, poor quality dwellings and overcrowding&quot;.  The fact that many workers in precarious industries are more likely to have been impacted by Covid-19 closures is highlighted in the paper.  Michael Byrne also states, &quot;The intersection of precarious employment and insecure housing is central to understanding the experience of renters during the pandemic, and likely shape their experience of its aftermath.&quot;<\/p><p>The paper usefully outlines some of the international policy responses to the pandemic: <\/p> <blockquote> \tThe pandemic has seen widespread emergency measures introduced in relation to the PRS across many jurisdictions. Across many countries a similar suite of measures has been introduced in response to the pandemic. These measures can be categorised in three key policy areas: eviction bans; rent regulation; and financial support for tenants.  <\/blockquote>  <p>It is always useful to look outside of Ireland because sometimes the Government can try to paint a picture that it is going above and beyond with its protection measures.<\/p><p>My final comment relating to Michael Byrne&rsquo;s paper concerns the idea of &quot;double precarity&quot; for households in the rental sector, namely labour market precarity and housing precarity.  In Ireland, it is more likely to be vulnerable cohorts living in the private rental sector.  For example, according to the paper: <\/p> <blockquote> \t...just under half of lone parent households are renting (compared to 36% of households made-up of a couple and children). Renters are also disproportionately non-Irish born. The proportion of non-Irish born households who are renting privately is 56% for EU-28 and 66% for non-EU 28 households. This is dramatically higher than the figure for Irish-born households, at just under 13%. Annual mean income of private renters is significantly below that of mortgaged homeowners. Similarly, almost a quarter of private renting households are at risk of poverty, while just 7% of homeowners are. <\/blockquote> <p>In the meantime, students are being asked to pay for between six and nine months' rent upfront, prospective tenants have reportedly been asked for three months&rsquo; rent in advance and, despite it being illegal, some landlords continue to discriminate against tenants in receipt of the housing assistance payment.  The Government does nothing about that and the authorities do not either.<br\/><br\/>We cannot discuss the private rented sector and how dysfunctional it is without mentioning how lucrative it is for private equity investors and institutional investors.  In quarter 4 of 2020, Savills Ireland reported deals worth &euro;533 million.  In 2020, a total of &euro;3 billion was invested in Irish property, with &euro;1.2 billion of that in the private rented sector.  Article 43 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann relates to private property.  It states: <\/p><blockquote>\tThe State recognises ... that the exercise of the rights mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this Article ought, in civil society, to be regulated by the principles of social justice.<br \/><br \/>The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good. <\/blockquote> <p>Imagine a government using the Constitution for the good of the people, rather than continuing to misinterpret Article 43.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300048#AAA00300","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624463220,"counter":327,"content":"<p>F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an deis p&aacute;irt a ghlacadh sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo.

It will extend the emergency period for a further six months to 12 January for relevant persons.  That qualifier is important.  The definition of \"relevant persons\" means the Bill is very limited.  It is limited to those who are unable to pay rent for two reasons, namely, being unable to work due to having contracted Covid or being in receipt of a State-funded payment introduced to alleviate financial hardship brought about as a result of the pandemic.  That is welcome, but very restrictive.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that for the first time, we are setting out what a deposit actually is, and that the Bill will restrict security deposits to a total of two months' rent, that is, one month's rent plus one month's deposit.  While it is welcome that that includes student-specific accommodation, I worry about the opt-out that will be available to students.  I ask myself why it is there and how it will be misused.  One of the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies stated that the explanation given to Opposition spokespersons in the briefing from the Department was that the opt-out provision was intended to facilitate foreign students who pay more than a few months in advance.  That may well be, but I could see it being greatly misused in regard to richer students with richer families who can come up with more than one month's rent and one month's deposit and ensure their place in accommodation already priced out of the affordability of most students.  Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify that in his closing remarks.  I welcome also the inclusion of what the Union of Students in Ireland canvassed for, namely, the 28-day termination notice.  That provision and the rent freeze extension are very positive and I expect the Bill to have the unanimous support of Deputies.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, we must put the Bill in perspective and outline the background to it.  From August 2020 to June 2021, almost a year, just 475 tenants had availed of the protection.  I had expected that we would hear some analysis during the debate of why that figure is so low.  It is marvellous that 475 tenants availed of it but we must bear in mind the number of households renting in Ireland.  It is difficult to find precise figures but the CSO stated in 2016 that 326,493 households were renting from either a private landlord or a voluntary body, although my experience tells me that the true figures are higher than that.  The figure of 475, therefore, is very low.  In addition, the private rented sector increased from accounting for 8% of households in 2004 to almost 20% in 2009, and it continues to grow.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation will put an end to the growing practice of requiring multiple months' rent upfront, a permanent change to the legislation in contrast to the extension to just January, and I welcome that.  It does little, however, to address the issues of affordability and indebtedness in the private rented sector.  The Minister spoke about how this is the fifth Bill related to tenancies that the Government has introduced, and he is correct.  We all agreed with him in regard to the previous Bills that sought to protect tenants.  He went on to state that only the Government recognises that 70% of landlords own just one rental property - including, as my colleague pointed out, a substantial number of Deputies - and that 86% of landlords own just one or two rental properties.  I fully appreciate that and understand that many landlords enter the market by accident, inheritance or a variety of events that might happen in their lives.  We must, however, take into account what has happened in the rental market.<\/p>  <p>  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service, in the research it prepared on our behalf before this debate, stated that while the private rented sector still comprises predominantly smaller landlords, as the Minister set out, REITs and other institutional investors have invested heavily in the Irish property market since 2014, although I might add that that is a result of Government policy that encouraged them to come in.  It stated that in a letter to the Government dated March 2019, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Adequate Housing noted that 93% of all assets sold by the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, went to foreign investors, and that by 2016, one third of all the properties sold were purchased by investors.  There is a strong trend here, all based on Government policy.  The research goes on to state that by the end of 2020, to bring us up to date, there were 15,500 residential units under the ownership of institutional landlords.  I could go on but I will not, given the limited time.<\/p>  <p>  Pre-legislative scrutiny was waived in respect of the Bill - I understand why, in light of the urgency - but if we keep waiving pre-legislative scrutiny on the important legislation that comes before the House, we will be tackling a jigsaw with each piece individually and not the overall picture.  There is a major housing crisis but it did not arise from the pandemic.  The pandemic shone a spotlight on, and brought into focus, what has happened with our housing system.  Another Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy stated that one gets bored talking about this.  I know exactly what he meant by that and what he feels, but we have a duty to articulate a different vision than that which the Government is putting forth.  Even though it has gone a long way to protecting some tenants, the number is extremely small.<\/p>  <p>  The Government accuses us on this side of the House of ideology, when all the time its own ideology is that which has led to the housing crisis, not overnight but deliberately as a result of Government policy.  The worst step taken was that by Fine Gael and the Labour Party in 2014 and 2015 when they introduced HAP.  They did so as a permanent solution to the housing crisis and that filtered down to all the local authorities, which were told there was no other game in town.  That was the sort of language I listened to as a city councillor in Galway when we attempted to bring the housing crisis to the attention of a number of governments and were utterly ignored.  When we got our quarterly reports, as I have said numerous times but cannot say often enough, from 2009 the column in respect of housing construction stated that it should be suspended.  From 2009, therefore, up to a year ago, we built no social or affordable houses in Galway, and that is a city where there is a substantial land bank if all the land is taken into account.<\/p>  <p>  Instead of that, we are proceeding piecemeal in the manner in which the Government is dealing with the housing crisis, as is reflected in the local authorities' approach on the ground.  We do not have a master plan in Galway.  More than 14 acres at Ceannt Station in the centre of town is being developed by one developer, the docklands are being developed by the Galway Harbour Company, while the Dyke Road site is being developed in conjunction with the Land Development Agency and the city council.<\/p> <p>There is also the Sandy Road site and 115 acres of land owned by the city council and county council just sitting there.  While we have a major housing crisis, we have a task force that has been sitting for more than two and a half years and has never produced a substantial report to tell us its opinion on the housing crisis in Galway or, more importantly, what the solutions are.  Letters are going to the Department.  We have an echo chamber in relation to a housing crisis and it is utterly frustrating.  I can say that from a privileged position where I have a job and a house.  How despairing is it for people on a housing waiting list, who are 15 solids years waiting for a house with Galway City Council, only to be told they will get HAP or RAS, or something else, but with no security of tenure?  That is the background to this Bill, which is positive and necessary, but it is simply a tiny piece of the overall picture.  I look forward to the day when we look at the overall picture and come up with proper solutions.  The Minister of State might do us the courtesy, I do not mean now but generally, of listening to us.  We generally come up with good ideas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300049#BBB00200","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624463820,"counter":329,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300050#CCC00200","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1624463820,"counter":330,"content":"<p>It is not for the sake of annoying Ministers but for working with them.

No one should be made homeless, especially in the middle of a pandemic.  This is common sense.  In years to come, people will find it difficult to believe that our housing Minister stood by and allowed evictions to happen in the middle of a global pandemic.  Without proper protection for renters, there is a real chance that this will be the Minister's legacy.<\/p>  <p>  I have been contacted by people who have received notices to quit - in other words, families and individuals who are being evicted.  A lady who has been renting for 11 years contacted me.  The house she is renting is the only home her children have known.  Last week, her landlord told her to start looking for a new place to live.  Where is the protection for families like this one who have been paying their way for 11 years?  This goes to the heart of the problem.  The Minister, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, and the Green Party have never understood what it feels like for parents to look at their young children and families, knowing they are facing eviction from their homes and perhaps even homelessness.  With all the Government's promises and commitments to solve the rental crisis in this country, what is it doing to protect families like this?  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to introduce secure tenure for families and renters.  We are calling for a ban on eviction until at least the end of the year, at a minimum, to give people some kind of security and peace of mind for the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  The measures in this Bill will do nothing to combat the scandalous conditions of rental properties in Cork city and nationally.  What is even worse is that through the HAP scheme, State money is paid to unscrupulous landlords for houses that are unsuitable and unfit for families and individuals to live in.  How is this Government allowing people to live in these conditions with mould, dampness, broken showers, broken heating and freezing cold cramped conditions?  All of these issues are being raised with me in my office weekly.  The Government is doing nothing and is allowing landlords to get away with this.  In fact, it is worse than this.  It is paying landlords to get away with this.  This is shocking and disgraceful, and it is no wonder that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are called the parties of the landlords.  Why is the Green Party abandoning renters and allowing Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to get away with this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300050#CCC00400","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speech","time":1624463820,"counter":332,"content":"<p>We now move to the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, to conclude the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300050#CCC00500","speaker":"1517"},{"type":"speech","time":1624463820,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I assure the Deputies that I am keen to listen to their views and to take as many of them on board as is possible.  It is about coming up with good ideas, unlike the last contribution which sought to categorised individuals.  Whichever political party Deputies are members of, I know most of them try to do their best.  I am certainly not a landlord.  I have a small three-bedroom semi-detached house in Mullingar with my family.  Contributions like that are unhelpful to this debate and are most frustrating.  We meet these very vulnerable people every day of the week in our clinics and try to assist them.  We should have a more constructive argument rather than using bland old one-liners that keep coming out.<\/p>  <p>  I thank all the Deputies for their contributions and I will do my best to respond to each issue that has been raised.  Having listened to colleagues, it is clear that we share a common purpose in seeking to secure tenancies for people impacted by Covid-19 and enhance their tenancy protections.  In my conclusion, I again thank members of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage for enabling the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Bill 2021 to be read a Second Time here today.  I understand and appreciate that the committee is diligent in carrying out its pre-legislative scrutiny of Bills and that it had wished to scrutinise this Bill in the usual manner.  Unfortunately, the urgency that applied to the publication of this Bill did not afford the time required for the committee to formally scrutinise the text of the Bill prior to its publication.  I hope that the briefing provided to the committee by my officials in advance of the Bill's publication served to mitigate the waiving of the formal pre-legislative process.<\/p>  <p>  I am very grateful to the committee for approving the waiving of the pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill.  It was the correct decision.  Without the waiver, it would not be possible to ensure the enhanced tenancy protections would continue to be in operation without interruption beyond 12 July 2021.  In addition to this, the permanent amendments proposed relating to advanced rent payments and deposits can now be introduced in advance of the forthcoming academic term and, consequentially, will make things easier for students returning to on-campus education.  Students will have the certainty under restrictions on amounts that they can legally be required to pay their student accommodation provider to secure a tenancy or licence.  This will be important particularly during the pandemic and in light of the difficulty some students have endured in seeking refunds of large advance rental payments.  Generally, these measures will help all tenants into the future.  The measures aim to help tenants with affordability constraints.<\/p>  <p>  We will debate this in detail on Committee Stage, but I note some amendments have been tabled proposing that a deposit be defined.  I appreciate the concern in this regard but providing a legal definition for a deposit might actually give rise to unintended consequences.  It is considers safer for the current understanding of a deposit in the market to prevail and to provide the RTB with discretion in determining any related disputes in this regard.  The RTB will also be empowered to sanction any improper conduct by a landlord, in this regard, at the potential cost of &euro;30,000 to the landlord.<\/p>  <p>  The early publication of the Bill has afforded Deputies the time to submit amendments for debate on Committee Stage.  The issues in question are very familiar to us.  When the Government extended protections under the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 in March, for tenants with rent arrears on foot of Covid-19 and at risk of losing their tenancy, we expected those protections would not be needed beyond 12 July.  However, circumstances have changed.  The unpredictable manner of Covid-19, coupled with the risks associated with variants of concern, have proven that we, as legislators, must be flexible and quick to react to ensure tenancies are secured, while respecting the constitutionally protected property rights of landlords.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is acting in unison to suppress the spread of Covid-19 and to mitigate its impacts on people.  The success of the vaccination programme and of the sustained adherence to public health advice in combating Covid-19 will inform any future decisions taken in the context of the rental sector.  The protections contained in the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act safeguard the most vulnerable tenants from eviction and rent increases during the emergency period, ending on 12 July 2021.  This Bill pushes that expiry date out until 12 January 2022.  That is one of the key purposes of the Bill.  Our goal is to protect tenants during Covid-19.  Our goal since last March has been that every tenant, and his or her landlord, is afforded the right to be protected as well.  As this is a six-month extension of the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act, I ask the House to support this protection.<\/p>  <p>  The Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act introduced similar temporary tenancy protections to those protection under the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020.<\/p> <p>The Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act covers the period from 11 January 2021 to 12 July 2021, while recognising the constitutionally protected property rights of landlords.  The ongoing threat from Covid-19 necessitated the enactment of the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act on 19 December 2020.  We need to recognise through this Bill that Covid-19 continues to present serious public health risks and related economic risks.  Extending the enhanced protections for our most vulnerable tenants for a further six months, until 12 January 2022, will provide certainty for tenants and landlords.<\/p> <p> When we introduced the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020, a number of Opposition Deputies declared there would be a deluge of evictions and tenants would be put out of their homes and on to the street.  This has not been borne out.  There were 475 declarations served by tenants and 44 by landlords between last August and the end of May of this year to gain enhanced tenancy protection.  During the same period, 3,810 warning letters were issued for rent arrears.  While 1,122 notices of terminations were served grounded in rent arrears, in the context of approximately 300,000 private tenancies, that number is relatively low.  It is worth noting that a notice of termination does not always result in an eviction.  For example, a landlord could serve the notice as a warning mechanism to get a tenant to meet his or her obligations.<\/p> <p> I reiterate and underline that while the numbers directly invoking this protection have been small, it has provided a strong safety net to vulnerable renters and sends a clear signal to the rental system that the State will protect tenants.  In this context, and because of strong direct financial support, we have prevented turmoil in the rental system.  Sustaining a secure tenancy is important.  Rent needs to be paid to secure accommodation and can be paid with State support, if needed.  The State will help people in their homes and I encourage tenants to reach out if they need such help.  A range of State supports are available to help tenants to sustain their tenancy and fulfil their legal obligation to pay rent.  The Department of Social Protection, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service and the Residential Tenancies Board are doing their utmost to support citizens.  Rent supplement is a key short-term income support to eligible persons living in private rental accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  My colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, recently provided a detailed account of the range of income and other supports extended to hundreds of thousands of people since the start of the pandemic.  During an unprecedented 12 months, the Department provided &euro;11.5 billion in weekly payments and other supports introduced to assist people impacted by Covid-19. <\/p> <p> Research by the ESRI and, more recently, the Central Statistics Office and the Central Bank indicates the gross median income of Irish households would have fallen by almost 20% in the second quarter of 2020 without the intervention of Government supports such as the pandemic unemployment payment, the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the enhanced wage subsidy scheme.  In practice, income supports cushioned the income effect and were particularly effective for low-income households.  The Department of Social Protection's analysis late last year, similarly to that of the ESRI, indicates that for most households in the lower 40% of income distribution, the income supports came close to fully cushioning the income losses due to Covid-19 and related employment lay-offs.<\/p> <p> I thank the Union of Students in Ireland for its engagement over recent months on student accommodation.  It is particularly concerned about students being asked to pay up to a year's rent in advance and having to provide lengthy termination notices.  The measures included in this Bill will go some way to alleviating its concerns.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, continues to work with our colleague, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, to deliver more accommodation for students through the national student accommodation strategy.  At the end of 2020, 10,742 bed spaces had been completed in student-specific accommodation since July 2016, with a further 3,337 bed spaces in development on-site.  <\/p> <p> I thank the Ceann Comhairle and all Deputies for facilitating the swift passage of this Bill and ensuring these protections are in place for tenants in financial difficulty directly due to Covid-19.  I assure Deputies that no tenant who needs help and enhanced protection from the State during Covid-19 will go without it.  The protections of the Planning and Development, and Residential Tendencies, Act will help any tenant in financial difficulty while seeking financial support from the State to pay the rent.  Tenants need to act as early as possible to avoid a build-up of rent arrears but can be assured of the State's support at this time.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, looks forward to debating with Deputies the proposed amendments on Committee Stage shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300050#CCC00600","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1624464420,"counter":335,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998: Motion","time":1624464420,"counter":336,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300051#DDD00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1624464420,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann resolves that sections 2 to 4, 6 to 12, 14 and 17 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 (No. 39 of 1998) shall continue in operation for the period beginning on 30th June, 2021 and ending on 29th June, 2022. <\/blockquote>  <p>The two motions before Deputies today seek the continuation in force of important provisions in law aimed at combatting terrorism and organised crime.

It is also clearly established that these groups operate hand in hand with organised criminals. <\/p><p>As Minister for Justice, I pay tribute to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, who continue to work tirelessly and co-operate closely to preserve life and counter all threats from terrorism.  Paramilitaries have consistently demonstrated that they are ruthless, reckless and cowardly.  They continue their attempts to murder and main PSNI officers.  The callous targeting of a part-time prison officer in April underlines their cold-blooded nature.  North-South co-operation in this area is crucial and the benefits of same are obvious from successful joint operations and the recent cross-Border investigation targeting ongoing crime. <\/p><p>While the 1998 Act was a response to a domestic threat as an open democracy, it is important we do not lose sight of the threat from international terrorism.  Ireland is not immune from this threat and many provisions of the Offences against the State Acts form part of the State's response to that threat.  We continue to work closely with EU and international partners in remaining vigilant against that threat.<\/p><p>An independent expert review group under the chairmanship of former Court of Appeal judge, Mr. Justice Michael Peart, has been established to review the Offences against the State Acts.  This comprehensive review will deliver on a commitment given during this debate last year.  This is an important and timely process because nearly 20 years have passed since these powers were last subject to a detailed review.  I am grateful to the expert members for giving their time to this important work.  The chair of the group has confirmed to me that an interim report is being finalised by the group and I expect to receive that in the near future.  That report will detail the work undertaken by the group along with its assessment of the time required to bring this substantial body of work to conclusion. <\/p><p>In the meantime, the report laid before this House notes the clear view of the Garda authorities that the Act continues to be one of the most important tools in the ongoing efforts in the fight against terrorism.  As Minister for Justice, I must have regard to the views of the Garda Commissioner.<\/p> <p>In the circumstances I must conclude that these provisions continue to be required and that they should remain in operation for a further 12 months.  By that time, I expect to have the benefit of the group's final report.<\/p> <p> Section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 is also the subject of the motion before the House.  It refers to a small number of serious, organised crime offences that are set out in Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  Section 8 of the 2009 Act makes these scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the Offences against the State Act 1939, which means that trials for these offences are to be heard in the Special Criminal Court subject to the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to direct that the offences be tried in the ordinary courts.  The purpose of this provision is to guard against the possibility of interference with jury trial by ruthless criminal groups.  The report on this section includes information provided by the Garda Commissioner on the use over the past 12 months of the provisions in question and details of the offences in question.  The report outlines that in the past year five individuals have been convicted in the Special Criminal Court in respect of offences to which section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act applies.  One of those individuals was convicted of directing a criminal organisation and received a lengthy sentence.<\/p> <p> Every Member is in no doubt as to the length these criminal groups are prepared to go to thwart the justice system and to maintain a climate of fear and intimidation in communities.  They have no regard for the damage their activities cause for families throughout the country.  They have no regard for the rule of law, and they will stop at nothing in pursuit of their criminal gain.<\/p> <p> As set out in the two reports that have been laid before the House, it is the clear view of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the provisions in the 1998 and 2009 Acts continue to be necessary and effective in ongoing efforts in the fight against terrorism and serious organised crime.  On the basis of the information set out in the report, and on the advice of the Garda authorities, I commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300051#DDD00400","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624465020,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her statement.  Every year we come to the House to examine the Offences against the State Act.  The clear difficulty we have in this country with organised crime gangs, in particular international drug gangs, is something for which we all share an abhorrence, given the toll they take on communities the length and breadth of the country, especially in inner city areas where drugs are a serious problem.  The legislation has come under scrutiny for many years from international players who identify difficulties with it that need to be resolved.  I am grateful that at last a review of the legislation is under way.  It must be progressed as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I am reassured by the Minister saying an interim report is expected soon.  I hope that before we return here this time next year not only will we have the report but we will make changes to the legislation to ensure that it is robust and stable and does not attract any attention from international human rights observers in the way the present legislation does.  We need robust legislation.  We must be able to defeat the criminal elements that run amok the length and breadth of the country and internationally.  We see the international element of it with the recent cyberattack on the HSE and what it has done in respect of it.  We are all very conscious that we need good laws.  We need firm laws and for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be properly resourced to deal with these situations.<\/p>  <p>  Today, we received the quarterly report on crime figures for the first quarter of this year.  We see that crime has reduced.  If there is a lesson to be learned from that, it is that the presence of garda&iacute; on the streets and visibly doing their work in the community has an impact, as they have been throughout the pandemic.  That is one of the good news stories of the pandemic.  Burglaries and assaults are down while the seizure of drugs and arms has increased.  It is very clear from the report that we should all take solace from the fact that the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the streets is having an effect.<\/p>  <p>  Tomorrow, the Commissioner is going before the Policing Authority to speak about the cancellation of 3,000 emergency 999 calls.  It would be appropriate for the Minister to at least apologise in solidarity with the thousands of people who were let down by the Garda in respect of this serious issue.  If she can, it would be appropriate for the Minister to address the issue in her closing remarks and to apologise to those people who have been let down.  There may be many more who have been let down in a similar way.<\/p>  <p>  To return to the legislation before us, a review is taking place and it should put us in a new place.  I hope that is what will happen.  For that reason, we will not oppose the legislation this year.  I will hand over to Deputy Daly to make some concluding remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300052#EEE00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1624465020,"counter":340,"content":"<p>It is heartening to see that in one of the reports that was laid before the House that the Minister accepts that some of these emergency provisions are a departure from normal practice.  Many of the human rights leaders to whom we spoke recently accept that emergency provisions which are outside the norm tend to persist the longer they exist and if they are not used, they should cease.  The annual renewal is not satisfactory, but rather than putting more appropriate legal architecture in place, successive Governments have sometimes used the renewal as a political football.  It is 20 years since a review under the late, great Mr. Justice Hederman, and a review is welcome now.<\/p>  <p>  The second issue is the lack of oversight.  There is no doubt that there are cases going to the Special Criminal Court at the moment that should not go there.  It is simply not right that, as was said recently, a civil servant should have the power to refer cases to the court without reason, challenge or explanation.  We called for a review last year, as we believe the legislation is outdated and belongs to another era.  The review group has been appointed and it has some excellent members.

I also take note of the Minister's promise of an interim report shortly.  In the meantime, we are asked to continue in force certain provisions of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 and the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.  That is the motion before the House.  The provisions to be renewed again fall into two categories.  First, those enactments created new offences and, second, the provision of the ordinary courts are deemed as inadequate to try these offences and therefore they should be tried in the Special Criminal Court.  On the first matter, if these offences are now a permanent feature of our law they should be made so, and not subject to annual review.  We must have a proper debate upon that.<\/p><p>In terms of cases being brought to the Special Criminal Court, the background to that Article 38.3.1<sup>o<\/sup>of the Constitution allows for special non-jury courts to be established by law.<\/p> <blockquote> \tSpecial courts may be established by law for the trial of offences in cases where it may be determined in accordance with such law that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice, and the preservation of public peace and order. <\/blockquote>  <p>The process involved is a two-stage one.  The first is where special courts are established and the second is that the cases to be tried are those determined in accordance with the law as cases deemed inadequate for the ordinary courts.  The Constitution does not state that the Oireachtas itself will decide and set out in the law those offences in respect of which the ordinary courts are inadequate.  It states that such determination is made &quot;in accordance with such law&quot;.  The determination is quite clear when one reads the Irish text of the Constitution to be consequent on the passing of law to be made &quot;de r&eacute;ir an dl&iacute; sin&quot;, in accordance with that law, rather than the law being included in the text of the Bill itself.  That is not a semantic point.  If it is made in accordance with laws, there has to be a process of determination that cases cannot be tried before the normal courts.  Previously, that judgment or determination was made by Government order under the Offences against the State Act 1939.  Having regard to the Minister for Justice's role in policing and the reporting relationship between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Government, the Minister presumably had the information needed to make those decisions, but under these two Acts, the Oireachtas took that decision-making upon itself.  That causes problems.<\/p> <p>What we are asked to do is make a determination that, in certain cases, we, as Oireachtas Members, are determining that they have to go to a special court, and the normal constitutional provisions would be set aside.  That is a very onerous thing.  There is much case law that I cannot go into in the five minutes I have.  However, I know the Abbeylara case very well because I was involved in it, and all the judges recognised that the Oireachtas was entitled to make inquiries in regard to legislation, but in all of that there had to be a transparent process so the Oireachtas was visibly enabled to make that decision.<\/p> <p> When that particular point was made by Deputy Sean Sherlock in 2019, the then Minister for Justice said it was reasonable to assume that Members - that is, each Member of the House - will engage in their own research, consideration and knowledge, the sum total of which will form the views of Members, including the views of Members as to the operation of normal courts and their capacity to administer justice.  In essence, what is expected of each Member of the House voting today is that we have done our own research and, on the basis of that evidence, come to the conclusion that the normal courts are inadequate to deal with this, and that the normal constitutional provision on the right of people to be heard in open court by a jury is to be set aside.  My great fear is that that will be challenged - there have been challenges in the past - and that it will be very hard to apply.  In the first instance, who in the Oireachtas is going to set out that that inquiry and reasonable investigation that the Minister for Justice says we should undertake is being done?  While the review is absolutely required, we need to change this process.  I hope Mr. Justice Peart, when he comes back in his interim report, will provide fundamental suggestions as to a change in the law so we will not be in this position next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300052#EEE00400","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624465620,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>- resolves that sections 2 to 4, 6 to 12 and 17 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 (No. 39 of 1998) shall continue in operation for the period beginning on 30th June, 2021 and ending on 29th June, 2022; and<br \/><br \/>- in the absence of any specific information being presented which points to the inadequacy of the ordinary courts in the administration of justice in Ireland with specific regard to offences listed under sections 6 to 9 and 12 of that Act, and acknowledging the views of multiple national and international human rights agencies that have raised serious concerns regarding the operation of the Special Criminal Court, resolves to proactively and progressively implement societal and justice reform measures which, within a specified period of time being no later than 2025, ensure that section 14 of that Act should not continue in operation after that date. <\/blockquote>  <p>Every year, this legislation is put before us and, every year, the debate seems to be more and more perfunctory.  A juryless court will once again continue with no regard to the constant and vocal opposition from international human rights organisations.  Last year, the House was promised a review and, last month, we were promised an interim report on the said review.  Yet, despite a hard legislative deadline, of which the Minister is well aware, we are once again asked to renew this legislation without any information as to why the ordinary courts are insufficient.<\/p><p>I want to highlight the second part of our amendment.  The Special Criminal Court is an emergency measure which has now been in place for 49 years.  It was needed 49 years ago, it has been needed and, I acknowledge, it is unfortunately still needed, particularly for issues like gangland crime, as the State has yet to enact alternative protections for juries.  However, to accept the constant continuation of this measure is to accept that, as a society, we will always be in such a position and that there are things that are so bad, from a crime and justice perspective, that we cannot do away with this court, to accept that we are unique in our challenges with gangland crime and dissident groups and to accept the UN Commission on Human Rights does not understand.  I find it difficult to accept that.  We are better than that and we should strive to be better than that.<\/p><p>The Special Criminal Court has a range of special powers which would not be accepted in the normal courts, including belief evidence, negative inference from silence and evidence being withheld from the accused and their defences.  It is one thing to make the argument that the Special Criminal Court is necessary on the basis of jury intimidation but on what possible basis is it legitimate to reduce the standard of evidence?  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties, Amnesty International and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission have all been critical of those procedures.  All have stated that the Special Criminal Court denies individuals the right to a fair trial and the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty.  The UN Human Rights Committee has repeatedly identified the Special Criminal Court as a violation of Ireland's legal obligations under the international human rights treaties, has expressed concern on the expansion of its remit and has called for its abolition.  Currently, the DPP is not obliged to provide a reason for referring an individual to the court where their human rights are in question.<\/p><p>We have a major problem with gangland crime, which I completely acknowledge.  It is corrosive in the communities where it is evident but it is not unique to Ireland.  The challenge this Government should be undertaking is to equip our ordinary courts to administer transparent justice safely and securely to all involved.  There are international examples to draw on to ensure juries are protected and free of intimidation, such as anonymous juries, yet there seems to be no desire to even consider these options.  Our amendment seeks to put a timeframe in place to deal with this issue because, if we do not focus attention, we will be here in five years' time or possibly even ten years' time, talking about the same issues, voting on the same legislation and being challenged by the same human rights organisations, for which most of us have a great deal of respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300053#FFF00200","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1624465620,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Paul Murphy, who is sharing time with Deputy Mick Barry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300053#FFF00300","speaker":"1517"},{"type":"speech","time":1624465620,"counter":345,"content":"<p>The Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, has described this Act as \"the single biggest denial of fair trial rights in our legal system\".  It is completely correct and that is why People Before Profit will be opposing this, as we have consistently done.  I would urge other parties to join us in opposing this, particularly the Green Party and Sinn F&eacute;in, which previously also opposed the extension.  The UN Human Rights Committee, Amnesty International and even former President Mary Robinson have all spoken out about these extraordinary powers.  They allow people to be locked up without the right to a trial by jury and without any actual evidence presented against them, just on the opinion of a garda.  We have seen again and again major scandals, corruption and abuses of power in the Garda.  Just remember how they lied about Maurice McCabe.<\/p>  <p>  As I mentioned, in the past, both Green Party and Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies spoke out and opposed it.  Last year, the Green Party, now in government, did a U-turn and backed it while Sinn F&eacute;in, after being pinned on it in the general election, said there was a review going on, got stuck on the fence and abstained.  Scandalously, again, they are going to repeat that this year.  It is disappointing and it is, frankly, cowardly, under the pressure of a little bit of criticism from the establishment political parties, to not do the right thing and vote against juryless trial, and to not vote against this massive abuse of civil liberties which Sinn F&eacute;in had traditionally voted against every single year until the pressure of last year.  In government, is Sinn F&eacute;in going to allow the continuation of this abuse of human rights?<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice recently talked about the need to use this juryless court against so-called subversives.  Who are these subversives she is talking about?  We saw during the water charges revolt how garda&iacute; admitted to tapping the phones of campaign organisers.  Were campaigners opposing austerity taxes considered to be subversives?  We have seen how the anti-Covid laws were used in the last year to threaten Debenhams workers and to ban taxi drivers' protests.  Are workers fighting for their rights to be considered subversives?  It is a warning to us all.  If we give this State extraordinary powers, it will continue them and use them against the will of the many.<\/p>  <p>  The central justification for the undemocratic and anti-civil liberties Special Criminal Court is the issue of jury intimidation.  That justification does not stand.<\/p> <p>No proof has been offered that this is a significant problem in our criminal justice system.  If it is, there are abundant alternative approaches which do not subvert the fundamentals of democracy and equality before the law.  The ICCL has offered a few examples, including anonymous juries, screening juries from public view, special protection for juries during trials, and video links for juries at different locations.  These are not new ideas in Irish law.  The uncommenced and now repealed Juries (Protection) Act 1929 had some of these protections.  On top of that, witnesses still have to give evidence during trials in the Special Criminal Court and are therefore a possible target of intimidation.  The Special Criminal Court was never needed, it is not needed now and it will not be needed in the future.  We cannot claim ignorance of the undemocratic and authoritarian nature of this legislation and cannot pretend that alternatives to it do not exist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300053#FFF00400","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624466220,"counter":347,"content":"<p>We will call a division on this motion and vote against it.

I support the extension of the relevant sections of both the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 and the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.  I will outline why I support these extensions.<\/p>  <p>  The Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 was enacted as a result of the terrible atrocity in Omagh, where 29 people were murdered by a group known as the Real IRA.  This was a terrible act which my home town of Dundalk has unfortunately been linked with on many occasions since.  The people of Dundalk were enraged by this heinous act and demonstrated at the time and many times since.  There is no doubt that paramilitary organisations are still active on this island and we need every power possible to deal adequately with this threat.  The bottom line is that paramilitary groups are totally opposed to democracy and the rule of law.  They will stop at nothing in an attempt to break the law, including intimidating people.  It is imperative that the authorities have enough power to deal adequately with these threats.  The extension of the relevant sections of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 deals with this.  There is no doubt that this legislation is not perfect.  As has been said many times before, it needs to be updated and improved, but until it is done, we do not have any option but to continue to extend these sections of the current Act.  I ask those who are opposed to this what a realistic and viable alternative is.  The bottom line is that authorities need these powers to carry out their duties.<\/p>  <p>  I support the extension of the relevant sections of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 for a further 12 months.  The Act was put in place to combat organised crime.  In the town of Drogheda in my constituency, over the last number of years there has been a turf war involving two drug groups.  The devastation and destruction that this has caused in the town cannot be overstated.  Families have been destroyed, lives have been ruined and lost, communities have been divided and young people have been scarred for life.  These drug groups have no fear of anything or anyone.  Life has no value for them.  Their only aim is to get more drugs onto the streets and destroy lives.  Without the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act, I believe that the crisis in Drogheda could have been much worse.  There is no doubt that these groups have no problem with intimidating witnesses or juries.  We have already seen that happen.  It should be noted that over the past 12 months, the garda&iacute; have made significant progress in combatting the activities of organised criminal gangs, especially in the north east.  This has been welcomed by the local community.  The continued use of visible patrols, checkpoints and other actions has no doubt been a significant factor in the reduction of gang-related violence in the north east.<\/p>  <p>  The report for the last 12 months until the end of 31 May 2021 shows that six arrests have been made under section 71A, 74 arrests have been made under section 72 and 24 arrests have been made under section 73.  The Garda Commissioner has reported that since the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, 530 arrests have been made.  In 2020, the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau seized in excess of &euro;36 million worth of illegal drugs, 23 firearms, 2,131 rounds of ammunition and &euro;8 million in cash, and made 228 arrests.  In this debate, we must consider the views of the Garda Commissioner.  He stated that this legislation continues to be important in the ongoing efforts to tackle criminal associations and serious organised crime.  He stated that he would welcome and recommends that the relevant section of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 be extended for a further 12 months.  As legislators, we must listen to those who are tasked with enforcing the law that we introduce.  I fully support the extension of the relevant sections for a further 12 months.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to listen to all sides of this debate but it is more important that we give people in relevant positions adequate powers to carry out their duties.  There is no doubt that Deputies here today will oppose this extension.  What can they offer as an alternative?  As I stated, the legislation is not perfect.  No legislation is.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and our courts must have the necessary power to carry out their duties.  Will those opposing an extension outline what they believe would happen if these powers were not put in place?  I once more put on record my full support for the renewal of these provisions for a further 12 months and urge other Deputies to follow suit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300054#GGG00300","speaker":"1600"},{"type":"speech","time":1624466220,"counter":349,"content":"<p>I do not necessarily have a problem with the fact that there is a Special Criminal Court.  It is provided for in our Constitution so there is nothing that I could do if I had a problem with it.  It is not unusual across the world to have a special criminal court or for certain offences to be tried by a non-jury court.  What I have a problem with, as has been repeatedly criticised by various forums nationally and internationally, is the fact that a non-scheduled offence can be certified for trial in the Special Criminal Court and that effectively cannot be challenged.  That has been criticised by many human rights bodies.  The Human Rights Committee has criticised it.  A review into it was commissioned by former Attorney General and former member of the Supreme Court, Mr. Justice Hederman, hardly a dangerous revolutionary.  They rarely hold such positions.  He found that this particular provision was offensive and recommended that it be changed.  It was not changed and we are here now for the annual rubber-stamping of the Special Criminal Court and the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act.<\/p>  <p>  This time last year, we were told that another review would be commissioned.  In Ireland, if people commission an independent review and do not like what it comes up with, they just commission another independent review.  Six months after we were told by the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, that work on the review was ongoing, I asked a parliamentary question of the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee.  The week I asked the question, it was announced who was going to be involved in this review.  I am glad that they are working but I question the delay in putting this review together.  I also question why we need a review.  There was a review before and a clear report about it.  International bodies criticised it.  I have a problem with the idea that a non-scheduled offence can be certified for trial in the Special Criminal Court and that cannot be challenged before the courts.<\/p> <p>I do not have a problem with certifying a trial.  The Garda or the DPP might take the view that the trial of a certain person or the trial of somebody for a certain offence might not be capable of being dealt with by the ordinary courts because of the possibility that justice might be subverted.  However, I have a problem with the fact that it cannot be challenged before the courts.<\/p> <p> During this year, Lisa Smith, a former member of the Defence Forces was charged with membership of a terrorist organisation, a matter which will be determined by the courts in the ordinary course.  However, it was certified for trial in the Special Criminal Court.  The idea that ISIS could subvert a trial in the ordinary courts in Ireland is as absurd as the idea that the Monaghan caliphate will be declared at midnight tonight.  It beggars belief.  The fact that that cannot be challenged before the courts brings the whole process into disrepute.  Even at this last minute I urge the Minister to not make a farce of the law in this way because these are serious offences, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said.  We are not talking about shoplifting - I am not saying that shoplifting is not a serious matter - but we are talking about very serious offences involving the possibility of the loss of lives.  That is all the more reason that justice should be done properly, transparently and openly, and that decisions that a certain type of case be tried before the Special Criminal Court should be reviewable by the courts in accordance with law, as almost every other administrative decision of administrative officers or indeed of Departments is reviewable by the courts.  International bodies and, as Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned, various domestic actors have also called for this to be done.<\/p> <p> I hope the Minister will give an assurance that there will not be another year where we are called upon to just blithely rubber-stamp this.  Even if she were to give that assurance, based on what her predecessor said last year, I would be slightly sceptical because I expect if this D&aacute;il is in place this time next year, this D&aacute;il will be back being asked to rubber-stamp the existence of the Special Criminal Court and the procedures in place which have been resoundingly criticised nationally and internationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300054#GGG00400","speaker":"1518","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1624466820,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I am standing here again this year to oppose the rubber-stamping of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 and the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 in our criminal code.  This has become a moot point every year, but I think it should still be opposed because we cannot simply give a <i>carte blanche<\/i>to the Government on this.  The right to silence and the inference included in that right being available to all citizens is and should continue to be a cornerstone of our justice system.<\/p><p>Putting forward these motions has assumed de facto permanency and the continuation of these powers is just a routine part of the criminal justice architecture in our State.  It has been rightly condemned by human rights groups throughout the world because the undermining of civil liberties affects all our citizens irrespective of whether they will ever be before the courts.  It is wrong to give the Government the impression that it can carry out these things whenever it deems fit.<\/p><p>There are reports laid in the Oireachtas Library on which these motions are supposed to be based, but I believe the reports are not fit for purpose.  They give the bare minimum of information that the Department of Justice probably deems is required to get these motions through.  It is a good job that the reports are not up to much because they only appeared in the Oireachtas Library on Monday and if they required proper or full study it would probably not be possible.<\/p><p>At the very least we need a report that gives a breakdown of why we need this law, what it contributes to our system and what are the possible alternative measures that could be carried out to preserve the integrity of the criminal justice system in a way that protects our citizens and preserves human rights.  Previous speakers have outlined some of those already.  It would do far more service to the country to consider those and put in place a system to ensure that those rights can be dealt with and people can be treated properly.<\/p><p>Over the years the Special Criminal Court has become somewhere the State can guarantee a conviction regardless of the soundness of the evidence presented.  Solicitors will not bother to put forward a defence or challenge evidence because they know that the outcome will be a conviction anyway.  One could argue that is not the fault of the court or the Government, but it is symptomatic of the way that the court is set up and required to run.  <\/p><p>Maybe the intention is that no one will challenge the evidence or lack of evidence.  This undermines our entire justice system and the presumption that justice can be achieved in the State as things stand.  It means that the lawyers who are supposed to operate the criminal justice system do not bother because they know that regardless of whether they put forward a counterargument, the court will guarantee conviction because that is what it is meant to do.  The State is quite happy with that and we, as legislators, are also supposed to be quite happy with that.  We are supposed to rubber-stamp this every year to allow this to happen.  That is wrong and it undermines everybody in the State.  It also undermines this House that we allow this system to continue.<\/p><p>I do not believe that the people who are tried in the Special Criminal Court could not be convicted in the ordinary courts.  I believe they could.  It would be far better for our system and for our democracy to do that.  It would be far better all round.  Those people would still be in jail and would still be convicted.  That is the reality of the situation.  The difference is that it is a bit harder and that the State would need to work a bit better.  What we are doing with this system is getting it over and making it easier for the State to do what it is doing.<\/p><p>I am opposed to the blanket endorsement of these provisions and believe that it contributes to the undermining of all our rights.  That is what this House must stand up for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300055#HHH00200","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1624466820,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I am grateful to the House for its consideration of these important motions and I thank the Deputies for their contributions, particularly those who spoke in support of the motion.  As I said, there remains a real threat from terrorist activity, particularly from dissident republican paramilitary groups, which warrants the continuance in force of the provisions of the 1998 Act.  The provisions we have discussed this evening are important in supporting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in its efforts to investigate, disrupt and dismantle the activities of terrorists.  Likewise, the renewal of section 8 of the 2009 Act is an important contribution to the overall framework of measures aimed at tackling organised crime.<\/p>  <p>  Every Deputy in this House knows the appalling damage caused by organised crime, particularly the damage caused by the drugs trade to individuals, families and communities.  Supporting the great work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in tackling organised crime remains a priority for me.  I assure the House that the Government is fully committed to giving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the necessary resources to continue the work of combatting those involved in organised crime.  It is important that I acknowledge that work.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to make significant seizures of drugs, firearms and cash.  It continues to bring organised criminals to justice.  Importantly, it continues to prevent further loss of life.  <\/p>  <p>  The view of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as set out clearly in the report, is that the continued operation of this provision is required.  By renewing these important provisions this House is sending a message loud and clear that this State will not tolerate the activities of terrorists and organised crime groups and is committed in its resolve to see them defeated.  I am satisfied that the concerns raised by the Deputies will be taken into account as part of the review by the independent expert group.  The work of the review group is well under way and I look forward to receiving its interim report shortly.  In the meantime, I am seeking approval for the motions to extend the provisions for 12 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300055#HHH00300","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1624467420,"counter":353,"content":"<p>Deputy Catherine Murphy moved an amendment to the first motion.

I thank the Deputies for tabling the amendments although I cannot accept either of them.  To define \"deposit\" as is proposed in these amendments, which are well-meaning, is unnecessary.  Section 4 amends section 16 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, inserting a new section 16(a)(iii) which provides a new reference to a deposit a tenant might be obliged to pay.  Section 12 of the 2004 Act, which deals with the obligations of landlords, has included reference to deposits since 2004 without a definition of the term being required.  This is the explanation.  Those references are already there.<\/p>  <p>  The term \"deposit\" is not defined in the Bill to ensure that the common understanding of it among tenants, landlords, letting agents and the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, continues to operate in the market.  The provision of a legal definition could have the unintended consequence of restricting the RTB's discretion in dispute determinations as regards what should be considered to be, or to be included in, a deposit.  The broader the understanding of the term, the better.  A legal definition of \"deposit\" could serve as a term to be circumvented by certain parties who may wish to charge something like key money, for example.  <\/p>  <p>  The Bill aims to clearly provide that the maximum amount of money to be provided to a landlord to secure a tenancy cannot exceed the value of two months' rent, that any advance rent payment cannot exceed one month's rent and that any deposit cannot exceed one month's rent either.  The RTB considers a security deposit to be a sum of money paid by a tenant to a landlord, usually before a tenancy commences or on the date of commencement of a tenancy.  The deposit is held by the landlord and is returned to the tenant at the end of the tenancy once no rent arrears, bills, charges or other items are outstanding and once no damage beyond normal wear and tear has occurred.  The security deposit is considered the lawful property of the tenant until the landlord establishes a right to it.  For those reasons, I am not in a position to accept the amendment, although I understand the thrust of the Deputy's intentions in tabling it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300057#LLL00800","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1624467720,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I am willing to listen to what the Minister has said on this.

I thank the Minister for responding immediately on that issue.  That person, although he is still in what is obviously a very difficult situation, being homeless, has now been given his own-door emergency accommodation where he will not be vulnerable to infection due to not having been vaccinated.  He and I are very appreciative that the Minister has responded so quickly.  I thank him for that.<\/p><p>As I said on Second Stage, insofar as the Bill seeks to extend protections to a small cohort of tenants, People Before Profit will support it.  Support that protects any group of tenants from eviction or rent increases is to be welcomed, as are the decisions to bring into legislation some of the calls that the Union of Students in Ireland and members of the Opposition brought forward previously.<\/p><p>However, the Minister will not be surprised to hear that we think it is not enough and that all tenants, tens of thousands of them, are in a very precarious situation and need urgent protection.  In our view, the Bill should include much more serious, effective and comprehensive measures to protect tenants from eviction and rent increases they simply cannot afford when one considers that the vast majority of tenants are already paying absolutely obscene levels of rent.<\/p><p>As I mentioned earlier today, the minimum rent for a two-bedroom apartment in my area is &euro;2,000.  Very often it is more than &euro;2,000, such as &euro;2,500 or &euro;3,000.  Who can afford that?  In order to pay the rent for a two-bedroom apartment, one needs to earn &euro;24,000 a year after tax.  It is beyond belief.  It is thoroughly obscene.  On top of that, because of the blanket restriction on further rent increases that the Minister rightly introduced during the pandemic but which has now been lifted, we face a situation where the two rolled-up 4% increases over two years can mean that people are facing 8% rent increases on top of those kinds of rents.  It is utterly unacceptable.<\/p><p>It is equally unacceptable that tenants could be faced with eviction when there is no fault involved.  Good tenants who pay their rent, have not done anything wrong and are not engaged in anti-social behaviour could be evicted.  I want to stress that at the moment, if you are evicted, you are, in effect, in a homelessness crisis.  That is certainly the case where I live, as it is in most of Dublin.  Most people would say it is also the case in Cork, Galway, Waterford and many of the other epicentres of the housing crisis, such is the level of unaffordability and the extortionate rip-off rents being charged by vulture funds, corporate landlords or just landlords who think they can make a lot of money.That is not acceptable.  If there was a big supply of affordable rental accommodation, one might say maybe it is okay that people can be evicted, but in a situation where there is nothing out there that is affordable and 100,000 families are, in one way or another, on social housing lists, transfer lists or a HAP transfer list with no chance of getting a property, there is nothing there for them.  Almost as a matter of definition, if one is evicted, one is very likely in a homelessness crisis.<\/p><p>I have previously mentioned the St. Helen's Court residents to the Minister.  I hope he might intervene in the effective way he did today in terms of their plight.  They are in a dire situation.  These are elderly people, working people who pay their rent and so on.  This community is facing the prospect of being in emergency accommodation in the coming weeks because the protections they enjoyed during the pandemic have no been lifted and this Bill does not provide them.<\/p><p>The amendments in this grouping are an attempt to address that issue and to bring into the Bill protections for all tenants for the duration of the emergency period at a minimum so that they evolve.  These are amendments to the emergency legislation.  They provide that for the emergency period, that is, for as long as the pandemic is with us, there should be absolutely no question of anybody being evicted and, similarly, there should be no question of people having further rent increases imposed on them.  In addition, when the period ends there should be no question of rent increases being backdated or accumulating such that people face an 8% or potentially a 12% rent increase.Even those who are protected by the Bill could find themselves getting a 12% increase.  There should be no backdating of those increases.  That is what these amendments do.<\/p><p>By the way, that is only as a stopgap.  We need not just pandemic-related protections for all tenants, but fundamental reform in the legislation to protect tenants properly.  Nobody who pays their rent and is a good tenant should face eviction.  If landlords are selling, they should be required to do so with tenants <i>in situ<\/i>.  As regards the stopgap, if the Minister accepts these amendments, which I know he will not do, he should then bring in legislation that will give that protection to tenants and, similarly, bring in rent controls.  I do not see what other way it can be done because I do not believe for one minute that rents are going to come down even if the supply to which the Minister often refers increases and so on.  There is no real prospect of the current unaffordable rents coming down.  We need rent controls, as are standard in many countries.  Even in the heart of capitalism, in New York and places like that, the authorities set rents at affordable levels and that is what should happen here.  People from a rent board or the local authority should go in, look at a property and say a particular figure is as much as can be charged for that property.  That is what we actually need to protect tenants.<\/p><p>I do not know whether the current by-election might spur the Minister on a bit.  It certainly spurred the T&aacute;naiste into making some fairly remarkable promises.  It might be worth the Government bearing in mind while considering these amendments that there is a significant number of renters in Dublin Bay South.  Many of the people to whom I have spoken on the doorsteps have asked what will be done for tenants and renters.  I think the Minister should take this opportunity.  If it protects tenants, I do not care that it might get a few votes for Fianna F&aacute;il.<\/p><p>This is the time when we have to protect tenants from unjust evictions and the extortionate rents they are now facing.  At the very least, the Minister could accept these amendments which would mean that for the full duration of the emergency period, that is, until the emergency legislation is repealed, there will be no rent increases and no evictions.  A lot of people would benefit from that, including the tenants in my area whom I have mentioned and who are now facing the imminent threat of eviction and homelessness when they have done absolutely nothing wrong.  I appeal to the Minister to seriously consider these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062300058#MMM00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1624468020,"counter":376,"content":"<p>These are crucial amendments.
