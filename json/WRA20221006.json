The EU&rsquo;s door remains open. As Commission Vice President &Scaron;efcovic has pointed out time and again, the EU has always shown flexibility in its approach to finding solutions and will continue to do so.<\/p><p>I am therefore heartened that Vice President &Scaron;efcovic and Foreign Secretary Cleverly have announced that technical talks between the EU and UK negotiating teams will recommence this week. This is precisely what this Government and the European Union have been calling for over the course of the past few months.  <\/p><p>The appointment of Prime Minister Truss and her new team has seen seen a welcome increase in engagement at political level between the Commission and the EU as well as between Irish Government and their UK counterparts. <\/p><p>The Taoiseach had a warm engagement with PM Truss on 18 September and I have had positive early discussions with both Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Chris Heaton Harris. It is constructive that all these engagements have been underpinned by a clear message of a commitment to negotiated joint solutions.<\/p><p>I will meet the Foreign Secretary in London this evening for more in-depth discussion on the Protocol and also on the range of global challenges we continue to work on, including as members of the UN Security Council.<\/p><p>I am also looking forward to building on my initial productive meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland when I meet him again at the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference meeting in London tomorrow. <\/p><p>I have also continued to meet the political parties and key stakeholders in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>In the course of all my engagements, I have expressed my view that our focus must remain on the formation of an Executive in Northern Ireland. With the October 28th deadline rapidly approaching, I would urge the DUP to re-assess their approach. The deadline is a firm, legal one. Their decision to prevent the establishment of an Executive is a political choice. I would urge them to make a better choice.<\/p><p>I recognise and acknowledge the serious concerns that many, particularly in the unionist community, have around the implementation of the Protocol. However, the EU&rsquo;s position has always been to ensure that the arrangements required as a result of Brexit - and in particular the type of Brexit chosen by the British Government - would operate in a way that impacts as little as possible on people&rsquo;s everyday lives, including in relation to East-West trade.<\/p><p>Therefore, discussions aimed at resolving issues over the Protocol can proceed in parallel to the process of Executive formation &ndash; it should not be a barrier to Northern Ireland&rsquo;s elected representatives reconvening to give voice to the people of Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach, Minister of State Byrne and I remain in close contact with our European partners and with the European institutions at all times. Our EU partners continue to show full solidarity with Ireland, as has been the case throughout the Brexit process. <\/p><p>I remain in close contact with Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efcovic  and, like all my EU counterparts, fully support the approach the Commission is taking to find solutions. There remains a shared understanding on the importance on finding solutions on the issues of most concern to people and businesses.<\/p><p>There is sufficient flexibility within the existing framework of the Protocol and the Commission proposals to address these concerns, if the political will to pursue a solution that works in the interest of Northern Ireland exists.<\/p><p>We also remain in close contacts with key interlocutors in the US administration and Congress. We are grateful for continued bipartisan US support for peace and stability in Northern Ireland throughout the Brexit process.<\/p><p>While the developments in recent days have been positive, it remains the fact that the British Government is proceeding with its legislation on the Protocol which, if implemented, would disapply core elements of the Protocol. This unilateral approach does not help build trust in relations between the EU and the UK. <\/p><p>I have made clear to our British interlocutors our concerns at this approach.  Wrapping actions in vague language around protecting the Good Friday Agreement serves nobody, especially not the people, business and elected representatives in Northern Ireland. <\/p><p>I will not waiver from the view that the Protocol strenuously protects the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, including avoiding a hard border, while ensuring the integrity of the EU Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it. The Protocol is an international agreement by two parties, and cannot be &lsquo;fixed&rsquo; by one acting unilaterally.  I firmly believe the issues raised around the Protocol can be addressed by the UK and EU working together to find joint, sustainable, pragmatic solutions.<\/p><p>More broadly, it is always worth repeating that the EU wishes to have a positive and stable relationship with the UK. We are partners facing the same global challenges, where upholding the rule of law is imperative. The current pressing priorities - such as war in Ukraine, energy, and cost of living crises - puts the importance of finding agreed solutions to the Protocol into perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600053#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Union","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600053#WRA01000"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[49073\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600053#WRA01100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the role that the Government will seek to play to ensure that all European Union Member States adhere to the rule-of-law functions which guarantee fundamental protection of rights and values for all its citizens.","asker":"1560","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p>The EU is a union of laws and values.

He also called on Israel to comply with international law, halt settlement expansion, and ensure space for civil Palestinian society.<\/p><p>The Middle East Peace Process also remains a key priority for Ireland during our term on the UN Security Council. Ireland engages actively in monthly Security Council meetings on the situation in the Middle East, which focus on the Palestinian question. Most recently, on 28 September, Ireland expressed concern regarding the recent increase in violence and incursions by the Israeli Security Forces in the West Bank, which has resulted in further loss of life and injuries to Palestinians.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600054#WRB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":41,"content":"<p>Question No. 25 answered with Question No. 8.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":42,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600054#WRB01300"},{"type":"question","counter":43,"qnumday":26,"qnumall":"[48920\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600054#WRB01400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if a Passport Office will be established in Ulster in view of the substantial increase in passport applications from that area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":44,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[49014\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600054#WRB01500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the reviews that have taken place within the Passport Office in terms of increasing capacity with the potential of opening a new passport office on the island; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1625","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":45,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 50 together.<\/p><p>The Passport Service has issued over 940,000 passports to date this year and 2022 will be the first year ever that over 1 million passports will be issued. The Passport Service is currently out-performing its previous busiest year (2019) by 17%. <\/p><p>Thanks to significant investment by the Government, substantial improvements have been made this year and normal pre-Covid levels of service have resumed.<\/p><p>Turnaround times for online First Time Applications have halved from 40 working days in March of this year to 20 working days. <\/p><p>84% of online adult renewal applications are being processed in 3 working days or less. <\/p><p>Demand for passports from all counties of Ulster remains steady. Applications from Northern Ireland are on average 11,000 applications per month or 10% of all applications. This year to date, 87% of applicants from Northern Ireland have applied through Passport Online. <\/p><p>The Passport Service is pursuing a Digital First strategy and promoting Passport Online as the quickest, most convenient and least expensive channel for applicants. This has allowed for the centralisation of passport processing resulting in greater efficiencies for the Service and for customers. The majority of Passport Service operations take place at the newly expanded Balbriggan Campus that now has capacity for 500 staff. <\/p><p>Passport Online is available to 97% of applicants around the world regardless of whether they are first time applicants or are renewing their passport. Passport Online has been hugely successful and over 90% of applicants from around the world now apply for their passport online. This has significantly reduced the number of applicants who need to visit the Post Office or the Passport Offices in Dublin or Cork to apply for their passport.<\/p><p>Currently, 100% of calls to the Customer Service Hub are being answered and customers can easily access the information they need through the Hub. In addition, my Department is implementing a staffing plan to ensure that excellent customer service is maintained during periods of peak demand.<\/p><p>The Passport Service continuously considers ways to improve its service to all of our citizens.<\/p><p>The public offices of the Passport Service in Dublin 2 and in Cork operate a four day urgent appointment service for renewal applicants. The Dublin office also offers a one day urgent appointment service. Recent figures for the Urgent Appointment Service show that just 28% of these appointments are being availed of.  Currently, about 1% of all passport applications are processed through the public offices in Dublin and Cork. <\/p><p>Any expansion of services would need to review the potential demand for an in-person urgent appointment service given the efficiencies built-in to Passport Online and in light of the fact that 84% of online adult renewal applications are currently being processed in 3 working days. <\/p><p>The Passport Service continuously reviews the range of services it offers while also strategically planning to respond to the future needs of the Service. In considering any expansion of existing services, a number of criteria are examined including the efficiencies that would be gained, whether the proposed expansion would improve the overall quality of the service and whether the potential benefits of expanding the service would justify the significant costs involved. Any proposed expansion would also need to complement the Passport Service's Digital First strategy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600054#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"United Nations","counter":46,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600054#WRB01700"},{"type":"question","counter":47,"qnumday":27,"qnumall":"[48633\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600054#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the actions that Ireland is taking in its role on the United Nations Security Council in relation to Western Sahara.","asker":"1570","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":48,"content":"<p>As per the UN designation, Ireland recognises Western Sahara as a non-self-governing territory.

To this end, I spoke to the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Chris Heaton-Harris, on 7 September immediately following his appointment. <\/p><p>Most recently, I met with the Secretary of State at Hillsborough Castle on 28 September. At the constructive and positive meeting, we discussed a broad range of issues including the importance of an election of an Executive in Northern Ireland, the Protocol on Ireland\/Northern Ireland, and the legacy of the Troubles. We agreed on the importance of the bilateral relationship between Ireland and Britain, as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, and on the need for an improved relationship between both Governments. <\/p><p>We discussed the current challenges facing the formation of a new Northern Irish Executive, the Secretary of State and I reiterated that the 28 October is the legal deadline for the formation of a new Executive remains firm and that, if an Executive, is not formed, there will be an election. The system of government at Stormont is at the centre of the Good Friday Agreement and it is paramount that the institutions of power-sharing are restored. It is for the parties, and those representatives that have been elected by the people, to come together to get the Assembly up and running, the NI Executive established, and the NSMC fully operational again before the 28 October deadline. The Irish and British Governments will continue to work to support these vital goals. <\/p><p>The legacy of the Troubles were a central part of my discussions with the Secretary of State. I reiterated the Government&rsquo;s position that the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill is not fit for purpose. I expressed the Government&rsquo;s opposition to the Bill as a unilateral move away from what was agreed by both Governments and most of the Northern Irish parties at Stormont House. <\/p><p>I also remain concerned about the compliance of the Bill with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights and other international human rights obligations, which I communicated to the Secretary of State. I also referenced the strong concern expressed about the Bill at the Council of Europe. <\/p><p>The Government is firmly committed to making progress on this issue for the families and victims that have been waiting for too long for truth and justice, and will continue to engage with the British Government to make clear our serious concerns and urge them to reconsider their approach. <\/p><p>We also discussed the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. Our focus must be on finding solutions around the movement of goods from Britain to Northern Ireland - this is the issue of most practical concern to people and businesses. Working together, we can maximise the benefits of the Protocol and address genuine concerns. Both my exchange with the Secretary of State and a phone call that I had with the new Foreign Secretary, James Cleverly on 15 September have been positive.<\/p><p>I look forward to further substantive engagements with the Secretary of State, and with Minister of State Steve Baker, when we meet in London on 7 October at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. The Minister for Justice will also represent the Government at this meeting. <\/p><p>The Government will remain in close contact with UK Ministers and seek to strengthen bilateral relations with the UK as provided for in the Programme for Government. I firmly believe that by working together in a spirit of cooperation we can jointly find solutions to the range of issues facing Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600054#WRB03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ukraine War","counter":68,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600054#WRB03900"},{"type":"question","counter":69,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[35895\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600054#WRB04000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which he has had discussions in recent times with his European Union counterparts concerned about security and defence in Europe arising from Russia&rsquo;s incursion into Ukraine.","asker":"1584","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":70,"content":"<p>Russia&rsquo;s appalling military aggression against Ukraine has highlighted more than ever the importance of European unity and solidarity in response to the challenges we face.

While both Revenue data and preliminary Census 2022 data show that vacancy lies within a range that is considered to be in line with a functioning housing market, it is important that the Government acts to ensure all viable housing stock is made available for use.<\/p><p>Accordingly, a new Vacant Homes Tax (VHT) will be introduced in 2023.  The measure aims to increase the supply of homes for rent or purchase to meet demand, rather than raise revenue. <\/p><p>The VHT will be self-assessed and administered by the Revenue Commissioners.  The tax will apply to long-term vacant residential property and will be paid by property owners. A property will be considered vacant for the purposes of the tax if it is occupied for less than 30 days in a 12-month period.<\/p><p>The VHT will operate by requiring owners of vacant residential properties to file an annual return declaring that their properties were vacant in the applicable 12-month period and indicating the LPT valuation band\/valuation that applies to the property. This will be used to assess their VHT liability.<\/p><p>The VHT will share some features with the existing Local Property Tax.

LPT that is deferred on or after 1 January 2022 carries a reduced interest charge of 3% per annum.

Over 13,000 projects have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to over &euro;1.15 billion.   The Programme for Government commits to continuing the SCEP and to prioritising investment in disadvantaged areas.  <\/p>  <p>  The 2020 round of the SCEP closed for applications on Monday 1 March 2021 and by the deadline a record 3,106 applications were submitted. The total allocation of &euro;150 million for capital projects, and &euro;166.6 million for the 2020 round in total, represents the highest level of allocation ever made under the SCEP.  <\/p>  <p>  Following completion of the appeal process, my Department is undertaking a full review of all aspects of the 2020 round of the SCEP and any recommendations arising will be reflected in the terms and conditions of the next round.  Following the completion of the review, the Department will announce the exact timing of the next round but it is hoped to have it open for applications early in the new year. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to sports participation generally, a fundamental aim of the National Sports Policy is to increase the levels of participation across the population, with a specific focus on less represented groups including women and girls. In May 2022, my Department held a Youth Stakeholder Forum on sport, where we gathered young people together in order to identify the barriers that are keeping young people from sport and gain some insight into how those barriers could be addressed. A report on that forum has been drafted and will help inform and direct the measures my Department takes to address youth participation in sport. <\/p>  <p>  In May 2021, Sport Ireland published its Participation Plan 2021-2024 and is now undertaking several initiatives under the Plan for children and young people, which will be delivered through Local Sports Partnerships, National Governing Bodies (NGBs) and other partners. <\/p>  <p>  In 2021, Sport Ireland launched the Girls Get Active Research Report. Following on from that report, Sport Ireland created a new funding strand through Dormant Accounts Funding to support Local Sports Partnerships (LSPs) in the creation of physical activity programmes targeting teenage girls. <\/p>  <p>  At present, Sport Ireland is working to establish a brand identity for teenage girls&rsquo; programmes rolled out by LSPs and NGBs. Sport Ireland is also tendering for the roll out of a communication and activation campaign targeting inactive teenage girls in Ireland. This will be the first time a dedicated national physical activity campaign has ever been created for this target group and highlights Sport Ireland&rsquo;s commitment in trying to motivate teenage girls to be more active.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it is suggested that the club mentioned by the Deputy should also contact its parent NGB, the Football Association of Ireland, directly to see what additional supports are available to it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600062#WRL03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1475"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","counter":442,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600063#WRM00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vacant Properties","counter":441,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600063#WRM00200"},{"type":"question","counter":442,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[49283\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600063#WRM00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if there are supports for owners of commercial premises which have been vacant for a long time to allow them to install the necessary services within the building to rent it out; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":443,"content":"<p>Planning regulations, introduced in 2018, which provide a temporary exemption for certain vacant commercial premises, including shops, services, offices, and guesthouses; from requiring planning permission to change to residential purposes such as &lsquo;over the shop&rsquo; living, have been extended until 2025.

This comes on the heels of the first Housing First National Implementation, which completed in December 2021, exceeding its four-year target by over 90 additional tenancies.<\/p><p>The report makes recommendations in the areas of data collection and analysis, and I understand that a pilot study on data collection of homeless deaths nationally is being undertaken by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department of Health. The research is applying the methodology used to compile the National Drug Related Deaths Index, which is a census of drug-related deaths and deaths among drug users and those who are alcohol dependent in Ireland. The data collection for 2019 deaths, including deaths among people who were homeless, involves the review of approximately 17,000 files from all Coroner districts. My Department continues to engage with the Department of Health and the Health Research Board on this study.<\/p><p>Dr. O&rsquo;Carroll&rsquo;s report also identifies that co-operation between different agencies and service providers is of critical importance. Under Housing for All, a new National Homeless Action Committee has been established. All of the key Government departments, agencies and stakeholders are involved.  The overarching objective of the Committee is to ensure that a renewed emphasis is brought to collaborating across Government to implement actions in Housing for All, along with bringing better coherence and coordination of homeless-related services in delivering policy measures and actions to address homelessness. Beyond this, the Committee will also have a role in addressing emerging homeless-related issues and in developing further responses.<\/p><p>The DRHE have advised that all reports on deaths in homeless services are reported both to the DRHE and the HSE. The DRHE does not have a role in establishing a cause of death as that is a matter for the Coroner.  I understand that the HSE confirmed to DHRE that it will attend a bi-annual review of the deaths in service reports and that a link person will be appointed to review critical incidents and deaths. DRHE works closely with the HSE to ensure the recommendations of Dr. O&rsquo;Carroll&rsquo;s report are implemented and some of the key recommendations, in particular the expansion of access to primary care services in private emergency accommodation have been implemented in the past year.<\/p><p>My Department is working closely with the Department of Health, the HSE and local authorities to continue to deliver the appropriate measures to support all individuals experiencing homelessness including those with complex needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600064#WRN03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":523,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600064#WRN03500"},{"type":"question","counter":524,"qnumday":208,"qnumall":"[49382\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600064#WRN03600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when his Department will issue the Ministerial Directive and guidelines to local authorities to allow them to process the new tenant purchase scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1482","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":525,"content":"<p>The Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme was reviewed in 2021 in line with Programme for Government and Housing for All commitments, with a number of changes subsequently coming into effect from 1 February 2022.

As part of this, Government approved a move over a six-year period to a level of Defence Forces&rsquo; capability equivalent to &lsquo;Level of Ambition 2&rsquo; (LOA2), as set out in the capability framework devised by the Commission, which will entail funding increases to reach a defence budget of c. &euro;1.5 billion (at January 2022 prices) by 2028 through the annual Estimates process. <\/p>  <p>The High Level Action Plan set out proposed implementation and oversight structures, and the Implementation Oversight Group met for the first time on  3 October. A civil\/military Implementation Management Office (IMO) has been established to support the implementation of the overall transformation programme required to implement recommendations from the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces. The initial focus of the IMO is the implementation of the 38 early actions as set out in the High Level Action Plan and the development of an Implementation Plan. Reporting mechanisms have been established to facilitate regular progress reports on the early actions to the IMO and the civil\/military Strategic Management Committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600066#WRP02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":593,"content":"<p>Question No. 231 answered with Question No. 230.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":594,"content":"<p>Question No. 232 answered with Question No. 230.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":596,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[49426\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600066#WRP03200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the degree to which Army pay, conditions, and strength of the army is in progress or otherwise; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":597,"content":"<p>The Deputy may be aware that a range of actions have been taken to address pay and conditions of staff in the Defence Forces, and the recent Report of the Commission on Defence Forces also makes a range of recommendations in this area. The Report proposes significant changes, including to the level of Defence provision in Ireland and recommendations in relation to capacity components required to achieve that provision.  This includes, inter alia, consideration of morale, recruitment and retention matters.  The Government&rsquo;s High-Level Action Plan (HLAP), launched in July, set out proposed timelines and oversight arrangements for its implementation, and identifies a number of pay-related recommendations for progression, including the intention to progress implementation of the following: <\/p><p>-  Removing the requirement for a 3 Star Private\/Able Seaman to &lsquo;mark time&rsquo; for the first three years at that rank;<\/p><p>-  Ensuring that all personnel of Private 3 Star\/Able Seaman rank are paid the full rate of MSA applicable to the rank;<\/p><p>-  Providing immediate access to the Sea-going Service Commitment Scheme to direct entry personnel in the Navy.<\/p><p>I am pleased to announce that following consultation with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, my Department can now proceed to implement the first two early actions, the removal of Marked Time and the payment of the full rate of MSA.

Fixed periodic pensionable allowances and allowances in the nature of pay also increased by 1% on this date.<\/p><p>The recently agreed, but yet to be balloted on, extension to this Building Momentum agreement,  provides for further increases in pay and allowances to all public servants, including members of the Defence Forces, under this pay deal. This extension provides for a 6.5 % increase, in addition to existing Building Momentum arrangements, as follows: <\/p><p>-  3%, backdated to 2nd Feb 2022<\/p><p>-  2 % on 1st March 2023<\/p><p>-  1.5% or &euro;750, whichever is the greater, on 1st October 2023.<\/p><p>Pensionable allowances in the nature of pay will also benefit.<\/p><p>In addition to general round pay increases arising out of ongoing national pay agreements, members of the Permanent Defence Forces have also benefitted from the implementation of increases in Defence Forces allowances, as recommended by the Public Service Pay Commission in 2019.<\/p><p>It is also important to note that for those Defence Force personnel who have specialist appointments, based on training or qualifications, there are a range additional allowances available to them.<\/p><p>All of these measures will have a further positive impact on the pay and conditions of Defence Forces personnel. <\/p><p>In terms of the Defence Forces strength, As at 31 August, 2022, the most recent date that figures are to hand, the strength of the Defence Forces was as follows:<\/p><p>-PDF was 8,146 personnel(establishment strength 9,500)<\/p><p>-  Army was 6,621  personnel(establishment strength 7,520)<\/p><p>-  Air Corps was 704 personnel  (establishment strength 886)<\/p><p>-  Naval Service was 821 personnel(establishment strength 1,094)<\/p><p>As Minister, my focus remains on restoring all branches of the Defence Forces to the current agreed strength.<\/p><p>I remain committed to maximising recruitment and retention of personnel, both male and female, to maintain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600066#WRP03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":599,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[49427\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600066#WRP03500","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the degree to which the Air Corps is in the course of being modernised and upgraded in line with other defence forces throughout the European Union in order to combat any imminent threat; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Air Corps Maritime Patrol Squadron supports this role providing aerial assistance to the Naval Service in patrolling the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) using the two CASA CN 235 maritime patrol aircraft which are due to be replaced in 2023 with the expected delivery of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft. <\/p>  <p>  The Naval Service Vessel Renewal and Replacement Programme is ongoing, this programme includes equipment upgrades along with the mid-life refit and upgrade of the P50 class of vessels.<\/p>  <p>  Two Inshore Patrol Vessels have been purchased from the New Zealand Government to replace L&Eacute; Orla and L&Eacute; Ciara, it is expected these vessels will be transported to Ireland in 2023 following the completion of a programme of works.

The report states that to achieve this would mean the Naval fleet should have enhanced air, surface and sub-surface search capabilities, with the latter allowing the Naval Service to monitor activity in the vicinity of sub-sea cables. In order to achieve these desired capability effects associated with a move to LOA2, specific recommendations made by the Commission, that were Accepted in Principle by Government when it published its High Level Action Plan, included an accelerated programme of Naval vessel replacement to ensure a balanced fleet of nine modern ships by early in the next decade. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600067#WRQ00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":610,"qnumday":238,"qnumall":"[49431\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600067#WRQ00800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the extent to which gender respect has been promoted and any attempts at abuse, sexual or otherwise, completely ruled out in the Defence Forces; if action has been taken to ensure compliance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":611,"content":"<p>I am fully committed to ensuring that every member of the Defence Forces has the right to undertake their duties in a safe environment underpinned by dignity and equality and by a culture of zero-tolerance for any kind of bullying, discrimination, harassment or sexual abuse.<\/p>  <p>  Over the last twenty years since the 2002 publication of the External Advisory Group on the Defence Forces and the three subsequent reports from the Independent Monitoring Group (IMG), a number of reforms have been implemented for addressing allegations of inappropriate behaviour, including harassment, sexual harassment and bullying, which are contained in policy documents and in Defence Force Regulation.<\/p>  <p>  The Defence Forces Diversity and Inclusion Strategy Statement and Action Plan additionally aims to ensure that a transparent culture exists, that encourages personnel to report inappropriate behaviour, discrimination, bullying, harassment and sexual harassment.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the reforms that have taken place in recent years however, it is clear from the experiences shared by both current and former members of the Defence Forces that the culture that is pervading, and the application of those policies, systems and procedures for dealing with unacceptable behaviour have not, and are not, serving all Defence Forces personnel well.  <\/p>  <p>  The work of the Judge-led Independent Review Group (IRG), established by me on 25 January last, following Government approval, is examining issues relating to bullying, harassment, discrimination and sexual misconduct, as well as workplace culture, in the Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the Terms of Reference the Group will:<\/p>  <p>  - Advise me on whether the current legislative frameworks, policies, procedures and practices for addressing incidents of unacceptable behaviour in the workplace are effective;  <\/p>  <p>  - Independently assess whether the pervading culture in the workplace is fully aligned with the principles of dignity, equality, mutual respect, and duty of care for every member of the Defence Forces and thirdly; <\/p>  <p>  - Will provide recommendations and guidance on measures and strategies required to underpin a workplace based on dignity, equality, mutual respect, and duty of care for every member of the Defence Forces.  <\/p>  <p>  This Independent Review is a necessary and critical step to fulfill my duty of care obligation to the men and women of the Defence Forces, to provide a safe work environment.

Applications meeting the criteria are approved by the NCSE and the NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  The NCSE continues to monitor and review the requirement for special class places in particular areas and has capacity to establish such new special classes where necessary, subject to the willingness of schools to open classes.  The NCSE welcomes expressions of interest from schools in opening special classes to meet the demand for special class provision.  In deciding on the location of a special class, SENOs take into account both the present and the future potential need for special class provision in the area, they must be satisfied that the special class is sustainable and appropriately located.  SENOs liaise with relevant professionals in their area to arrive at an informed decision.  <\/p>  <p>  It is the policy of the Department of Education, in accordance with the principles of inclusive education, that pupils with additional learning needs are supported in mainstream classes along with their peers, with additional supports provided as necessary. As such, the Department has not sanctioned any new special classes for children with specific learning disability (SLD) since 2011.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has invested considerably in ensuring that all recognised mainstream schools have been allocated additional special education teaching resources to cater for children with special educational needs, including pupils with SLD.  At the end of the current year, there will be 14,385 special education teachers and 19,169 SNAs working in primary and post-primary schools.  Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers have been published on my Department&rsquo;s website, at www.education.ie\/en\/The-Education-System\/Special-Education\/Guidelines-for-Primary-Schools-Supporting-Pupils-with-Special-Educational-Needs-in-Mainstream-Schools.pdf.  It is a matter for schools to monitor and utilise their allocation of additional teaching support to best support the needs of identified pupils, in accordance with my Department's guidance.  Schools are supported in this regard by the National Educational Psychological Services (NEPS).  The teaching time afforded to each individual pupil is decided and managed by schools, taking into account each child's individual learning needs.  <\/p>  <p>  Funding is also made available to schools for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers and\/or software to assist children with special educational needs, including children with SLDs, where relevant professionals recommend the equipment as being essential for the provision of education.  Schools apply to the NCSE, through their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) for such support.  SENOs make recommendations to my Department where assistive technology is required, in accordance with the criteria set out in my Department's Circular 0010\/2013.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department, therefore, provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools, which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs, including pupils with a SLD, to ensure that wherever a child is enrolled, s\/he will have access to an appropriate education.  As such, pupils with SLD have the option of attending their local school with additional teaching supports or attending a special class attached to a mainstream school or a special school.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department provides for special schools and special class placements where more intensive and supportive interventions are provided, including students with dyslexia.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note though, that the majority of students with significant literacy difficulties currently receive additional teaching support from a Special Education Teacher in a mainstream class. This is provided on the basis of the individual pupil&rsquo;s learning needs, identified in schools, as opposed to being based on a requirement for a child to have a diagnosis, or an assessment, of a particular disability.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may wish to note that the inspectorate is currently working to finalise its report on the outcomes of a series of special education needs inspections in schools with special classes for children with specific learning disabilities.  It is envisaged that this report will be with Special Education section for consideration by mid-October.  The findings of this report will inform future policy development in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600068#WRR01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":649,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600068#WRR01100"},{"type":"question","counter":650,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[49277\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600068#WRR01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will address the case of persons (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":651,"content":"<p>The School Transport Scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.

This Pathfinder programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 as included in the National Development Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600068#WRR01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":658,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600068#WRR02000"},{"type":"question","counter":659,"qnumday":254,"qnumall":"[49344\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600068#WRR02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when the results of the Junior Certificate Examination will be issued; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1511","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":660,"content":"<p>The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the state examinations. <\/p><p>In view of this I have forwarded your query to the State Examinations Commission for direct reply to you. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600068#WRR02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":661,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600068#WRR02300"},{"type":"question","counter":662,"qnumday":255,"qnumall":"[49350\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600068#WRR02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when refurbishment works will commence on a school (details supplied); the expected timeframe for completion of these works; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1511","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":663,"content":"<p>The project to which the Deputy refers has been devolved to the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) for delivery as part of a programme of school building projects.<\/p><p>The brief for this project is to provide a new build 24 classroom primary school including a 2 classroom SEN Base.<\/p><p>This school is part of &lsquo;Project Nore&rsquo;, and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the tender process for appointing a contractor for &lsquo;Project Nore&rsquo; is currently underway.<\/p><p>Following the completion of this tender process and a Departmental review of the Tender Assessment Report, approval for construction will follow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600068#WRR02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":665,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[49351\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600068#WRR02700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when refurbishment works will commence on a school (details supplied); the estimated timeframe for completion of these works; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1511","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":666,"content":"<p>The project to which the Deputy refers has been devolved to the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) for delivery as part of a programme of school building projects.<\/p><p>The brief for this project is to provide an extension and refurbishment to the existing school building to accommodate a long term projected enrolment of 1,000 pupils.

These investigations have sought to establish the facts relating to the operation of the institutions, as well as the manner in which those who were resident in them were treated. <\/p><p>In establishing the independent statutory Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes in February 2015, the then Government sought to ensure an independent and thorough investigation of what happened to vulnerable women and children in these institutions during the period 1922 to 1998. Notably, the Commission was specifically tasked with investigating concerns related to systematic discrimination within these institutions.<\/p><p>Following publication of the Final Report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, An Taoiseach offered a formal apology on behalf of the Government, the State and its citizens to all those who spent time in these institutions. In this apology, An Taoiseach acknowledged the failings of the State, over many decades, to protect vulnerable citizens, and to uphold their fundamental rights. The State apology recognised the <i>&ldquo;additional impact which a lack of knowledge and understanding had on the treatment and outcomes of mothers and children with different racial and cultural heritage, those who faced mental health challenges, or those with physical and intellectual disabilities&rdquo;.<\/i><\/p><p>It was further acknowledged that <i>&ldquo;such discriminatory attitudes exacerbated the shame and stigma felt by some of our most vulnerable citizens, especially where opportunities for non-institutional placement of children were restricted by an unjust belief that they were unsuitable for placement with families&rdquo;.<\/i><\/p><p>This State apology marked a starting point for further measures designed to address the needs and concerns of survivors and their families.<\/p><p>I am acutely aware that there is no financial payment which could make up for the immense pain and suffering endured by so many of our citizens whose lives have been affected by these issues.<\/p><p>The Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme is just one aspect of the overall redress package of supports and measures set out in the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Survivors and Former Residents of Mother and Baby and County Homes Institutions which seeks to provide an inclusive and enduring response to the priority needs of all survivors. <\/p><p>The proposed structure of the Scheme, with increasing financial payments depending on length of stay, recognises that higher payments should be made to those who were subjected to institutional conditions for a prolonged period.<\/p><p>This allows for a simple and non-adversarial application process, in which applicants will not have to prove abuse and the State can shoulder much of the administrative burden. <\/p><p>My Department and other state authorities are working to ensure survivors see tangible results as early as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600071#WRU00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts","counter":767,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600071#WRU01000"},{"type":"question","counter":768,"qnumday":289,"qnumall":"[49160\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600071#WRU01100","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if his Department has any contracts with a company (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1522","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":769,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that my Department has no contracts in place with the company referred to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600071#WRU01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Bodies","counter":770,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600071#WRU01300"},{"type":"question","counter":771,"qnumday":290,"qnumall":"[49180\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600071#WRU01400","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the name, function and establishment date of all the organisations and agencies that are funded by his Department; the number of employees in each; the salary of the chief executive in each organisation and agency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":772,"content":"<p>There are seven bodies under the aegis of my Department.

It also provides for the identification of remains and their return to family members, where possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Act allows the Government, by Order, to direct an intervention at a particular site where the criteria for manifestly inappropriate burials are met and to approve the appointment of a Director of Authorised Intervention to oversee and manage a phased, step-by-step approach to the excavation, recovery, analysis, identification (if possible) and re-interment of the remains. <\/p>  <p>  On 4 October the Government made an order to establish an independent Office to lead an intervention at the site of the former Mother and Baby institution in Tuam, Co. Galway, under the Institutional Burials Act 2022. The making of the Order follows on from Resolutions in the D&aacute;il and Seanad last month approving the draft Order that was agreed by Government in July.  <\/p>  <p>  In line with the Government Order, the functions of the Director of Authorised Intervention, Tuam will include carrying out a DNA Identification Programme, which involves taking DNA samples from eligible family members and human remains buried at a site and analysis of those samples by Forensic Science Ireland. The purpose of the analysis is to compare DNA profiles to establish if there is a familial link between people who believe they have family members buried at the site and the human remains that are recovered. <\/p>  <p>  The Act provides that Forensic Science Ireland can establish the Databases that will allow for DNA profile comparison following receipt of a notification from the Director that an Identification Programme is continuing. A decision to continue with an Identification Programme is taken by a Director where he or she is satisfied that there are family members of deceased persons still alive who may wish to participate in the Programme and where FSI has determined that the quality of samples tested are sufficient to enable DNA profile comparison. <\/p>  <p>  Following the making of the Government Order, I intend to appoint a Director to head up the Office as soon as possible.

For the 2022\/23 programme year, there all ECCE capitation will be paid at a flat rate of &euro;69 per child per week.<\/p><p>This is a departure from the previous approach which paid differential capitation rates to services depending on whether or not sessions were led by a graduate.

Core Funding provides funding based on a service's capacity (opening hours, number of places and age group of children), and graduate premiums for lead educators and managers. Base rate allocations for capacity at the sessional pre-school rate offers &euro;0.65 per child place per hour and the graduate lead educator premium allocation is &euro;4.44 per hour.<\/p><p>While Core Funding will operate in addition to and alongside ECCE (standard capitation), AIM, CCSP and NCS, it replaces ECCE higher capitation and incorporates funding previously allocated to the discretionary Programme Support Payments (PSP) from September 2022.<\/p><p>The change in approach to funding ELC Graduates is underpinned by the recommendations of an Expert Group, outlined in their report <i>Partnership for the Public Good<\/i>, and approved by Government in December 2021. The Expert Group noted that the higher capitation payment has diverted graduates away from non-ECCE provision, despite the importance of high-quality provision for under-3s. The Expert Group also reference a Focused Policy Assessment of higher capitation, which noted a difficulty in ensuring that the additional payment was passed on to educators.<\/p><p>Funding for ELC Graduates is now one element of a larger funding model, and is underpinned by Employment Regulation Orders setting minimum rates of pay in the sector, including differential pay rates for graduates in leadership roles. This will ensure that educators and managers with degrees will feel the benefits of the graduate premium payment being made to services. <\/p><p>Given the different approaches to funding ELC Graduates, it would not be appropriate to make direct comparisons between the previous ECCE higher capitation and the Graduate Lead Educator Premium in Core Funding.<\/p><p>ECCE higher capitation had been paid on the basis of the number of children participating in the ECCE session, not the number of hours of ECCE being led by a graduate. For example, an ECCE room with 22 children previously received 2.75 times more higher capitation funding than an ECCE room with 8 children.

I am pleased that with the enhanced financial transparency and public management underpinning the new funding model, we are now in a better position than ever before to make progress on this front. <\/p><p>The <i>'Independent Review of the Cost of Providing Quality Childcare Services in Ireland'<\/i>, published in October 2020 and the <i>'Analysis of the Rate of Surplus for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare Services in Ireland'<\/i>, published in October 2021, provide relevant information and insight into sector level data. <\/p><p>The sectoral information on rate of surplus in ELC and SAC in Ireland suggests that, on the whole, there are not excessive profits in the sector. However, there are significant variations across different types of provision. For example, the evidence suggests that ECCE-only services see the highest levels of income in excess of costs compared to other types of provision. The sector average rate of surplus is 4% whereas the characteristics associated with ECCE provision indicate surplus rates of between 14% and 23%. <\/p><p>This analysis was useful for the development of the new funding model, undertaken by an Expert Group and outlined in their report, <i>'Partnership for the Public Good: A New Funding Model For Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare'<\/i>, published in December 2021. The Expert Group stated that the reports provide a good argument for increased financial transparency to be assured of the position on surplus\/profits in the sector.<\/p><p>The Expert Group noted that in designing the funding model, it is important to consider the impact of public funding on a privately delivered sector. They further noted that while it is entirely appropriate that providers earn a fair and reasonable income, it is important to ensure that profit is not the primary motive for providers in this sector. This is particularly important given the scale of public funding in the sector, which will exceed &euro;1 billion in 2023 as recently announced in the budget. <\/p><p>One of the key arguments outlined in the Expert Group report is that, in essence, the State has a right and a duty to ensure that the market serves the public good. For this, my Department will be monitoring emerging trends in the model of delivery, identifying any threats to the public interest, such as profiteering or financialisation, or sustainability issues, in order to take appropriate mitigation measures. <\/p><p>The collection of information on income and costs is essential for the full understanding of this complex and diverse sector in order to inform the development of policy. As recommended by the Expert Group, there needs to be full visibility and understanding of financial information in the sector in order to better understand the impact and interaction of income, costs, surplus and profit in the sector. <\/p><p>I am pleased therefore that the recent data collection for the 2021\/2022 Annual Sector Profile, including questions on income and costs, has been completed by 93% of services. This new and emerging data will allow the Department to rerun income and cost analysis and ascertain the latest available financial position to inform the next policy developments. <\/p><p>Together for Better, the new funding model for Early Learning and Childcare, was launched in September. Over 90%, more than 4,000 providers, have become Partner Services under Core Funding, committing to working in partnership with the State for the public good. The response from providers to become Partner Services in delivering Core Funding has been hugely encouraging and positive. <\/p><p>The investment requires providers to freeze their fees at last year's rates; it requires new pay rates to be in force; and it requires a significant degree of operational and financial transparency over how services operate. This assures Government and the public that public money is being used for its intended purpose - high quality, affordable, and accessible Early Learning and Childcare.  It also puts in place a solid foundation and brings further confidence to the system to allow for additional increases in investment. This is already happening, with a landmark investment of &euro;1.025 billion in the ELC and SAC sector in 2023.<\/p><p>Further interrogation of the new Core Funding application and income and cost data is required in order to most effectively design developments in Year 2 of Core Funding. Developments may focus on promoting further capacity expansion, investing more in the base rate, or to taking more targeted initiatives to invest in specific parts of the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600072#WRV00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":801,"qnumday":301,"qnumall":"[49247\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600072#WRV00600","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if the attention of his Department has been drawn to a penalising effect of the core-funding allocation wherein smaller independent services face closure thereby reducing choice for parents who want part-time care or early childhood care and education scheme-only provision, something that is not catered for in many full day care creches; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1585","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":802,"content":"<p>Together for Better is the new funding model for Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School Age Childcare (SAC).

The EU Work Life Balance Directive requires nine weeks paid parental leave for each parent by August 2024, however, there are no immediate amendments to parent's leave currently planned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600072#WRV01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education","counter":809,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600072#WRV01400"},{"type":"question","counter":810,"qnumday":304,"qnumall":"[49281\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600072#WRV01500","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the reason for the delay in processing an application for the operation of a school (details supplied).","asker":"1460","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":811,"content":"<p>As the subject matter of the Deputy's question relates to an operational matter for Tusla, I have referred the matter to them for a direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600072#WRV01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":813,"qnumday":305,"qnumall":"[49288\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600072#WRV01800","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the reason that his Department insists on an age requirement to participate in ECCE; the reason a child (details supplied) has been advised that it is not possible to participate in ECCE in 2022; if he will review this regulation thereby empowering parents to determine when the child will participate in the ECCE year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1454","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":814,"content":"<p>The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme is a universal two-year pre-school programme available to all children within the eligible age range. <\/p><p>A child must have reached 2 years and 8 months of age on or prior to 31 August of the relevant programme year to be eligible for the September start date and a child cannot turn 5 years and 6 months of age during the course of the ECCE programme year.<\/p><p>The child referred to is eligible to begin ECCE in September 2023 and avail of a second year in September 2024. <\/p><p>The minimum eligibility age of 2 years and 8 months for the ECCE programme was chosen based on national experience and a review of international practice.

In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. <\/p>  <p>  Regrettably, the current average processing time for naturalisation applications is approximately 19 months.<\/p>  <p>  My Justice Plan 2022 commits to developing a fully digital, customer-centric immigration service and to enhance the efficiency of our immigration system. In line with these commitments, a number of actions have been taken to reduce the impact on immigration processing times, including the introduction of online applications, a new customer service helpdesk and a new customer-focused immigration website. <\/p>  <p>  As a result of the introduction of the temporary statutory declaration process in January 2021, and the assignment of additional staff to the citizenship team, last year, 11,512 citizenship decisions were made. This is the highest number of decisions made annually since 2015 and reflects positively the significant changes undertaken to date. <\/p>  <p>  For the first six months of 2022, almost 7,900 citizenship decisions have been issued, including 1,005 decisions on minor applications. This exceeds the total number of minor decisions issued during the whole of last year when 868 minor decisions were made.<\/p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2022, new applicants for citizenship no longer have to submit their original passport with their application. Instead, they can provide a full colour copy of their passport. This is freeing up staff that up to now have been engaged in returning passports to applicants and will also help to reduce processing times. <\/p>  <p>  A previous examination by the Department of the citizenship application process indicated that incorrectly submitted applications were diverting considerable resources from general processing, resulting in the slowing down of all applications and adversely impacting on customer service. Therefore, significant effort has gone into clarifying the application guidelines published on the Department's immigration website (www.irishimmigration.ie) and on making the application process itself more customer friendly, including the introduction of the new scorecard structure for proof of identity and residence.<\/p>  <p>  The scorecard was introduced to help applicants to complete their applications with greater certainty than before. Since the go-live of the scorecards, a preliminary review of applications received indicates that the quality of the applications has markedly improved.<\/p>  <p>  This is a welcome development and builds on other innovative measures recently introduced in the citizenship application process, including the deployment of &ldquo;Tara&rdquo; the e-chat bot, e-payments, e-tax clearance and Garda&iacute; e-vetting, and the removal of the requirement to provide the original passport when making an application. These measures have improved the service to our customers and are contributing to a reduction in processing times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600073#WRW02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":876,"content":"<p>Question No. 327 answered with Question No. 326.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":878,"qnumday":328,"qnumall":"[49314\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022100600073#WRW02600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when an application for naturalisation by a person (details supplied) will be processed; the reason that it is taking so long taking into account that the person has lived legally in Ireland for 40 years and is married to an Irish person; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":879,"content":"<p>The naturalisation application from the person referred to by the Deputy was acknowledged as having been received by Citizenship division on 23 May 2022, and continues to be processed by my Department, with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation.<\/p>  <p>  Citizenship Division have requested further documentation from the person concerned and they should provide this documentation as soon as possible, if they haven't already.<\/p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process. <\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay.

The referral of such a high proportion of licence applications has been the principal cause of delays in the issuing of licences and of the backlog in the number of licence applications on hand.  <\/p>  <p>  To address this, my Department has invested in additional ecology resources.  It has recruited a significant number of external ecologists in 2022 and these are focusing exclusively on afforestation in order to increase output further and to meet the target for afforestation licences as set out in the Licencing Plan. These improved outputs for afforestation are now coming through on the monthly and quarterly output figures.  Improvements to process have also been introduced and outputs from Project Woodland are contributing to a better functioning licensing system. These outputs include implementation of an end-to-end process review and of an independent expert regulatory review, completion of a training needs analysis and commencement of an organisational review, the roll-out of a pre-application discussion initiative nation-wide and the payment of an environmental grant in 2022. <\/p>  <p>  The average DAFM output per week to date in 2022 for licences approved is 93 files.  On the basis that 75% of these had an ecologist input approximately 70 files per week had ecology input.

However, since July there have been significant signs of improvement as a result of the new ecologists starting to issue licences, with 97 licences issued in September for example.  We are embarking on an intensive effort over the last few weeks and next few weeks to prioritise afforestation with an aim of clearing older files ahead of the new forestry programme.<\/p><p>As regards RUS, while we committed in our Licensing Plan to increasing output this year, the Plan does not include an annual target as many RUS applications are screened in for Appropriate Assessment and are referred to ecology.
