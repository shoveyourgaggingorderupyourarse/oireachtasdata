The committee will hear from representatives of the agricultural sector.<\/p> <p>  Since 28 February, the legal requirement for mask wearing in public settings no longer applies.  However, it is good practice to continue to use face masks or coverings, particularly in crowded areas.  The service encourages all members of the parliamentary community to wear face masks when moving around campus and when they are in close proximity to others.<\/p> <p>  Before we proceed, I bring to the attention of witnesses that in giving evidence within the parliamentary precincts, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  This means they have a full defence in any defamation action arising out of anything said in a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed to cease giving evidence on an issue at the Chair's direction.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard.  They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as far as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third party or entity.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses who give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as does a witness giving evidence within those precincts.  They may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by witnesses, outside the proceedings held by the committee, of any matters arising from the proceedings.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to utterances of members participating online in a committee meeting when their participation is from within the parliamentary precincts.  There can be no assurance in regard to participation online from outside the parliamentary precincts and members should be mindful of this when contributing.<\/p> <p>  In our first session between 5.30 p.m. and 7 p.m., the committee will hear from the following representatives of the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA:  Mr. Tim Cullinan, president; Mr. Damian McDonald, director general; and Mr. Robert Malone, senior retail policy executive.

I am joined today by the IFA's director general, Mr. McDonald, and our retail policy executive, Mr. Malone.<\/p> <p>  The IFA welcomes the publication of the scheme of the Bill and its proposal for the establishment of an office for fairness and transparency in the agrfood supply chain, as committed to under the programme for Government.  The association has long advocated and lobbied for greater regulation and transparency to be brought into our food supply chain.  It is farmers, as the primary producers of food, who are the weakest link at the bottom of this supply chain.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland, we have implemented the EU directive on unfair trading practices, UTPs, as required, and this function is being carried out by the enforcement authority within the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is clear there is a need for an independent body to carry out the role of ensuring compliance with the UTP directive.  The directive has been carefully considered at length by our elected EU representatives and it is a positive step.  We must now ensure that we strengthen this proposed legislation and strengthen the legal powers of the new office for fairness and transparency in the food chain beyond the scope of the UTP directive.<\/p> <p>  The IFA welcomes the opportunity to make a submission and meet with the committee today.  We have referenced a number of amendments and additions in our submission that we would like to see included before the Bill progresses.  In order to strengthen the legislation and allow for a more equitable position for farmers in the food supply chain, the IFA is seeking the following additions to the Bill: a ban on below-cost procurement of food, a ban on below-cost selling, security for suppliers in all tendering processes, stringent rules around retail food price promotion, minimum dedicated shelf space of at least 30% for branded food products, a prohibition on the use of non-approved logos, particularly the use of the Irish flag, and a prohibition on fake farm brand names created to mislead the consumer.  We are also seeking an assurance that the new office for fairness and transparency in the food chain will be up and running this year.  I will now go through each of our requests in more detail.<\/p> <p>  There must be an additional UTP provision to prohibit the buying of food below the cost of production by food procurement managers in dominant positions.  This needs to be clearly directed towards the retailers and main wholesale food service providers.  The IFA proposes that independent published costs of production should be kept under regular review and should be enshrined in the Bill as a minimum price buyers can pay producers and suppliers of food.  While not solving all problems, this inclusion will go a long way to preventing the dominant buyer from pricing farmers out of production, as has occurred in the horticulture sector for the past 20 years. <\/p> <p>  The IFA is seeking the reintroduction of a ban on the below-cost selling of food, as originally prohibited under the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987.  That ban prevented retailers from using food as a loss leader in their business.  Selling food below the cost of production completely undermines our domestic food producers.  The IFA commissioned a report into the Irish horticulture sector in February 2022, entitled Retail Price Compression Threatens the Viability of Irish Horticulture, which shows that over the past 11 years, the average price of food fell by 9%.  In 2013, in the period before Christmas, a number of retailers discounted fresh vegetables to 5 cent a kilogram to attract footfall into their shops in the lucrative Christmas period.  Without protesting demonstrations by growers, organised by the IFA, that practice would have continued and gained traction, likely leading to the complete elimination of the Irish horticultural sector.  Reintroducing a ban on below-cost selling will, in particular, give stability to the current cohort of very vulnerable growers of Irish fruit and vegetables.  Do we want a situation where, Ireland, as one of the most fertile crop-growing countries in the world, must import all its fresh fruit and vegetables?<\/p><p>Tenders from the retailers to secure supplies of food from farmers and growers should be multi-annual in nature, providing insofar as possible greater certainty and support against the impact of the unpredictable seasonality of food production.  Mechanisms should be provided within existing arrangements to facilitate continued engagement, negotiation and reward terms or price in exceptional circumstances and unforeseen market dynamics, including an agreed lag period to their implementation when relevant.  Terms must be agreed in advance of annual planting of the crops.  <\/p><p> Where a retailer engages in any discounts on agrifood products as part of a promotion, the retailer shall, prior to a promotion, specify the period of the promotion and the expected quantity of the agricultural and food product to be ordered while the promotion is on.  Promotions must be clearly funded by the retailer and not by the supplier.  <\/p><p> The IFA calls for the inclusion of a minimum dedicated shelf space of at least 30% for branded food products.  Premium branded food selling at a higher price to consumers will result in a greater price being passed back down the food chain to the farmer.  It is clear that where a retailer does not offer branded food to the consumer, the farmer receives less.  <\/p><p> The association calls on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Charlie McConalogue, to give the new office the power to ensure all retailers of agrifood only use Government and agency approved logos, such as the Bord Bia Quality Assurance Mark and the National Dairy Council logo, to indicate the Irish origin of produce.  The Bill must include a prohibition on use of the Irish Tricolour and other self-created logos in the likeness of the Irish flag that may confuse the true provenance of products.  <\/p><p> Retailers of food must be prohibited from creating fictional \"fake farms\" to sell their own branded food.  These fake farms could be misleading to the consumer and be interpreted as being of local origin, which may not be the case.  The IFA raised the use of fake farms by food retailers in 2021.  The use of &ldquo;Coolree Creamery&rdquo; by Lidl and &ldquo;Clonbawn Irish Dairy&rdquo; by Aldi to sell their own private label milk was publicised by the association in 2021.  An application made by Lidl for a court injunction prohibiting IFA's continued exposure of these fake farms was rejected by the High Court.  <\/p><p> We have watched with great interest the committee&rsquo;s previous sessions on the Bill with the Minister and his officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and enforcement authority and the committee's meeting last week with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, and Retail Ireland.  <\/p><p> Greater fairness and transparency is at the core of the Bill and the reason it is needed is the imbalance of power in the food supply chain.  Farmers, the primary producers of food, are unquestionably the weakest link in the supply chain.  As John F. Kennedy famously said, &ldquo;The farmer is the only man in our economy who buys everything at retail, sells everything at wholesale, and pays the freight both ways.&rdquo;  This is still true today and the Bill must go a long way to change this.<\/p><p> Major retailers at the top of today's food chain and a small number of large food service providers currently hold the power in Ireland&rsquo;s food supply chain.  This power leads to an inequitable distortion of value being distributed down to primary producers of food.  The Bill needs to specifically call out where the current power imbalance lies, and state that this is where the focus of the new office will be directed.  <\/p><p> The IFA is calling on the Minister and the Government, to include a stated focus on five major retailers and main food service providers as the initial primary focus of the new office.  The IFA commissioned a report in February 2022 by the economist, Mr. Jim Power, on the retail price compression and how it is threatening the viability of the Irish horticultural sector.  The report showed that over the past 11 years, the average price of food fell by 9% while the overall consumer prices increased by 13%.  This report states that the retail price compression experienced in the horticulture sector has resulted in the current market failure.  If the issues associated with the price compression are not addressed, the vegetable growing sector, in particular, will continue to contract.  There has been a constant decline in vegetable grower numbers from approximately 377 in 1999 to today&rsquo;s estimated number of 100 commercially viable growers.  <\/p><p> It is imperative the analysis and reporting function includes proper value chain analysis which outlines what portion the primary producer is receiving.  We must see where the money is going.  The IFA is calling on the Minister to enshrine the responsibility of the new office to investigate the value trail in the food chain and where unfairness is clearly reported, ensure immediate action is taken to rectify it.  The association suggests monthly reports publicised with at least quarterly information seminars, both online and in-person, to assist in dissemination of the data to stakeholders down the food chain.  This analysis should also include data on the percentage share of the food value chain that is returning to the primary producer.  <\/p><p> The IFA submission to the committee sets out a number of specific observations regarding the legislation currently under consideration.  All of those are documented in our statement so I will not go through them again.  I thank the Chair and the committee for the opportunity to present here this evening. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022071300002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Cullinan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to put forward our observations on the 69-page proposed Bill.  A properly functioning food chain in Ireland, and indeed in Europe, is central to ensuring food security.  It is equally central to securing sustainable food production.  When we hear of sustainable food production at the minute, there are three legs to the stool but it is very much one leg in focus at the moment and that is the environmental aspect.  Without the economic focus we will not have environmental or social sustainability.  It is imperative with all the challenges that have arisen.  We have heard a lot about food inflation in the past 18 months but in the previous 25 to 30 years there was no food inflation.  It was stagnation from a farm gate perspective.  In that time, processes and retailers and their concentration of market power in particular from a retailer, has forced down the margin for the primary producer.  We are involved with the European Milk Board, EMB, and it is equally a European issue.  It is not confined to Ireland.  If we want the family farm structure to remain in place, action has to be taken and there needs to be strength in this position.  We need to see improved margins for farmers to bring about a properly functioning supply chain and above all, we need transparency.  That is critical along the price chain.  There will always be price volatility but we need transparency to develop a level of fairness out there.<\/p> <p>  The office for fairness and transparency in the agrifood supply chain must take the lead, be strong and independently rule practices of unfairness where they see fit.  This authority should be co-funded by the EU and mandatory funding from industry such as retailers because it cannot be carried by the primary producer.<\/p> <p>  The Competition (Amendment) Act 2006 created huge issues as regards below-cost selling.  Mr. Cullinan alluded to it from the perspective of the vegetable growers - the stress, the anxiety, the trend among farmers to reduce numbers as a result.  The retailers concern is footfall and our produce, whether it is dairy, beef or vegetables, is used to gain those feet in the door.  This form of low-cost selling has to be stopped. <\/p> <p>  There are two clear points in the supply chain and one of those, which is quite transparent, is the farm gate price.  Equally as transparent, to be fair, is the sale price on the shelf but we need transparency in between.  It is critical for our food chain.  Large food processing and retailing companies have comprehensive sustainability policies but when it comes to economics and sustainability for the primary producer, they do not understand the effects of their actions.  <\/p> <p>  I will be brief on this as I would especially like to be involved in questions and answers, but the new office must take the lead, be strong and independent, and prepared to rule.  As regards specific comments on the general scheme, the Bill states: \"The functions of the Office shall include analysis and reporting of price market data.\"  This data needs to be up to date and to include the costs associated with production and the margin along the supply chain.<\/p><p>Without such data, fairness cannot be established.  The ICMSA believes that it is important to clarify that the Bill also will apply to suppliers of farm inputs, a sector dominated by a small number of companies.  We have seen the impact of inflation there, whether on fertiliser or oil,  in recent months.  That has a huge effect on the margin for the farmer.  We question the introduction of levies and charges.  Such charges cannot be imposed on the primary producer either directly or indirectly.  The ICMSA welcomes the general functions of the office outlined in the general scheme but, on a technical point, the function set out in head 8(1)(b) must include making available analysis of information on costs and margins in the supply chain.  We must use stronger phrases than \"encourage compliance\" or \"encourage fairness\".  There must be fairness to ensure farm families have a sustainable income as we move forward.  On the collection of data, there needs to be a focus on more than just publicly available data.  The office must have the power to obtain market data to ensure that fairness is achieved in the food chain.  It is true that some data may be market-sensitive.  Such data do not need to be published, but they must be available to the office if we are to achieve fairness.  <\/p><p> The ICMSA proposes that the farm organisations that are members of the farming pillar should have representation on the board.  My understanding is that currently, membership of the board is limited to six, with three members required for a quorum.  Given the importance of the issue of fairness for farmers, we need to see a greater level of representation on the board.  The ICMSA feels that the office should publish all decisions relating to prohibitions of UTPs.  We do not support the use of the phrase \"may publish\" in the general scheme.  It is critical that all decisions be published.  On the disclosure of interests, it is advisable that all past or current interests are disclosed by the members of the board, chief executive and staff to avoid issues later.<\/p><p> Regarding the criteria set out in the general scheme on the basis of which the office may decide not to investigate a complaint, such as a practice occurring \"at too remote a time to justify an investigation\", we feel that there must be an investigation if a complaint has been made.  The office should always inform complainants if their complaint will not be followed through at its earliest convenience.  The fines that are enforceable by the office should be realistic and should be determined by the market position of the lawbreaker and the level of offence committed.   With regard to independent dispute resolution, it is likely that market power will disincentivise smaller producers for using such a mechanism for fear of future retaliation, and because of the potential costs associated with it.  Prices should be published on a monthly basis and in a timely fashion.  It is critical that we get this legislation right.  Farm families have been waiting a long time for it.  There must be a level of sharpness to the focus of the office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022071300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat McCormack","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their comprehensive opening statements.

I do not know if they have been following the debates that we have had on the legislation to date.  So much of what this committee and the Department do is locked into the CAP.  This is one of the few areas in which the Government can bring measures through the House that will potentially make a substantive difference to the relationship of farmers with the overall market chain.  Following every interaction, I am becoming more concerned that this could be a missed opportunity.  I have a number of specific questions and perhaps I will ask a few of them together.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McCormack touched on the issue of publicly available information, on which the general scheme is quite specific.  It appears that the new office will not have additional powers to get information that is not publicly available.  As all the farm organisations have correctly stated in their submissions, we know, by and large, precisely how much farmers receive for their product either at the mart or in the factory.  It is publicly available information.  We know exactly how much we pay in the supermarkets for those goods, whether it is here or internationally.  The information that we do not have, which is contested and in dispute, is on what happens in between, how much profit is being made and by whom.  Do the organisations represented here believe that the legislation will be flawed if the final Act does not provide scope for the office to get that information?  I take Mr. McCormack's point that the office does not necessarily need to publish the information, but it must be able to obtain it.  My second question concerns the seats on the board that have been preserved for producers.  The organisations have made very valid points about the need for them to be represented on the board.  We have heard other organisations make similar points previously.  I ask the witnesses to outline what they think the overall make-up of the board should be.  How many members should it have and how many producer representatives should be on it?  What other expertise would the board benefit from having?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022071300002#D00300","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>The Deputy mentioned the CAP in his comments.  It is a critical time for legislation such as this to be brought forward.  We are all familiar with the debate surrounding the CAP.  The funding model is changing from supporting farmers to produce food to ensuring that they comply with environmental measures.  That is a fundamental shift in itself.  It is critically important that we get his legislation right to ensure that we can get more back from the market to the primary producers.  Looking at the situation in Ireland, a number of sectors sell predominantly to Irish retailers.  We have seen, time and again, the impact that has had on those businesses.  For example, there are only 100 horticultural producers left in the country.  That demonstrates the impact it has had.  Those producers are wholly dependent on Irish retailers.  The liquid milk, pig and poultry sectors are predominantly dependent on the Irish retail sector.  It is critical for those sectors and all the other sectors.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the availability of information.  We have been very clear on the issue from the start.  Information relating to the whole supply chain must be made available.  Otherwise, we will have failed.  As he pointed out, we know what the primary producer is receiving.  From there on, it is a mystery.  That information must be made available.  As we have been saying for a number of years, it is about equity and fairness in the supply chain.  The UTP regulations will not do enough there.  It is critically important that we implement the proper legislation to ensure that equity and fairness are delivered.  <\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's question regarding membership of the board, it is critically important that primary producers have seats on the board.  We must ensure that all the different sectors that are supplying and dealing with retailers are represented.  Earlier this year, horticultural farmers were concerned about raising issues with retailers directly.  They were approaching us and asking us to act as an intermediary between them and retailers.  That is how serious the issue is.  It is critically important that when the seats on the board are being allocated, people representing the primary producers in each of the sectors that are dealing with retailers are given a seat. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022071300002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Cullinan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>As I alluded to earlier, it is critical that we know what is happening in the supply chain between the farmyard and the shop shelf.

A few factors can affect that going forward, including the margin for the primary producer and the climate Bill.

There are other examples of State boards in the agricultural sector with larger numbers.  If the legislation is properly structured, we believe that the farming pillar bodies, which are membership organisations, need to be represented on that board so they can represent their members on an issue that is critical to them, because it is effectively their income.

What that allows them to do is have their own brand.  We have examples of what we refer to as &ldquo;fake farms&rdquo;.  However, take any brand, for example.  If you go into a shop you will see Egan&rsquo;s potatoes.  However, there is no Egan&rsquo;s potatoes.  The fact is that the supermarket is in a position to ask all potato suppliers to compete against each other to provide the cheapest potato to go in that bag from one week to the next.  Rather than the actual person supplying the potatoes building up a brand value, the brand value is being taken by the supermarket.  We cannot end up in a scenario where supermarkets are filled only by their own brand products.  This is not just an Irish problem; it is a global strategy by retailers to try to take more of the chain for themselves.  If there is an Egan&rsquo;s potatoes, it should be Egans that is putting the potatoes into the bag, and the consumer believes that is what is happening.  I am just using that as an example.  There are many more examples of that.  There are others that are clearer that they are brands owned by supermarkets, going back to the original yellow pack where this whole thing started.  The point we are trying to make, and I agree it is not the simple thing to do, is that there should be some requirement or a minimum below which retailers cannot go in terms of pushing out all of the brands.  Many of the products on shelves that are branded by the supermarket sit alongside the supplier&rsquo;s own branded product, which may be selling at a higher price.  To remain viable, the supplier has no option other than to supply the product to fill the own-brand order as well.  It is an issue.  It is not easy to solve it, but we want to flag it clearly here that this where we are going if we do not do something about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022071300002#E01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damian McDonald"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Mr. McCormack said the level of fines enforceable by the office should be determined by the market position of the lawbreaker.

It is to level the playing pitch, bring more power back from the top of the food chain, including the retailers and the food service buyers, to the primary producers.  I believe the board as proposed is too small.  However, it is about what is in the legislation and to have enough powers to open up the food chain and see where the value is going and put power back in the position of the farmers.  One of the big asks we have is the ban on below-cost procurement of food.  That is a big issue.  The cost of producing that food has to be taken into consideration, whether it is a head of broccoli, a kilo of beef or a litre of milk, and retailers should not be able to purchase that at below the cost of production.  That will mean the primary producer is more sustainable.  We have asked for a ban on below-cost selling but the consumer needs to get value as well.  We are all for that.  It is very important.  We need the consumer with us in all this. <\/p> <p>  Earlier this year Teagasc produced costings for the production different field vegetables.  They went up by various margins of between 15% and 25%.  Not one grower was offered that as an increase from whoever they were dealing with, whether it is a middle person or a retailer.  They had to fight their best to get close to it but they should not have to fight to stay in business and remain viable.  As part of this legislation in terms of fairness and transparency, they should be able to outline the cost of production and the margin they need to stay viable.  It is not a margin to get rich but a margin to keep producing food and not rely on imports from somewhere outside of Ireland.  We can do all of this here.  That is what it has to be about.  We need more representation for primary producers with two or three people in dedicated seats on the board for primary production.  Boards such as Bord Bia's have similar set-ups to this proposed new office and they are models we should look at for a board.  It is important that the subcommittees, possibly like Bord Bia, represent different sectors.  Vulnerable sectors are on life support such as the horticulture, pig and poultry sectors and any sector that is reliant on retail to sell its produce.  It is not the world market.  They are the sectors that suffered most this year when inputs rose.  They could not get the increases out from the retailer.  We need subcommittees set up specifically for those to investigate and have powers in order that they can ask authorised officers of this new office to find out where the value is, make it transparent that there are people who are not getting paid the cost of production, and be transparent and publicise that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022071300002#F01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Malone"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>The Minister said he was open to getting approval from the Oireachtas to nominate a chair.

If we do not have that, we cannot address the lack of transparency.  The ICMSA has made the same point.  That is the first step here.  We need to get the truth and understand what is happening before we can address it.  What has happened to the sector this year with input increases is a shocking scenario.  The world market generally has operated, given a return to farmers and driven that but our domestic market has failed in that the people who are dependent on selling their produce to Irish retailers are suffering the most.  That means there must be a serious lack in our system somewhere along the line.  We hear a lot of talk about increasing horticulture and it is mentioned as a priority in the programme for Government.  Whatever about the feasibility of that with the growing conditions in various parts of the country, what is happening is the exact opposite.  Our horticulture sector is contracting at an inordinate rate.  Certain products can be produced abroad cheaper than they can be produced in Ireland because our production costs are higher.

We have to entice the Department and the Minister in the right direction.  Mr. Cullinan raised points.  The suggestion that compulsory reporting of price data would apply above a certain threshold is a fair proposition n the ICMSA's, submission.  A small local retainer would not have to divulge information.  What do the witnesses see that threshold as?  Mr. McDonald talked about moving the debate from below-cost selling to below-cost procurement, which would be considered attractive.<\/p><p> I had this difficulty in the European Parliament when dealing with the original UTP legislation.  Even the European Commission argued that it is almost impossible to identify and set out the cost of production, because it could be different for two different farmers depending on inputs and so on.  Do the witnesses see a role for this new body if we moved in that direction?  Could it be charged with setting out the sectoral costs of production that would underpin the legislation?  They could then be set independently and would recognise the realities.  Has the IFA sought any legal advice about whether it is possible for the Oireachtas to introduce such legislation?  I assume it would have to be legally binding on imported products as well as domestically produced products, otherwise it would potentially undermine the objective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022071300002#G00900","speaker":"1451","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":64,"content":"<p>The core of the issue is a farmer having a margin.

We currently see substantial inflation in the cost of production for feed, fuel and fertiliser for all sectors.  That has impacted more on some sectors than others.  I sat in front of numerous retailers earlier in the year.  There were issues with contracts and so on.  Everybody was looking at what could be done to keep primary producers in production.  We made that point too.  Things will change due to weather events, substantial inflation and the Russian war in Ukraine, which has had a huge impact on all sectors.  Flexibility is needed.

I am making this statement on behalf of Mr. Vincent Roddy who had Covid last week.  I am taking his place in making this submission on behalf of INHFA on the general scheme of the Bill.<\/p> <p>  We welcome the opportunity to make this submission on an issue of major importance to farmers and the consumer.  Unfortunately, in making this, farmers and the consumer have over time seen their influence diminished in favour of ever-increasing profits for our major supermarkets and the larger multiples.  In a society driven by perception rather than facts, consumers have been sold on the myth of a cheap food policy that is also sustainable.  This myth ignores the financial and environmental costs of producing food while promoting waste and driving poverty.<\/p> <p>  At all levels of society, and especially with regard to our workforce, there is legislation in place to ensure workers are not exploited and are guaranteed a minimum level of pay through a minimum wage.  Unfortunately, this principle does not seem to apply to our farmers and food producers.  While someone stacking shelves in a supermarket is guaranteed a minimum payment, the same supermarket will wilfully exploit farmers, safe in the knowledge that there is no legislation in place to prevent this.  As a consequence of this, we have seen an exodus from agriculture and potential young farmers not committing to an industry that cannot deliver any level of certainty.  For those who remain in the industry the ever-increasing demands placed on farmers are clearly a factor in farm accidents and fatalities on farms.<\/p> <p>  All of this is a damming indictment of legislation, both in Ireland and across Europe.  Our hope is that the committee members and other legislators care enough to address this and maybe this process can be a critical first step.<\/p> <p>  I turn to outline what needs to happen.  The following are proposals the INHFA maintains can make a positive impact if applied.  Outlined in the Bill are proposals to establish an office for fairness and transparency in the agrifood supply chain.  This we fully support and maintain that as part of its remit it will be tasked with the role of establishing the ongoing cost of food products.  It should consider all input costs for farmers and other primary producers, including fixed costs and insurance.  It should allow for a fair profit margin for food producers.  Once we have an ongoing price index for the cost of producing all foods we will be in a much stronger position to identify and prevent below-cost selling.  This new office should also have the power to prevent supermarkets from using any food product as a loss leader.  We need to reassess conformity with regard to certain food products.  An example includes the size and shape of certain vegetables, the colour of eggs, and so on.  By applying stipulations around conformity, farmers are losing out on products they have produced but are unable to sell.  This costs money and also contributes to food waste, which is a huge issue.  We are aware that food production uses significant resources such as land, water, energy and fertiliser.  Food waste, which equates to approximately 1 million tonnes of food annually in Ireland, is also a waste of these natural and valuable resources.<\/p> <p>  In recognising that since 2016 supermarkets are banned from demanding payment from suppliers for promotions and shelf space we need to ensure adequate resources for the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, to ensure the laws around this are being enforced.  Giving the new office for fairness and transparency in the agrifood chain control over this is another option that should be considered.  We also need a national and European awareness campaign explaining the important role of food production and the need to respect and acknowledge food producers' basic right to a fair price that reflects their costs and their work.  Any such campaign should include our schools and all education centres.  It should also focus on food waste, the quality of our food products, and why some foods such as organics cost more.  Will this still be the case in the next CAP when we are going to increase organics by three times, from 2% up to 7%, or are we going to have a realistic market for this produce?  That is another huge issue we are going to see.  It is vital that we have farmers' representation on this committee so we can get a real voice for the issues debated.  After all, it is farmers' income that is at stake.<\/p> <p>  The establishment of the new office to regulate and control fairness in the food chain is a positive step.  It will need to be adequately resourced and have enough power through legislation to act.<\/p><p>Politically, as the price of food increases, this office may become an easy target for the multiples in their determination to maintain the <i>status quo<\/i>.  We feel that this should not happen.  We have outlined clear proposals that if implemented can ensure the shoddy practices driven by the multiples and larger supermarkets are brought to an end.  In addition, our proposals, through the awareness campaign, can enhance the role and perception of farmers and other food producers who perform the most basic but essential role for all of society. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022071300002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Miche&aacute;l McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McDonnell and invite Mr. Keane to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022071300002#O00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to address the committee on the Bill.  I am accompanied by Mr. Liam Hanrahan, chairperson of the national agricultural affairs committee.<\/p> <p>  The Bill reflects the commitment in the programme for Government and EU policies that seek to improve market transparency in the agricultural and food supply chain, and most important, to improve the position of farmers, fisheries and smaller food producers in the agricultural and food supply chain.<\/p> <p>  The members of Macra na Feirme have consistently highlighted the need for a redistribution of power within the food supply chain.  Given the fragmented nature of farm families and their distribution across the country, along with the enterprise variation that exists, all levers of the UTP regulations and further are needed to ensure that the balance of power is evenly distributed across all actors in the supply chain.  There have been concerns consistently among farmers about price fluctuations in some markets along with the requirements of certain farm produce demanded by the consumer.  However, at times of constrained supply, certain requirements are no longer a barrier for entry to the market.<\/p> <p>  Macra na Feirme wishes to highlight that farmers remain in the weakest position within the food supply chain.  With five larger retailers controlling in the region of 90% of the domestic market share, it is clear that the individual farmer's position is clearly vulnerable and weak.  This is particularly evident in the beef sector where, for example, the average suckler farm consists of in the region of 20 breeding suckler cows.<\/p> <p>  Macra na Feirme welcomes the establishment of the office of fairness and transparency for the enforcement of the UTP regulations.  We have reservations that the new body has not been given a sufficient suite of powers commensurate with the responsibility to ensure fairness and transparency.  In its recent submission, Macra na Feirme highlighted the need to ensure that powers of investigation into activities of a criminal nature, under the auspices of an ombudsman, be conferred on the new body.  At recent sittings of this committee, different perspectives on the Bill were put forward that were in direct contradiction of conferring investigative powers on the new body.  Macra na Feirme requests clarity on the powers of investigation for the new office, which may ultimately lead to prosecution.<\/p> <p>  Macra na Feirme notes that head 45 states: \"The Chief executive may appoint in writing such persons or classes of persons as he or she considers appropriate to be authorised officers for the exercise of all or any of the functions conferred on an authorised officer under this Bill, as specified in the appointment.\"  Let us compare with section 129 of the Data Protection Act, which states, \"The Commission may appoint such and so many members of its staff, and such and so many other suitably qualified persons, as it considers appropriate to be authorised officers for the purposes of this Act.\"  When a comparison is drawn, it is clear that a difference exists between the perceived internal capacity of the new office versus those offices established in other areas of enforcement.  Macra na Feirme raises this issue in its submission in the context of the food ombudsman and seeks further clarity about the designation of an \"authorised officer\" and the origin or potential origin of such an officer.<\/p> <p>  Macra na Feirme welcomes the role that the new office plans to execute concerning price and market analysis.  However, concerns remain that to establish the exact breakdown of value from producer to end consumer is not clearly laid out as a function of the new office.  Transparency is largely evident at the point of sale from the primary producer to the processor in most supply chains.  There is a degree of transparency at the point of sale to the end user, which is the consumer.  There is a section in the supply chain that pertains to the main large actors where the price breakdown is unknown.  Macra na Feirme highlights the recent Grant Thornton report, which was commissioned by the now decommissioned beef task force, in which it found that the actors within the supply chain, between primary producers and end users, were in some circumstances difficult to ascertain and garner information from.  Leaving the provision of information within the supply chain as a voluntary contribution to the office on behalf of large actors within the supply chain will do little to achieve the objective of the new office, as stated earlier.  Macra na Feirme would like the addition of powers that allow for the new office to examine and determine the exact breakdown of price, and value, within the agricultural food supply chain at all levels.<\/p> <p>  Macra na Feirme wishes to raise concerns over the definition of \"commercially sensitive information\", which has been an area of focus at recent sittings of this committee.  The exact nature of this information is unknown in the context of its relative importance in determining price breakdown within the food supply chain.  In its current form, this Bill has no mention of access to commercially sensitive information or what the new office interprets as commercially sensitive.  It is essential for transparency and fairness that this matter be clarified and ascertained, and also to ascertain the willingness of retailers to engage in providing such information.  It is in that context that Macra na Feirme has reservations about the willingness to share such information and engage on the basis of exchanges between this committee and the retail sector's representatives at a recent sitting.  Macra na Feirme calls on this committee to ascertain the willingness to engage and determine if a recommendation to add an amendment in this area is necessary to the Bill.<\/p> <p>  Following on from its submission on the general functions of the office, Macra na Feirme wishes to highlight the need to ensure that a ban on below-cost selling is an additional enforcement power attributed to the new office.  Below-cost selling was banned as part of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987, which prevented retailers from using food as a loss leader in their businesses.  In 2006, the ban was removed by the then Minister for Trade, Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  The position of the primary producer has only been weakened as a result of this ban.  Macra na Feirme acknowledges the recent rise in the cost of food production but highlight that the proportionate share of the farmers' increase remains unknown and remains negligible when compared with the rising input price at farm level.<\/p> <p>  Macra na Feirme seeks the introduction of a ban on below-cost selling as a priority for the new office.  Macra na Feirme would like an exercise carried out regularly to ascertain the costs of production using various farm systems in each sector.  Once this information is established and updated then the financial requirements to meet the definition of \"farm economic viability\" needs to be added to ascertain the fair price for agricultural produce at the point of sale from the primary producer to the processor, factory or retailer.  This is not something that is unique as when this issue is examined it is clear that the Spanish Government has passed legislation to ban the selling of certain goods at levels below the cost of production.<\/p> <p>  Macra na Feirme would like a strengthening of the confidentiality measures in the Bill.  This is in particular reference to ensure the protection of primary producers and suppliers who come forward with complaints of suspected breaches of the UTP legislation.<\/p> <p>  Macra na Feirme echoes the comments made by the CCPC at the committee on the confidential nature of complaints.  We consider this as a matter of high importance as ensuring confidence in the office from the start is paramount and ensures that the resources available to weaker actors in the supply chain are made available and protected.<\/p> <p>  Macra na Feirme seeks an extension to the period outlined in the Bill for investigation and prosecution of any breach according to the UTP legislation.  The current proposal outlines is a two-year period post any potential offence be brought to the attention of the new office and investigated.  We request that this be extended to three years on a permanent basis and call for a potential short-term extension to four years to allow for a bedding-in period for both the new body and that actors in the food supply chain can familiarise themselves with the remit of the new office.  This request is reinforced by the fact that the new office will establish a database of information which may take some time, as outlined at this committee.<\/p> <p>  Macra na Feirme believes that it is hugely important that the new office be furnished with information relevant to its remit from any and all existing public bodies.  This will facilitate smoother establishment and faster progress towards effective running.  Has preparatory work been conducted between the bodies responsible for the establishment of the new office and the relevant statutory bodies?  The CCPC would be of particular note concerning this matter given its recent investigation into the beef sector and its experience in the area.  An effective handover by the CCPC and relevant bodies and Departments will be necessary for an effective transition.<\/p> <p>  Macra na Feirme seeks clarification concerning this Bill regarding the relationship between competition law, the offices responsible for its monitoring and the implementation and the new office of fairness and transparency.  Uncertainty pertains to reporting and monitoring of activities such as cartel behaviour in the agricultural sector.  In the event that cartel activity exhibits characteristics that fall foul of UTP legislation, and competition law, primary producers need certainty as to the relevant authority that will pursue any potential investigation or, in the event of both, the requirements that must be fulfilled for an investigation to be commenced.<\/p> <p>  Macra na Feirme requests an indicative funding amount, and the potential workforce scale and size for the initial start-up phase of the new office.  The CCPC had a budget in the region of &euro;13 million in 2019 that rose to &euro;18 million in 2021 and has a workforce in the region of 100.  It is paramount that the new office be furnished with the financial, knowledge and skills resources it needs to discharge its function fully while establishing the relevant datasets and information that will be required.<\/p><p>A budget of &euro;4 million was announced in budget 2022 for the establishment of the new office.  Macra na Feirme requests clarity on the use of this funding allocation to date and also on the &euro;1 million that was announced in budget 2021.<\/p><p> Macra na Feirme also requests clarity on definitions in the Bill, particularly pertaining to evidence required for an investigation, criteria for an investigation and the requirements of a search warrant.  The basis of this request is to provide clarity for primary producers in respect of the information needed by the office to pursue an investigation or further.  The issue was raised at the committee with the CCPC and there remains ambiguity as to the requirements of the above.  On communications, knowledge of the new office among primary producers is in the region of 50% and the knowledge of UTPs is in the region of 14%.  Significant work will be needed to communicate the role, function and remit of the new office to the primary producers and to all actors in the supply chain.<\/p><p> Macra na Feirme welcomes the establishment of the new office of fairness and transparency.  It does however have reservations that the remit of the new office does not extend far enough.  Ensuring that the power in the agricultural food supply chain is rebalanced is the direct ambition of the UTP legislation along with being a priority of the CAP, where it is set out as a strategic objective.  Macra na Feirme would like to see constant engagement by the new office with representatives of the farming sector as well as constant review of the implementation of the UTP legislation and the potential for additions to the legislation.  Finally, I thank the Chairman and the committee for their ongoing engagement with us on all issues relevant to rural youth in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022071300002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I thank our guests from the INHFA and Macra na Feirme for their engagement on this issue.

The legislation underpinning the ombudsman requirement in Ireland is the Ombudsman Act 1980.  There are some main functions of the ombudsman that we assumed would be attributed to the new office, given that the Bill went to public consultation as a food ombudsman Bill.  We engaged in good faith with the submission process under the impression the Bill was establishing a food ombudsman.  We took as given that the office would have some key functions, if it were an ombudsman's office, which would allow it greater investigatory powers, including the right to investigate in respect of negligence and carelessness and in respect of \"contrary to fair and sound administration\".  Given some of the complaints from our members, we would have assumed these powers would be part of the core work of this office.<\/p> <p>  It now looks like the functions of the ombudsman will not be attributed to it and it will be simply the office of fairness and transparency.  I would highlight that this is a different framework from what was put out to public consultation.  It is like the Galway footballer shooting for the goalposts, the goalposts being moved and then Hawkeye saying the submission is still relevant.  We are disappointed an ombudsman is not to be given the authority to do that and will not have enforcement powers under the UTP.  We do not believe the legislation goes far enough.<\/p> <p>  We have clarity on the price received at the point of purchase from the primary producer.  We have clarity at the other end in respect of the price to the consumer.  The ambition is that we would have the powers to see what goes on in the middle among the actors of the food supply chain.  On investigating and comparing what goes on across the EU, we have one of those frameworks in milk supply.  The Ornua purchase price index, PPI, feeds back information to farmers on a monthly basis as to the return of the product on the PPI.  A number of months ago it was 46.9 cent per litre.  The average payment price for milk received at co-operative level was 45.8 cent per litre.  We have this tool that highlights this.  The question is whether the availability of that tool is delivering a higher price for farmers.  We suggest it is not.  We would much rather see enforcement than reliance on embarrassment.  Our understanding of the Bill is that it still does not provide the powers to investigate the price breakdown within the food supply chain.  Applied to a simple, short food supply chain, as I understand was mentioned by other farm organisations in previous contributions, such short supply chains exist in the horticulture sector.  There is a primary producer and a retailer.  We have seen the diminution in the number of horticulture suppliers in the country over past years.  It does not take a whole lot to examine that food supply chain to see where the power breakdown is.  <\/p> <p>  The committee and the Deputy asked questions of the Minister and the CCPC in respect of investigative powers.  I think Deputy Carthy raised questions about the 160-odd complaints that came in about behaviour in the beef sector a number of years ago.  There was no investigation pursuant to those behaviours.  We still have no idea what the criteria are for investigation.  The CCPC outlined to the committee that its understanding of the Bill was that the new authority will not have the powers to conduct criminal investigations.  The Minister in his previous statement to the committee the week before said it did.  There has not been any clarity on that since.  We are requesting clarity as to whether it will have that power.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022071300002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":106,"content":"<p>It is good to get the opportunity to engage.  To come in on the back of what Mr. Keane said, there are concerns regarding the ability to investigate.  Maybe it is not great to say that when the Bill is through and we have that up and running, we will be in a position to see how true or untrue it is.  It is definitely going to be a concern.  There is also concern about the board, which may have been mentioned earlier.  There is a very small board.  The question of who is going to sit on it will be an issue as will its specific role.  I think someone referred earlier to the size of the board as regards the quorum of 50%, which would be high enough normally but when there are only six board members it is a problem.  We will have to wait and see.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Carthy said, the INHFA has been looking for a regulator for a good while.  Macra referred to an ombudsman.  We welcome that there is a move in the right direction.  There is an acknowledgement that something has to happen in this regard.  However, time will tell and maybe that is not a great place to be.  I am not sure what level of review is provided for to make changes if required.

Our understanding from his interpretation is it must go through the public procurement process or public appointments process.  We have reservations about how we ensure two primary producers, as a representative sample of primary producers, will be on the board if they are to go through the public appointments procedure.  The chair of the board should have the necessary knowledge and skill set relating to food production in Ireland so that he or she has an overview of what happens on the ground.  I am aware he or she can read into the brief and I am sure whoever is appointed will be of a suitable standard but ensuring he or she has a background appreciation for what is happening in the food supply chain will be critical.<\/p> <p>  I refer also to some contributions at the committee a number of weeks ago on representation from some other sectors, such as the retail sector.  It begs the question of somebody speeding down the M50 at 180 mph and going into a Road Safety Authority board meeting to determine what the sanction should be on a motorist, so I question whether the relevance of that is something that, through the public procurement process, which I am not familiar with it, could pertain within it.  The primary producers' representation of two is crucially important.  On the figure of six, we request that be enlarged as a representative sample of the primary producer sector as well.  A quorum of three is 50%.  We would like the quorum to be half plus one in terms of voting powers and being a representative sample of the board.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked what can be added and what can be changed.  We have long called for the six grey UTPs to be included as black UTPs.  On the six UTPs relating to contract negotiations and so forth, we can look at the primary producers who may find themselves in the position to negotiate those contracts.  We have experience in the spring just gone by of smaller horticultural or beef producers who had limited bargaining power when it comes to securing a contract, so why would we not be using all the powers we have at our disposal to ensure the playing field they are negotiating contracts on is balanced out as much as appropriate?<\/p> <p>  On what is missing, we mentioned in our opening statement and submission the issue of below-cost selling.  There is a larger question around the viability of the farm sector as well, moving into the future, and the provision of opportunity for young farmers.  Should we allow the sale of produce in the domestic market at below the cost of production that would meet the viability definition of farm incomes based on the national farm survey?  How that pertains is the basic viability of a farm at minimum wage is &euro;19,616 per annum plus a 5% return on capital investment on machinery and livestock.  That is the definition Teagasc has put forward as \"farm viability\".  I am not sure whether we would be happy with minimum wage but it is definitely a start.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022071300002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I have no more questions.

Encouraging compliance is all fine and well but we need to ensure there is compliance with this.  We understand that in recent months large-scale retailers have had time to engage with the temporary office that has been set up.

In terms of falling foul of the legislation and some of the suggested fines, it is on a scale from compliance to summary notice and up as far as prosecution and penalty and so forth.  They are on a scale from &euro;250 to &euro;1,000 and so forth.  At the lower end, there is a fine of &euro;250 for falling foul of the legislation.  For a large actor within the food supply chain, I do not think anyone present will agree that is a fair reflection in terms of the scale of large producers as compared with smaller producers.  That is where to start.  At the lower end of the scale, it is up to a maximum of &euro;1,000.  That is far too weak.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the larger enforcement piece - I will come to enforcement momentarily - I echo the remarks of Mr. Roddy in respect of the figure of &euro;500,000 and a percentage share of the overall turnover or profitability of the company.  There is precedent for that in the context of breaches of the GDPR legislation, which can lead to a fine of up to 4% of a company's turnover or profitability.  It is in that region.  For a large company, 4% is a significant figure and that would be a deterrent to partaking in unfair trading activity.  The sanctions are not stringent enough in terms of deterrence.<\/p> <p>  The issue of enforcement is referred to in our summary as well.  We welcomed how strong the committee was on it in its questioning in respect of the CCPC.  Farmers and individual primary producers have no clarity right now as to what are the requirements or criteria for an investigation to be started under competition law.  Several years ago, there were a lot of complaints to the CCPC in respect of certain activity in the beef sector.  That was not pursued and some of those items are up there.  Is responsibility being put on the primary producer to garner the evidence for an investigation to even begin or are there powers within the Bill for this authority to commence investigation on suspicion of a breach?  The representatives of the CCPC who appeared before the committee referred to the severity of starting an investigation and the severity of the potential consequences, such as a sentence of ten years' imprisonment and so forth, as being a deterrent but the mere outcome of an investigation should not be a deterrent to the investigation being commenced.  That point did not make sense.  From our side of things, it is critical to make clear the criteria for starting an investigation so that farmers and primary producers can ascertain or have a barometer of the evidence that is needed for an investigation to start.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022071300002#R00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I put the issue of costs and margins to the representatives of Retail Ireland who appeared last week.

We understand from contributions made at meetings of the committee that the CCPC has prosecuted people for behaviour within different supply chains and sectors, so there is precedent there and the CCPC has the powers and the authority to investigate.  The gap is not only what the criteria for the CCPC are but also, as referred to in our submission, what the roles of both authorities will be and what the link between them will be.  For example, a primary producer comes forward with evidence of activity within the food supply chain that it suspects may not be fair.  It may fit under the UTP regulations.  I am not sure I even understand that, and we have put a lot of work into it.  From the point of view of the primary producers, they are going to one office to report and so forth and they find out in six months, a year or 18 months that the report is not relevant and that they have to go to a different authority.  It needs to be ensured both authorities or statutory bodies report to one another and speak to one another.

We are not legal experts so we have sought clarity as to whether the CCPC has such investigative powers.  The authorised officer is referred to in our submission.  It is written in the draft Bill - I cannot remember under which head - that the chief executive has the power to appoint an authorised officer to carry out an investigation.  By way of comparison, the data protection law enacted in 2018 states that the chief executive officer has the authority to appoint an authorised officer from among his or her staff or a person or persons from wider afield.  We note, however, that this draft Bill does not contain a reference to staff.  What will the skill set within the staff complement be?  Will they have the required skill set?

The Agreement on a Unified Patent Court, UPCA, is an international agreement treaty between 24 member states of the EU, including Ireland, setting up the UPC.  The UPC is an international court set up by participating EU member states to deal with the infringement and validity of unitary patents.  Ireland signed the UPCA in 2013.  The Attorney General has advised that a referendum is required to transfer the judicial powers from the domestic courts to the new international court.  Once the UPCA has been ratified, arrangements can be made a for a local division in Ireland.  The drafting of the Bill required is currently in the preliminary stages.  A decision on the timing of the referendum is a matter for Government.  <\/p><p> Today, I am pleased that we have the opportunity to consider these matters further with representatives from IBEC.

I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss the UPC.  My name is Naoise Gaffney, and I am chair of the IBEC corporate IP group and vice president of IP for GH. Research.  I am also an adjunct professor of patent law at Trinity College Dublin.  I am joined by Aidan Sweeney, IBEC's head of enterprise and regulatory affairs.  We are here today to talk about the UPC, the referendum that is required before Ireland might participate in the system, and why, in our view, it is important that the committee gives due consideration and scrutiny to this matter.  We would like to ensure that the country does not miss out on the substantial opportunities for economic growth the UPC presents.  IBEC welcomed the Government&rsquo;s recent reconfirmation of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the UPC.  It sent an important message to other countries, as well as international investors, that Ireland is determined to be fully involved in the UPC.  While progress on the UPC had stalled across Europe due to Brexit and some legal issues in Germany, these issues have now been resolved.  The pace has picked up considerably across Europe, with the new court on track to open its doors in early 2023, with or without Ireland.<\/p> <p>  To provide members with an overview of what it is all about, the UPC is one part of a two-part package that also includes the unitary patent.  This unified patent package will create a simpler and more efficient mechanism for obtaining and enforcing patents in Europe.  As part of this, the UPC will be a newly-established single court system under international agreement for pan-European patent litigation and enforcement.  It will ultimately have exclusive competence in respect of infringement and validity of all patents granted by the European Patent Office, EPO.  By way of reference, most patents currently in force in Ireland have been granted by the EPO, which is a centralised European clearing house for patents.  The Intellectual Property Office of Ireland, IPOI, based in Killkenny, has similar competence.  However, most of the activity from a patent perspective tends to go through the EPO.  The unified patent package is needed simply because the current European patent enforcement system does not work effectively for companies, and in particular for SMEs.  The current system of country-by-country patent protection.  Litigation is extremely expensive, time-consuming and resource-intensive.  Under the new system, there will be centralised mechanisms of both protection and enforcement.  This could be particularly beneficial to Irish SMEs.  SMEs tend to have only a few patents - if they have any at all.  These patents are likely to cover their core technologies, which are often their most valuable assets.  Under the existing system, getting pan-EU protection and enforcing those rights all the way across Europe can often be prohibitively expensive for such companies.  The new system would make this a more realistic prospect for them.  Having part of this new system based in Ireland would be further beneficial for these enterprises because they would be able to enforce their pan-European rights through an Irish based court rather than having to play away from home, as it were.  As we have alluded to already, it represents a significant opportunity for Ireland.  The business case for Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the UPC has gotten stronger since it was first examined almost a decade ago.  Ireland is uniquely positioned to establish itself on the international stage as a patent enforcement hotspot.  If done right, Ireland&rsquo;s participation could yield very substantial gains for the wider Irish economy - gains that would go far beyond an increase in legal services.  That point is important, so I would like to re-emphasise it.  If Ireland participates in the UPC in an effective fashion, the economy as a whole - not just legal services - stands to gain significantly.  <\/p> <p>  The UPC has been designed to comprise several local divisions across the contracting states.  It was decided that Ireland will host its own local division, subject to the referendum passing.  This was an important decision.  Infringement litigation will not be spread evenly across each local division, and forum shopping is to be expected.  Internal conversations are already under way in many large companies to select one location to establish their base for patent enforcement, and a variety of other corporate functions will co-locate to this base.  Ireland can compete for this investment, but to stand a chance of success, the local division must be established here in a timely fashion.  After Brexit, Ireland has two powerful and unique advantages over other UPC locations.  We should bear in mind that a lot of the patent litigation that will take place in the UPC will be global in nature and involve parties originating outside Europe.  Being able to litigate on a pan-European basis before a court with native English proficiency and common law experience is a big deal for many such parties, particularly for those from countries with their own common law traditions like the US.  Ireland can now take advantage of a marketplace the size of EU and combine it with the fact the country is a hub of patent-intensive industries, both multinational and indigenous.<\/p> <p>  Let us get to the figures.  An attractive and timely-established local division in Dublin will support the further expansion of the patent-intensive sectors across the country, creating jobs, benefiting SMEs and boosting Ireland&rsquo;s innovation performance. It is expected to contribute at least &euro;415 million, or 0.13% in GDP growth, per annum.  It could rise to as much as &euro;1.663 billion, or 0.5% in GDP growth.  In addition to the broad economic benefits to the wider economy, there will also be increased expenditure and employment in legal, professional, and other technical advisory services.  That is the prize that we can compete for at the moment, but we must play our cards right.  While Ireland stands to gain significantly through participating in this system, we will only be able to do so if we participate in a timely fashion.  Establishing a well-run and attractive local division that is ready to go when the UPC starts operating or very shortly thereafter will be key to competing for patent litigation to be heard before the Irish-based court.  A slow start to implementation will prove costly and prevent Ireland from making the fullest use of the potential of the unified patent system.  We should also bear in mind that there will likely be a period between holding a referendum and setting up a local division should the public agree to the establishment of the UPC.  That must be factored into the equation.  It is possible that an Irish local division could be established soon after it is launched by the initial 16 ratifying states, which will likely take place in early 2023, but it could also be as late as two years down the line.  This is likely to affect the attractiveness and take-up of the Irish local division.<\/p><p>Projections indicate that while patent litigation activities could still increase, albeit from the existing extremely low base, we might only get a quarter of the cases that would be available to a well-run, timely and attractive local division.  This translates into a significant opportunity cost.  While we have stated that there is between &euro;415 million and &euro;1.66 billion to play for, a conservative estimate is that a significant proportion of this will not be available to latecomers to the system.  It will be off the table.  We are happy to go into more detail on that if the committee wishes.  In addition, delayed ratification in Ireland clearly would benefit locations elsewhere.  Many of those expected to gain would be key competitor locations for foreign direct investment, FDI. <\/p><p> Prompt action is now required.  While the Government has committed to running a referendum on this issue in May 2024, if not before, it is IBEC&rsquo;s view that May 2024 is the absolute latest date that a referendum should be held and even then, it is at the risk of missing out on significant opportunities.  Should other issues be put to the people earlier, the referendum on the unified patent court, UPC, should absolutely be included.  Work on enabling legislation should resume.  Government should also convene an inter-departmental preparatory group on the UPC and work with external bodies, such as IBEC, to try to influence decisions on the UPC at European level and prepare the groundwork.<\/p><p> Ireland is not out of the running by any means.  We have a unique position within the UPC system that could benefit the system as a whole and be of significant advantage to the Irish economy.  What we are delivering today is a simple two-part message.  The first part is that there is a substantial opportunity here.  The second part is very important in that much of the opportunity is only available within a limited timeframe.  This is the reasoning behind IBEC&rsquo;s call for a clear timetable, which captures the urgency of the opportunity at stake.  I thank the committee for its attention.  We look forward to answering any questions or addressing any specific issues that members of the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022071300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Naoise Gaffney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":147,"content":"<p>On the first page of IBEC's submission, it states \"these issues have now been resolved, and the pace has picked up considerably across Europe with the new court on track to open its doors in early 2023, with or without Ireland.\".

He has said it is gathering pace.  I know this issue has been kicking about for a while.  From the limited amount of research I have done, it seems that it goes very fast and then very slowly and so forth.

The question for us now is how far behind the starting line we will be.  That is, to some extent, within our control.  I take the Deputy's point about referendums not being run lightly.  Much preparation needs to go into them and considerable material needs to be produced to educate the electorate but, at the same time, we still have a degree of choice and control.  We alluded to the fact that it would potentially be problematic if Ireland joined two years down the line, but if we only joined a few months down the line, it may be less so.

Mr. Gaffney will be aware that there are well-accredited groups that have a view about that courts such as the UPC limit democratic freedoms and, crucially, interfere with the creation of things such as patent-free medicine.  We have had a debate at this committee, as I know the Committee on Health and others have, on the TRIPS waiver and how important it is to get those medicines, especially in the midst of a global pandemic.  Dr. Mike Ryan keeps saying nobody is safe until everybody is safe and that the medicines should be gotten to the people who need them.

It is just the transfer of powers from one forum to another.  To the extent that the UPC can be compared to something in the sporting arena, I suggest that what we are faced with at present is the opportunity to allow the Aviva Stadium to be used on a regular basis for the Champions League.  All we are talking about is the venue.  Many of the other issues, especially around access to patent-free medicines, relate to the fundamental rules of the patent game.  Those are about how one plays football.  We are not talking about how one plays football.  We are just talking about the stadium one plays in.  It is a fair criticism of a different issue.

There are very few enterprises, even the smallest ones in Ireland, that would be content just with securing protection within the Irish market and not going further afield.  The desire here is to get protection in as many other markets as it might be reasonably foreseeable for one to look to do business in.<\/p> <p>  We are focused here on the reform of the European system, so I will answer the question with regard to Europe.  There is a centralised clearing house for the granting of patents called the European Patent Office, EPO.  The process to get to the point where the EPO would give one the thumbs up and say one can have a patent, is one chunk of cost.  However, the EPO does not grant a single patent that covers all of Europe and instead, it gives one the option to get individual national patents in all of the participating member countries.  That is where considerable cost tends to kick in.  The cost of engaging with the EPO up to that point is unavoidable and will not change, but the first real saving to be achieved is at the validation stage.<\/p><p>That is where one takes the thumbs-up and turns it into a real patent.  Every additional country that one would like to seek protection in could cost another &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,000.  A significant issue is translation into international languages.  That is on top of the initial sunk cost that one probably incurred, of between &euro;7,000 and &euro;15,000, to get to the point where the EPO has given a thumbs-up.  In every year in which one wishes to keep the patents in force, one has to pay each individual national patent office a premium.  That is designed to ensure there is not a backlog of patents that people do not want.  Things die if people will not pay to keep them alive.  The cost really bites in the context of enforcement.  No one wants to litigate but sometimes people need to defend their rights.  If they want to litigate in Europe, they need to do so in every jurisdiction where they have a patent in force.  They need to go to Germany, France and the Netherlands.  Each litigation will cost hundreds of thousands of euro.<\/p><p> Now, for the first time, there is an opportunity to just do that once rather than doing it five times in different jurisdictions.  It is expensive anyway and will potentially still be out of the reach of small and medium enterprises, SMEs, but thankfully the Unified Patent Court, UPC, system provides specific financial supports for SMEs to use the system.  It was the EU's intention to make this as accessible as possible to SMEs.  There are significant savings to be had on the litigation front too.  At present, many SMEs may only have one or two patents.  That may not be because they only have one or two technologies worth protecting but because those are the technologies SMEs can afford to protect.  If it gets cheaper, they will be able to protect more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022071300002#C00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Naoise Gaffney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":155,"content":"<p>Do we have any research on the number of companies that have just one or two patents which could scale the number up?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022071300002#D00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":156,"content":"<p>About one in five multinational companies across Europe and about one out of every 100 SMEs has a patent.

That report was a 50-page document.  My colleague, Mr. Sweeney, can go into the figures in more detail, but the value is in the order of &euro;100 million or &euro;200 million, depending on the level of activity.  In my answer to some of Deputy Stanton's questions I said that the large figures we place on what it would mean for Ireland if we have a successful local division here have very much to do with the gravitational effect on the onboarding of additional corporate activity.  Typically speaking, from a multinational perspective, which I will deal with first, when it comes to locating certain parts and functions of an entity in different locations, there is a tendency to keep certain functions close to the nerve centre.  Even if a body's headquarters are in one country, sometimes there might be a cluster of significant individuals - not necessarily the key people but significant individuals all the same - in some other jurisdiction.  Some of the last functions to depart that nerve centre are on the corporate side.  IP management is one such function.  If, however, a decision is made to relocate IP management activities, it tends typically to bring a lot of other corporate activities along with it.  It is therefore not just IP managers one sees coming into the country as the result of a gravitational effect; there is an ancillary pull on a lot of other activities as well.  One may therefore find a lot of that nerve centre, not just the IP element, moving to Ireland.<\/p> <p>  A really good point was made about this opportunity being to a large extent potentially more valuable to Ireland after Brexit.  The UK made a significant contribution to the design of this system back in the day, before Brexit was even on the horizon.  As a result, going back to Mr. Sweeney's point earlier, the UPC was designed very much as a nice hybrid of the Commonwealth traditions of the English-speaking world and the civil law traditions of France and Germany and the countries clustered around them.  Ireland now has this opportunity to step into Britain's shoes.  I was on a panel at a meeting in London on intellectual property in the first quarter of this year at which I made that point and then went on to tell the audience that, of course, Ireland is not the UK and that we have been trying to make that point for about 800 years.  At the same time, there is now an opportunity for Ireland to step up and to play in the top tier and, going back to Mr. Sweeney's point, to contribute to the overall betterment of the system in a way we may not see if we step back, are passive about this and allow the system to proceed in such a way that, essentially, it just becomes a clone of the German system; that is, I think, the way German practitioners would like it because that is the system with which they are most familiar.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022071300002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Naoise Gaffney"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I will make one other point.  In the higher education sector in this country we hold an awful lot of intellectual property rights.  In some cases the property is patent-protected; in some cases it is not.  Commercial companies may be sought to come in to assist.  They might look at the IP in the context of commercialisation and see how that might be rolled out.  The first question becomes patenting, the cost and the protection and whether one's rights can be enforced.  For a lot of countries, including Ireland, as Mr. Gaffney said, this is a global business.  Smaller SMEs will not go to China.  They cannot.  It is very expensive to litigate in the US and very difficult to enforce one's rights, so smaller companies end up having to partner with bigger ones, probably multinationals.  They can fight that space.<\/p> <p>  There is a significant benefit to Ireland of the IP we hold within higher education.  I do not think Mr. Gaffney referred to this in his opening statement but I am sure IBEC is well aware of it.  I would like to see some coalescing of IBEC's strategy with higher education in understanding that we have an awful lot of IP that could be expressed commercially but has to be safeguarded in the first instance.  I do not even know if we have a good repository in this country to understand how many European patents we have sitting in abeyance.  As the witnesses will know, they have to be removed every number of years, and that costs money.  There is a body of work to be done on that.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Stanton said, this is a very important topic for the committee.  We absolutely need to speak to the Department and to ask that what IBEC is asking to be expedited is expedited and that we try to get this matter to a referendum as quickly as possible, get legislation through and get it decided on.

They might cover their costs.  That was one of the proposals at the outset.  For us to have that message, we need to be at the table of the preparatory committee trying to put those issues forward for us.

We take the issue very seriously here in Europe for the very obvious reason that we must keep our citizens fed.  It is one of the primary expectations of our citizens that it can be ensured the public can have safe, high-quality and affordable food available to them.  It is the whole purpose of the Common Agricultural Policy, which has its basis in EU treaties.  It is one of the original objectives of the treaties because post-war Europe was suffering from food shortages, and we needed to ensure citizens had safe, high-quality, affordable food.<\/p> <p>  For the past 60 years or so we have been working very hard to deliver on those expectations and dealing with a range of challenges in that period.  By and large, the system works well and Europe basically has self-sufficiency in all the main agri-food commodities.  We obviously have our challenges, for example, we are heavily dependent on imports of fertilisers and animal feed.  When it comes to animal products and the main crops like wheat, barley and corn, we are in a very good position.<\/p> <p>  That does not mean we are not challenged, and most recently by what is happening in Ukraine.  Over the decades we have had various shocks, including bovine spongiform encephalopathy, foot-and-mouth disease and various plant pests.  The most recent is climate change.  We have adapted to these challenges, and in the case of climate change, for example, we put in place the Green Deal and Farm to Fork, containing key priorities to basically ensure our agricultural priorities are sustainable moving forward and basically adapting to this existential threat to society at large, and not just in the agricultural area.<\/p> <p>  Of course, we have also had to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, which presented its own challenges to agri-food systems.  Probably the single biggest lesson from that is just how sophisticated those chains are.  There is no question that farmers and primary agricultural production are the bedrock of our agri-food systems and food security but to get the food from the farm to the consumers' table is a long and sophisticated process involving processors, ingredients and inputs such as fertilisers, energy, additives, transport and logistical systems, food processing, abattoirs, meat cutting plants etc.  There is also the retail industry itself.  Covid-19 taught us that any disruption in any part of the chain can basically have consequences for the entire operation.<\/p> <p>  We took those lessons into account and developed new strategies.<\/p><p>We presented a communication on food security.  Subsequently, we had yet another shock; we have been going through a very difficult period, with the Ukraine.  That has also proved a major shock to agrifood chains globally but not necessarily in Europe, I would stress, because we had a very resilient agrifood system.  However, the global system was already in a relatively fragile state.  It was recovering from the Covid pandemic and especially the shocks to logistical systems and then suddenly, the war in Ukraine effectively removed from global supply chains, Ukrainian wheat, maize and sunflower.  These are three commodities for which they had a huge share.  The loss of these stocks to global markets led to a further escalation in prices and provoked fundamental questions about how adaptable we are at global level to dealing with food security. <\/p><p> On response, I will highlight three initiatives on the part of the Commission.  First and foremost, we had communication on 23 March on food security which identified three strands of policy action.  The first is how we deal with food security in Europe itself, arising from what is happening in Ukraine.  As I mentioned earlier, we are in a pretty good position on that as we have a good harvest in prospect.  The second is how we deal with the situation in Ukraine itself, because the loss of its stocks to world markets was obviously very destabilising.  From a humanitarian perspective, Ukrainians have to keep themselves fed and Ukraine borders the EU so we must work very hard to try to allow Ukraine to re-establish itself on global markets.  Finally, we must look at the global situation including the humanitarian dimension.  Unlike Europe, large parts of the world have structural deficits in key agrifood commodities and were very vulnerable to what happened to Ukraine through, for example, the escalation of prices and in some cases even the availability of agrifood products.  We had to work to strengthen their position.  That includes improving and increasing their production capacity.  The final strand of the immediate course of action to deal with what is happening in Ukraine was the adoption of a communication of so-called solidarity lanes.  These are designed to basically compensate for the closure of the Ukrainian Black Sea ports through which they normally ship their commodities.  Now, in a very short time, we have defined rail, road and barge alternatives.  This is a huge logistical operation.  We cannot compensate for the loss of Black Sea ports overnight, but we are working extremely hard with Ukrainian authorities to basically provide outlets to allow its grains and sunflower oil to access more markets, to keep its own agrifood production system ticking over, to provide them with the revenues and to plant new crops in the next harvest cycle.  Otherwise a major component of the Ukrainian economy would be fundamentally damaged with both European and global consequences. <\/p><p>  In Europe we have a very resilient and powerful system with challenges, notably climate change, but the CAP does deliver on what is expected of it.  However, we are also challenged at the international dimension and especially from the circumstances arising from this war in Ukraine.  We had the measures in place to basically allow us to address them already this week.  I want to reassure the committee that this is being followed at the political level.  We had to present our various actions in the agricultural committee in the European Parliament.  Next Monday, there will be an agriculture Council meeting where we will discuss the situation on the markets and the impact of what's happening in Ukraine and of course, the European Council itself in its several meetings over the past few months has given a very high priority to this issue of food security.  With the Chair&rsquo;s permission I will stop here at this and I look forward to the committee&rsquo;s questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022071300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Scannell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Scannell.

I mentioned them earlier - wheat, maize and sunflower.  The EU imports virtually no wheat from Ukraine.  We did import relatively significant quantities of maize for our animal feed industry but there are alternatives to that on global markets and already, we see a drop in overall demand for animal feed largely for price purposes etc.  We are heavily dependent on Ukraine for sunflower oil but again there are alternatives to that such as rapeseed oil, soya oil and in some cases, even olive oils, although for different sectors sunflower oil is especially important.  I spoke earlier about the complexity of food chains so, for example, the fish processing industry is heavily reliant on sunflower oil for canned fish such as tuna and sardines.  It has certain qualities that are difficult to replace.  I mention that as an example of the complexity of these issues.  Therefore Europe is not immediately exposed in terms of its own supply chain on these commodities other than sunflower oil but the impact at global level is very significant because Ukraine accounted for a very large share of world trade in wheat.  The question is to what extent global markets will adapt to the loss of these Ukrainian grains.  First, we are trying through the solidarity lanes to ensure that that loss is kept to a minimum so that Ukraine can actually export.  However, as I mentioned, that is a big challenge due to the closure of the Black Sea ports.<\/p> <p>  On production levels in Europe itself, the wheat harvest will come on stream shortly.  We expect a European harvest of about 125 million tonnes.  To put that in perspective because these figures are so huge, that will allow us an exportable surplus of about 38 million tonnes which is really huge.  Europe is one of the biggest players on world markets for wheat.  That is about 30% of tradeable wheat.  Ironically in the circumstances, Russia will also have a very big harvest.  At global level, overall wheat production will be relatively stable.  It will be about 775 million tonnes which is little changed on the previous year.  However, that hides important sectoral differences.  What really matters in this context is the situation in the traditional exporting countries which includes Europe, Ukraine, Russia, the USA, Australia, Canada, and Argentina.<\/p><p>Markets will remain relatively fragile especially with the war ongoing.  Even in recent weeks we have seen some softening in prices.  Certainly, in Europe there is no need to panic.  I would be concerned about the global situation.<\/p><p> To give a bit of context, probably a bigger threat is the energy situation should Russia, for example, cut off the gas or reduce flows.  In that context, next week the Commission will adopt a communication on how we anticipate potential shortages in key energy inputs, notably gas, as the winter approaches.  Already a significant number of member states have introduced national provisions to reduce and prioritise who gets access to these key energy inputs.  That, in turn, leads to the Deputy's question about the inflationary impact.<\/p><p> We need to be very mindful that inflation in general has risen very sharply and increases in food prices have been a major contributory factor.  Traditionally energy and food are excluded from the main indices for inflation because they tend to be so volatile.  There had been an expectation that the increases we saw during the Covid pandemic would be transitory.  This was the assumption of the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve etc.  However, in large part as a result of the war in Ukraine it is not proving so transitory.  That has basically led to longer and more worrying levels of inflation.  Obviously, we all have a shared interest in doing more to bring inflation back significantly.  It has not been an issue for three decades or so, but those of us who are around long enough recall how painful it is to reduce inflation.  It is a painful and difficult exercise.<\/p><p> The UN is leading the efforts to reopen the Black Sea ports.  Apart from the UN itself, the key players are Ukraine, Russia and Turkey.  It would be a major bonus if they succeed.  There is already talk of a pilot shipment from the port of Odesa.  We have high expectations and hopes that these will prove successful.  However, we need to be prudent and anticipate a scenario where either it does not prove possible to reopen the ports or even if they do reopen that it will take some time for the normal logistics to pick up to their former levels.  That explains our solidarity lanes and the communications I mentioned earlier.  We cannot to reduce our efforts to provide alternatives to the Black Sea ports.  It would be wonderful if those efforts proved to be unnecessary because the Black Sea ports reopened, but it would be worthless to make such assumption.  I will stop at that.  I hope I have answered the Deputy's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022071300002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Scannell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":193,"content":"<p>My final question is climate change related.

We have very good and sophisticated satellite systems that give a read out on the climatic conditions throughout Europe, the impact on soil moisture level and in turn the impact for crops.  Already we have had to revise downwards on a number of occasions our expected overall harvest.  Two months ago, we had high expectations that we would have a very good harvest.  Now we are expecting something more in line with the five-year average.  We published our short-term outlook for cereal production last week.  We expect a drop of approximately 2.6%, which is not alarming in these circumstances.  For wheat we scaled back our forecast harvest from 130 million tonnes to 125 million tonnes, a not insignificant production but still in line with our five-year average.<\/p> <p>  Harvests tend to be unpredictable but even with the current prolonged dry conditions and even with the heatwave forecast for the next week or two, the harvest is sufficiently advanced at this stage for us to be pretty confident that we will nonetheless get a good harvest.  Obviously, the risks are on the downside especially with the heatwave etc.  There certainly will not be any issue with the availability of wheat on the European market.  I made the point earlier that we have massive export availability.  Our current projection is for 38 million tonnes.  If necessary, if that had to be run down to keep us fed, that is what would happen.  Obviously, that would have implications for global availability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022071300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Scannell"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Scannell for making the time to join us today.  His presentation and initial answers have been very helpful.  It is important to consider the origins of the Common Agricultural Policy because much of the focus in our generation has been on surpluses and so on.  The first Commissioner, Sicco Mansholt, came from a hungry Europe where there was famine in his native Netherlands.  Few will disagree with the view that surplus is certainly better than famine.  Having an assurance of food is something we all take for granted.  Just as we should not take peace in Europe for granted anymore, we certainly should not take food security for granted.  That is an important point to make.<\/p> <p>  In that vein, I want to focus on the immediate situation arising from the conflict in Ukraine.  When I say conflict, for the avoidance of doubt, it is the absolutely unconscionable assault on Ukraine by Russia.  Mr. Scannell spoke about solidarity lanes, rail and so on.  From all the evidence we have received, these will not go anywhere close to moving the actual harvest of wheat, maize or sunflower product that is normally exported from Ukraine.  Am I right in saying the only realistic way of getting significant access to market is for some mechanism to reopen the Black Sea ports?<\/p> <p>  I read the EU Council conclusions last week.  They put considerable focus on supporting the United Nations efforts in that regard.  Does Mr. Scannell think there are real prospects for that?  I ask him to quantify what the alternatives would be in the event that the Black Sea ports remain unusable.  We know the logistics of the different rail gauges between Moldova and Romania.  These are logistical issues that cannot be instantly overcome.<\/p> <p>  My next question relates to the alternatives.  Mr. Scannell spoke about Europe being able to access sufficient grain on international markets.  What is the increased capacity from countries like Canada and the United States?  Have other countries increased production this year?  It is well and good to say that we can be assured of food security in Europe, which of course is important, but it cannot be at the cost of starvation elsewhere.  I am wondering what the global situation will be.<\/p> <p>  My final question relates to the broader issue touched upon by Deputy Calleary.  I ask about the ongoing medium-term impact of climate change particularly on water availability in southern Europe.  There is drought in Italy and Spain.  Agricultural land which is normally very productive may in the medium term become unproductive.<\/p><p>I am interested in Mr. Scannell's opinion on how that is being assessed currently and what particular actions, if any, we can take to address that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022071300002#C00400","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":197,"content":"<p>There was a lot in that.  Regarding the extent to which the solidarity lanes can effectively compensate for the loss of the Black Sea ports, I acknowledged earlier that it is a huge challenge.  The Black Sea ports accommodated an average of 5 million tonnes of grains a month.  Currently, and notwithstanding huge efforts, we have managed to move 2 million to 2.5 million tonnes of grains in the month of June.  That is less than half, but it is an extraordinary achievement in the circumstances.  Obviously, however, if that is less than half, the system is not coping.  Bear in mind that one simply cannot replace these Black Sea ports.  One is not going to replace the volumes that are moved in these giant grain ships with road, rail and barges overnight, and not even in a matter of months.  If we could get it to 2.5 million to 3 million tonnes, that would be very respectable and take a great deal of the pressure off.  Bear in mind that the forthcoming Ukrainian harvest will be much reduced in any event because of the war with Russia.  A lot of the more productive areas are either in the war zone or are occupied.  It is important not to downplay or underestimate the contribution of the lanes, even at the current levels.<\/p> <p>  What is a bigger worry perhaps is not just the volumes that are being moved but the cost of that.  Moving through these alternative transport modes is much more expensive than using sea transport.  That in turn affects the competitiveness of Ukrainian grains, oil seeds and so forth.  We have to be very attentive that if these costs become prohibitively expensive, there will not be a demand in practice for these grains.  We are very attentive to that.<\/p> <p>  On the capacity of others to fill the gap, markets are resilient.  I can give the example of Europe itself.  We expect to have an exportable surplus of up to 38 million tonnes.  That is significantly more than last year.  Canada will have a very strong harvest, although it has to be accepted that this reflects an extremely poor harvest in the previous year.  Russia, ironically in this context, stands to profit from the current international situation in grain markets.  It is on schedule to have a very strong harvest.  Overall, the global availability of grains will be more or less on the same level as in the previous year.  However, what is perhaps more important is who has those grains and especially the position of the traditional big grain exporters, including the EU.  Often the best gauges of that is price.  I mentioned in that context that prices have eased not insignificantly in the past several weeks, basically because the northern hemisphere harvests are now coming on stream and there is availability and so forth.  I stress, however, that in the future markets are likely to remain fragile because a great deal is dependent on what happens in Ukraine and the extent to which Ukrainian grains, especially wheat, are able to access the market itself.  Even in the current projections we still anticipate that 10 million to 11 million tonnes of Ukrainian wheat will access world markets.  If that proves not to be the case, that will create supply pressures in the market.<\/p> <p>  The climate change dimension is huge.  Before Covid-19 our focus was on climate change for obvious and apparent reasons.  This presents massive risks to the viability of our agrifood production systems and that explains why we had the Green Deal and Farm to Fork.  The focus of the media, at least, has been somewhat distracted, understandably, by Covid-19, Ukraine and so forth, but we cannot afford to lose sight of climate change.  That is why, even in the context of what is happening in Ukraine, we reminded member states that in the preparation of their so-called Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, strategic plans they need to have resilience and food security very much in focus, including how they respond, working with the Commission, to what is happening in Ukraine.  That includes how they make their systems more resilient to climate change.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy gave the example of water availability.  We expect member states to use the resources available from the CAP to work with their farmers to ensure that they can deal with these challenges, including water availability.  Obviously that is a bigger issue in some member states than in others.  If one is following the media, Italy is currently going through a major drought.  The River Po is running dry and so forth.  It really brings home to us that this a huge problem.  These things are not happening once in a generation any more but happening every second or third year.  It is extremely important that member states are very ambitious in their CAP strategic plans on making their systems more resilient on climate change.<\/p> <p>  If the Deputy has any follow-up questions, I am happy to take them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022071300002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Scannell"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":198,"content":"<p>That is fine.

He has dealt with a fair amount of the subjects in which we are interested.  Food security comes down to the work that has always been done at European level to ensure the supply and the quality.  As Mr. Scannell said, supply on a world basis is not going to be the issue, but price will be a major one.  What is the disaster reckoning and what plans are put in place if there are difficulties with releasing that 10 million to 11 million tonnes of Ukrainian wheat and other necessary foodstuffs?  We have seen it already happen on some level in the energy sector, and it can take a long time for this to happen, where there is a reorientation in respect of who is buying from whom and who falls into what particular camp.  All of it is the outworking of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.<\/p> <p>  From listening to Mr. Scannell as regards food, and many new terms are being bandied about regarding the importance of resilience and strategic autonomy, Europe is okay at present.   However, I am wondering about the plans that are in place.  There are two issues.  We all see the European Union on its best day as a force for good in the world.  However, it also exists within the world and we know that globalisation and the world economic system have taken a complete reorientation.  It is how we cope with that and what disaster planning is put in place, particularly for those areas that will be under severe pressure such as the Horn of Africa and areas in the Middle East.  Where is the European Union and the Commission as regards that disaster planning?<\/p> <p>  Again, whatever the issue is with regard to food, energy is where there could be real difficulties for all of us over the next while.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022071300002#D00500","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":201,"content":"<p>The international dimension is very preoccupying.  I make a distinction in that context between those countries outside of Europe that can access markets through their own means and countries that are reliant on humanitarian aid.  Taking the example of wheat, it is well recognised that the countries of north Africa and the Middle East are very dependent on wheat imports.  They import from around the world.  Before this crisis, these were extremely demanding market participants.  Countries such as Algeria, Egypt, Tunisia and so forth would put out their periodic tenders seeking submissions by X of the best prices and delivery conditions for 100,000 or 200,000 tonnes of wheat to meet the following specifications and so forth.  They basically were hard bargainers and often got very good deals.  We were even faced with a lot of complaints that they drove too hard a bargain.<\/p><p>However, markets are cyclical and when they receive a shock, such as what happened with Covid and its impact on logistical chains and then subsequently Ukraine, etc., prices rose.  The issue here is not so much availability, but affordability, and these countries are challenged in that context.  I mentioned that prices have eased somewhat in recent weeks.  I mentioned also that the northern hemisphere harvests are now coming on stream, so for the next several months there will be plenty of availability.  The question will be what kind of price they will be prepared to pay.<\/p><p> On the broader dimension, I mentioned we had a communication on 23 March on food security.  It had three components: Europe itself; Ukraine; and the international dimension.  We explicitly acknowledged that we have to be very mindful of, basically, instability of the world market and how that impacts, including the humanitarian dimension.  The Deputy mentioned the Sahel and Horn of Africa region, etc.  In the past several months, for example, I do not have the exact figure in front of me, but I recall it was something of the order of &euro;1 billion was pledged by the EU towards the Sahel and Lake Chad area and a further &euro;600 million to the Horn of Africa in direct humanitarian aid.  We had the so-called Lugano Conference just last week on Ukraine.  Within the package of measures there, there is &euro;500 million, I understand, to assist Ukrainians in dealing with the current challenges to their agriculture and food situation.  <\/p><p> We are very alert to and mindful of this international dimension.  It is not just a question of short-term fixes.  Basically, these countries have to work towards having more resilient agrifood production systems themselves.  We all accept that trade is extremely important, including for Europe.  Let us not forget we have a huge trade surplus in agrifood products.  It is a big part of our economy, especially in Ireland.  However, we need to very mindful also that a country is not, let us say, overly exposed, should there be there destruction on world markets for whatever reason, it could be a plant disease, a trade dispute, war, etc.  Many developing countries are very vulnerable in this respect and need to invest an awful lot more in their agrifood production systems to basically ensure they are not as vulnerable as they currently are to disruption of world markets.  Obviously, we have a duty to assist them in that process also through development aid.  That, as I said, was well signalled in the communication on 23 March.  <\/p><p> I will not pretend there are any magic solutions to this that can happen overnight.  It is and will be a very big concern.  What is happening in Ukraine has made that concern an awful lot greater.  Of course, everybody remembers the last big spike in world food commodity prices, which triggered the so-called Arab Spring.  If it is not carefully handled, we would risk finding ourselves in a similar situation in this case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022071300002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Scannell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; gets one more supplementary question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022071300002#E00200","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":204,"content":"<p>We all know we are in a different place.

It is no secret that the Commission is under much pressure to essentially accommodate concerns on food security at the cost of our sustainability objectives.  For example, when the new CAP reform enters into force from 1 January next year, we should essentially postpone certain sustainability-orientated reforms to basically not compromise our production.  Of course, there is a whole discussion to be had also on the extent to which sustainability measures are at the cost of productivity.  There is a very strong body of evidence that suggest that these sustainability measures are essential to ensure the long-term viability of our systems and we should not abandon them for short-term fixes.  On Monday, the agriculture Council will touch on many of these issues.  The Commission will present an update on the current evaluation process of the CAP strategic plans and the extent to which, if any, they need to be fine-tuned to take account of the food security-related issue.  Difficult choices will need to be taken.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy raised a very important issue on fertilisers.  When I highlighted earlier that Europe is in a good position traditionally, thanks to the CAP, etc., we still have our vulnerabilities.  I mentioned, in that context, fertiliser in particular.  We import huge quantities of potash and phosphates, as well as huge quantities of gas for our nitrogen-based fertiliser industry.  If those supplies were compromised for one reason or another, that would then call into question the availability and the cost of fertilisers, which in turn would have a big impact on farmers planting decisions and the prices they receive.  If they choose, for example, to use lesser quantities of fertilisers, that would compromise yields, which again brings us back to food security.  We are back, essentially, to the same kind of issues.  <br\/><br\/>On the extent to which recent weather conditions have basically allowed them to escape the consequences of less fertiliser use, I do not think it is the weather conditions <i>per se<\/i>, but there is a so-called concept of a phosphate holiday.  Basically, you can cut back on the usage of phosphates and potash for the short term.  Generally levels in soils are sufficient and Teagasc does much work with farmers to basically identify where they might be deficient in this context.  Essentially, you can cut back in the short term.  The extent to which you can do that in a second growing cycle or, indeed, a third is questionable.  If the Deputy asked me to highlight the areas that we need to keep very clearly on our radar moving forward in terms of food security, I would say fertiliser availability and, behind that, energy availability.  I mentioned the forthcoming communication on the coming winter.  That is very prominent on the radar.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022071300002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Scannell"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":206,"content":"<p>We have 25 minutes and three contributors remaining.

I will probably have some supplementary questions arising from some of the contributions earlier on.<\/p> <p>  In many regards, we are facing into a perfect storm with the war in Ukraine and climate change.  Mr. Scannell said that supply will not be the issue and cost is, but it is very concerning to see the impact climate is having on crop production.  I saw yesterday that France&rsquo;s wheat production is estimated to be down 7%, with a 15% drop in crops in Romania as well.  That is probably replicated in many areas.  Northern Europe is probably the opposite and probably has good growth.  However, there are certainly huge concerns in relation to climate and also the situation with the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia.  We see that there are 25 million tonnes of grains essentially locked in Ukraine now.<\/p> <p>  At yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence we had the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, in with us.  I raised the question about Odesa and the prospect of that port being reopened.  I do not want to put words in his mouth, but he said he was optimistic that something might happen in the near future in terms of reopening Odesa, which will be critical.<\/p><p>Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; raised the issue of fertiliser, which will be an issue of concern.  Mr. Scannell said we have the ability to sustain the amount of fertiliser we have over the next year or so, along with some other mitigation measures.  He might be able to give us some detail of how dependent Europe is on fertiliser from Russia and Ukraine.<\/p><p> I also want to touch on the issue of the humanitarian crisis tragically unfolding in Africa, Afghanistan and other areas and the impact climate and the war in Ukraine will have on those very vulnerable regions.  We know there was a crisis in those regions before the war in Ukraine.  Donations to the World Food Programme, WFP, across all of those regions have been down consistently over the past number of years, which has put pressure on it.  What analysis, if any, has been carried out on that?  I have heard what he said about money coming from Europe into the Sahel and the Horn of Africa.  That has to be welcomed.  <\/p><p> What analysis has been carried out on the displacement of people in those regions?  Obviously there is an issue.  People in Africa are being displaced.  Significant numbers of people are fleeing for their lives with their families across the Mediterranean Sea and are making their way to Europe.  Some horrific measures are being taken by some European countries to stop that influx of migrants.  The WFP is failing in many regards.  What impact will the number of displaced people have on the broader region?<\/p><p> In the view of Mr. Scannell, is enough being done by the European Union to avoid humanitarian crises in those regions?  I refer to the military spend by the EU to provide military assistance to Ukraine which, of course, the Ukrainian Government has asked for.  I will not get into that debate.  However, given the comparison between the military spend and the spend on humanitarian aid on regions that are at crisis stage, is enough being done by the European Union to give assistance to the many people who need it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022071300002#E00600","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I will start with the fertiliser issue.  Nobody would question that we are hugely dependent on imports, but we have to make a distinction between the different components.  For example, in terms of potash we were traditionally reliant on major imports from Belarus and even before the war in Ukraine we had taken sanctions against Belarus.  Now we have to turn to alternative sources on world markets for potash.  Unfortunately, very few are in Europe.  Canada and Morocco are major producers of potash and phosphate.  China is also a large producer, although it has restricted exports and given priority to domestic consumers.<\/p> <p>  Nonetheless, in terms of potash and phosphate, we need to take account of what I mentioned earlier.  Farmers can, in the short term at least, ease off on their use.  We have been able to cope pretty well.  The European fertiliser industry comprises major traders and is very good at sourcing products on global markets and selling them on global markets, including in Europe.  There has been no supply crash in Europe.<\/p> <p>  We are more concerned about nitrogen-based fertilisers.  We are very reliant on imports of Russian gas in that regard.  For nitrogen-based fertilisers we can do one of two things, that is, import fertilisers or produce them in Europe.  By and large, they have been produced in Europe, but that means importing gas.  That is what we have been doing.  A lot of that gas, as I acknowledged and we all know, comes from Russia.  The signs have been ominous in regard to Russia deciding to curtail supplies, such as recent maintenance issues on Nord Stream I and the formal cut-off of gas to Poland and Bulgaria.  It would be imprudent not to plan for a situation where gas supplies would become even more precarious.  I am repeating myself, but that explains why we have communication coming forward next week on how we work with member states to anticipate potential shortages to the end of this year.  As I mentioned earlier, this needs to be prominent on our radar screens, and indeed it is.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the humanitarian dimension, my expertise is in agriculture, CAP, supporting European farmers, etc.  The humanitarian aspect is important, but we have other specialist services that work in that field.  Food is obviously extremely important in this context.  I acknowledge our communication on food security, which very transparently highlights that there are major challenges at the global level, including in the humanitarian area which explains why, to repeat myself, there is &euro;1 billion for the Sahel and Lake Chad area and &euro;600 million for the Horn of Africa.  <\/p> <p>  Is that enough?  Frankly, I have to turn to the development community on that and the ongoing debate on the extent to which Europe and other international donors can, should and do work with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, FAO, WFP and other UN agencies, to not just provide humanitarian aid as a kind of short-term fix for clear shortages in the market of foodstuffs.  We are not dealing with a potential risk to food security in some of these countries; it is actually happening.  There are lots of figures available on the number of people in precarious food security situations, which has increased sharply in recent months and years.  <\/p> <p>  I return to Deputy Calleary's question on inflationary impacts.  In Europe, we spend a relatively small share of our overall household expenditure on food, with important distinctions between high, low and middle-income earners.  On average, it is relatively low.  In developing countries, the figure is relatively high, at 50% or more.  Anything that leads to an increase in food prices in these countries squeezes incomes and leaves a lot of citizens in these countries in a situation whereby they do not have money to buy food.  As I said, the FAO has produced a lot of figures that are very worrying in that context.  <\/p> <p>  The international community is working hard.  I mentioned the Lugano conference on Ukraine that took place last week.  The UN General Assembly, FAO and WFP are all preoccupied with how we deal with this issue, with the added complication that we saw a sharp increase in commodity prices even before the war in Ukraine.  As to solutions, perhaps the committee could invite one of my colleagues from our international services to come back to it at some future date.  That merits a long discussion in itself.  I am sorry if I am not able to give the Deputy the answer he hoped or expected.  I ask him to keep in mind my limitations in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022071300002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Scannell"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I have some very quick questions.

In light of what is happening with Ukraine, does Mr. Scannell foresee any significant changes to CAP or would he propose any changes to it?  Finally, I note we are, as Ursula von der Leyen has put it, stepping up food production in Europe.  This will have an impact on agricultural emissions.

Each and every member state is very preoccupied with this for the very good reason that food prices have gone up sharply and this impacts on lower income groups in particular so it basically has a major societal impact.  What political system can afford to ignore that impact, which is why you cannot pick up a newspaper these days without reading about this particular issue?  I am not going to go into what Ireland is doing as compared to France as compared to Greece etc., but suffice it to say this is very prominent on the economic and political agenda Europe-wide.  In so far as the Commission itself has a role, I go back to our communication of 23 March on food security.  We signalled that in a European context, member states need to use the instruments available to them and that includes for example flexibility on VAT rates on food and food products in general; social support measures to funnel resources to lower income groups to help them deal with the price impact; and measures on the supply chain to allow farmers to deal with higher input costs, so that in turn their producer prices are kept at a reasonable level.  Obviously if producer prices are increasing, as a reflection of increased input costs, this has an impact further on in the food chain.  <\/p> <p>  This brings me to the Senator's question as to the extent we in the Commission are working to adapt the CAP to reflect what is happening in Ukraine.  I mentioned that member states are currently at a very advanced stage in their CAP strategic plan preparations for the newly reformed CAP from 1 January.  This is a huge undertaking but, as part of that process, the Commission has already written so-called \"observation letters\" to the member states on their preliminary plans.  We took that opportunity to remind them to factor in the need to review just how resilient their agrifood systems are in the light of what is happening in Ukraine and, in the background also, the far bigger existential threat to agrifood production systems, from climate change.  Basically we need to see from member states a high level of ambition on how they will anticipate and take into account climate change because this is not an issue they can afford to ignore, nor can farmers ignore it, nor indeed are they.  I do not think there is any member state or any farming organisation or individual farmer who does not feel impacted.  They are the ones on the ground who see the consequences.  We have been speaking repeatedly about the impact of the current dry spell in Europe and of the heatwave that is currently taking place on projected harvests.  Every farmer growing cereals in Europe is checking the weather forecast ten times a day.  They recall that they are doing this a lot more than they did in the past.  In terms of how they plan or what they plant, they now increasingly have to factor in the situation on water, fertiliser and the plant protection products used etc., so that they can be viable and more sustainable.  Nobody can escape the implications of this challenge ahead of us.  We have to remain flexible and that is why on Monday in the agriculture Council, we will hear from the member states on their take on the current situation and the extent, if any, to which our plans need to be adapted to Ukraine or to the climate change situation, etc.  I will stop at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022071300002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Scannell"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Scannell.

If my first question has already been answered, leave it at that and I will get the text later.  I am interested in hearing what Mr. Scannell has to say about a number of issues.  First, with regard to the &euro;500 million support that has been afforded to EU farmers, is there any conditionality attached to that?  Does Mr. Scannell know if it is a straightforward fund or what conditions are attached to it?  How does the Commission envisage this money being spent, or is it largely being left up to member states to decide what is needed?  Second, in the context of sustainability and climate change, obviously we are all operating in that context and agriculture must also.  I am going to ask a few questions about this country in particular.  In Ireland, how can we reorient our agricultural models both in the short and in the long term to try to ensure greater sustainability?  I am not asking Mr. Scannell to pre-empt the agriculture Council on Monday but just to give a general overview on that.  Third, and this is not going to happen unless they call a meeting this afternoon,  if I had to meet a group of sheep, hill or suckler farmers in north Leitrim or south Sligo to discuss climate change this evening and I told them I had a meeting about food security with the Commission this morning, what message could Mr. Scannell give them?  When we talk to farmers about CAP and food production, many of them will still say that the CAP was initially brought in to ensure food security.  To most farmers, this means you produce more food.  They see it as a simple straight line.  If Mr Scannell could give them one message, what might that be?  I did not attend a recent seminar on food security at which Mr. Scannell was speaking but one of my staff members did and they took notes.  It might have been the European Commission seminar last week.  One of the questions he was asked was what one single action could be taken to avoid a global food crisis and the answer Mr. Scannell gave was to stop the war.  He may have said more but that is the answer I have here.  Putting that aside - and let us assume that the <i>status quo<\/i>remains for the next six to 12 months - what single action does Mr. Scannell think could be taken in order to avoid a global food crisis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022071300002#G00400","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I will answer the first question as I did not touch on it earlier, regarding conditionality in the &euro;500 million package announced on 23 March.  That amount can be, and in most cases was, accompanied by twice as much from national funds so &euro;1.5 billion in total.  Yes, there is conditionality.  Essentially member states are expected to target those farmers most directly impacted by rising input costs, included fertiliser costs in particular.  We already have reports from members states on who they targeted accordingly.  It was mostly those in the livestock industry because they were very hard hit by very sharp increases in animal feed costs.  Cereals producers on the other hand, even though fertiliser and energy costs have risen sharply, benefited from even sharper increases in producer prices.  By and large, the livestock sector seemed to have been the biggest beneficiary across all the member states.  We will produce a report in due course on the overall take-up etc.  The conditionality requirements left much of the flexibility to the member states.  Frankly, we in the Commission are around a long time and we accept the situation varies enormously from one member state to another, from one sector to another, and indeed even within sectors.<\/p><p>We accept that the situation varies enormously from one member state to another, from one sector to another and even within sectors.  There is no single one-size-fits-all approach.  Member states have to be given sufficient flexibility to allow them to target who is most deserving of support.  I have heard nothing to suggest that they have abused that flexibility.  Hopefully I will not be disappointed when we get around to checking how they spent it.<\/p><p> On the issue of how we reorient our systems, Ireland was mentioned specifically.  It comes back to the CAP strategic plan, which is perhaps the single biggest reform of the CAP.  We are giving member states the flexibility to design their own agrifood production systems within the framework of the CAP, adapted to their own needs and challenges.  That includes climate change and sustainability.  Deputy Calleary would be familiar with this from his time as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Ireland has in its own hands the instruments to design a system that is fit for Ireland.  We in the Commission have an obligation to ensure that conforms to the overall structure and is consistent and coherent with what other member states are doing.  There is an obligation on all of us to ensure it fits in within the wider Green Deal, Farm to Fork, Fit for 55 objectives, that is, creating a sustainable agrifood production system that will keep us fed without excessive contributions to greenhouse gas emissions.  That is a big challenge but it has to be met because if we fail on that at member state level or EU level, the consequences will be huge, including for food production.  Food sustainability and food security are not opposites.  They are entirely complementary to one another.  If we fail at one we will fail at the other.<\/p><p> On the message to hill farmers and suckler farmers, the big strength of those sectors in terms of CAP sustainability is that, apart from contributing to food supply, they are extremely rich in their contribution to biodiversity and rural development.  Sustainability is not only about economics.  We would stress this.  There are three pillars, namely, the economic, the social and the environmental.  These sectors contribute hugely to the social and environmental pillars, as well as the quality dimension.  If I were working in any of these sectors I would be very proud of what I was doing.  They should be proud and they should be supported in what they are doing.  Sometimes they feel they are being ignored but that is not the case and should not be the case.  That would be a big mistake.<\/p><p> Regarding what single issue would help, I already mentioned stopping the war in Ukraine.  That would help hugely.  Putting that aside, the answer is innovation, basically.  Unless our agrifood production systems and our society in general become much more innovative in how we deal with and use energy, find alternatives and deal with climate change, we are going to be in huge trouble.  The CAP reform puts a very heavy stress on innovation because traditionally and historically it is always innovation that has come to the rescue.  If we are to move to systems that use less fertiliser and fewer plant protection products, we are going to have to find new technologies that allow us to meet these objectives.  In other words, we need innovation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022071300002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Scannell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I thank Mr Scannell.

I see some familiar names and faces from the members' colleagues on the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  We value our engagements with the Oireachtas very highly and see these opportunities as an important part of our work.  Joining me today are council member Dr. Adele Bergin, and Mr. Killian Carroll and Mr. Kevin Timoney from the council&rsquo;s secretariat.<br\/><br\/>IFAC is an official independent body established under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012.  Its mandate is to assess and endorse the official macroeconomic forecasts, assess the budgetary projections, assess compliance with the fiscal rules, and assess the fiscal stance.  Its focus is on the overall fiscal stance rather than on individual tax measures or spending items.<br\/><br\/>Following two difficult years due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Irish economy is now facing the challenge of a surge in energy and food prices due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  Together with other price pressures as the economy recovered from Covid-19, inflation in Ireland has increased to its highest rate in a generation.  The strength of the pick-up in inflation in recent months was not anticipated.  The Government&rsquo;s projections in April were for annual consumer price index, CPI, inflation of 6.2 % this year, while the inflation rate for June was already estimated to be 9.6 %.  Globally, forecasts for inflation have been revised up, while expectations for growth have been scaled back.  Higher energy and food prices, together with higher interest rates, will dampen growth in advanced economies.  Uncertainty is very high, including around energy supplies in Europe this coming winter.<br\/><br\/>Despite this, recent economic data for Ireland have remained robust.  Consumer credit card spending has continued to grow in recent months.  Employment and tax receipts remain strong.  Looking ahead, the Irish economy will inevitably be impacted by global and European developments, although Ireland&rsquo;s direct exposure to Russia is less than for some other countries.  Our specialisation in fast-growing digital and pharmaceutical activities may continue to be a source of resilience.  Nevertheless, high inflation is likely to lead to the first annual fall in overall household real income in a decade.  The impact of the higher cost of living creates real hardship for low-income households, who spend more than a third of disposable income on energy and food, and some other vulnerable groups.<br\/><br\/>Against this background, the Government published its summer economic statement on the 4 July.  This sets out its strategy for budget 2023<i><\/i>in September and updates the overall amounts the Government plans to spend in the years ahead, although it did not revise the full economic and budgetary forecasts compared with April.<br\/><br\/>Strong tax revenues have led to a new official projection for a budget surplus in 2022, one year earlier than anticipated.  This primarily reflects stronger than expected tax receipts, particularly from corporation tax.  The Government faces a delicate balancing act in the budget between protecting the economy and poorer households from higher energy and food prices, while avoiding adding to inflation through second-round effects.  Fiscal policy cannot permanently shelter the economy as a whole from higher prices.<br\/><br\/>In last October&rsquo;s budget, the Government set out plans to increase core spending by &euro;4 billion in 2023 to &euro;84.1 billion.  Core spending is Exchequer spending excluding one-off measures and unemployment benefits.  This was consistent with a new fiscal rule to grow core spending in line with an underlying sustainable growth rate of the economy of 5 %.  The IFAC welcomed this new rule as an anchor to keep the public finances on a sustainable path and to reduce the debt ratio to a more prudent level.  The summer economic statement now plans to raise spending in 2023 by &euro;5.3 billion, a growth rate of some 6.6%, with an additional &euro;400 million in measures from this September, taking the level in 2023 to &euro;85.8 billion.<br\/><br\/>The 5% spending rule is a significant strengthening of Ireland&rsquo;s fiscal framework, although some aspects of its design need to be clarified.  It is welcome that the Government has continued to use it as a reference point, even while deviating temporarily from the rule for the year ahead.  The rule provides a useful signal that policy should not try to compensate fully for higher inflation.  It is sensible, however, to allow some leeway during this period when inflation is very far from trend.<br\/><br\/>The summer economic statement further increased the size of the planned tax package from &euro;500 million to just over &euro;1 billion.  Inflation tends to raise the tax burden because it draws more income into the higher tax bands.  The upward revision to the tax package would help to prevent the tax burden from rising substantially.  Well-targeted temporary measures can also help to smooth the transition to higher prices or address one-off events, such as Covid-19 or the immediate needs of refugees, without impacting the underlying dynamics of the public finances.  The amounts that have been allocated will allow existing measures to be extended or could allow for some new temporary measures to be put in place.<br\/><br\/>Taken together, the plan outlined in the summer economic statement would strike a reasonable balance between creating space to support the economy and more vulnerable households, and avoiding adding to inflation by increasing demand excessively in an already inflationary environment.  The Government will, however, need to make difficult choices in the budget.  Increases of &euro;2.7 billion in permanent core spending remains to be allocated after taking into account the planned rise in public investment, rising pensions costs and the existing pay deal.  This amount is relatively large compared with those in recent budgets, but much of it is likely to be required just to stand still in terms of maintaining the existing level of public services, and welfare and pension rates.  Indeed, given the current trajectory of inflation, this amount would likely be insufficient to fully index public sector pay and welfare rates.<br\/><br\/>There is very limited space for new policy initiatives beyond cost-of-living measures at this time.  Better targeting of supports would improve the trade-off between helping those most exposed and risks of second-round inflation.  The council&rsquo;s full assessment of the budget package will depend on the details of what is announced on budget day, together with economic developments over the coming months.<br\/><br\/>Overall, the public finances have recovered well from the Covid-19 pandemic.  Prior to the surge in inflation, the budget balance was set to reach a sizeable surplus in the years ahead.  Combined with lower interest rates and underlying growth of the economy, the government debt ratio would fall significantly in the coming years.  The high average maturity of debt and large cash reserves provide some insulation in the near term from higher interest rates.  Nevertheless, the debt ratio remains high by historical standards and compared with other small advanced economies.  The over-reliance on corporation tax flatters this picture.  Taking the council&rsquo;s estimates that &euro;6 billion to &euro;9 billion of these receipts are excess compared with fundamentals, this implies that the current surplus is equivalent to a substantial deficit.  Corporation tax last year represented nearly &euro;1 in every &euro;4 of Exchequer tax revenue, amounting to nearly 7% of national income.<\/p><p>A large share of this is paid by just a handful of multinational corporations.  While these revenues could remain strong for some years, they depend on developments and decisions made outside Ireland.  These revenues are volatile and subject to the risk of a sudden large fall.<\/p><p> The Government should take measures to reduce its reliance on corporation tax by, at a minimum, capping and preferably reducing over time how much of this money is spent.  This would reduce the risks of a reversal in revenues and avoid overheating the economy.  The reduction in exposure could be achieved in various ways including paying down debt more quickly, making contributions to the rainy-day fund or by reinstating the National Pensions Reserve Fund in order that the corporation tax boom would be used to reduce the need to increase taxes in the future.<\/p><p> Looking ahead, major policy commitments and challenges need to be properly costed and factored into the Government&rsquo;s medium-term plans.  These pressures on public spending raise significant questions about how they will be accommodated within the Government's spending rule alongside existing policies.  There are three main challenges.<\/p><p> First, Ireland&rsquo;s population will age rapidly in the years ahead due to people living longer and the coming retirement of Irish baby boomers.  Annual spending on pensions is set to rise by about 1.5% to 2% of national income by 2030.  The pensions commission&rsquo;s preferred option involved raising the State pension age and substantial increases in PRSI rates, amounting to almost &euro;1,000 per year for a worker on a typical wage of &euro;35,000.  Maintaining the retirement age at its current level of age 66 would add approximately another &euro;800 in PRSI payments for a worker on a typical wage.<\/p><p> Second, the Government is required to halve Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared with the 2018 level.  This will be a major change to the way our economy and society functions.  However, the impact on the public finances has not been fully assessed or factored into budgetary plans.  Estimates from Mr. John FitzGerald put the cost at an additional 1.7% to 2.3% of national income on average over the years 2026 to 2030.<\/p><p> Third, the Government has not costed its major healthcare reforms under Sl&aacute;intecare beyond this year.  There is no clarity on how much progress has been made to date and what the overall cost is likely to be.<\/p><p> The public finances can play a key role in helping to address the impact of the higher cost of living, particularly on lower-income and disadvantaged households, but it must be done in a way that does not add to inflationary pressure to ensure that higher inflation does not become entrenched.  While Government borrowing was key to protecting the economy during the pandemic, the fiscal response now needs to be more balanced.  Fiscal policy cannot permanently shelter the economy as a whole from higher prices.  Despite the urgency of current pressures, it is important to maintain the economy and public finances on a sustainable path and address the longer-term challenges for the public finances.

The summer economic statement provided &euro;2.2 billion in respect of maintaining existing levels of services and &euro;800 million in respect of pre-committed increases in capital ceilings.  Last year, that figure was approximately &euro;1.6 billion in terms of services for 2022.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Barnes pointed out that in its report in May, the council noted that the 3% increase that underpins this allocation has changed from the SPU despite higher inflation.  Given the fact that we are seeing higher inflation and that the numbers have not changed, from what we have seen, in more than a year, how much of the discretionary money does Mr. Barnes think will be eaten into when we factor in what is happening in terms of inflation?  Mr. Barnes also made the point that existing pay agreements are factored into the existing levels of service but not future pay agreements, one of which we know is under consideration.

In any typical budget, many of the spending increases are needed just to maintain wages and pay.  That is a welcome change.<\/p> <p>  One of the difficulties with the SPU is the existing level of service beyond the current year.  There are no real details about how finance gets to it.  Usually, it is a more realistic number than some of the numbers we have seen for spending in recent years.  There are no very clear underpinnings so it is harder to work out exactly how we would adjust that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the Deputy's bigger question on the higher inflation that is now expected next year, which is important, if we were to make up for the unexpected inflation this year, which will actually be a much bigger number that, our assessment is that if we were to just stand still, the total amount of spending that was allocated for next year in the summer economic statement would not be enough to index all these bits fully in line with inflation if we take into account wages, welfare rates, pensions and other parts.  Our assessment is that the costs of standing still are higher than the total amount for spending next year.  That means within the overall spending limit the Government has set, choices will have to be made between different aspects of it.  There may be some aspects where it is desirable not to fully index them.  There are obviously some areas within that which would be priorities.  As I noted earlier, there is obviously not going to be much space for any additional spending on new programmes unless, of course, taxes were to increase, which, not relative to the rule but in economic terms, would make a difference.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the Deputy's specific question on pay, we have not made that calculation so I do not know what the impact of that pay deal would be.

Hospital costs relating to laundry have gone up.  Energy costs for hospitals have gone up.  The Department has calculated &euro;2.2 billion just to keep all those services going.

I will start at the beginning.  We do not have an updated figure for inflation.  That is one of the reasons we will make a fuller assessment in September.  The pick-up in inflation in recent months has been really strong, and far greater than anyone had anticipated.  Some of that relates to major uncertainties about energy prices, wheat prices and other food prices.  We have seen movements in different directions there.  Coming into the winter, we might be much clearer about energy prices.  Some of these prices might fall.  We have seen a fall in wheat prices in recent weeks, but there are different pressures in other areas.<\/p> <p>  The euro is also weakening against the dollar.  Many of these things are priced in dollars, which will also add to inflation.  There are other sources of inflation with tightness in the labour market and other issues in the economy.  It is very difficult to know.  The most useful thing may not be to look at the year-on-year inflation but, rather, to try to work out the underlying dynamics.  It is very unclear as to whether there will be new shocks to inflation.  It will also take time for the shocks we have seen to work through the economy and in particular the effect on wages.  These things are very uncertain and we should have a bit more information in September.<\/p> <p>  In our models of the standstill, we index welfare payments, including pensions.  When we do it to prices, we do it to the economy-wide measure of prices.  The Deputy is right that in order to strictly speaking maintain the real living standards of people on welfare or pensions, we would need to use the inflation rate relevant to them.  This is likely to be significantly higher than the overall rate of inflation because we know they spend much more on things that have increased such as food and energy.  Partly because I do not have a clear view on inflation and much less for those groups, I do not know what is appropriate.  How that compensation should be made is really a choice for the political system.  It clearly makes sense to protect groups and sectors that are far more exposed than others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":237,"content":"<p>Mr. Barnes mentioned that the summer economic statement has revised up the Government's taxation package from &euro;500 million to slightly over &euro;1 billion.  He said that the upward revision of the tax package would help to prevent the tax burden from rising substantially.  I wish to tease that out.  Last month, Dr. Barra Roantree from the ESRI noted that the benefits from changes to the standard rate band is concentrated towards the top of the income distribution.  Therefore, changing the upper band gives no benefit to 80% of tax units.  The IFAC income assessment report in May noted that high-income households which would benefit from a tax change such as this would simply increase their savings, increasing their spending power.  We know that 80% of tax units do not pay tax at the top rate and only 20% would benefit from a change to the standard rate.  To have secondary effects and so forth, tax cuts can be provided to people who will increase their spending power and possibly fuel inflation.  Is that the best measure in terms of tax cuts?<\/p> <p>  I take two things from Mr. Barnes's opening statement.  I see a change in his position to the effect that tax cuts to the standard rate are required - so a tax rate for 20% of income earners.  An inference could be drawn that the increase in the tax package from &euro;500 million to &euro;1 billion is actually for this purpose.

We do not take a view on either the design of specific temporary measures or of tax measures.  We were setting out that if the Government were trying to keep the tax system the same in economic terms as it was before - regardless of whether people think that is a good idea - the higher inflation now would draw more income into the higher band, leading to an overall tax increase.  In order to maintain it as it was before would require more of an adjustment to those tax bands in cash terms.  By increasing the amount allocated to that, the Government is making it more likely that there will be less of an increase.  In previous years, the Government has not always fully indexed the tax system, which has been a source of real tax increase.  As the Deputy says, it falls mostly on higher earners; that is how it works.  Sometimes it has introduced other measures to offset it.  There is often much confusion about the indexation issue and the impact of inflation on taxes.<\/p><p>If one wanted to keep the system as it is then today, in economic terms, one would basically have to index the bands by more.

The point has been made, and rightly so, that the budget will come down to choices and targeted measures.  The Government has increased the taxation package up to &euro;1 billion.  After one subtracts the public pay agreement, there will be less than &euro;2 billion in discretionary expenditure.  Once social welfare increase are taken out of that, we are talking small numbers.  Mr. Barnes has argued that we need targeted measures.  He also stated that we need to ensure that we do not have second-round effects.  Taxation is quite expensive.

There are choices to be made.  One choice is about how one allocates a given amount of spending between different uses.  The other question is whether one wants to raise taxes to create more space.  One option would be, for example, to do less with indexation, which would give the Government, subject to one qualification, more space.  In that way, it could allocate more towards helping other groups in society through higher spending.  There is a case for doing that.  There is also a case for taxing people who earn higher incomes - and, perhaps, incomes that have done quite well in the past few years, as we discussed in our May-June report - and using that to help the more vulnerable groups.<\/p> <p>  One important caveat and one concern of ours is about the design of the spending rule.  The Government's spending rule is purely about spending.  If one takes, for example, the European spending rule, then that takes into account changes in tax policy.  If, for example, under the European rule, one increased taxes, and that could include through not indexing the tax bands, it would give more space to increase spending because, in terms of the overall balance, that would be neutral, which is what we really care about.  It is just that one reaches that point in a different way.  At a minimum, it would be good for the Government to clarify how that is treated.  From an economic point of view, however, it would be a very good improvement to allow discretionary tax measures to enter into that spending equation.  There are a lot of other good reasons for doing so as well.  It also closes down any incentive that the Government might have, in different circumstances, to cut taxes because it cannot do anything on the spending side politically.  In this context, it is very sensible that the Government should at least have the option within the spending rule to also change the tax and spending mix.  The council is not taking a view as to whether that is a desirable thing or not in terms of whether that should be done regarding the mix of spending and taxation that one wants.  The spending rule, which should really be about hitting a particular balance, should give the Government the option to raise taxes and give itself more space for spending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I hear what Mr. Barnes said to the effect that lower indexation would lead to more expenditure.

As I said, this will involve a massive social and economic transition.

For some time now we have been concerned the Government has not provided an assessment or full costing of how it thinks these forces are going to play out, either for the economy or for the public finances.  One of the costs is going to be higher investment in energy, insulation and these kinds of things and our sense is much of that is included in the national development plan, so it seems to be accounted for.<\/p> <p>  What is less certain is the kind of current ongoing spending that might be needed and also things, for example, like compensating those whose incomes are adversely affected by these changes.  What we see now with the higher energy prices is partly related to that.  There is also the impact on the tax system if we are all driving electric cars in ten years.  The Government makes a significant amount of money from motor fuel taxes.  What is going to replace that?  How is that going to be managed?  There are a lot of really big questions to be answered.  Some of the work is starting to be done.  We see the paper I mentioned from Dr. John FitzGerald that has estimates of about 2% of national income per year.

Most countries in Europe are in the same situation as we are, that we are basically a long way behind in our analysis of this major change, but I hope there will be some progress in the time to come.

There has been a trend of declining interest rates over time.  As he also said, in the Irish case, something that gives us some protection in the short term is the fact that we have locked in low interest rates for much of our debt for many years ahead.  The fact that we borrowed to build up cash reserves means we have had to borrow more.  This means we have got a stock of low-interest debt.

I would add that the building of houses into those capital projects could be a good use of corporation tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#G00300","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":275,"content":"<p>There are two responses to that.  The short answer is \"No\".  There are two reasons for this.  First, as the national development plan reflects, investment needs be permanently higher in the future because we are going to move towards a more capital-intensive economy.  Whatever we do, it is going take us a long time to catch up on housing, energy production and other things.  It is not just a sort of temporary one-off that we invest in something and it will be done.  We have to build it into the baseline because it may not be as high, but investment will be higher than it has been historically.  There is obviously a difference between taking that money and spending it on investment compared with spending it on health.  Health is actually a poor example, but on truly current spending which has no future benefit, because there is a longer term benefit in the case of health.<\/p> <p>  One of the things that is important is that the money needs to be taken out of the economy.  This is money where basically a big chunk of it is coming from multinational companies in profits on worldwide or European trading activity.  It is not being generated within Ireland in the way that the revenue of a pub might be.  This is money coming into the economy.  Essentially, with this very large amount of money coming in, if you spend it, that will contribute essentially to overheating the economy further.  If you bring more money in, prices will go up and housing will become more expensive.  It is quite important not to spend it.  It is important to invest it, probably outside the economy.  That is a way of keeping the economy on a balanced path.  This is the experience of Norway, which has a similar but much bigger issue with the oil revenue.  In the early 1990s what they did is they spent the oil money as it came in and their economy had a huge boom and then a big collapse at the point where the money came down.  It is at that point that they decided to set up a sovereign wealth fund, which invests the money.  One rule of that investment fund is that it must not invest any money in Norway.  It is all invested internationally.  If you go to Norway, you still see the impact of the oil money.  It is very expensive to buy anything there.  Some of the oil money is still coming into the economy in a way, but compared with what it would be like had they spent that money even on investment projects that yield a future return, it would have been very much more destabilising to their economy.  While it seems attractive to use these moneys for investment - and definitely using it for investment is better than using it for current spending - it is ultimately a question of trying to keep the economy on a balanced path.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":276,"content":"<p>We are in a bit of a difficulty here because our capital investment has been incredibly low historically.

Most European countries are possibly at around 3% or 4%, so this is a very high level of investment.  As the Deputy rightly points out, the real constraint is not actually finding the money to finance it, it is the capacity of the economy and the construction sector to absorb this without running up costs.  We wrote a paper about this a year ago but, unfortunately, the people who wrote it are not with me today and my memory is a little bit sketchy.  Thousands of extra workers will be needed to meet the Government's target in the housing sector alone.  We are in a period of very low unemployment, and there are not a massive number of people around, either with the right skills or even just around, who could contribute to that.  The real constraint on all of this is the capacity at which we can build houses and insulate houses, which is very important for climate change, and at which we can build other forms of infrastructure.

At this time of year, officially it would look as though the health spending was on budget, but we would discover at the end of the year that there was a big hole in it.  In the years before the pandemic, that was running at about &euro;500 million or &euro;600 million a year of overruns.  That hole was essentially being filled by corporation tax, which was a very unhealthy dynamic during that period.  Many things have changed since.  The pandemic makes is hard to know what the underlying situation is now.  It remains an area of concern, however.  It is a big area of spending where we know there are naturally big pressures.

The report on wages raises a question on the approach of using tax measures as opposed to other measures.  There is also the need for an increase in the minimum wage to living wage levels because of inflation.  This has been highlighted by Social Justice Ireland and others.  The IFAC report highlighted that incomes in the top five sectors have been increasing while we have had static incomes in lower sectors.  The report states there has been a long-standing divergence between the higher paid sectors and other sectors in terms of the hourly wage.  By contrast, hourly wages in the lowest-paid sectors have barely increased in cash terms.  In real terms this is a decline when we have inflation, including inflation in basic costs such as the cost of food.<\/p> <p>  Will the witnesses comment on the need for fiscal measures that do not just address the cost of living in a general sense but are very much targeted to addressing lower incomes?  A few years ago, there was an International Monetary Fund, IMF, report that was compiled over 30 years across a number of economies.  It highlighted that when the incomes of the bottom 10% increase, it has a positive impact on the economy whereas increases in the incomes of the top 10% do not have the same effect in the economy and can have a negative effect.  I say this in the context mentioned by Mr. Barnes, namely, that while Covid had a negative impact on many, there are some whose wealth increased.  A report by Oxfam states that the wealth of just nine billionaires in Ireland increased by &euro;16 billion during the Covid period.  In this context, the concern is that tax measures, even if they are about shifting the index point, would benefit those in the higher bracket but we are still not having a conversation about a potential third tier of higher tax or measures to address the widening of the wealth gap and the income gap.<\/p> <p>  I have questions on two of the three medium-term challenges identified.  I might follow up on them later.  There is another shorter-term issue I want to highlight.  We know the fiscal rules have been suspended at EU level.  One of the reasons this is important is because it allows for front-loading, not only for day-to-day spending but also for investment.  Mr. Barnes mentioned that investment needs to be treated differently.  With regard to front-loading, what is long-term investment with potential long-term rental returns, I am concerned that a narrow approach to annual spending ends up costing us.  With the very rigid application of the fiscal rules in the decade since 2008 the EU and individual states lost a lot of time and opportunities to invest in public services and public service infrastructure.  Now we see gaps in public services, and these have been highlighted.  We have also lost time for the transition needed for climate change.<\/p> <p>  A specific area where fiscal reticence on spending may be driving inflation is housing.  We know the fiscal rules were cited, and continue to be cited even though they no longer apply at EU level, as a reason Ireland has adopted a leasing approach rather than a direct build and purchase approach for social housing.  The guarantee of leases with a profit margin, which are subsidised by State for investment funds, has incentivised investment funds to compete in the purchase of housing.  This has also had an inflationary impact on the cost of housing more generally.  This is an example of how not having public spending and creating a reliance on a market structure has driven up the cost of housing.  Will Mr. Barnes comment on these points?  I will then ask questions on the medium-term challenges he identified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#J00600","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  There is a theme that will run through my answers to these questions.  IFAC's concern is with the overall balance of the public finances and their sustainability and how much money the Government is putting into the economy compared to how much it takes out.  It is about making sure it is not destabilising to the economy and that we are not contributing to economic booms or busts.<\/p> <p>  On the Senator's first point, Mr. Timoney is the author of a paper that is extremely important in the context of understanding the Irish economy.  We have really had a trend divergence between higher income earners, in particular these are people working in certain sectors such as technology and pharmaceuticals, and others.  Many high-paid jobs are being created in these sectors.  The people who have these jobs have seen very big wage increases.  Other people in other sectors have not seen very much.  Although these trends are probably especially strong in Ireland, partly because the economy is growing quite fast, we see them in many other economies also.  The returns for a digital worker having certain digital skills and certain high skills have increased over time while the returns for other jobs that require lower skills or lower levels of education have fallen behind or stagnated.  It is very important to think about these trends.  This could also be added to the medium-term challenges.  The council does not take a view on what the right response is.<\/p><p>That is a matter for politicians and the Government.<\/p><p> This raises an important question, namely, if this is what society is like, what does that mean for the Government in the future?  We have already seen that thanks to Ireland's progressive tax system, this dynamic means that more income is going into the higher tax brackets.  It is too early to be very confident about it, but it looks like this is leading to a permanent shift in the economy towards paying more tax as a share of national income because more people are now earning at higher rates.  That money is available for other things, including for redistribution to other people in the economy.  Again, we are not saying that is what should happen.  However, it is illustrative of some of the big questions that need to be considered.<\/p><p> That leads to the question of investment.  There was a period following the crisis where public investment in Ireland was too low.  That was a concern raised by the council at the time.  Usually, we would not go so far as to comment on particular items, but we became worried that the level of public investment was so low that public capital stock was getting to a level that would be problematic for growth.  We raised those concerns at the time.  In many countries, there is a strong incentive for short-termist politicians to cut investment because the cost of that does not becomes immediately apparent and current spending can be kept at the same level, rather than making the choices they should be making which may be more difficult in terms of cutting or pulling back on other areas of spending or raising taxes.<\/p><p> As it happens, in Ireland's public investment has, fortunately, more than recovered.  We are at the highest share of national income we have ever seen on a sustained basis.  It is very high by international standards.  That is being done in the context not of massive public borrowing, leaving the pandemic aside, but because of the way policy has been run in the past couple of years.  That is quite a significant achievement.  As we discussed earlier, the real constraint on public investment now is the capacity of the economy to deliver on public investment and avoid inflation in those sectors and more generally.<\/p><p> The question of treatment in the fiscal rules is a different question.  In terms of the situation Ireland is in, we are managing to combine a very high level of public investment with sustainable management of the public finances and economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":300,"content":"<p>Housing is an example of public investment, but it is routed through a short-term mechanism in terms of leasing.

For example, increased social housing on a not-for-profit basis might have a deflationary effect.<\/p> <p>  I wanted to pick up on two of the three medium-term challenges Mr. Barnes identified.  He mentioned the pensions commission report.  There is a real problem with it in that it explicitly excluded one of the largest forms of expenditure on pensions in the State from its discussions.  In terms of fiscal planning for pensions and treating that within a closed loop of PRSI when we have another strand of public expenditure, namely, tax relief on private pensions, that does not seem to have been taken on board and properly considered.  A few years ago, we spent &euro;2.7 billion on private pension tax relief.  Research has shown that the money is largely going to those persons in the higher and ever-growing income strata that were mentioned.  Surely fiscal prudence would involve examining the tax expenditure on pensions, as well as PRSI, when we configure how we plan prudently for a pension for everybody in the State.<\/p> <p>  Carbon targets have been factored in in terms of expenditure.  It is a question we as a committee raised with the EU Commissioner for Budget and Administration.  Sustainability was mentioned.  Fiscal sustainability needs to be understood within the sustainable development goals and the wider frame of sustainability.  We are working within very set planetary thresholds.  Our fiscal and financial policies are, to a degree negotiable, but they are sitting inside a non-negotiable planetary boundary in terms of the available emissions space and our carbon budgets.  I ask Mr. Barnes to comment not just on the idea of expenditure on climate and environment policies but also on the proofing of our fiscal policies to ensure that they are sitting within a very rigid carbon budget.  I am aware that this is a discussion at EU and global level, as well as in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I ask him to comment on housing, in particular the fiscal prudence of targeted measures towards lower incomes.  The IMF has said targeted measures towards those on lower income tend to stay within the economy and have a less inflationary effect, in that such money tends to go on basic expendables.  In terms of preventative spending, the health impacts, for example, of cost of living issues at a lower income level can be very negative, such as people going hungry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#K00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":301,"content":"<p>There are a lot of questions there.

There are some areas where we would be more concerned that we are missing bigger effects, in particular on the climate side but also in terms of Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p> <p>  The work of the pensions commission was important.  Taken at face value, the commission's proposals would essentially address most, if not all, of the future rise in pension costs.  Those costs are going to be very big because people are living longer.<\/p><p>There will also be a 50% increase in the number of people reaching retirement age.  There are huge pressures there, and it is important that an adequate response is made to that.  Already, the tax measures that were included are quite substantial.  They may be the price that people are willing to pay to maintain the pension system as it stands.  However, it warrants careful consideration and a proper debate based on the choices available.  The easiest thing is to do nothing.  The longer we wait, however, the more expensive it will be to fix.<\/p><p> Specifically on tax relief, that was not included in our own modelling either.  It is a good point, and something we plan to revisit in the second wave of that modelling.  The amount of tax relief will vary over time as the demographics of the population change.  Pensioners are not taxed in the same way as people of working age, so there is also an effect to be built in there too.  We did not look at the public sector pensions particularly well either because of a lack of information.  There is work that can be done to improve the model.  I think we will do that when we next revisit the modelling.<\/p><p> On sustainability, the Senator is correct that these things must be seen in a wider context, including climate.  There is the cost of trying to avoid climate change and reduce emissions as well as mitigating its impact, especially in the Irish case, with protection against flooding and insurance risks from extreme weather.  There are many things there, and that is one reason the Government needs to have a full assessment of the economic and budgetary impact of these things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I am glad that Mr. Barnes has indicated an intention to use it in IFAC's modelling.

Take the budget that is being proposed now.  It will be a very sizable budget by any standard.  The key issue is what it will deliver for various people.  I am looking at the tax package.  Mr. Barnes's opening statement contained a very carefully-worded paragraph about the tax package and how inflation effectively draws more income into higher tax bands.  We have seen a fiscal drag with the tax bands for many years.  You would have to have an enormous increase in the standard rate of tax threshold to bring it up to the average earnings.  In September, there is likely to be just over &euro;1 billion in a tax package on offer.  The Government has said that it will widen the tax bands.  If it does so by about &euro;1,500, an average worker will get about &euro;5.60 more per week.  My question is about the macroeconomic impact of that but also the distributional impact.  What is IFAC's view of the effectiveness of spending money on putting &euro;5 in a lot of people's pockets compared with an alternative source of spending?  What would be the macroeconomic impact?  Has IFAC done an analysis of that?

This very much depends on exactly what happens to wages, but in economic terms it keeps the tax system as it was before in real terms.  There is no real economic or distributional impact; it is keeping the system as it currently is.  If you did not make that adjustment more taxes would be going up and more income would be dragged into those higher categories.  In recently years we have seen partial indexation.  That means there has been some offset for that but not completely.  One of the reasons why income tax has grown quite strongly is that there is more income being drawn into those upper categories.  From an economic perspective, this is essentially neutral.  You can take a view as to whether you think it should be neutral or not but those sorts of changes would broadly be neutral in the real amount of tax people are paying as a share of their incomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":308,"content":"<p>What about the distributional impact and the economic effectiveness of spending money in that manner by giving a small amount to a lot of people rather than putting it to an alternative use?

That would generate additional resources that could be used for something else, such as for childcare or to compensate people for the higher cost of living.  That is a political choice.  Those are two different ways that it could be organised.  As we noted earlier, one of the concerns with the Government's spending rule is that it does not allow for an offset on the tax side.  With the European spending rule, there is a certain amount that you can spend but you can increase that amount by having an offsetting tax increase, a revenue increase.  The spending rules that the Government has specified do not allow that to happen.

Regarding net investment levels, however, I was struck by the research IFAC carried out some years ago highlighting the significant catch-up and the high depreciation in this regard.

The national development plan runs out in ten years, but at the end of those ten years, as the Senator said, investment will still be high.  We will still have these rates of 6% of national income, which is high by historical standards.  What we do not have a sense of is what will happen after that.  It might be natural that investment would fall a little after that period, but it will not fall back to the low levels we had at some points in the past.<\/p> <p>  One of the reasons investment will not fall to such a low level is because we will need to keep investing to maintain what we have built in the past ten years.  We will have a bigger capital stock.  In order to maintain that, we will have to invest more money.  This is exactly the kind of factor that medium-term budgetary plans need to build in.  This is a less pressing issue now because we are ramping up the capital stock heavily.  The new investment is big relative to the depreciation of existing investment.  This future context is a real thing.  A common problem in the public finances of many countries is that people like to build new things, but it is less exciting to tell people that existing capital infrastructure will be repaired.  This means we end up with capital stock that gets depreciated and, essentially, gets lost.

We are still discussing how we are going to achieve these changes.  We have seen emissions increasing all the time, particularly since the recovery.  We see them going up again now.  There must be agreement on what the plan is.  There must also be some costings of the different options.  As I said, there will be some direct impacts.  If we all move to using electric cars, for example, then we will lose revenues from motor fuel duties.  Those duties represent a substantial part of the public finances.  We will then either have to find something else to replace them or we will have to make some other adjustment.<\/p> <p>  As I said, regarding the investment aspect, we think the national development plan has allocated significant amounts of money to the transition we will need.  The situation in other areas is much less clear.  One of the big questions everywhere is how we can bring about the changes we want to achieve.  In a purely economic sense, we could regulate people, tell them they cannot make a certain emission anymore and that they must do this.  The reality of the situation, however, is that we will probably have to offer some incentives to get people to change their behaviours or to provide some compensation to those who suffer as a result of these changes.  It will be difficult to work out what these amounts will be.  The point is that we do not know what they will be, but they could be significant.<\/p> <p>  Electric cars continue to be expensive.  Many countries have incentive schemes to subsidise people to move to electric cars or to subsidise the infrastructure to support such a change in other ways.  All those endeavours involve a cost.  If, therefore, we are going to rely on such policies, we need to figure out how much we think the Government will need to pay to get people to change their behaviour in that way.  We can think of sectors that will have adverse impacts from this transition and it may well be that the Government will choose to compensate people, provide them with incentives or to help them with the transition.

There is a similar organisation for climate there, and they work closely together.  They have done good analysis of this but, ultimately - this is a warning of a very different sort - they had a number of court rulings regarding the fact that they were not meeting their emissions goals but also regarding air pollution.  The Dutch authorities have had to take drastic action in terms of taking measures that are very costly but were needed to meet these short-term objectives.  That is partly a lesson that we need to plan and start taking action quickly because if we do not, we may have to make much more violent changes.

It is also because the Government borrowed quite a bit during the pandemic when it looked like it would have to borrow more for Covid supports.  In the end, that money was not used, so the Government is sitting on unusually high cash reserves.  Taken together, it is a high level of debt by historical standards.  It is high compared with several other small euro area countries.  There are several factors.  It is a concern.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of factors that are quite favourable to Ireland's position.  One is that the NTMA does a very good job, which is very helpful in terms of the financing position.  As Mr. Carroll mentioned, the maturity on debt is quite high, so we do not have to repay too much each year and it will be a long time until we have to replace the whole debt stock.  Even if interest rates went up, we would only be paying on any new borrowing we have, and we do not need to take out much new borrowing.  The budget is in reasonably good shape, at least in headline terms.  There is also the fact that the economy is likely to grow much faster than the rate of interest.  That naturally tends to bring the debt ratio down.  If we had not had the cost-of-living crisis and all these distortions, the debt ratio would have been on a fairly good downward path, which is consistent with the fact that the economy is growing fast, we are benefiting from the corporation tax boom and unemployment is low.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of favourable factors but there are also risks.  Of course, the higher the level of debt, the more one is exposed to those risks.  One risk we discussed is higher interest rates.  As we stated, that could take time to feed  through but would ultimately add pressure.  As all present are aware, there is not a huge amount of space for extra spending, even beyond the cost-of-living measures and the immediate crisis.  The other big risk is a shortfall in growth.  If something were to happen to the Irish economy, such as the multinationals all going somewhere else or that kind of thing, that could make our debt position look a lot worse.  The big risk is probably on the growth side.  The other risk relates to the public finances.<\/p><p>The plan to have a 5% spending rule is a good one.  It would keep debt on a good trajectory.  If the Government of the day were to deviate from that on a persistent basis, if these pension, health, climate pressures and other things were to lead the Government to run a very different fiscal policy from the one it plans, those things are a risk to the public finances when there are high levels of debt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#N01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":342,"content":"<p>Is what we are doing this year really an option?

That is why we think it was reasonable to deviate somewhat, temporarily, as the Government has set out in the summer economic statement.  It is important that it is a temporary deviation.

The other question is what is sustainable.  If there were a shock, if interest rates were to go up, if growth were to fall, what starting debt ratio would avoid us getting into a position where debt is spiralling out of control and where we have to make a big fiscal adjustment?  The higher debt is, the higher that risk.  We have done some quite sophisticated modelling that draws on the work of the former IMF chief economist, Olivier Blanchard.

We cannot just have more spending and less tax all of the time.  We need to make sure the two things are in balance.  It is the combination of climate change and pensions, which are happening at the same time.  People often focus on one or the other, but they are actually going to be hitting people at the same time.  Those in charge of the public finances and households are going to have to deal with the impact of climate change.  People may have to insulate their homes.  They may lose their jobs.  They may have to do things differently.  At the same time, we are going to have to meet these pension costs that are going to increase considerably.  That is one of the reasons we are concerned about the lack of implementation around the pensions commission report, particularly in the context of signals in respect of not raising the retirement age.  Already, the package proposed by the pensions commission involves quite a substantial increase in taxation.  That may be occurring at a time when other increases in taxes may be needed because of climate change, for example.

As members are no doubt acutely aware, the delivery of eye care services in Ireland has been challenging for many years and now stands as the longest waiting list in the country with nearly 45,000 patients awaiting on outpatient appointments.  Within the NERIECS network, there are in excess of 18,000 patients awaiting their first outpatient appointments, with 6,000 of these on the Mater waiting list and a further 6,000 to 10,000 on community waiting lists.  The demographic demand for eye care is set to increase exponentially in the coming years, with an estimated doubling of the number of patients requiring eye care in the next 30 years.  This situation has been further compounded following the global pandemic, with a latent demand for services now starting to manifest in the six-month to 12-month category of waiting lists.<\/p> <p>  Of concern to the ophthalmology clinical community is the growing support for patients to access care for routine cataract care outside our jurisdiction, such as in North Ireland, while other ophthalmic patients wait an unacceptable length of time, outside of clinically acceptable intervals, and are being harmed with resultant irreversible sight loss for conditions such as glaucoma and age related macular degeneration.  The vision for better eye care in Ireland has been clearly articulated in the primary care eye services review and the HSE national model of eye care.<\/p> <p>  Sl&aacute;intecare advocates for the development of a more integrated health service, centred on a comprehensive community-based care model and provides the framework within which our health services will develop over the coming decade.  While these documents outline the what, they do not support the how and the when of this initiative.  This has been the work that the NERIECS team has been road mapping, making sense of and implementing for the past 12 months.  We have extensively collaborated with all stakeholders to understand how to fully integrate and deliver eye care locally, to quality standards with optimal outcomes for patients.  We have also worked to understand how current hospital-centric services need to be redesigned and integrated with community and primary care, how to support this with information and data, and how current funding models and mechanisms need to change.<\/p> <p>  The current service provision model is unsustainable and will require transformational change to deliver the required paradigm shift in care delivery models.  To achieve this ambition, which incremental change will not deliver, we accept that we must transform our eye care delivery across the region.  We are committed that the pace and scale of this transformation must deliver sustainable change.  The north-east region comprises north Dublin, Meath, Louth, Cavan, Monaghan, Westmeath and Longford, with a combined estimated population of 1.2 million to care for.  Demographic modelling shows a significant projected increase in the population of those over 65 years of age in this area.  Eye care is delivered by six healthcare organisations in the region, namely: Ireland East Hospital Group via the Mater; RCSI Hospitals Group, Children's Health Ireland at Temple Street; CHO 1; CHO 8; and CHO 9.  These are six distinct legal entities delivering care that is anchored in the Mater and at Temple Street from where the clinical governance is provided.  These areas are soon to be restructured into regional health authorities and we await that with interest.<\/p> <p>  The challenge was how best we delivered care for all patients in this region to reduce and eliminate our wait list, which at the beginning of Covid numbered 9,000 for the Mater alone and approximately 15,000 for the entire region.  There were also approximately 2,500 patients on a wait list for cataract surgery at this time.  Through collaboration between CHO 9 and the Mater hospital, a hub and spoke model for service integration was tested and has to date delivered substantive improvements to waiting lists, with a near 85% reduction in the adult long-waits through our Ashgrove House initiative.  My colleague, Dr. Rogers, will talk about the similar reduction in the paediatric amblyopia via the initiative between Temple Street and Grangegorman, which has nearly totally reduced in spite of the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  The model of eye care we are implementing across the NERIECS region holds to a hub-and-spoke concept of three-level integration that is based on: geography; the level of care required, be it primary, secondary or tertiary; and a specific care pathway that patients need focusing first on the largest volume care pathways, such as cataract, glaucoma, paediatric amblyopia and age related macular degeneration.<\/p><p>In the absence of a formal legislative framework, we accepted that governance and co-ordination of six organisations, while maintaining clear clinical and corporate governance in this structure, would be challenging, and it has proved so.  We set out to innovate to solve this problem in the interests of our staff and patients through the adoption of lean principles and a management system for process improvement and implementation of our strategy.  This is novel to the Irish healthcare system.  We are happy to lead from the front to test the reality of delivering system-level specialty integration.<\/p><p> The methodology provides a mechanism to eliminate waste in system and deliver managed, co-ordinated structural change, while keeping what is of value to our patients and staff to the fore.  In June 2021, 12 months ago, the eye care teams in the region enabled and empowered more than 100 staff and our patients to participate in a system-level enterprise value stream analysis, EVSA.  This week-long event empowered staff to clearly understand the current state and reality of eye care delivery in this region and to collectively agree on a vision and roadmap to improve and redesign eye care in the next five years.  It also afforded them a sound methodology to deliver on this.<\/p><p> The gap as to how we would deliver on accountability, clinical governance and ownership for the transformation was proposed through our facilitators in IBM Simpler, Mr. Richard Carr and Mr. Dave Jones-Lofting, through the design concept of a virtual accountable care organisation, VACO.  This structure has been deployed in healthcare in the US since 2014, and more recently in the UK, but this will be the first deployment of this structure in Ireland.  The VACO provides a mechanism to co-ordinate the function of the six healthcare organisations.  It is responsible for devising and deploying the strategy to improve eye care.  The VACO co-ordinating group comprises stakeholders from all the sub-specialties working in eye care in the region such as medics, nurses, optometrists, orthoptists, GPs, finance officers and information technology teams.  There is also broader representation across the six healthcare organisations.<\/p><p> That value stream analysis also looked specifically at the four high-volume care pathways - cataract, glaucoma, paediatric amblyopia and age-related macular generation - to develop best practice pathways, including, specifically, a shift to community-based care, where appropriate, and templates for rationalisation of standardised referral, enhanced triage and more accurate demographic data capture.  Crucially, the VACO also puts targeted design teams in place to support all its activity.  These are our foundations.<\/p><p> All participants in the community integration team, information technology team, training, education research and innovation team and finance team are taking this on as part of other normal roles in the HSE, save for a core team of three; giving extra to this project in which they believe.  These staff and teams are the bedrock of this co-ordinated effort.  We held 11 planning events over the 12-month period since that initial value stream analysis and we have now created the infrastructure and processes where we can deploy integrated care across the region.  We still need to finalise the financial pathways, but discussions have been positive with the chief finance officer of the HSE, and it is interested in this model that we are developing.  The chief finance officer has given us a clear set of rules that need to be respected as we seek to deploy this in providing a roadmap.<\/p><p> Our goal would be a core regional account for funds that can be deployed to the area of need to best serve the patients and improve efficiency based on the principle of our purpose pyramid, which is to reduce the burden of blindness and vision impairment while improving quality of life for those affected.  The IT team is looking specifically at how we introduce an integrated electronic patient record along with harmonised patient administration systems so we can reduce the need for patients to travel between the different sites, with an expert opinion given more efficiently and patients just needing to travel to clinics and-or diagnostic hubs close to their home.  This feeds directly to the principles of Sl&aacute;intecare and will be advanced with regional health authorities' centralised scheduling with a clear clinical governance line.<\/p><p> We have achieved a significant amount through the goodwill and willingness of all those working in eye care across the region in all different disciplines coming together to tackle the problem in eye care delivery.  To date, the transformation has already delivered significant outcomes including a decrease in both adult and paediatric waiting lists across the region; a reduction in surgical waiting lists of 21% for more than 12 months; standardised regional referral for both cataract and glaucoma; right-first-time referral improved from 20% to 95%; improved patient and staff satisfaction with cataract pathway experience; and conversion rate to surgery for patients referred for cataract now at 95% - improved from where it was previously at 75%.<\/p><p> We are patient-focused, and our purpose pyramid sets the reduction of vision impairment and blindness and access to support services as the core driving goal of this group.  The improved access to care, reduction of wait lists and transformation efforts are all to support this goal.  We have identified our funding gap for the next three years and we are confident that, if supported, we have the mechanism, structures and, most importantly, the buy-in of all involved in eye care delivery to eliminate our wait lists in the north east in three years.  This is a bold ambition as we look to reduce the wait list for outpatients from approximately 14,000 currently to zero, and the cataract wait list, which has grown to 3,000, also to zero.  This data is all validated by Mr. Gerry Kelleher and the data team in the HSE.  This is greatly aided by the recent approval of funding for staffing for the new eye cataract theatre at the Mater hospital, which, based on projections, will eliminate its surgical wait list in three years based on current levels.  We should be able to assist with cataract wait lists in other parts of the country from that date.<\/p><p> The issues we still need to tackle are finalising the funding stream and pathway, which is very close, and integrating the information technology systems in order that we can create a web of interconnectivity between the six healthcare organisations.  This will give us visibility on patients&rsquo; records across the system thus reducing their need to travel.  We also feel strongly that the VACO provides a model for eye care delivery in other parts of the country that may not have that co-ordinated effort in place just yet.  The VACO will also provide a model for the improved community care delivery of other medical specialties such as an ear, nose and throat, ENT, dermatology and neurology.<\/p><p> I encourage members to read our submitted slide presentation and look in particular at our strategy deployment tool, the level zero X matrix, which has all our aims and metrics summarised on one page.  Our ask of them today is to support the virtual accountable care organisation as a governance structure to manage care across different organisations in our health service, and support the initial funding gap for staffing, equipment and transformation costs, which will be at &euro;3.9 million for 2023, &euro;3 million for 2024 and &euro;2.72 million for 2025, with just index-linked costs required thereafter.  In return, under the principle of accessibility through innovation, we will provide the delivery of accessible, integrated, equitable and optimal eye care across our entire community while eliminating resource waste within our system.  We commit to return to the committee with all the data it requires in 12 months to demonstrate our progress.  I am happy to take any questions.

After this question, I would like to invite my colleagues who have also prepared a few words to speak.  The VACO was initially proposed through the health insurance networks in the US in approximately 2014 for how they would reduce costs across that, but it provided a framework for an integrated care model.  The King's Fund, which is the health think-tank in the UK, sort of latched on to this as a potential model.  It is looking at this in the same timeline we are to deploy it across the region.  Therefore, we are sort of running at the same timescale with respect to this.  Much like we are seeking to do here, the UK has adapted that original US model to create that integrated care.<\/p> <p>  The model is based on those principles of shift left, collaboration and virtual clinics so that we can access patients' data without repeating tests.  That was really the driving force in the US where patients were being internally referred in the system, tests were being repeated and patients were having multiple visits.  Therefore, that eliminates that piece.  In the UK, which is on the similar Covid-19 restoration and transformation journey we are, as part of our EVSA, we made a really good presentation for Ms Melanie Hingorani, who is the transformation lead in the UK.  It is on the same journey as us.  It is looking at the VACO system already and seeking to deploy it.  As regards results from that the UK, however, its timelines are the same as ours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022071300002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Professor David Keegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":363,"content":"<p>There is no concrete data from the UK yet as such.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022071300002#B00500","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":364,"content":"<p>No, there is no concrete data.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022071300002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Professor David Keegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":365,"content":"<p>Could Professor Keegan talk us through what was involved in building his team?<\/p><p>Professor Keegan seems to have got agreement from a significant number of stakeholders.

The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, had originally worked on surgical waiting lists and then switched its attention to outpatient waiting lists, where we saw our greatest need.  We collaborated with the NTPF and CHO 9 to create a new model clinic for long waiters.  We had just started to deploy that prior to the Covid crisis hitting and the structure was such that we were able to keep it going.  That is how we were able to reduce the number of long waiters by 80% and reduce the total wait list by 3,000 over that period.  That gave us a model to refer to in discussions with our colleagues.  I pay tribute to a number of people in this regard.  I had discussions with my colleague, Ms Ryan, chief of operations at Temple Street hospital, about how we would integrate paediatric care, which is the key need in the CHOs.  I spoke to Mr. Mullaniff of the NCBI about how we integrate the patient organisations, specifically the rehabilitation aspect, which was a gap in previous models.  Professor Patrick Broe, the clinical director of the RCSI Hospitals Group, showed early interest in this.  We also engaged with Mr. Des O'Flynn, who was originally in CHO 9 and then in CHO 8, and Ms Josephine Collins in CHO 1.  We had a model to put in front of them.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to the broader coalition of IT experts and health pricing officers, when one can stand up in a room and offer a purpose pyramid that is patient-focused and patient-centred, it was remarkable, encouraging and enlightening to see how people will move with us and give of their time to these design events.  They want to see this work.  We are looking for support centrally in order to keep the momentum with the team.  It is about personal relationships, conversations and meetings.  The EVSA events are quite energising.  We had the event in Ratoath GAA club last year and everybody enjoyed it and knew we were doing good work.

CHI thanks the committee for inviting us to participate in this discussion on an exciting and innovative new development for healthcare.  Paediatric ophthalmology is a high-volume service in terms of activity with just under 23,000 outpatient and 690 surgical cases undertaken per year across CHI.<\/p> <p>  CHI wholly supports NERIECS and the work of the accountable care organisation.  The principles of integrated care delivery that traverse regions and system-care settings are aligned with Sl&aacute;intecare, the national paediatric model of care and CHI's mission.  The VACO is a means of delivering integrated care between community and acute services as part of Sl&aacute;intecare implementation and addressing the greatest operational challenge, which is timely access to treatment.  Access is a challenge to this paediatric specialty.  There are currently more than 2,000 outpatients and 574 inpatients and day cases on the waiting list for treatment.  Delivering care through a network as close to home as possible is truly child-centred and ensures the most appropriate use of resources at the right level of care within the system.  Progression towards an integrated healthcare system for children and adolescents is a strategic objective for CHI and the development of the VACO is timely in this regard.<\/p> <p>  While the integrated eye care network is commencing in the north-east region, it is envisaged that this network will serve the eye-care needs of all the paediatric population of Dublin.  Future requirements and enablers to support this development are being accounted for in this design phase.  Clinicians have estimated that up to 60% of patients attending acute paediatric eye care services are clinically suited to care at community level.  Clinical governance is paramount to this and the acute setting can support clinical oversight in delivering integrated care.

Typically, what would be the common complications patients on that waiting list have?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022071300002#D01700","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":398,"content":"<p>It depends on what they have been referred with.  One of our concerns is that patients with cataracts, which is the biggest cohort of patients, are needlessly living with vision impairment while waiting for appointments to be assessed and then for procedures that will reverse the problem.  It is a straightforward procedure that is delivered quickly in great units throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  The other area of concern picked up by Dr. Edward Dervan and the team in the glaucoma EVSA is the delayed presentations of glaucoma into our services.  For those who are not aware, glaucoma is a condition that can reduce and diminish sight loss in a silent manner and patients do not present until late in the condition.  It is one of the areas we have identified through NERIECS.  By employing the community teams, empowering the ophthalmologist to do that initial assessment and having a standardised optometric referral form, we will increase the speed at which we see the right patients, at the right time.<\/p> <p>  The other group we are concerned about is those with age-related macular degeneration, AMD.  These patients can suffer irreversible sight loss if they have the wet type of macular degeneration, with 65% having irreversible sight loss within three months of diagnosis.  Rapid access to care is needed.  We will greatly enhance that access through our AMD pathway, but we should have a standardised referral and local diagnostics.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Rogers can talk about the risks in delaying paediatric amblyopia-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022071300002#D01800","nonspeaker":"Professor David Keegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":399,"content":"<p>My time is limited.  I will ask one more question and give the remainder of my time to Professor Keegan to answer it.<\/p><p>It is very important in the context of healthcare reform, Sl&aacute;intecare and the establishment of regional health areas.  We are getting a briefing today from the Department on the establishment of regional health areas.  Professor Keegan's presentation was very interesting and timely.  He said that the Sl&aacute;intecare document clearly sets out what needs to be done but that the how and when are not so clear.  He also spoke about challenges with regard to integrating care from a hospital-centric service and redesigning and integrating good community and primary care, which is what regional health areas are meant to do at a more global level.  Professor Keegan then referred to the difficulty with having six distinct legal entities delivering care and the absence of a legislative framework.  Part of the problem we might have is that these regional health areas will not be underpinned by legislation.  They will not be a legal entity as it will continue to be the HSE board but that is a different debate.  Will Professor Keegan outline the model of integrated care NERIECS has worked on, how it is working and how we can practically achieve the objective of moving from the current hospital-centric service to one that is much better integrated not only on the hospital side but also in community and primary care?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022071300002#D01900","speaker":"1615","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Cullinane.  We can set up the model and the structure.  We have to respect the legal entities.  We have put in place a system of strategic oversight, which is the VACO.  The next step will be to generate service level agreements and memorandums of understanding to create an internal network between the legal entities to operate in that structure.  The initial part is dependent on the goodwill, buy-in and interest of all the stakeholders in the region.  We have set up the VACO.  The next step is to create the legal structure through service level agreements and memorandums of understanding.  There is a service level agreement guidance document that the finance and legal teams will work through to create them.  Data governance must also be considered as must agreements on data sharing and data protection.  These will all be looked at by our specialty teams.<\/p> <p>  We expect and hope that when it moves to the regional health authorities and away from the CHO system, we can blend in this model because we will have demonstrated effectiveness and will be able to show this route to it.  Of course, the danger and risk is that people will stand up and say we cannot do it at this stage.  We have moved slowly by trying to demonstrate some successes, such as those of Dr. Rogers, CHI and Ashgrove House.  We want to integrate properly by doing this.  We are in this incremental phase in the context of delivering true integration.  I hope this answers the question.

They are born with it and they have no idea they have it.  There is a very narrow window in which it can be treated.

The question is how difficult it is at present.  It is fair to start with examples of very good data and IT infrastructure and integration.

A patient with a head injury in Galway can have the images looked at by the team in Beaumont on the same day that injury is sustained.  We have examples of good integration but they are pockmarked and by direction largely.<\/p> <p>  We also noted through this, and the cyberattack highlighted it, that the infrastructure throughout the community health organisations is fragile and needs to be supported.  The infrastructure in the HSE hospitals was exposed through the cyberattack.  This was less so in the voluntary hospitals because they had put extra measures in place.  We have multiple speeds of travel with respect to IT throughout the system.  Our work has highlighted this.  We were not fully aware of all this beforehand.  We had a sense of it.  It has really exposed that the different rates of travel on IT governance and infrastructure are a potential risk to its deployment.<\/p> <p>  The universal health identifier is crucial.  The preference would be for a national decision on an IT platform for all health records.  Then patients would not need to move.

In the interim we will keep working as much as we can.  We have an issue at present in one of our sites.  We have a service level agreement with Ashgrove House.

What we were looking to do was to have a whole-population solution not just based on whether people have medical cards or are insured or not insured, because we realise there is a gap between those patients who do not have a medical card and are not insured and need to be covered by the public health system.

In fairness to the referrers acting on the patients' best interests, they feel they cannot switch that system off until this is fully up and running.<\/p> <p>  We are excited to be getting our new theatres so we can demonstrate that tripling of the capacity for cataract surgeries through the Mater so they will not need to do it.  However, I do need to point out that there is often a misconception that treatment abroad in Belfast involves patients going to an NHS unit to be treated up there, as they are going to a private facility in Belfast.  We actually have the bizarre situation whereby, in another role, I do surgeries in the Mater Private Hospital and I am asked to operate on patients from the NHS service in Belfast who come south to Dublin for their surgeries.<\/p><p>There is an odd situation on the island whereby patients in the Republic are going to Belfast for surgery and patients from Belfast are coming to Dublin for surgery.  Through NERIECS, we are hoping to provide enough capacity through this model to address demand in the region.  The modelling in the slide I showed, carried out by Gerry Kelleher and Alison Dingle, shows that we would hit that point in about three to four years' time.  We would then have extra capacity to deal with the other parts of the country, if they have not addressed it by then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022071300002#F02800","nonspeaker":"Professor David Keegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":440,"content":"<p>Would it be common for people to come from the North to the South?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022071300002#G00200","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I cannot speak for other private hospitals.

What we have heard loud and clear from our work with the cataract team, led by Mr. Tim Fulcher and Dr. Lisa McAnena, is that when they worked with standardised referrals, GPs wanted optometrists front and centre and engaged on this, with support from GP services.  That would ensure more accurate referrals coming so that the referral coming in can be risk stratified.  That is not the full answer.  With that information, we triage urgent patients.  A patient may have comorbidities, diabetes or other issues or may have good vision in one eye.  Some cases should be expedited.  In this day and age, nobody should be waiting five years.

We should be facilitated to look after the patients who are referred to us.  We operate on them in our facilities.  If we cannot do them in our facilities, we do them in an agreement in other facilities and there is a referral back arrangement in place.  It is clear and transparent, and the patients know what they are getting out of it.  However, this<i>ad hoc<\/i>arrangement of referrals with emergencies does not sit well with me and it is not to the principles of the programme we are trying to advance here today.  One of the driving forces at the start of this was that we would deliver care to Irish patients in the Irish jurisdiction and we look after people here.  I also have to respect Deputy Kenny's comment about his patients, and we have to work harder to do that.  I hope today's engagement shows the committee and the broader public that there is a group of people involved in eye care who are absolutely committed to doing that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022071300002#H03100","nonspeaker":"Professor David Keegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":485,"content":"<p>The engagement today has been very useful.

I am sorry to keep going back to it, but I highlight the model being operated in Ashgrove House and Grangegorman.

Let us get the right equipment, the right staff into those units before we go back to those with the big cheque book looking for capital in respect of this.  We are going to try to do this without that, but it may then become apparent that there is a specific unit that needs to come in around this.  We would hope to be part of and run alongside the primary care centres that are planned across the country and that there would be provision for eye rooms in those centres.

The Deputy gave the long answer.  You have to mind your team.  If there is anything that has been very stark, and Ms Ryan, Dr. Rogers and Mr. Mullaniff will speak to this, it is particularly the case in front-facing healthcare.  I am not here as an apologist.  It is just the reality on the ground.  We could do Saturdays, and have done in the past.  I would say every eye unit in the country has had Saturday waiting list initiatives.  There is a lot of excitement and enthusiasm around them because you bring down your waiting lists.  Patients who have been waiting for surgery for ages are happy because they get the surgery done.  It is a very satisfying procedure to do.  I am very lucky that I get to do it.  My colleagues feel the same, but to do that in a sustainable way, you must do it differently.  We have an acute nursing shortage in our hospitals and ophthalmology is not immune to this.  We need to look at it in the context of the cost of living, recruitment, where our hospitals are located and how we make sure the terms and conditions are right for our teams so that they can deliver that care.  It comes back to sustainability.  If we can do that, we have a sustainable model.  I agree with the Deputy.

We all know someone who fits into that category.  Deputy Gino Kenny spoke about one of his constituents.  I remember dealing with a man who was a carer.  He would not have been as old as Johnny in the example given in the slide presentation, who was 77.  The man with whom I dealt was caring for his wife.  He could only see shadows.  He ended up going for an appointment through what, I presume, was the triage system.  This was not in Dr. Rogers' area I might add.  The man was basically asked the question of how he got to the appointment.  He said he got a bus and then had to walk from the bus stop to the clinic.  That seemed to be it.  He was told then to come back in 12 months.  He was devastated after this.  We spoke in terms of the pathways.  He thought this would be a pathway for him to get treatment.  He eventually got it but that period of losing his sight, particularly with the added pressure of being the carer, put huge pressure on that family.

There is no doubt there are people around the country.  It is out of desperation that people travel to the North or wherever else in order to try to get treatment.  As has been said, it is ironic that people are coming in the opposite direction.  Again, we do not hear of the busloads of people travelling.  At least, I have not heard of them doing so.  Hopefully, it did not happen that busloads were coming from the North during Covid-19.  I suppose it is selling hope.  The fact that a person cannot see, or sees shadows, transforms his or her life.

There has been a great deal of focus on the numbers, the contracts and the nuances in the structures in the region and the integration challenges around that.  We need to bring this back to the real and the felt need, and what is happening on the ground.  In the context of what often comes through our door before going through the hospital door, the fact that getting a diagnosis is often seen as success is a little strange.  The reality is that one in three ophthalmology patients is found to be waiting in excess of 18 months at present.  That does not mean they are just waiting 18 months; they can be waiting longer.  I am speaking in general.  That period can be really testing; it can be really tense.  Given that sight is the sense that people fear losing most, it is not okay, from an organisational perspective, to sit here and be okay with that.<\/p> <p>  The NERIECS initiative is already showing early success.  I want to again highlight the integration into the community, where we have embedded the ECLOs in the north east.  Typically, patients have been obliged to wait three and a half years before they come through the door of the national sight loss agency.  In some instances, that is now down to three and a half weeks.  As Dr. Rogers indicated, what we tend to see most is macular degeneration.  This condition is age-related.  We have an ageing population.  There is a boom expected.  It is life-changing.  Whether you are a parent of a new baby, whether you are a small child or whether you are an adult who has acquired sight loss in the course of your working life, sight loss impacts on all aspects of your life and all aspects of your family.  From the NCBI perspective, we are here to galvanise people when it comes to the NERIECS initiative.  We want to transform the way in which we deliver medical eye care across the acute and community settings.  We are fully behind the VACO.  In the context of the structures and governance that have been put forward -  on which this team has worked so hard - we really are encouraging the State and, in particular, the committee to consider providing the necessary funding required to drive the implementation of the NERIECS model.  It is the first model we have seen in a long time that we have been part of.  It is showing early results.  In the interests of our patients, we all need to do more collectively.  There is a certain amount of responsibility, not just on this team but also on the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022071300002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aaron Mullaniff"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":556,"content":"<p>This question is probably bizarre.

Over the past few decades, this methodology has been applied successfully in healthcare settings.  For example, Michael Dowling, a Limerick man who runs the largest hospital group in the US - it is based in New York state and Long Island - adopted lean principles about ten or 12 years ago and reduced waste significantly and improved throughput and patient care.  The hospitals in that group are down to a ten-minute wait for patients when they are in the actual setting and an on-demand service.  You cannot directly compare with the US because it is a different healthcare system.  I am just talking about adoptees of this.  A colleague of mine in Milwaukee invited me to visit his laboratory.  He is an adaptive optics expert.  He knew I was interested in lean principles and introduced me to the head of the service there, who is a sceptic.  They had been adopting this across a few units in the US and he reluctantly came to the party to institute lean management.  He was totally converted and wrote a book.  We have given that book, <i>Synchronicity<\/i>, out to the team.  It is about eliminating waste.  It improves the patients' outcome, they get in to see you quicker, they are not waiting there as long, they get out on time, the doctors and the staff get out on time, and that is something we are looking at doing.<br\/><br\/>There is a great deal of science and methodology behind this.  That is what we are being coached on.  We bring everybody with us.  It is a collaborative effort.  The nurses, doctors, administrators, porters, staff nurses and ward attendants come into a room and we go through our current state asking &quot;How are we doing things&quot; and we all agree we are here today because we are not doing things well or well enough.  Then with some free thinking and some tools we identify what the ideal would be and ask ourselves what would be the best way to run our service in an ideal world.  We have integrated healthcare, on-demand care and people waiting two weeks for cataract operations.  That is the ideal state.  In between, there is a future state that is attainable.  We write up these what are called ideal principles.<br\/><br\/>I do not wish to sound too evangelical about it, but we write all these down.  In that process, the team asks &quot;What are we in control of?&quot;  We say there are 26 things that would be our route to an ideal state.  Then we grab control of it because they say &quot;What can we do now as a group?&quot;  When it comes to patients having a nicer experience when they come it, we state that we can do that now and that it is up to ourselves.  So we tick that box.  When it comes to integrated IT system that runs throughout the country, we will say that we cannot do anything about that because it is in the hands of others and that we have to lobby in respect of it.  The box in that regard will remain empty.  We go through everything in that way.  It is remarkable how much of it is actually in our own hands.  It is empowering for the teams, and they get on and start doing it.  We have been through 11 of those events.  People give up their time, rearrange their lives and come in to participate in them.<br\/><br\/>I came into this at a very basic level, having just read a book on lean principles.  With the guidance we get from the experts or the transformation office in NERIECS, and with external facilitation, we are now at a wholly different level in our thinking.  It is about empowering people.  We talk as a group about our thinking and we bring that into other aspects of what we do.  The core principle is to eliminate waste, go again, eliminate more waste and go again. That is patient-focused, and it never stops.  That is the goal.<br\/><br\/>There have been a few breakthroughs.  I refer to the purpose pyramid developed by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, RNLI.  In very simple terms, the purpose of the RNLI is to save lives at sea.  It does so by having highly-trained staff available at short notice.  Underpinning that is the funding and training to support it.  In our case, the purpose is to reduce the burden of vision impairment and blindness and improve measures to supportive measures.  It is supported.  Our goal is not to reduce waiting lists.  I will be absolutely honest.  Our goal is not to have the right patient in the right place first time.  That is not our primary goal; it is our secondary goal, because doing that helps us helps us to attain our primary goal of the reduction of avoidable preventable blindness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022071300002#N00600","nonspeaker":"Professor David Keegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":558,"content":"<p>Will Professor Keegan expand on the virtual diagnostics?

First, there is the information that needs to be reviewed.  For most patients, that is a measurement of their current vision and some sort of imaging at the back of the eye.  The nice thing about that is you can have sites set up to do that throughout the region - for example, Cavan, Navan, Drogheda - where it is local to the patient.  Then in the Mater you have a room which has a computer set up, a webcam, a telephone or whatever communication method you wish to use.  We will communicate by whatever means the patient chooses.  This is because some elderly patients do not want to have Zoom calls.  They would like a nice phone call with their provider.  That is enabled with sufficient Internet bandwidth in order that you can access all the imaging easily.  The consultant will come in to a 15-patient clinic to review all of their virtual images and then contact the patient via phone or if it is their preference they just get a letter in the post.  It is very much driven by what the patient wants.  It means that those 15 patients will have not come from Drogheda, Cavan or Navan to us.  They will not have o get themselves there.  They will not be sitting in the outpatient clinic of a tertiary centre waiting to see a consultant when they do not need to be.<\/p><p> Within that virtual setting, one can start to build layers in and train up the optometrist to the top of their licence in order that they can look at the stable cohort, but still with governance from a consultant.  One can be a force multiplier of consultants.  Very often, consultants are expensive people to have in a healthcare system.  It is about using the allied healthcare professionals to the highest level.  The virtual clinic really does that.  In the Mater hospital, we have a designated space, we have the IT capability ready, we have the links ready to go and the shared spaces for imaging.  We are just about to tip into it.  We also have consultant colleagues who have committed to providing their time to these virtual clinics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022071300002#N00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Duncan Rogers","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":562,"content":"<p>Very impressive.

Yes it is common.  On the co-ordinated effort, it is part of lean and what we call the \"just do its\", when one gets a group of people together the stuff is so obvious we wonder why we did not do it.  Deputy Shortall alluded to this earlier when we spoke about integrated care.  One of the early things we did was a gap analysis.  We considered our four key bits of equipment: a colour camera; an optical coherence tomography, OCT machine; a biometry machine; and an visual fields machine.  These are the four core bits of kit.  We then considered the staff to run it.  This is in the primary eye care review under the heading of staff and includes a consultant ophthalmologists, orthoptists, optometrists and nurses.  Then, when we looked around the region, some were very well staffed but had no equipment.  They were in a very basic room with only so much they could do.  Then the patient was sent on somewhere else in the system for that.  Likewise, other areas had the bells and whistles equipment but only had a consultant in two days a week.  The equipment was sitting fallow for the rest of the time.  Mark Jeffrey and the office have done that gap analysis.  The equipment ask in our budget submission is very targeted.  For example, we need a particular piece of equipment in Beaumont Hospital.  We do the cataract surgeries based out of Beaumont Hospital.  We see some 300 patients per year who have to come to the Mater Hospital be seen in the clinic there, have tests done in the Mater and the surgery done in the Mater but then must go back to Beaumont Hospital for their follow-up.  With the purchase of a machine the costs &euro;70,000 those patients could get their tests in Beaumont Hospital and they would not have to come to the Mater hospital for anything other than their surgery and then go back.  We are looking to recreate that across the hospitals in Beaumont, Blanchardstown, Cavan and hopefully Navan.  We only need to lift up 7% to 10% in all of these areas.  It is a cumulative effect.  There is a gap.  We have identified the gap.  The request in our budget submission is that the gap be closed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022071300002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Professor David Keegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":564,"content":"<p>Does Professor Keegan see that as one of the advantages or potential advantages of the RHAs?

The data is updated on an ongoing basis with a rolling update running throughout the calendar year from January to December.  On average, we make about 500,000 changes to the data annually.  We supply our main data product to the market four times a year, in January, April, July and October.<\/p><p> There are two address databases within GeoDirectory, namely a geographic address database and an official postal address database.  Both of these address databases are in English and, where available, Irish.  It is important to note that the GeoDirectory data is only ever a picture in time and historic in nature.  We are always trying to keep up with new developments and address changes.  While we endeavour to capture as many addresses as possible in Irish, this is not always possible.  For example, when we visit a new housing development, addresses may not be fully assigned.<\/p><p> In GeoDirectory, we rely on the teams in An Post and OSI to capture, confirm and update the address information for both the Irish and English versions of address.  An Post supplies address information and OSI provides boundary and official townland names.  Our relationship with both of these bodies is critical to our success, and I acknowledge the very positive relationship we have with them.<\/p><p> Regarding the Irish-language version of an address, we use the Irish version as provided by Logainm.ie wherever possible.  Logainm.ie is the expert in this field and has the understanding, skills, and experience to provide the best Irish translation.  Our most recent update of Irish-language translated addresses was received from Logainm.ie in February 2022 and covers the 2020-21 period.  This recent data will be included in the records throughout 2022.  We anticipate that further updates will be received from Logainm.ie on an ongoing basis and these will be updated to the relevant address databases at the earliest possible time.<\/p><p> In parallel to the data supplied by Logainm.ie, our database is also continuously updated through information collected on an ongoing basis by An Post.  This on-the-ground information is acquired through local knowledge, local road and area signage, contact with local authorities where required, and the reviewing of OSI townland names.<\/p><p> Looking specifically at Gaeltacht areas and using the Gaeltacht boundary set made available by OSI, GeoDirectory has 60,790 addresses in Gaeltacht areas.  We have entries in our Irish table for all of those addresses.  However, if any part of an address is not translated, it is provided in English, for example, when a business or house name is in English.  We continue to work with all parties to increase and improve the quantity and quality of addresses as Gaeilge.<\/p><p> GeoDirectory provides these addresses to all our customers, including Eircode, and they decide which format and language is used to deliver their services.  I must emphasise that the role of GeoDirectory is to provide as comprehensive as possible a database of all available address formats.  Our company cannot and does not seek to influence the versions or features of address records that are used by the various service providers.<\/p><p> In summary, GeoDirectory has ongoing and robust data collection processes that include both Irish and English versions of addresses.  Where possible, we use the official Irish names received from Logainm.ie and will continue to work with our partners to ensure we have the most up-to-date and comprehensive database of Irish addresses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022071300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Irwin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":578,"content":"<p>I too will read my statement in English if the Chairman will permit it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022071300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Dignam"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":579,"content":"<p>Ceart go leor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022071300002#B00300","speaker":"1485"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":580,"content":"<p>Chairman and members, I am pleased to appear before the committee to answer any questions you may have concerning the operation of Eircode.  I understand the committee wishes to consider matters raised in the reports of an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga concerning Gaeltacht placenames that continue to be available in English alongside their Irish versions in Eircode.  We are aware of the issues raised by the commissioner and hope to help the committee with its inquiries today.<\/p> <p>  Capita Business Support Services Ireland was appointed by the then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in 2013 to develop and manage the postcode system for Ireland as the postcode management licenceholder.  The system was branded as \"Eircode\" and Capita Business Support Services Ireland operates Eircode, including the Eircode finder online application.<\/p> <p>  The Eircode database is constructed using data provided by An Post GeoDirectory, which Capita has licensed.  This is the sole address database that populates the Eircode system.  It is stipulated by the terms of Capita Business Support Services Ireland's agreement to operate the Eircode system.  Eircode has no authority or remit to alter these addresses.  Eircode is authorised to assign alphanumerical codes known as Eircodes to postal addresses within the State from this database and to maintain and update the Eircode database, which is available to license and provides the functionality behind the Eircode finder web application.<\/p> <p>  Concerning addresses in the Gaeltacht areas, Eircode uses the postal addresses as indicated in the An Post GeoDirectory database.  When searching for Eircodes or addresses in Gaeltacht areas using the finder application, the addresses default to the Irish-language versions.  To view the English-language versions of such addresses, users must click on a separate tab marked \"English\".<\/p> <p>  Each quarter, we receive a list of new or updated addresses from An Post GeoDirectory which are then integrated into the Eircode system.  In operating Eircode, we take considerable care to ensure we correctly identify the addresses that are situated in Gaeltacht areas and to specify that they default to the Irish-language version when searched for in the Eircode finder.  Additionally, all Eircode web pages are available in Irish, and Irish-language customer service options are available to allow people to have their queries answered via email, post or phone in Irish.<\/p> <p>  While addresses in Gaeltacht areas default to Irish-language versions, Capita Business Support Services Ireland is not entitled to unilaterally remove English-language versions of these addresses from the Eircode system or otherwise alter the An Post GeoDirectory addresses on which Eircode relies.  We hold a contract to operate Eircode as a public service provider and perform the contract according to its terms.  As the committee will be aware, an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga's monitoring report, which was published in July last year, outlines that any statutory language obligations relating to the use of Gaeltacht placenames fall under the remit of the Department on the Environment, Climate and Communications, and not that of Eircode or An Post.<\/p><p>I am nevertheless conscious of the importance of the committee's work in ensuring adherence to the statutory language obligations.  Therefore, I welcome the opportunity to provide responses to any inquiries members of the committee may have or to offer any necessary clarifications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022071300002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Dignam","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":582,"content":"<p>N&iacute;l a l&aacute;n Gaeilge agam, therefore, I also wish to give my response in English.  I am the director of international trade for An Post&rsquo;s mails and parcels business, as well as a member of the board of GeoDirectory.  I am glad to be here to discuss the issues at hand.  I offer our apologies for the delay in appearing before the committee, which was largely around the practicalities of the various notice parties being available here.  Certainly, no disrespect to the committee was intended.<br\/><br\/>GeoDirectory is jointly owned by An Post and Ordnance Survey Ireland, OSI, and its primary role is to supply a geocoded buildings database to the market.  As has been said, An Post&rsquo;s official postal address database is one of the data sources used by GeoDirectory.  Much of the relevant points for discussion have already been covered by Mr. Irwin, but I want to make a few points about An Post.  Each year, my colleagues deliver 405 million mail items to 2.35 million address points throughout the country.  That amounts to more than 2 million items per day.  No other postal service in Europe kept as high a percentage of delivery routes open, delivering every route, every working day, and keeping almost every post office open during the pandemic in the interests of social inclusion and supporting communities around Ireland.  We deliver mail addressed in Irish or English throughout the country.<br\/><br\/>Our aim has always been, and will continue to be, that mail addressed in Irish receives the same quality of service as mail addressed in English.  Our standard operating procedures for staff contain methods for dealing with letters containing Irish addresses.  All of this is in a context where many of our staff are primarily English speaking and increasingly some do not have Irish or English as their first language.  As an aside, having spent a holiday around Ireland on the south and west coast last week, my wife and I found ourselves sending a daily postcard to our daughter who was in Col&aacute;iste UISCE in Belmullet.  We dutifully posted one each day from various locations such as Dublin, Castlebar, Clonakilty and Kinsale, and the mail, which was addressed fully in Irish, was delivered the following day in each case, as indeed it should be.<br\/><br\/>The address and location data mentioned by Mr. Irwin, including Irish location names, are captured in a variety of ways such as during route updates with delivery staff, on the ground from street or development nameplates, from planning sites and brochures for new developments, or as a result of an address-related query.  Where there is an Irish name within a designated Gaeltacht area, we record the locality in Irish along with its English alternative.  This can include a spelling variation, an abbreviation, an alternative name or other versions of an Irish language name or Irish language abbreviation.  Our website, <i>www.anpost.ie<\/i>, offers a facility for checking local addresses in both Irish and English.<br\/><br\/>As has been said, we at An Post have an robust system in place for delivering mail in Irish or English and within the Gaeltacht areas.  We work with both Irish and English versions of addresses and the many variants of both that exist throughout the country.  As with GeoDirectory, we use the official Irish names received from <i>logainm.ie<\/i>and we continue to work towards the most efficient way of delivering the mail to our Gaeltacht customers.  We also continue to develop and improve the data and local knowledge on which we rely so heavily, conscious of the needs of Gaeltacht communities, working within and as part of those communities, and supporting the national language.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022071300002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cyril McGrane"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":583,"content":"<p>T&aacute; a fhios agam go mbeidh v&oacute;ta&iacute; ar si&uacute;l sa Seanad.

Neither An Post nor Ordnance Survey Ireland are the legal entities that assign addresses.  That has to be remembered as well.  That is the responsibility of the local authority.  A series of events has to happen for an address to be created so we can capture it.  The reality on the ground is that people change their addresses and we have to capture those changes as well.  While people sometimes see an address as being a very solid and fixed thing, it is quite fluid and changes a lot.  While we are saying the vast majority of addresses in Gaeltacht areas are in Irish, there are some that are not because they are recorded in English still.  That needs to change and they need to be translated officially so we can capture them.  We will capture them and we will include them.<br\/><br\/>The reality is there are business names in English and we have to record them as they are because that is what people know them as.  Businesses want to be found, they want their customers to find them and that is what they call themselves, so it is in English at the moment.  When a new housing estate or house is being created, for example, it can take a while for an address to be established and we are not sure what the address is at all.  It is vague in both Irish and English, so we are waiting for that to be finished.  As I alluded to, we break the address into different components, and there is not the full level of Irish available yet for some of those components because they are in the process of being translated.  When they are translated, we capture them.  The vast majority in Gaeltacht areas are as Gaeilge.  We are always striving for perfection and completeness and chasing that goal.  It is a fundamental goal of GeoDirectory throughout the country and not just in Gaeltacht areas.<br\/><br\/>In answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question, An Post cannot deliver to us a full Irish language version because it is not officially translated yet in all cases.

It continues.  We referenced this earlier.  Through our constant updating and working with <i>logainm.ie<\/i>, we know there are different interpretations and spellings throughout the different Gaeltacht regions of Ireland.  We have to take all of those factors into account and, while doing all of this, ensure we meet our obligations in respect of next-day service.  The point I was making is we are doing that.  We are confident that letters addressed in Irish, or indeed in English, receive that next-day quality service in our Gaeltacht areas through our delivery service units.  Many from the local population are employed in those delivery service units and are Irish speakers themselves.  With their knowledge, they are helping us all of the time to improve our database.  It is constant, however.  It does not stop at one point in time at which that is it and it is all done.  As Mr. Keogh mentioned, people decide to change the name of their houses.

If you search for a postcode in a Gaeltacht area, the Eircode system will return the Irish version of the address.  You have to go into a secondary tab to find the English version of the address.  When a new property is released and a new address comes to us from GeoDirectory, we send an Eircode notification letter to the householder.  If that house is in a Gaeltacht area, it will be addressed to the Irish version of the address.  We do a lot.  I am very comfortable with what we do but we do not have a remit to make a unilateral change that goes against the terms of our agreement with the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SC12022071300002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Dignam"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":675,"content":"<p>Caithfidh m&eacute; a r&aacute; go bhfuil m&eacute; f&oacute;s den tuairim gur ar an Roinn a thiteann an fhreagracht as an bpraiseach seo mar t&aacute; f&oacute;rsa dl&iacute; leis na pleananna teanga agus is l&eacute;ir go ndearna an Roinn plean teanga agus nach raibh s&iacute; s&aacute;sta &eacute; a chur i bhfeidhm.

I am joined today by my colleague, Mr. Paul McDermott, who is the director of high performance and national governing bodies at Sport Ireland.  To begin, I wish to emphasise that Sport Ireland has worked closely with Cycling Ireland to provide support and guidance on its governance issues to ensure it can continue to operate as one of Ireland&rsquo;s most successful national governing bodies, NGBs.  Cycling Ireland is the NGB for cycling across the island of Ireland.  Its stated vision is to develop an island enriched by cycling.  It covers a broad range of disciplines, including BMX, cyclocross, mountain biking, track and road racing.  The NGB currently represents approximately 25,000 affiliated members across 490 clubs.  These figures have grown significantly from a baseline of around 6,000 in 2010.<\/p> <p>  Cycling is of strategic importance.  It is referenced in both the national sports policy and Healthy Ireland&rsquo;s national physical activity plan as a priority sport, as well as being a central component of Transport Infrastructure Ireland&rsquo;s national cycle network.  Cycling Ireland currently delivers a broad range of initiatives, projects and events across multiple Sport Ireland investment programmes, including participation, inclusion, women in sport and high performance.  In the national sports policy 2018-2027, cycling has been identified as one of three key sports for prioritised participation.  That is because of its contribution to overall health and well-being.  In addition, cycling is a key mode of transport that benefits the environment while also contributing to fitness beyond the sporting context.<\/p> <p>  Through Sport Ireland's research, the Irish sports monitor, a significant increase in cycling participation has been measured since 2019, with a particularly strong growth during the pandemic.<\/p><p>As a means of transport, Sport Ireland has measured an increase in people who are using cycling as a method of transport to 11% of the population.  In relation to Cycling Ireland's contribution, it contributes many positive aspects to Irish sport, including a high level of success in high performance cycling contributing to Sport Ireland&rsquo;s overall medal targets annually and quadrennially.  We have witnessed recent successes for Irish cycling at the Paralympic Games with Team Ireland winning two gold medals, one silver medal and one bronze medal, while at the Olympic Games, Cycling Ireland qualified its largest ever team.<\/p><p> The proposed development of a velodrome at the Sport Ireland campus will be an exciting addition to Irish cycling and will create the opportunity to bring major benefits to Irish cycling at national and international levels.  The velodrome will not just benefit high performance cycling, but the cycling community at large as well as the general public in providing an opportunity to participate in a safe environment for cycling.  Sport Ireland recently commissioned the KOSI Corporation to conduct an audit in response to observed governance concerns in Cycling Ireland.  This audit highlighted a number of concerns across the board.  Issues in relation to funding, ethical decision making, organisational culture and behaviours were just some of the issues highlighted in the report.  Sport Ireland is pleased to see the progress being made by Cycling Ireland in addressing and tackling the issues which were brought to light in the context of the issues raised in the report.  On 30 May, Cycling Ireland provided Sport Ireland with a formal written update on its progress in regard to the 2021 KOSI audit findings and wider governance reforms.  Significant resources have been invested in addressing these recommendations.  Cycling Ireland has communicated to Sport Ireland that all KOSI recommendations will be addressed in full by the end of September 2022.<\/p><p>Cycling Ireland has been allotted core and high performance funding.  However, in the context of ongoing governance improvements, a payment schedule or what we refer to as a financial plan has been agreed for both core and high performance funding.  In June 2022, Cycling Ireland requested a release of funding by Sport Ireland.  This funding was sought by the national governing body, NGB, to ensure business operations continued without disruption.  Sport Ireland agreed to release 50% of allocated funding within the parameters of the financial plan, which ensures Cycling Ireland continues to function while satisfying Sport Ireland that the risks presented are mitigated and public funds protected.<\/p><p> A number of changes in board and executive personnel have brought additional skills and experience to the organisation.  I am happy to say the composition of the board now consists of a 50:50 gender balance among its ten directors, each of whom contribute a wide variety of credentials, skills, and experience.  A number of new board sub-committees have also been established, each with approved terms of reference and with independent members either in place or identified for recruitment.  More recently, Cycling Ireland has commissioned auditors, BDO, to complete work on a number of areas: to act as an external reviewer of Cycling Ireland grant applications going forward, up until June 2023; to investigate the Sport Northern Ireland sustainability grant application; and to conduct an independent review in relation to Cycling Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with the professional cycling team EvoPro Racing.  <\/p><p> On 20 and 21 May 2022, Cycling Ireland conducted consultative workshops - first, between the staff and the board and, second, between the board, senior staff and representatives of the wider membership of Cycling Ireland.  Both workshops were facilitated by external strategic and governance specialists.  These activities were specifically convened to address aspects of the KOSI recommendations, including ethical decision making, organisational culture and behaviour; and the role of the board and staff in working together.  There will be further consultations with the wider community in place prior to the AGM in November.  We will also see some additional governance reforms in a series of amendments and motions which will be tabled at that AGM in order to progress a further number of governance and structural issues that are arising.  A nominations group under the direction of the governance and ethics committee will endeavour to ensure the candidates meet suitability requirements particularly in relation to a skills matrix.  However, given the current structure of the constitution, certain amendments may need to be made in advance to facilitate this process.  Cycling Ireland has made progress in appointing a new performance director and is on a good trajectory towards the continuation of its performance programme.  We are also very confident that there is a new, emerging group of talented young athletes who are rising through the ranks and performing very successfully at an international level.  I mentioned the velodrome previously.  Sport Ireland is very keen to see it being commenced in the near future.  I am hopeful.  That will make a big difference to cycling in Ireland but it will also be a very strong addition to the Sport Ireland campus.  Throughout its engagement with Cycling Ireland, Sport Ireland will continue to ensure the highest standards of governance are adhered to across the organisation.  We are content with the progress made to date.  We have noted that there is still some way to go but are very comfortable that there is good progress being made.  We will continue to provide ongoing advice to support Cycling Ireland with this work as it goes through these reforms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022071300002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Una May","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":725,"content":"<p>I call Dr. Tom Daly of Cycling Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022071300002#B00200","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":726,"content":"<p>Good afternoon.  I was appointed vice president of the board of directors of Cycling Ireland last March as part of the formation of a new board.  My co-vice president is Mr. Conor Campbell and in the absence of an elected president, I am representing the board here this afternoon.  I am joined by my fellow board member, Ms Helen Kerrane, who was also appointed earlier this year.  I thank the committee for this invitation and we look forward to providing an update on the organisation&rsquo;s affairs, and to answering the members' questions, as part of our commitment to transparency and accountability.  I also thank the committee for its patience with our previous postponement of this session.  As we explained then, we were awaiting completion of a significant overdue report, which we felt would greatly help the committee members to be more fully informed.  Unfortunately, we have still not received this report and BDO, the firm commissioned to produce it, has confirmed that due to matters outside its and Cycling Ireland's control, it is not yet able to publish its report on the proposed commercial arrangements between Cycling Ireland and EvoPro Racing.  BDO has also confirmed that Cycling Ireland has been especially keen to have this report published well before this, and especially in time for today's committee hearing.  Due to ongoing interventions of legal representatives of the former president of Cycling Ireland and EvoPro Racing, respectively, BDO is unable to proceed with the publication of the findings at this time.<\/p> <p>  I want to provide a brief introduction to our organisation and its context.  As has been said, Cycling Ireland is the national governing body for cycling across the island with more than 25,000 members.  The membership has increased significantly over recent years.  Cycling has been listed as one of three priority sports in the national sports policy, with Government committing significant funds to the area.  Taken together, these developments represent both a once-in-a-generation opportunity as well as a significant challenge for Cycling Ireland.  Our operations are very diverse.  On the one hand we are working hard to give our high-performance athletes the best possible opportunities and on the other, we are delivering entry-level programmes to tens of thousands of children annually.  In between, we expect to deliver more than 1,100 events this year encompassing a very diverse range of cycling disciplines and interests for all ages.  In summary, we are working very hard to create an environment in which Irish cyclists of all ages and interests are provided with the opportunity to fulfil their personal aspirations and potential.<\/p> <p>  I will now address some of the legacy governance issues and related reforms this board is dealing with.  One issue goes back to 2020 and relates to a capital grant application that resulted in Cycling Ireland being deemed ineligible to receive capital funding for a 12-month period.  This was restored in October 2021.  In parallel, Cycling Ireland was the subject of a governance audit, the KOSI audit report,  commissioned by Sport Ireland.  This was released in October 2021, revealing significant governance inadequacies and detailing 17 change recommendations.  We have already implemented, or are in the process of implementing, 14 of these and expect all will be addressed by this September.  Another such governance lapse began to emerge in December 2021 regarding the proposed support for a development academy for young Irish riders through an already established professional cycling team, EvoPro Racing.<\/p><p>Based on the potentially high and ill-defined costs, along with other issues contained in a heads of agreement presented to the board, the board subsequently attempted to agree an arrangement that would provide both parties with clarity on requirements and costs.  This arrangement was produced to EvoPro Racing but was not agreed to.  This issue created an irreconcilable disagreement at board level during the early part of this year and, as part of a resolution achieved with the help of Sport Ireland and the presidents of Cycling Ireland&rsquo;s provincial bodies, the then president and several directors voluntarily stood aside to enable a new board to be formed.  Given the profound effects of the EvoPro issue on the organisation, the board commissioned BDO Ireland consultants in February 2022 to investigate the details of the proposed arrangement.  This measure was felt necessary to protect our reputational integrity and to uncover any operational, administrative and cultural weaknesses that would need to be addressed as part of our organisational renewal.  Cycling Ireland has been most anxious to have this report finalised and believe it would have justified the board's concerns, proposed arrangements and subsequent decisions on the matter.  However, as I have explained, its finalisation has been delayed by ongoing legal representations from the other parties involved.  During the course of its inquiries for this report, BDO uncovered and reported to Cycling Ireland a failing over a number of years in the Union Cycliste Internationale, UCI, registration process for Irish-based professional teams.  The UCI is the world governing body for cycling.  The current board is in the process of remediating this issue with the relevant stakeholders.<\/p><p> I will briefly refer to the leadership of the organisation, which is primarily our board.  The current board is composed of exceptionally qualified directors with proven domestic and international experience and with a broad range of relevant competencies.  The board has established strong subcommittees in the areas of people and culture, governance and compliance and audit, risk and finance.  We have also achieved a 50:50 gender balanced of directors.  At our first full meeting in March 2022, we committed to a root-and-branch review of the operational structures of our organisation, beginning with an extensive consultation process with members.  This is well under way and will be ongoing until the autumn.<\/p><p> We fully acknowledge and regret that serious mistakes were made in the past, which were unbefitting of an organisation that receives public funds and fees from members.  However, it is important to stress that there was no personal gain for those involved.  All acted primarily in good faith and were motivated by a passion for the sport.  By voluntarily stepping aside, they have contributed to the organisation&rsquo;s renewal of itself.  I assure the committee that the new board of Cycling Ireland is resolute in its commitment to effectively serve our members, to foster a culture of integrity, to provide value for public funds and to adhere to robust principles of good governance.  I thank the committee for its time and we look forward to answering members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022071300002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":728,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for joining us today and for the exceptional work they are doing in developing the sport and the pursuit of cycling on the island of Ireland.  I asked that the witnesses appear before us today to address the significant breakdown in trust that occurred as the result of the actions of an admittedly small group of people within the organisation in how they approached the grant aid process.  We must begin to restore trust, hopefully to a significant level, so the 25,000 members of Cycling Ireland and people who are generally interested in and passionate about the sport of cycling can have that trust on an ongoing basis.  The witnesses have done an exceptional amount of work since these anomalies and issues were first identified and I congratulate them on that.  Asking them here was not about engaging in any kind of accusatory or Star Chamber process.  It is about bringing as much information as we possibly can out into the open with regard to the ongoing reforms in governance that are happening, and will continue to happen, in Cycling Ireland, hopefully for as long as is necessary.<\/p><p>I have a few questions for the witnesses.  It is important that these questions are asked and answered so we can continue with that process of restoring trust.  Is there an ongoing Garda examination or inquiry into the false quotations that were given to the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media?  If so, has that inquiry arrived at any conclusions?  Having been a member of Cycling Ireland for many years, I always thought there was a significant lacuna or vacuum in the area of communication between the board, the executive and the members.  It is a very large organisation with 25,000 members, which is excellent to see.  When it became apparent to the board that these issues had arisen, was there any ambition to make this information known to the members within the shortest possible timeframe?  Why did it take so long for the members to be informed of these issues?  They are substantial stakeholders within the organisation.  They effectively contribute to the financial well-being of the organisation but I have always felt they were held at a remove from the board itself.  That needs to be resolved.  I would be interested in how exactly the witnesses intend to do that.<\/p><p>There is another aspect of Cycling Ireland's work, which is something I am passionate about.  I have always considered this unusual so the witnesses might be able to help me on this.  The memorandum of association states, &quot;The main object for which the Company is established ... is to encourage, develop and organise cycling on the island of Ireland including but not exclusively racing and leisure cycling&quot;.  Today's opening statement from Sport Ireland states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tCycling Ireland is the NGB for cycling across the island of Ireland.  Its stated vision is to develop an island enriched by cycling. <\/blockquote> <p>That is a very powerful choice of words.  I would argue that a key element in delivering on those two objectives, that is, to organise, encourage and develop cycling and to develop an island enriched by cycling, is ensuring Cycling Ireland's 25,000 members can cycle in a relatively safe environment.  Whether leisure members training for the next sportive or elite racing members training for their next time trial, TT, or hoping to make it onto a national team, their training place is essentially our public roads.  There are no other options available to them right now.  Our public roads are their de facto training facility.  Do the witnesses believe Cycling Ireland has a role in advocating for safer roads in Ireland?  Have they engaged with organisations like the Road Safety Authority or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the past, or do they intend to engage with them in the future, to ensure our legislation is sufficiently robust to protect Cycling Ireland's members when they are cycling on public roads?  If I was a board member of Cycling Ireland, I would think that a critically important element of the work it does.  In my experience working with many others in cycling across Ireland in the last four or five years, the voice of Cycling Ireland has been strangely silent on all these matters.  I would be interested in the witnesses' perspectives on that.<\/p><p>The witnesses will be aware that over the last six months to a year, many club and provincial cycling organisations around the country have had difficulty staging events on public roads, be they TTs, races or whatever else.  There seems to be an inconsistent approach within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as to how these events are facilitated at local level.  Some garda&iacute; and their superiors seem to be exceptionally supportive of events and others seem to be implacably opposed.  Has Cycling Ireland engaged with the Garda at a national level, or does it intend to, to put in place a agreed protocol or policy for when clubs or provincial organisations seek to organise an event?<\/p><p> It is fantastic that Cycling Ireland has achieved gender balance on its board.  Is there a representative on the board who represents the views of the members of Cycling Ireland?  I know it is difficult to arrive at a consensus on what those views might be.  Who is the voice on the board for the 25,000 members who make a substantial financial contribution to Cycling Ireland each year?  Who represents their interests in terms of how they want the organisation to develop, their interaction with the organisation, such as in the area of membership renewal, and their objectives and passion for the development of the sport in future?<\/p><p> I say \"Well done\" to our witnesses on a very successful R&aacute;s event this year.  It was wonderful to see that historic cycling event coming back to life and making us all very proud to be part of Cycling Ireland.  How does the investment of Cycling Ireland in that race compare with the investment it makes or intends to make in R&aacute;s na mBan or the Junior Tour of Ireland, which is currently ongoing?  This is important.  I refer to what the UCI is doing internationally to promote women in cycling, along with organisations such as the Amaury Sport Organisation, ASO, and others that are increasingly finding a way to bring women in cycling onto television channels and smartphones.  It is important for Cycling Ireland, too, to be very active in promoting women in cycling at local, provincial and national levels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022071300002#C00200","speaker":"1483","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":730,"content":"<p>I afforded latitude to the Deputy but the onus is on members to avoid making comments that may prejudice the outcome of proceedings of a legal nature.

I will deal with his questions in order and defer to Ms Kerrane on certain aspects.<br\/><br\/>As regards the Garda inquiry, it is our understanding that there have been Garda inquiries into the issue of the sports capital grant.  We do not believe they involve any current employees of Cycling Ireland.  Our CEO was in touch with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  He was asked to assist by way of giving a statement to verify some facts, but we do not believe he or any other employee of the organisation is the subject of those inquiries. I have no knowledge of the status of the inquiry.<br\/><br\/>The second issue raised by the Deputy relates to communication, or a lack thereof, between the board and the members.  I sat through the annual general meeting, AGM, as a relatively ordinary member and was disappointed to subsequently discover there were these various issues going on and, possibly like the Deputy, I had not been told about them at the AGM.  The board has committed to openness and transparency.  Since the board was formed in March, we have issued two individual updates on all these affairs, insofar as we can, to each member of the organisation.  We are committed to that.  As part of our consultation process, we are meeting with members through various forums where we are open to questions, which will be answered.  We are doing our best in that regard.<br\/><br\/>On the area of leisure cycling, safety and all that, we are in somewhat of a transition stage.  Ms Kerrane will address that.  To give an illustration from my experience of where we are, as a club secretary in Killarney I was heavily involved in submitting observations on cycling development and all that but I felt slightly uncomfortable about doing so because there was a question in respect of whether that is the role of a cycling club.  The club did not do that kind of thing historically and there is nothing in our rules or constitution stating it is our role.  We did it anyway.  We were working with people from <i>cyclist.ie<\/i>, who are very professional at this type of thing, and there was a question in respect of what our role was in all this, as compared with their role.  Cycling Ireland is in a similar state of transition in terms of discussing where we lie at a policy level in this area and where we should lie relative to the other organisations.  I will hand over to Ms Kerrane to provide details of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022071300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom Daly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":732,"content":"<p>The Cycling Ireland strategic plan 2020-2024 has four main points regarding advocacy, one of which is to develop memorandums of understanding with organisations such as <i>cyclist.ie<\/i>.  I understand that previous boards have attempted to do this but we would like to see the furtherance of that.  There are many different groups and we do not want to end up with duplication of what is out there.I am concerned to canvass their opinion.  We have member surveys.  Any members of the committee who are also members of Cycling Ireland will have had an email drop into their inbox last week with a membership survey and I ask them to fill it in.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy asked about cycling safety standards and the RSA.  We have worked with the RSA.  It is in the strategic plan to do so.<br\/><br\/>As regards the question on safety and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that is as much a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na it is for Cycling Ireland.  I cannot answer on behalf of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as to why there is a disparity in how different events across the country are treated.  We would like to work with it on that.  In Northern Ireland, Cycling Ulster and Cycling Ireland discuss these matters with the PSNI and have developed an accredited marshal training platform so that accredited marshals can be allowed to stop traffic there.  It is a structured training plan.  It is not just about a person stepping out with a red flag.We could consider having a formal discussion in the South of Ireland with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, national governing bodies, Deputies and other legislators as to whether that could be attained here.  This is for the safety of everybody, not just of cyclists.  I agree that safety is the number one issue that comes up when members ask about what is happening.  That is true whether the member is a parent, as I am, with a daughter who cycles, or a normal commuter, as I am.  I cycled here today.  It is multi-factoral.  We can do better and we will seek to do this in the future.  It is in our strategic plan that we will consult with organisations and bodies.  I cannot speak for the previous board but I can do so for the current one.<br\/><br\/>As regards the Deputy's final point, regarding who are the representatives of the members of Cycling Ireland, Dr. Daly and I, along with many other people, have not lost our links to cyclists.  There are several of us on the current board who have been involved as commissaires or racing organisers or come from a racing background.  I have raced and I am commuter and a parent.  I trained my kid how to ride.  I do long-distance cycling and have done track cycling.  You name it, I have done it.  We are here for Cycling Ireland.  We may have been nominated by various organisations and structures to the new board.  I was nominated by Cycling Leinster, for example.  We are here for cycling as a sport and a utility, however, and we are here for its future.  We are the ordinary members.  I have been to many AGMs and look forward to attending more of them in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022071300002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Helen Kerrane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":733,"content":"<p>To get back to the question on safety, Ms Kerrane mentioned the Cycling Ireland arrangement in Northern Ireland.  Initial steps in that regard have been made in the South.  Our CEO recently visited the relevant people at Garda headquarters to initiate a discussion on the matter.  He was accompanied by one or more of our members from Northern Ireland who were involved in the development of that scheme in the North of Ireland.  Initial steps have been made to, it is hoped, make progress in that area.  It relates to the standardisation of safety issues in the context of the running of events, the enhancement of all that and giving reassurance to the Garda and the public on how it might operate.<\/p> <p>  I can only reinforce Ms Kerrane's observations on who is representing cyclists on the board.<\/p><p>I may stand to be corrected but I do not believe there is any person on the board who is not a cyclist of one type or another.  Quite a number of us have been heavily involved in clubs all our lives.  It is fair to say that members who do not have that experience are very anxious and working hard to learn about the organisation and the people involved in it.<\/p><p> The Deputy's final question was on the funding of our key events.  We aim to give appropriate and proportionate funding to all key events.  There was a higher level of funding given to R&aacute;s Tailteann this year, as opposed to R&aacute;s na mBan, for a number of reasons.  One reason was a commitment given by the previous board.  The other is that, as the Deputy will be well aware, R&aacute;s Tailteann has a tremendously important strategic role in Irish cycling as a motivator and a pathway from the crucial underage and junior levels into the senior, high-performance level.  We need to be able to showcase the event in order for it to attract commercial sponsorship and for it to be able to stand on its own two feet.  The increased funding this year was to enable it to be resurrected after a lacuna of a number of years in order that it could be highlighted to potential sponsors.  That was part of the reason, as well as the value of the event itself.  It has been made clear to the R&aacute;s Tailteann organisation that this increased level of funding will not be sustained by Cycling Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022071300002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":735,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Daly.

We will be able to expand the track programme, not only at global and international competition but also at national level.

We have been able to generate quite a significant amount of success.  It is not untypical that high performance athletes are used to travelling and training overseas but it will definitely be a landmark, pivotal moment for cycling in Ireland.  It will be hugely exciting.  We know that Cycling Ireland has plans and will be able to use it to its upmost for coaching, technical expertise, Paralympics, the able-bodied Olympic team and generally for clubs and others who want to expand and engage track cyclists.  It will be very exciting.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022071300002#F01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul McDermott"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":760,"content":"<p>That is great.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022071300002#F01100","speaker":"1555"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":761,"content":"<p>I thank all the witnesses and particularly Dr. Daly and Ms Kerrane.

Contrasting Cycling Ireland with the IABA, in Cycling Ireland we had a board which voluntarily stepped aside.  Excellent volunteers like Dr. Tom Daly and Ms Helen Kerrane stepped up to the mark.  As is clear from the weekend, the outgoing IABA board has lost the confidence of the clubs and members.  It certainly arguable and our committee put it to Sport Ireland that because the outgoing board lost support, no matter what governance proposal the outgoing central council put, it was never going to carry with the members.  There was a correct response in terms of what happened with Cycling Ireland, in contrast with what happened in the IABA.  The approach of Sport Ireland and the Minister to the IABA should be to engage with the new council and not be talking about threatening funding cuts.  That is appropriate obviously if there is no governance reform but that reform in the IABA was not going to come as the existing regime did not have the confidence of the members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022071300002#G00700","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":772,"content":"<p>I attended the meeting in Roscommon on Sunday.

We hope the IABA community which turned up in numbers, with 105 clubs represented on Sunday, will go back to the substance of the recommendations.  There was not a lot of conversation about their substance.  The governance review written by Brian MacNeice was independent and was commissioned by the IABA itself.

I will not get into a debate about it.  The independent report recognised, as we all do, that there were in the IABA long-standing issues, some going back a number of years.  In the last 18 months three particular issues arose: the issue within the central council itself, the issue with high performance, and the review.  We do not have a partisan approach.  We wanted to help the IABA.  It commissioned the report.  It was done independently.  My role was simply to have one interview with Brian MacNeice.  Mr. MacNeice spoke to the people in Irish boxing.  All the clubs were allowed to make submissions.  We talked to a wide range of people.  We have to accept, however, as we do, that the clubs and the grassroots feel a disconnect.  There is no question about that.  That was heard loud and clear on Sunday.  There is a body of work to do to repair that.  It is fair of Senator Malcolm Byrne to make the contrast with Cycling Ireland, the board of which is embracing the need to stay with the KOSI report, the IPA governance effectiveness review and so on.  It is to be hoped that, in the aftermath of Sunday, people will reflect and understand what is required of the IABA to address the issues.  Sunday was a landmark day.  It moved the situation forward.  However, has it addressed the issues of substance?  Not yet.  Those issues of substance remain to be addressed, and we remain open to working with the IABA to address them.  It is in everybody's interest.  We absolutely recognise the importance of Cycling Ireland as a governing body and cycling as a sport and a pursuit in Ireland.  Likewise, we value the contribution of Irish boxing not just to Irish sport but to the wider community.  That is why we spend so much time engaging with the IABA, and we hope to continue to do so.

To have taken the leadership away or to have lost the leadership close to an Olympic Games was less than ideal.  Cycling Ireland put in place a variety of interventions to mitigate that loss, but the loss was less than ideal.  We believe that Cycling Ireland has high potential in respect of high performance.  We believe that cycling is a core sport, whether at European, world, Olympic or Paralympic levels.  The performance director Cycling Ireland has now is a high-calibre individual, and we believe he can lead that programme into sustained success.  However, they are expensive programmes - there is no question about it - and sometimes that can raise an eyebrow.  However, if we want to be successful on the track or the road or with the Paris cyclists, the organisation has to be led by a suitably qualified person with the right coaches and so on.  We hope that that person, in any programme, can be sustained right the way through an Olympic or a Paralympic cycle and that we will not lose him or her close to a games because that is not fair on the athletes.

It is one of the priority lines we are going to try to agree with the IABA and one of the points of urgency with it.  As the various contributors said, there is an urgency here to get the IABA back and functioning to a high level.  I pay tribute to the coaches, including Zaur Antia, John Conlon, Dmitrij Dmitruk and the others.  They have done a fantastic job but they are only filling in a gap.

As I said at the beginning, this has been a very important element of the process of restoring trust in Cycling Ireland and its governance structures.  We can go forward from today with a hugely greater degree of confidence in how exactly those governance issues are being addressed and will be addressed in future.  I am delighted to hear the velodrome is becoming - I hope, I think - a reality at long last.  I recall visiting New Zealand with our ambassador there about two years ago.  We were brought to one of its two national velodromes and met two renowned, world-class track cycling coaches who happened to be Irish but were basing themselves there because it was the only place they could get a role or function with their coaching skills.  To be able to attract that kind of talent home again and to develop our locally home-grown talent would be a really exciting time in Irish cycling.  I wish Dr. Daly and the board of Cycling Ireland every success in getting that under way as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>  In conclusion, I was not casting any aspersions, and apologies if it sounded that way, on the cycling pedigrees of either of guests from Cycling Ireland, because those are very substantial and honourable.  Dr. Daly explained earlier the appointment process to the board but I am thinking about the optics of this.  I argue that in an organisation as large as Cycling Ireland and that has as large a national footprint, there always needs to be some sort of mechanism so the 25,000 members have a say, although many of them do not turn up to meetings.  We have our AGM in Seven Springs Cycling Club in Loughrea every year and out of I think 90 members 25 turn up and the rest pay their sub and say that is all they are doing.  The commitment was made to go on further than that and it is welcome but there needs to be perhaps some mechanism whereby the 25,000 members would have a role or what we might describe as a voice on the board.  Granted all board members are a voice for cycling and they have all risen up through the ranks from their local cycling clubs but I just think that is important from a perception point of view on an ongoing basis.<\/p> <p>  As I said, I thank both of the Cycling Ireland guests for the work, for stepping into the breach and doing incredibly important work in restoring that trust and providing a really strong, solid foundation for the future of cycling in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022071300002#J01000","speaker":"1483"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":799,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

It is incredible in the context of an airline that was responsible last week alone for the cancellation of approximately 100 flights from Dublin Airport.<\/p><p>The vast majority - 70% - of the cancelled flights from Dublin Airport were Aer Lingus flights.  It is unacceptable that we are held in such contempt by the airline, given the substantial payment provided to it during the Covid-19 pandemic.<br\/><br\/>I received an email at 8.12 a.m. and the heading on it is &quot;Another wonderful move by Aer Lingus&quot;.  I want to read it into the record, although I will not name the sender.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>\tYesterday July 12th, Flight EI 107 from DUBlin to JFK New York was cancelled.<br \/><br \/>We sat on the runway for nearly 3 hours and then were summarily told to get off, find our own accommodation and wait for an email from Aer Lingus for further information.<br \/><br \/>Getting off the plane we were met with a skeleton crew who had no concrete or usable information.<br \/><br \/>As I booked my flight through Expedia..  I contacted them for updates.<br \/><br \/>It&rsquo;s now 8.04am on Wednesday morning. Aer Lingus still has not updated their systems with Expedia to reflect the cancellation.<br \/><br \/>Incompetence, arrogance and lack of concern for their passengers has been one reason I never fly Aer Lingus.  I now add criminally understaffed.<br \/><br \/>They&rsquo;ve had 2 years plus to boost and train staffing as they know that Covid is going to be a recurring issue. This should not be a huge surprise to them.<br \/><br \/>I made the mistake of giving them another chance. That will never happen again.<br \/><br \/>And while they&rsquo;re at it&hellip; they might get someone to clean the bathrooms.  And pick up the rubbish.  [That is a different matter]<br \/><br \/>Yours, from the Travelodge in Swords ... <\/blockquote><p>This is one example given by a person I have never spoken to earlier this morning.  The attitude of the airline is unacceptable.  The behaviour of management towards us and, more importantly, the travelling public is completely unacceptable.  We have an obligation on behalf of the travelling public to hold Aer Lingus to account.  The airline is responsible for a huge proportion of the transatlantic flights coming into and going out of Ireland.  In that context, it is important that we hold it to account.  The August bank holiday weekend is coming up.  It is probably going to be the second-busiest weekend of the summer.  In terms of the number of passengers who have been discommoded or left unable to travel, what Aer Lingus has done is worse than the meltdown we saw with the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, in the third week of May.  What is equally bad is the reputational damage done to our country in terms of how tourists and people coming here see, regardless of whether it is their first or last experience of Ireland, what is happening.  It is not good enough.  I ask the Chair to have the secretariat invite representatives of Aer Lingus to come before the committee to appear before us next week, the week after or at some point prior to the summer recess.

I am principal officer of the climate delivery division, which is part of the new climate action pillar established in the Department in the past 12 months.  I am joined this afternoon by my colleague Ms Patricia Waller.  In the climate delivery division, Ms Waller and I work on facilitating the transition to electric vehicles in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The Climate Action Plan 2021 has set a high ambition for the electrification of transport, with a target of almost 1 million electric vehicles on Irish roads in 2030, including private cars, small public service vehicles, light and heavy goods vehicles and larger public transport vehicles.  The Government strategy to increase the uptake of electric vehicles in Ireland involves two main elements.  First is incentivising the purchase of electric vehicles through both financial supports and regulation and second is the provision of a high-quality, seamless electric vehicle charging infrastructure.  There has been significant investment from the private sector in delivering EV charging infrastructure in Ireland and this has been critical in supporting the uptake of electric vehicles to date.  However, in anticipation of much-needed step change increase in electric vehicle ownership, it is appropriate and necessary for the Government to set a framework and national plan for the provision of Ireland&rsquo;s EV charging infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  In this light, the Department developed a draft EV charging infrastructure strategy and issued it for public consultation in March of this year.  The strategy considers the different charging needs of urban and rural communities, as well as the need for a just transition to EVs in Ireland.  In developing principles to underpin the roll-out of EV charging infrastructure, the strategy takes into account the anticipated trajectory of EV uptake and the increasing demand that will be placed on electricity distribution networks through the electrification of transport.  Currently, the majority of EV charging, about 80%, is done at home.  Access to and installation of home charging infrastructure is relatively well established in Ireland.  A more significant gap exists in the provision of publicly accessible charging infrastructure, the demand for which will grow as EV uptake increases.  The strategy identifies four main categories of charging infrastructure, all serving different user needs depending on where and when people need to charge their EVs.  The first category is home charging or multi-resident unit or apartment charging.  It is expected that this will be the default charging option for the vast majority of people living in Ireland.<\/p><p>This type of charging will be standard, requiring a number of hours for a vehicle's battery to be 80% charged.  The strategy proposes that off-peak or night-time charging should be encouraged to ease demand on the grid.  The strategy also proposes promoting shared charging solutions.  This would be an Airbnb-type system for home chargers, whereby the owner would rent out his or her home charger, typically via a third-party app.  For people who do not have the access or the space to install their own home charging solutions, the strategy proposes that residential or neighbourhood charging solutions are developed in higher density residential areas.  These would replicate the home charging solution by providing standard and, preferably, off-peak charging options.  This concept has been successfully delivered in cities such as London, Oslo and Amsterdam to support the uptake of electric vehicles.<\/p><p> A variety of top-up charging solutions are then also needed for people who need to charge their batteries while on the go.  These solutions include destination charging, which involves a faster charge at a trip location or destination, taking typically between one to three hours to charge, depending on the duration of the visit, and en-route charging, which would more or less replicate the current forecourt refuelling option used by internal combustion engine vehicle drivers.  En-route charging will be in locations where the only purpose is to refuel, that is, there is no other reason for stopping there.  Therefore, en-route charging infrastructure needs to be at the highest charge power capacities.  Ideally, a charge at these locations should not take more than ten to 20 minutes, and that time will even come down in future years.<\/p><p> The strategy also sets out a high-level plan for the delivery of charging infrastructure over the coming years, with key delivery groups proposed to take forward the implementation of the strategy.  As well as publicly accessible charging infrastructure, there will be a need to consider charging infrastructure for niche sectors such as the electric small public service vehicle, eSPSV, sector and for the piloting of EV charging infrastructure for heavy goods vehicles.<\/p><p> A key element of the delivery plan is the establishment of an office called zero-emission vehicles Ireland, ZEVI, which will be launched next week and will co-ordinate the implementation of the EV infrastructure strategy and the delivery of EV charging infrastructure.  The office will be based in the Department of Transport and supported and resourced by colleagues in a number of agencies, including the SEAI; Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII; the National Transport Authority, NTA; and ESB Networks.<\/p><p> We were very pleased with the level of engagement with the strategy through the public consultation, with over 13,000 responses to the online survey.  One hundred stakeholders participated in two half-day strategy workshops, and we received about 60 detailed written submissions to the strategy.  The consultation responses are being reviewed, and we expect a revised strategy to be published alongside an implementation plan by the end of this year.<\/p><p> Finally, I should note that electric vehicle technology is changing rapidly, with new technologies being developed and introduced to the market at speed.  In this fast-changing context, while the overall trajectory of action is clear, predicting the specifics of charge point types and interfaces that will be available by the end of this decade is less so.  For that reason, while the strategy sets out the long-term structures and frameworks that will be put in place to deliver a comprehensive national EV charging network, the detail in the strategy relating to infrastructure delivery is mainly focused on the years from now until 2025.  In 2025 the strategy will be reviewed, with an updated strategy published for the years from 2026 to 2030.  That will review progress to date and reassess and refine the provisions, initiatives and funding pathways for future delivery.  We look forward to continuing our work in this area.  I am happy to take or to share any questions with my colleague.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#D00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aoife O'Grady","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":824,"content":"<p>We now turn to Mr. Meally for his opening statement on behalf of the SEAI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#E00200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":825,"content":"<p>I thank you, Chair, and joint committee members for the invitation to attend the meeting today and to discuss the Government's draft EV charging infrastructure strategy.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Graham Brennan, the programme manager for EV charging infrastructure.  I thank the committee for affording me the opportunity to present my opening statement.<\/p> <p>  The SEAI is at the forefront of delivering Ireland's energy revolution.  We are funded by the Government of Ireland through the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Transport.  We have had a major transformative impact on the Irish economy, and in the past decade our actions have underpinned more than &euro;1.2 billion in energy savings.  We are catalysts for action through our grant and incentive programmes and our capacity-building processes.  Citizens, communities, businesses and other stakeholders are at the heart of everything we deliver.<\/p> <p>  Transport is the single largest source of energy-related emissions in Ireland, representing about 40% of energy-related emissions, equivalent to about 20% of all greenhouse gas emissions.  While this decreased temporarily during the Covid-19 pandemic, it has since rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, despite even the dramatic fuel price increases in recent months.  The majority of transport emissions come from road transport, approximately 50% from private car users and 25% from freight and commercial fleets, which is difficult to decarbonise due to the dominance of the combustion engine and its associated fuel supply infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  Since 2011 the SEAI has actively promoted the purchase of electric vehicles, including battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles but excluding hybrid electric vehicles, and the associated charging infrastructure in Ireland.  Today we have over 60,000 EVs on our roads, representing about 2.7% of our total car fleet.  The annual sales rate of EVs has grown massively in 2022, representing 21%, or one in five, of all new car sales, up from 13% for the same period last year.  Demand for EVs is high all across the EU and the UK, with six-month waiting lists not uncommon for prospective car buyers.  If Ireland is to reach its target of 845,000 passenger EVs on the roads by 2030, representing 40% of the total car fleet, the EV sales rate will need to reach 100% of all new cars before the end of the decade.  That will require determined investment in public charging infrastructure and efforts to provide charging facilities to the more difficult locations such as on-street, apartment and multi-unit development-type locations.  The SEAI therefore welcomes the publication of the draft EV charging infrastructure strategy by the Department of Transport.<\/p> <p>  We are providing insights and expertise to our colleagues in the Department of Transport to assist the development of the EV charging infrastructure strategy and we look forward to the finalisation and delivery of the strategy as a key part of the overall shift to zero-emissions transport.  Adequate infrastructure is a key enabler of EV uptake in Ireland and can ensure that all vehicle users can complete their necessary journeys with confidence.  Infrastructure must be installed across a range of locations, including private, commercial and public sites, and involves a range of parties, including planners, electricity operators and IT systems.  The strategy aims to bring these interests together under one roof within the new ZEVI collaborative initiative under the Department of Transport.  The SEAI is pleased to continue to provide its expertise and services to this group in order to deliver on the climate action plan.<\/p> <p>  The SEAI's work supports the delivery of the climate action plan and Ireland's emissions reduction targets, including transport actions to support businesses, the public sector, and citizens and communities on their transition to low-emissions transport solutions.  The SEAI's work is integral to the achievement of major targets and policy objectives and includes promotion of EV uptake towards the national EV target by 2030 via grant support for private and commercial vehicles, information supports, interactive comparative tools, fleet guidance, dealer training and awards, transport energy awards, behavioural change campaigns and EV fleet trials.  The national EV target is currently the largest contribution to transport emissions reductions in the Climate Action Plan 2021, with a projected 3.2 Mt CO2 attributed to the target.  Promoting vehicle charging solutions availability to homes, businesses and public bodies via grant support for home chargers, apartment chargers, local authority chargers, and destination and community-based chargers is part of our remit.  The SEAI's work also involves supporting efficiency and emissions reductions in the public transport fleet - that is, public transport, local authority and other public sector fleets - through our public sector programmes and through supporting business fleet electrification via guidance, case studies and grant support for vehicles and charging.  Our work also involves supporting community low-emissions transport initiatives via our sustainable energy community network and community energy grants.  The SEAI was a leading agency supporting the work of the low-emissions vehicles task force, which published numerous reports on key activities to drive the adoption of low-emissions vehicles in Ireland.  The SEAI is also a member of the electric vehicle policy pathway working group, which presented its report to the Government in 2021.  As part of that group, the SEAI behavioural economics team completed a study which outlined the EV customer journey and identified the barriers to be addressed, many of which have been actioned since the report was presented to the Government.  The SEAI's work also involves delivering state-of-the-art energy modelling, policy analysis and advice and collating national energy statistics.  We drive and support national energy research to support innovative research and development activities in support of national emissions reduction targets.<\/p> <p>  We passionately believe that the clean energy transition must happen urgently, and we stand ready to support all of Irish society on this journey.<\/p><p>EVs offer one of the most promising and accessible options for reducing tailpipe emissions from road vehicles.  Importantly, with an ambition and capability of producing 80% of our electricity from our own renewable energy resources, we have the opportunity of removing our dependence on imported energy and stabilising our own transport energy costs into the future.  Electrifying the transport fleet will complement the growth in renewable electricity by providing a mechanism to store the electricity and eventually provide electricity back to the network to provide support to the network when needed.  Operating the number of electric vehicles desired by 2030 will require comprehensive and reliable charging infrastructure options and, importantly, will require intelligent management of vehicle charging via the home and via a smart grid.  The SEAI is ready to support the deployment of this infrastructure, develop new tools and methods to maximise this opportunity and carefully guide the public with the necessary information to make their change to electric vehicles go as smoothly as possible.  We thank our colleagues in the Department of Transport for their support for our transport programmes and close collaboration.  I welcome discussion with the committee, and my colleague and I are happy to answer any questions members may wish to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Meally","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":827,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Meally.

The ESB's strategy, Driven to Make a Difference: Net Zero by 2040, sets out a clear roadmap for the ESB to achieve net zero emissions by 2040.  It also commits the ESB to a science-based target for 2030 to provide assurance that we are decarbonising our operations at the necessary pace and scale.  Our support of e-cars is one of the means we will use to help us achieve these goals.  We are here to address the committee as representatives of ESB e-cars.  Mr. John Byrne, head of e-cars joins me here today.  We are mindful that the committee may have questions for ESB Networks on connections and related matters.  As discussed with the secretariat, these will be addressed by ESB Networks directly in the coming months as we are not here to speak for ESB Networks.<\/p> <p>  I will give some background on ESB e-cars.  The ESB established ESB e-cars in 2010.  We believed that we could support the electrification of transport by seeding, developing and supporting the transition to electromobility.  We recognised that charging infrastructure and support services would need to be in place to give citizens the confidence to purchase an electric vehicle.  There was no onus on the ESB to provide the infrastructure, but it was a role we embraced given our commercial semi-State status and interest in supporting low-carbon technologies.  ESB e-cars was established with three aims: to design and build an expanding public charging infrastructure for EVs across Ireland, thereby reducing the range anxiety that was an issue for early e-car drivers; to support the adoption of EVs in Ireland; and subsequently to stimulate demand for EVs nationally.  In recent years, the demand for EVs has increased dramatically.  Since ESB e-cars was established, we have expanded the network to provide ultra-reliable and fully interoperable EV charging with more than 1,350 public charge points servicing customers across the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  There are three types of chargers on our network.  The standard 22 kW is the most widely available charger on the network.  They are geographically located so that an EV driver is always within 35 km of the nearest charger.  These AC chargers will typically charge an electric vehicle in three to six hours depending on battery size.  The fast charger is a 50 kW charger and we have approximately 150 of them.  These are DC chargers and are substantially faster than the standard chargers.  An 80% charge will typically take 45 minutes.  The high-powered 150 kW chargers are located in hubs and are capable of charging two vehicles simultaneously.  These units can provide the latest generation of EVs with 100 km of range in as little as six minutes.  ESB e-cars is currently undertaking a &euro;20 million investment programme to further expand and enhance the charging network across Ireland.  The ESB qualified for &euro;10 million in funding from the Climate Action Fund with the ESB matching the funding with a further &euro;10 million.  This comprehensive investment programme is expanding and enhancing the public charging network across Ireland to help to meet the expected growth in EVs in the coming years.<\/p> <p>  There are three different elements to the current investment programme.  The first element is the replacement of 264 legacy standard AC chargers, and this is already 99% complete.  The second element is the upgrade of 52 locations to provide fast charging; this is 75% complete and the remainder will be completed in 2023.  The third element is to develop 52 high-power charging, HPC, hubs throughout Ireland, which can charge multiple vehicles simultaneously.  This is a substantial component of the upgrade and will see 52 HPC hubs being constructed as we negotiate access to both motorway and national road sites.<\/p> <p>  Data-driven analytics help to identify and locate the most suitable sites for hubs.  HPC hubs can charge up to eight vehicles simultaneously and can provide up to 100 km of electric driving range in as little as six minutes.  To date, 18 hubs have been completed, with a further 11 in various stages of construction.  We expect them to be completed in 2022, with the remainder to be completed in 2023.  These works will significantly modernise and strengthen the charging network by upgrading all charging points in strategic locations to cater for all EVs, adding next-generation charging hubs to the network.  We are committed to ensuring that our public charging network is reliable and that EV drivers have confidence in it.  Since the commencement of our investment programme, our reliability rate has increased from 84% to an average of 98% this year.<\/p> <p>  ESB e-cars firmly believes that the transition to zero-carbon transport will require a whole-of-system approach.  We need to see much more active travel - walking, cycling, etc. - and increased use of public transport.  However, there is likely be a strong desire for cars given the particular demographics and geography of Ireland.  Where this is the case, there are huge benefits in terms of both air quality and emissions from electric-powered vehicles.  In addition to private transport, significant volumes of both light and heavy freight continue to operate in the country but will eventually need to be decarbonised.  Electricity will therefore play an ever-increasing role here as battery performance improves and ever larger vehicles can be electrified.  Therefore, in time, more charging infrastructure will be required to support Ireland to reach the target of almost 1 million EVs on the road by 2030, as reasserted in the Climate Action Plan 2021.<\/p> <p>  The first round of climate action funding has been instrumental in delivering additional charging locations, improved reliability, faster charging times for drivers and a substantial reduction in carbon emissions.  The number of charging sessions on our system has tripled since the beginning of 2021 and we now reach approximately 70,000 sessions per month.<\/p> <p>  The ESB welcomes the recently published draft strategy, EV Charging Infrastructure Strategy 2022-2025.  We are delighted to have had the opportunity to participate in the workshops hosted by the Department of Transport and to input into the development of the strategy, as we are doing today.  ESB e-cars fully supports the strategy.  There is of course much work ahead to build on this important strategy, which we understand will be led by ZEVI, which is to be launched soon.  We look forward to collaboration with other stakeholders on developing the implementation plan to support the high-level strategy.  We note that while 80% of current EV charging is estimated to take place at home, this proportion will decrease over time as the EV fleet grows and the demographic of EV owners shifts.  In excess of 70% of EV owners are customers of ESB e-cars and we undertake regular customer surveys of our customer base.  The prioritisation of smart home charging from the end of 2022 represents a positive development and should, over time, help to alleviate pressure on the electricity grid at times of high demand.  The visibility that EV drivers will have of their charging profiles and energy demand will be further improved through smart meters, which will allow all customers to view their energy consumption in half hourly intervals.<\/p> <p>  Destination charging is a complex topic with widely varying dwell times depending on the situation and location.  The strategy must allow for a variety of charging approaches depending on the situation, which typically requires case-by-case analysis.<\/p><p>We welcome the statement that the new ZEVI office will place a renewed strategic focus on delivering high-powered public charge points in heavily trafficked areas and along key parts of the national road network.  Based on our analysis, we have already seen that demand for higher speed top-up charging is increasing with a greater number of electric vehicles on the road.  It is unclear from the strategy as to whether local fuel stations that are not located on primary or motorway routes will be included for future funding rounds nor is it clear whether they will be classified as destination or <i>en route<\/i>charging.  There are several hundred petrol stations across Ireland so clarity would be welcome around the treatment of these locations and whether these assets will be included in future funding rounds.<br\/><br\/>ESB e-cars would like to work with all relevant stakeholders to accelerate the timeline for the development of a pathway for the delivery of high-powered <i>en route<\/i>charging infrastructure on the strategic road network.  This is currently due for delivery in quarter 2 of 2023.  Earlier certainty on the requirement for this critical infrastructure will in turn allow for more infrastructure to be delivered within the period of this strategy.  The sooner we have the strategy, the sooner we can deliver on these goals.<br\/><br\/>Further clarity could be provided on the destination charging point schemes funding, including who is eligible to apply.  In addition, while individual landowners can apply for grant funding and then choose to run and operate the sites on an individual basis, this would have obvious implications for interoperability across the network.  ESB e-cars would welcome the opportunity to input into a set of key criteria for EV charging locations.<br\/><br\/>Ease of use and charge point interoperability will be a key enabler to mass adoption.  Electronic payments should become the default option at all charging locations.  EU regulations will likely require this in time.<br\/><br\/>We note that the ESB Networks&rsquo; Dingle Project was successful in assessing EV uptake and attitudes to EVs in rural areas.  The findings from the study were particularly informative from an EV perspective.  Of particular interest was that the average daily distance driven was approximately 80 km and the willingness of customers to embrace and harness the new EV technology made available under the trial.  Our existing charger network in Kerry saw an increased utilisation during the trial period and led to the roll-out of additional high-powered charging hubs in County Kerry.<br\/><br\/>The working groups and taskforce outlined by the strategy form a key part of driving towards delivery.  It is crucial to engage stakeholders from across the full spectrum of consumers, industry experts, original equipment manufacturers, and the public and private sectors.  ESB e-cars and other charging point operators should be facilitated in each of the working groups as much as possible because much of the delivery learnings have been acquired by these companies in recent years.<br\/><br\/>Most of the supports mentioned in the strategy are primarily capital driven.  While capital investment is most welcome and required by the industry, due consideration should also be given to providing early support to charge point operators to contain operating costs.  The period between now and 2025 is a particularly challenging period while national demand for EVs grows.  A moratorium on capacity costs at locations with high electrical capacity requirements should be explored and implemented where possible.<br\/><br\/>ESB has made a significant commitment over the past decade to support and encourage the transition to zero carbon transport and EVs on a universal basis.  ESB e-cars has grown to become the leading provider of EV charging infrastructure across Ireland.  We will continue to play a central role in the provision of ever faster, ultra-reliable charging infrastructure across Ireland over the next decade.  The electrification of transport and empowering and supporting customers and communities to achieve net zero will remain a key component in ESB&rsquo;s strategy and commitment over the next decade.<br\/><br\/>Mr. John Byrne and I are happy to address any questions that committee members may have at this time. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Suzanne Ward","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":830,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Ward.

There are a couple of reasons behind that, one of which is the need to provide EV charging infrastructure for people who do not have access to their own driveway.  I would not anticipate that the rates would be quite as cheap as home charging but we want to be able to provide a slower charge at lower rates when people can charge at night so it does not become prohibitively expensive for them to charge their EV.  Local authorities as road authorities in Ireland have control over that local and regional road network.  That is step one where we see them being a key partner.<\/p> <p>  Step two is that local authorities themselves are often landowners and own land with significant public car parking space, whether that is municipal offices, leisure centres or libraries.  We would see those types of publicly accessible car parks as being ideal locations for destination charging.  We have identified in the strategy that we would anticipate working very closely with local authorities in rolling out that.  In the context of the strategy we have identified that we would support local authorities through providing funding for them to identify what we would call a local area charging network.  That could be done on a regional basis with a number of local authorities, or if there is one very large local authority they might do one just for them.  That would identify the locations where one might have the neighbourhood charging and the destination charging in that local authority area.  It would identify an implementation plan about the prioritisation and the series in which these would be rolled out.  On that basis, we would have a sense of the right size and the right fit for EV chargers in that local authority area with regard to the public and State-owned lands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#G00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aoife O'Grady"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":838,"content":"<p>Returning to step one, in my constituency and throughout the country, and particularly in housing estates that were built less than 20 years ago, homes would have no front gardens but would have parking bays at the front.<\/p><p>Many people feel excluded from getting on board with EVs.

The grant provides &euro;600 towards the installation of the charger.  There may be a need for upgrading in the home for various reasons.  It might not be just because of the electric car.  The authority on the safe operation of electricity in the home, Safe Electric, makes sure that chargers are only installed in safe situations.  The grant is only for the charging infrastructure.  It is not for upgrading the wiring because is not within the remit of the programme.  Perhaps it is something that could be discussed in the future but it is not covered.  There are varying costs, but a charger and its installation would cost in or around &euro;800 to &euro;1,000.  The &euro;600 grant goes towards the cost of that.  The need for upgrading and additional wiring varies across different homes.  The cost of that varies depending on the age of the home.<\/p> <p>  If I could step back in terms of the first questions on EVs and the charging of EVs, I will allow Mr. Brennan to come in on the point of the home charging.  Why are EVs good for Ireland?  One, we can supply the fuel ourselves by generating it locally.  Therefore, local fuel supply can provide security of supply.  Two, we have relatively short distances to travel.  Cars now have a range of 400 km, which will cover anywhere in the country where we need to go, so they are ideal in this situation.<\/p> <p>  Where do we expect charging to be done?  We expect 80% of that will be done at home.  The phrase I have used before is, \"You charge when you are stopped.  You do not stop to charge.\"  It is not like a splash-and-dash at home and then get the fuel and the groceries and all of that.  It is a different mindset.  People will be planning their journey and saying whether they need a splash-and-dash for three or four minutes just to get me through those last few kilometres and then charge it when the car is sitting at home overnight.  That is why the home charging infrastructure and working with those hard to reach dwellings, such as apartments and others, are so critical as part of the strategy.  I will allow Mr. Brennan to speak about the piece of work we are doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Meally"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":843,"content":"<p>In terms of feedback, has Mr. Brennan heard that the extra electrical work is prohibitive for people getting the infrastructure in place?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#H00500","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":844,"content":"<p>There are a number of human factors here that we need to think about.  Electricians are being asked to go to homes and they have it in their heads that the installation of a charger is a fixed piece of work costing &euro;1,200.  When they go to a house, they are supposed to check the wiring that is there.  If they find the wiring to be undersized, according to the rules, they are supposed to upgrade the wiring.  Is that always happening?  Is the electrician saying that it is fine because it has done the homeowner for the past eight years?  There is an opportunity with the roll-out of smart meters.  While ESB Networks are changing the meters, there is a chance to figure out how many places need upgrading.  The rule of thumb is that if a house was built before 1996, there is a risk that the wiring is low in that regard.  I have not seen that become a major issue, but we are starting to see it because we are inquiring about it.  We are hearing of more cases where wiring is being upgraded with ESB Networks and Safe Electric.<\/p> <p>  On the point about the hardest cases for people who live in urban areas, such as Rathmines, being to get supply across a footpath, there are two solutions we are looking at.  One solution is to place a gully in the ground, and the other is to have an overhanging arm.  People are trying these solutions but everybody is afraid of the liability and questioning if it is within planning laws.  If we could get those questions answered, we would include them in the grant scheme and, thereby, widen our net.<\/p> <p>  The forecourt guys have a very small footprint, so they are worried about the size of all the charging equipment.

There are so many variables feeding into it.  Let us assume that between 70% to 75% of homes could have access to home charging.  If all of those homeowners use overnight home charging, they would always leave their home with a battery that is charged to 80%.  In new vehicles, that would provide a 300 km to 400 km journey.  For most trips in Ireland, that would mean they would not need to top up unless it is a very long distance.<br\/><br\/>We want to put in charging points at places that are convenient for people to use.  We heard that a 50 kW charging point takes between 45 and 50 minutes to provide an 80% top-up.  People are not going to stop and charge somewhere and sit for 45 to 50 minutes.  Our plan is to put that type of charging unit in or around trip destinations, where people are going anyway for a purpose.  It is either a supermarket, library, sports club, or swimming pool.  While they are there, they can charge their vehicle and it is ready to go when they come out.  There is also the <i>en route <\/i>charging, which is done for very long distance journeys.<br\/><br\/>What we have is a system whereby we know how much power the cars that we want to have on the roads in 2030 will require.  The challenges and difficulties are in analysing how that will be divided between the different types of charging and the different kilowatts.  The alternative fuel infrastructure regulation, AFIR, proposal is coming through the EU at present, which will set a mandatory regulation for the provision of high-powered charging along the trans-European transport network, TEN-T, core and additional motorway network.  That has to be done regardless of what we think our modelling needs.  That will be an EU regulation.<br\/><br\/>Over the coming six to 12 months, we plan to work with local authorities to identify what they have within their power to do, both in the context of neighbourhood charging and destination charging.  We will also launch destination charging schemes by the end of this year for sporting organisations so that people can have them in sports clubs.<\/p><p>We expect that through this process, we will get a sense over time of where the charging will go, the power that will be attached to it and then we will see where the gaps are.  It is an incremental process.<\/p><p> The other factor that is changing is that the battery lives of the vehicles are improving all the time.  Ten years ago, when we were starting out, one got 200 km to 250 km on a charged battery.  This year, most of the vehicles that are new to the market are giving 400 km to 500 km, with some coming in at 700 km.  In five years time, a 700 km range on the battery may be standard for a vehicle in Ireland, which will cover almost any single journey a driver might want to make.  This means that if drivers have access to a home charger, they will not need to top up elsewhere.<\/p><p> The issue is very complicated, with a lot of variables and assumptions.  It is impossible to say at this point what we will need by 2030.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#H00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aoife O'Grady","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":849,"content":"<p>Following on from that, we can potentially see a scenario in which, as the quality of batteries and chargers improve, a huge amount of the charging will happen at home.

It is the notion that the State will say, \"Here is the infrastructure\", and people will go out and use it.  Does that happen?

Anecdotally, from talking to people I know, they keep telling me their next car will be an EV because the infrastructure is not there at the moment.  They are not yet ready to make the commitment but they will be in a few years.  Part of that might be perception and the sense they need to see every forecourt with an EV charger.  There may be a need for a mind shift in drivers towards the idea of home charging.  People may not yet be able to visualise that.<\/p> <p>  There are pressures arising from oil costs and fuel demands that will nudge people towards purchasing EVs now there is availability of longer-range batteries.  Even without a home charger, a long-range battery might only need to be charged once a week or once a fortnight.  The cost of purchasing and running an EV will be weighed up in terms of the cost of electricity.  There is an awareness that the resale value of an internal combustion engine, ICE, vehicle will dive in a few years' time.  People know the shift is coming.  Approximately 22% of all cars sold in Ireland in the first few months of this year were sold with a plug attached.  Colleagues in Oslo tell me that was the tipping point for them.  Once they hit 20%, they got to 80% in approximately four to five years.  I do not whether that will happen in Ireland because we have other issues in terms of costs and we also have supply chain issues at the moment.  However, in terms of consumer perception, once we get to one fifth of the fleet being electric, everyone recognises that now is the time to move.

For instance, most people feel they would need to charge their cars on a more regular basis than is the case.

Some of the relevant inputs would be the traffic volumes and flows at a particular site, the capacity and speed of the infrastructure and whether the flows and location will support that infrastructure.  Another factor is the space that is available on the site.  Typically, the space that is required for EV charging infrastructure, depending on the scale of the operation we plan to build at a site, can be excessive.  It requires planning permission in many cases.  In some locations, space can be at a real premium, particularly in heavily urbanised areas.

There are headwinds coming our way that we did not anticipate in 2021 in the form of the global supply chain shortages.

The supply chain shortages started with Covid and the container shortages and then there were the shutdowns in China leading to low factory production.  Now we have the war in Ukraine adding additional layers in.  At the moment we are not quite sure when those shortages are going to be relieved and when we might get back to business as usual in the supply of EVs to the market.

I have a few points I want to make and will not take ten minutes.<\/p> <p>  There is an element of the chicken and the egg to all this.  Some people, ideologically, were willing straight away when the first generation of EVs became available to throw the car keys out the window and buy an EV; however, others were less willing.  For some people it must make economic sense and there must be an infrastructure, so there is a bit of a pioneering element to all this.  I am probably in that bracket.  I cycle and I take the train to the D&aacute;il but I have a diesel car for getting around Clare.  To be honest, I do not yet trust there is enough infrastructure on the ground and there are an awful lot of people like that.  They will wait until the infrastructure is there before making that seismic shift in how they live their lives.  That is the chicken and egg aspect.  A forecourt owner in the county told me it would cost him &euro;500,000 per fast charging unit in his forecourt.  He said a diesel or petrol pump costs virtually nothing because they all have tanks underground and with some of the larger companies the forecourt operators virtually pay for the pumps.  It is not so with fast chargers.  To Dr. O'Grady and Ms Waller, are there any incentives to get forecourts transitioning to this?  I cannot move and more people cannot do so unless the infrastructure is in the forecourt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#K02600","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":882,"content":"<p>We are aware of that problem.

The issues there are really to do with the grid connection and the grid upgrades and what needs to be done to facilitate fast charging, especially in rural Ireland where you may be well away from the power network and substations.  The infrastructure strategy proposes we set up a public-private forum because this is somewhere we need to work in partnership with the private sector.  We are aware a level of State funding supports will be required.  The question is what is the right size and amount for that and where does it go.  My feeling is it goes into the grid and the network upgrades needed to deliver energy to particular forecourts.  Then we come back to the question of what is the strategic location for the State and where do we provide those grid upgrades.  We are not going to be able to provide them to every forecourt operator.  The need will not be the same.  We have described home charging already.  I am sure the majority of people, especially in Clare, will have access to a driveway and a home charger.  If we imagine the majority of the population will be able to charge their vehicle at home there will absolutely be a need for public charging but it will not be the same as at the moment where everyone is reliant on forecourts for refuelling.  There will be a piece of work ongoing and we have already had very strong engagement with Fuels for Ireland and different forecourt operator-managers to try to assess what is needed and where the support should go.

What we are seeing is that as more people own an electric car and then speak to their neighbours about it, people are getting that information and trying out an electric car.  The reality is that, as we stated, 80% or more of charging will be done at home.  The person will have a car that will take him or her 400 km or 500 km around County Clare.  Most people overestimate the journeys they are doing and underestimate the cost they are paying for fuel.  The decision to make that jump from diesel or petrol to an electric car starts to come with seeing EVs on the road, picking up the information from neighbours and friends and then realising that if a car has a range of 400 km or 500 km, it will only have to be charged once or twice a week and that it will only be charged at home.  The cheapest tariff one can get for charging the car is to do so overnight at home.  Those are the decisions people make before deciding which car they want.  There are many people now who want to switch but cannot do so because of the supply chain constraint.

When a person buys a house, he or she has a good idea how energy efficient it is and how well it heats and cools and everything else.  When it comes to cars, there is the national car test, NCT, and one can look at the service record of the car.  When it comes to electric cars, however, one needs to know the grade of battery the car has.  That needs to be graded in some way,  including across the years of car usage.  Plant machinery is gauged in hours.  If one looks on <i>donedeal.ie<\/i>, one will see advertisements for diggers or tractors that have clocked up a certain number of work hours clocked.  To my knowledge, however - I hope our guests can contradict me on this - there is no database for some kind of national registry that grades car batteries in the second and third years of usage so that the buyer of a second-hand car knows what he or she is buying.

It is a good question.  How does one convey battery ageing to the consumer?  In the early days, as a Nissan Leaf, for example, aged, it lost a bar on the display.

They know the battery will lose 1% or 2% of its storage each year.  One is not seeing that because the manufacturers are compensating for it and to cover themselves in the context of the warranty.  EVs usually have an eight-year warranty, approximately, for the battery.  I am not aware of anyone having explained a standard test.   That should go into the homologation process for the cars.

Really, with what we are trying to do, again, the difficulty comes into what we know is the total energy demand.  What we need to try to work out is how to break that down into how much of that energy demand will be apportioned by our 7 kW or lower charges and how much will be done.  Will an overnight or six-to-eight-hour charge typically be done at a place of residence or maybe a workplace during the day?  Then, we have destination chargers, which would be 25 kW to 50 kW, when a person would be charging from anywhere between 45 minutes to two to three hours.  The idea there is to try to match that to consumer behaviour.  That is the big challenge for EV infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  Previously, all our vehicle refuelling has been on the basis that a person stops for five minutes, refuels, pays and goes.  Now, what we are trying to do is match our infrastructure to consumer behaviour.  Therefore, where people's cars will dwell for a long period of time, either at their home or place of work if they commute by car, we will provide a low-power charge or recommend a low power charge in terms of grid capacity.  It is also better for the vehicle anyway.  Then, where people have a shorter dwelling time of one to three hours but again, not a quick splash and dash, we would be talking about 25 kW to 50 kW.  Then, for real emergencies like when a person is on the motorway and the battery starts blinking with 150 km to go, that is when the splash and dash is needed.  That person just pops in, refuels for maybe five to ten minutes, gets 150 km on the charge and makes his or her way to the destination.  That is the challenge.  It is about getting the right level of power in the right place to meet consumer needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#M01800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aoife O'Grady"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":918,"content":"<p>That is it, and also to deal with people like myself who are incredibly disorganised and might not necessarily have charged the night before.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#M01900","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":919,"content":"<p>There is that.

We are in the world we need to be in.  The big thing, which is almost a repeat of what was said earlier, and I am hearing about pilots and all the rest, is how we facilitate home-charging units for people who do not have that.  Could I get a bit of detail in relation to the over-hanging arm and anything else that is being looked at?  I refer to multi-unit chargers within estates and everything else.  It is the fact of actually being able to secure and control them and all the rest of it, and regular wear and tear combined with not so regular wear.  Unfortunately, we have regular cases whereby stuff that is left unattended can be damaged, which creates its own difficulty.<\/p> <p>  If we are talking about local authorities then, a guy approached me previously and he was quite straight in a sense.  He was selling cars and said he would like to sell more EV.  He did not believe - whether this was fair is something I will chase up over the summer - that there was sufficient level of interest from the local authority in County Louth.

The State is now stepping into a space in which State activity or intervention has never been needed.  For local authorities then, this is not something with which they are tasked or in which they are skilled or have expertise.  We have been working with some local authorities who are out ahead of the game.  Tipperary County Council has been engaging with us.

It has been doing very well on that.<\/p> <p>  There are two steps in terms of local authorities.  I think there is a recognition from local authorities, certainly from all the ones to which we have spoken.  We have spoken at local authority conferences as well.  There is a recognition of the need to step into this space.  The questions then are what resources they need to do this job properly, what supports we can give them from central government, on which we are working with them, and what they need to do.<\/p><p>We would look at piloting a number of charging options for people without access to a driveway.  Lamp-post charging is running as a pilot in Fingal County Council and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  We are looking at what is happening in other cities around Europe.  Amsterdam has a nice model whereby people who purchase an EV make the city authority aware of this.  If they have access to a driveway, it is not an issue.  Really we are talking about people living in towns and cities or in villages with on-street access.  The city authority does a scan.  If there is an EV charger within 250 m of where people live that is vacant for more than 50% of the time, the authority says that people are fine.  That 250 m is built in because it has to be convenient.  If there is no EV charger within 250 m, people are prioritised for delivery.  If there is a charger within 250 m which is occupied for more than 50% of the time, the authority concludes that there is insufficient infrastructure and maps it.<\/p><p> We are working with local authorities.  Through the infrastructure strategy, we have proposed setting up a public sector delivery group which would involve them.  It is about working out the right way to do this.  Some local authorities do not want to put in on-street charging on streets because they also want to put in active travel routes beside the kerb, so that is a challenge.  There is the option of charging hubs.  Our key aim is to have infrastructure that is convenient to and used by people.  If we have infrastructure within 200 m or 300 m of where people live, that is ideal.  It does not have to be on-street.  A hub is also fine.  We will test a mix of different options over the next year or two.

My colleague referred to that.  There have been many discussions with local authorities about those pilots, including D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  The issue with street lights is that they do not receive sufficient energy to power the EV chargers.  We need to look at whether there are trickle opportunities to use this model.  Street lights are not metered, so a meter cabinet has to be installed.  There are some technical, regulatory and physical issues that are being worked on with the local authorities.  Fingal and the other Dublin authorities have come up with a strategy.  They have been looking at options for charging hubs.<\/p> <p>  We believe the grant incentives are where they should be.  We, the Department and the Minister constantly review them to determine what should be upgraded.  We have changed the incentives over the years.  We started off providing commercial and private grants.  The commercial grant was dropped because there was an opportunity for benefit-in-kind and there was no need for an additional incentive.  As battery electric vehicles now have a longer range, we did not need to incentivise plug-in hybrids, which already had an ICE.  The idea is for the funding available from the Government to target battery electric vehicles.  The &euro;5,000 currently there is constantly under review.  It will not be there forever.  There should be price parity with petrol and diesel vehicles in 2024 or 2025.  The cost of running, buying and servicing an internal combustion engine is higher than an electric car.  It is cheaper to run an electric vehicle.  We are aiming to incentivise the markets.<\/p> <p>  We have changed the grant schemes over the last couple of years.  They were online.  The home grant applications are much easier and more straightforward online.  They can be processed relatively quickly.  It used to be that it took up to ten days to approve a grant for vehicle charges.  That is now instant.  Somebody would have to come in, look at a car, go away to think about it, get a grant offer and then come back in again.  A dealer can now get grant approval immediately when the customer is on the forecourt.  All of those changes have happened following a series of developments in the grant scheme.

They have told me that EVs are great for urban driving but are not good on motorways because if one drives at any sort of high speed they burn into the battery.  In many cases, one cannot drive long distances.  Taxi drivers have tested EVs in great depth.  How far are we behind technology-wise in reaching a point where the average person can buy an EV car in the full knowledge that he or she can travel from Dublin to Limerick or Cork without fear and will not be required to stop at junction 14, which is what many people must do now?

The EU INTERREG VA programme between academic institutions and local authorities is providing funding of &euro;6.4 million for a project.  I do not want to put the witnesses on the spot.  I am fascinated by it, given our interaction with local authorities.  What will that funding be used for?  Is it part of an academic exercise?  Have we drawn it down?  The witnesses can come back to the committee with a note on it if they do not have the answer.  This is mentioned on page 45 of the strategy.  I am curious to learn what it is about.  The strategy states: \"The Ireland-specific part of the project aims to fund up to 40 fast charge points in various locations on both sides of the Border with a target date for delivery of May 2023.\"  Is that funding being delivered?

I still think it goes back to what Tom Cruise said about showing the people the money.  People like to have a few bob more.  If we can demonstrably show them in real terms that they are saving a chunk of money by investing in an EV in comparison to traditional cars, that will help make the change.  The Minister for Transport was criticised for suggesting that people should slow down when they are driving.  He was not far wrong, but it did not suit the narrative at the time for him to say that.

I told my wife that I had always wanted to drive the Ring of Kerry.  I set my satnav and started driving.  I drove for a while and the satnav instructed me to take the next left.  I took the next left and continued on.  The road started to get narrower and narrower until there was grass in the middle of it.  I wondered how a bus would get around the area, because it was crazy.  I was thinking, as I was driving in my internal combustion car, how I would feel if I was in an electric car.  I was in the middle of nowhere.  I kept reassuring my lady wife that it was all right and I knew where I was going.  I did not have a clue if I was ever going to get out of the place.  I have difficulty with the idea of using EVs in rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I want to raise a few issues.  My colleague Senator Buttimer mentioned that in 2009, we were told by the Government to go out and buy diesel cars because it was the only way to live.  God help us, but so many families have been stuck with diesel cars that they cannot get rid of because it was the wrong decision to make.  Right now, we are in a transition period in respect of energy.  We are talking about EVs today.  We could be talking about hydrogen vehicles tomorrow.  Who knows what other technology is coming along?  I am a bit concerned about the amount of money that we are putting into the infrastructure.  We may learn, at some stage in the future, that we have gone in the wrong direction and we should have gone down the hydrogen route or somewhere else.  In my own driving experience, I have moved from petrol to liquified petroleum gas, LPG; from LPG to diesel; from diesel back to LPG; and from LPG back to petrol.  I have learned that if you drive slowly and carefully, you can save quite a lot of money.  That comes with age.  I am a little concerned that we might be heading in the wrong direction.  <\/p> <p>  There is another issue that I am concerned about, and I would be interested in hearing the witnesses' views on it.  How ethical is the mining of the raw material for the batteries of EVs?  It is all very well for me to get into my big 4x4 EV in Dublin, the manufacturing of which probably emitted as much carbon as would be emitted twice in the lifetime of the vehicle itself.  However, if the battery came from children mining in darkest Africa, where are we going with saving the planet?  Are we saving the planet at the cost of thousands of lives in these places?  That is one of the areas that I would like to touch upon.<\/p> <p>  I will mention another area I would like to touch on.  I have been living a bachelor's life for the last two weeks because my wife and daughter have Covid, so I am living in my son's house.  The hot water system is heated by solar panels.  It is absolutely fantastic.  I have never had such hot water that is available at all times.  Is there any chance we could use solar panels to charge our cars at home?  Would that require some retrofitting to be done to homes?<\/p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned night rates.  In County Louth, very interesting work is being done by EnergyCloud at the moment.  It is very innovative.  Energy that is generated at night, which is of no value to anybody to heat water in houses, is used.<\/p> <p>  Going back to the cost of charging EVs, I am interested in the figure of &euro;10 per 400 km.  I have two relations who switched to EVs recently.  They are both complaining that their ESB bills are through the roof.  I am not sure how they are being charged.  Perhaps Mr. Meally knows whether there is an opportunity to expand the work of EnergyCloud into vehicle charging.  I will leave it at that for the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#P01000","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":992,"content":"<p>I can respond to a few of the Senator's questions.  On the hydrogen versus battery debate, when a hydrogen fuel cell is used and is made from electricity, the round-trip efficiency is 50%.  If that is done by battery, the efficiency is around 87%.  If we are using electricity in both cases, hydrogen will always lose to a battery, economically.  We find that all of the manufacturers are making battery EVs.  For the cars, the feeling is that the batteries have it.  There is ten years of development in EVs.  The price of fuel cell vehicles is around &euro;50,000 at the moment.  That is where EVs were ten years ago.  No one is really building infrastructure for fuel cell vehicles.  When we move up in scale, there is even uncertainty as to whether hydrogen will work for heavy vehicles such as trucks.  It looks like the medium-sized vans will all be electric.  The trend is certainly there.  It is based on efficiencies.  Around 40 battery factories are being built in Europe now, so there will be tonnes and tonnes of battery production capacity in Europe.  Hydrogen is probably better suited for aviation.  It might also work very well in electrolysis for grid storage and perhaps in shipping.  Those are the niche areas where it can be used.<\/p> <p>  On mining, cobalt mining is the big issue.  Around 60% of that comes from Congo.  On the evolution of the technology, all the manufacturers, including Tesla, are planning to stop using cobalt.<\/p><p>They are replacing it with nickel.  Tesla is boasting that already some of its vehicles have stopped using cobalt.  There is also battery recycling to get the cobalt back.  The evolution of the battery has moved to lithium and sulphur.  This is possibly all there will be in the batteries in future.  There is tonnes of lithium around and sulphur is fairly cheap.  This is probably where it will go.<\/p><p> The point on EnergyCloud is a very good one.  We are switching the home charger programme so that we will only fund smart chargers.  The smart meter and the smart charger are separate entities.  Smart meters tell people how much energy they are using every 15 minutes.  Based on this, the supplier can decide to give them a package.  With a smart charger, if someone knows the price of energy will plummet because the amount of wind on the system that night will be enormous, they can use a smart charger to charge.  This is how it is evolving.  We will see it emerging.  The smart charger is essential.  I will leave the point on photovoltaic energy for someone else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#P01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Graham Brennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":994,"content":"<p>The whole idea with solar, as with EnergyCloud, is the smart use of energy.  Smart meters will allow this.  Cars are coming out with batteries that will be able to contribute to the grid.  At times when energy is needed, it can be taken from the cars.  If there was a storm in Kerry a car could power a house for two or three days.  This is the battery capacity.  The vehicle-to-grid technology that is coming will allow the energy to go two ways.<\/p> <p>  The solar panels on the house are for solar thermal energy that heats the water through a circuit.  Photovoltaic solar energy generates electricity.  If a car is parked outside the house during the day it provides an opportunity to charge the car with the energy straight from the sun.  Our grant schemes can be availed of in any home, ideally those that are south facing.  The opportunities for home energy systems include not only charging a battery but also running a heat pump and feeding the energy system.  The system is getting smarter.  EnergyCloud particularly looks at low-income homes and putting hot water into the cylinders and topping them up at night.  Generally, many of the issues to be addressed in these areas are regulatory as opposed to technical.<\/p> <p>  I have driven around the Ring of Kerry.  We can now see with an app where the charge points are, whether they are being used and the cost of charging.  Drivers look at the fuel gauge, the range and how far it is to the nearest charger.  People will not go out with fumes in the tank to do the Ring of Kerry.  They will make sure they have enough charge to get around.  They will make sure they know on the app where the charge points are.  They will know whether to go to the hotel they are staying in for an overnight trickle charge to be ready to go again the next day, or to a fast charger in the town.  All of this information is on the system.<\/p> <p>  To go back to the general point on taxi drivers and others, we have to rethink our use of transport as well as our use of energy.  People talk about the journey from Dublin to Cork but how often do they make that journey?  Are they thinking about the car they are using and the longest journey they would ever do?  Are they thinking about what they do five or six days a week? We have seen that 80% of the journeys carried out are less than 80 km long.  For a journey from Cork to Dublin people could drive to the train station in Cork, hop on the train and then use a bike to get around Dublin.  When they return to Cork, the car is charged.  People must think about the best way to use transport.  Cars will now allow us to go for 400 km.  The faster people drive on the motorway, the more energy they will use.  It is the same with petrol or diesel.  The heavier people are with the foot the more they will use from the fuel tank.  It is about getting used to this behavioural change.  The taxi drivers in Dublin to whom we have spoken who use the cars and who have received very generous grants are saving &euro;300 a week on average in fuel costs.

I do not want to cut across Mr. Meally.  For the average person an electric car is on the horizon but it is over the horizon.  People do not see it as immediate.

The average person might only do a long journey a couple of times a year but they want certainty.  If I am on fossil fuel, I can pull in along the motorway and get diesel or petrol.  There are factors and reliability.  The devil is always in the detail.  This is an aside.

I said to a friend of mine that I wondered why they were driving the vehicles.  He said that when they bought the vehicles, they got a pair of wellingtons too.  They would go to the ploughing championship once a year to try out four-wheel drive.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in what Dr. O'Grady said about early adapters.  People adapted to electric vehicles before they were quite ready and before the market had settled in.  When I bought a car recently, I was mindful about buying a dual fuel or hybrid vehicle.  The salesman in the garage told me not to.  He said that the battery is too heavy for it and it causes a problem with the suspension in the car.  Even though my car has an internal combustion engine, it has all the technology to tell me when I am saving fuel.  The difference between 120 km\/h and 100 km\/h is amazing when it comes to the cost of running it.  Not every family wants to buy a great big four-wheel drive vehicle.  For the average family to buy a little Yaris to run around in or a small electric car the cost is still too high.  We have to do something if we are serious about moving in this direction.<\/p> <p>  Another problem we have is that people tend to change their cars every three or four years.  This will become a problem.  The carbon cost of manufacturing the car is probably 20 years.  How many 20-year-old cars do we see on the road?  There are very few.  A lot of education and a lot of cultural change must take place.  Is the Department doing anything about this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#Q00400","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":997,"content":"<p>We are doing a lot.  We always need to do more.  The average family in Ireland does not purchase a new vehicle.  The people in Ireland who purchase new vehicles are a very small minority of the population when we look at the overall car fleet and how many new vehicles are purchased every year.  To get to the average family in Ireland we need a second-hand EV fleet.  We are only now hitting the point of EV sales when we will see EVs coming through to the second-hand fleet.  At present there is a very small second-hand fleet in Ireland.  They tend to be much older vehicles with significant battery degradation.  We need to keep new vehicle sales coming through so that they follow through to the second-hand market two or three years later.  The average family will then be able to purchase a three-year-old EV with a high-quality battery.  Many of the vehicles now have battery warranties for seven to eight years.  People will have security of mind and will know they will get another five years out of the battery.<\/p> <p>  I chair the EV policy pathway implementation group.  A subgroup of that group is looking at how to activate and generate the second-hand market for EVs in Ireland.  We have a challenge because many of this country's second-hand vehicles have traditionally come from the UK.  Brexit has meant significant additional taxation charges because the UK is outside the EU VAT system.  There are several elements to this.  Another challenge is that with Covid many vehicle leasing and rental companies stopped purchasing new vehicles.  This is one of the reasons we see such high car rental prices at present.  They do not have sufficient vehicle demand.<\/p><p>We are working to see if we can get an incentivisation for those leasing fleets to start purchasing EVs.  This is because, traditionally, those vehicles make their way into our second-hand market after two or three years.  Therefore, regarding cost and affordability, getting the second-hand market right will help.  The upfront cost of an EV is high.  Even with our grants, a significant gap still remains between the cost of some EVs and equivalent ICE-powered vehicles.  As more and more EVs come onto the market,, we will see those costs reduce.  They are still higher than those for vehicles with internal combustion engines, but within a year or two - given the running costs and the difference between the low cost of running an EV and the increasingly high cost of running a petrol or diesel car - people will get their money back within a few years.  This aspect will cause a switchover, as well as the cost of vehicles coming down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aoife O'Grady","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":999,"content":"<p>Is it foreseeable that a situation will ever arise where it will be possible for me to drive into a forecourt, open a little pocket in the side of my car, wheel out the used battery and wheel in a new battery and take off?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#R00200","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":1000,"content":"<p>Some vehicle manufacturers are piloting programmes where the batteries are rented.

How does this situation stand now?  How many charging points are in place?  What are the challenges in this context?
