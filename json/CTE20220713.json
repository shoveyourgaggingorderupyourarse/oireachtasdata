The Agreement on a Unified Patent Court, UPCA, is an international agreement treaty between 24 member states of the EU, including Ireland, setting up the UPC.  The UPC is an international court set up by participating EU member states to deal with the infringement and validity of unitary patents.  Ireland signed the UPCA in 2013.  The Attorney General has advised that a referendum is required to transfer the judicial powers from the domestic courts to the new international court.  Once the UPCA has been ratified, arrangements can be made a for a local division in Ireland.  The drafting of the Bill required is currently in the preliminary stages.  A decision on the timing of the referendum is a matter for Government.  <\/p><p> Today, I am pleased that we have the opportunity to consider these matters further with representatives from IBEC.  I welcome Mr. Aidan Sweeney, head of enterprise and regulatory affairs; and Mr. Naoise Gaffney, chair of the IBEC corporate intellectual property, IP, group and vice president of IP at GH Research Ireland.  <\/p><p> Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references that witnesses may make to another person in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected by absolute privilege pursuant to the Constitution and statute.  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p><p> The opening statements have been delivered to members.  To commence our consideration on this matter today, I invite Mr. Gaffney to make his opening remarks on behalf of IBEC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022071300002#A00200","speaker":"1509","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>A Chathaoirligh agus a bhaill an choiste, go raibh maith agaibh as ucht an chuiridh labhairt libh inniu faoin Unified Patent Court.

I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss the UPC.  My name is Naoise Gaffney, and I am chair of the IBEC corporate IP group and vice president of IP for GH. Research.  I am also an adjunct professor of patent law at Trinity College Dublin.  I am joined by Aidan Sweeney, IBEC's head of enterprise and regulatory affairs.  We are here today to talk about the UPC, the referendum that is required before Ireland might participate in the system, and why, in our view, it is important that the committee gives due consideration and scrutiny to this matter.  We would like to ensure that the country does not miss out on the substantial opportunities for economic growth the UPC presents.  IBEC welcomed the Government&rsquo;s recent reconfirmation of Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the UPC.  It sent an important message to other countries, as well as international investors, that Ireland is determined to be fully involved in the UPC.  While progress on the UPC had stalled across Europe due to Brexit and some legal issues in Germany, these issues have now been resolved.  The pace has picked up considerably across Europe, with the new court on track to open its doors in early 2023, with or without Ireland.<\/p> <p>  To provide members with an overview of what it is all about, the UPC is one part of a two-part package that also includes the unitary patent.  This unified patent package will create a simpler and more efficient mechanism for obtaining and enforcing patents in Europe.  As part of this, the UPC will be a newly-established single court system under international agreement for pan-European patent litigation and enforcement.  It will ultimately have exclusive competence in respect of infringement and validity of all patents granted by the European Patent Office, EPO.  By way of reference, most patents currently in force in Ireland have been granted by the EPO, which is a centralised European clearing house for patents.  The Intellectual Property Office of Ireland, IPOI, based in Killkenny, has similar competence.  However, most of the activity from a patent perspective tends to go through the EPO.  The unified patent package is needed simply because the current European patent enforcement system does not work effectively for companies, and in particular for SMEs.  The current system of country-by-country patent protection.  Litigation is extremely expensive, time-consuming and resource-intensive.  Under the new system, there will be centralised mechanisms of both protection and enforcement.  This could be particularly beneficial to Irish SMEs.  SMEs tend to have only a few patents - if they have any at all.  These patents are likely to cover their core technologies, which are often their most valuable assets.  Under the existing system, getting pan-EU protection and enforcing those rights all the way across Europe can often be prohibitively expensive for such companies.  The new system would make this a more realistic prospect for them.  Having part of this new system based in Ireland would be further beneficial for these enterprises because they would be able to enforce their pan-European rights through an Irish based court rather than having to play away from home, as it were.  As we have alluded to already, it represents a significant opportunity for Ireland.  The business case for Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the UPC has gotten stronger since it was first examined almost a decade ago.  Ireland is uniquely positioned to establish itself on the international stage as a patent enforcement hotspot.  If done right, Ireland&rsquo;s participation could yield very substantial gains for the wider Irish economy - gains that would go far beyond an increase in legal services.  That point is important, so I would like to re-emphasise it.  If Ireland participates in the UPC in an effective fashion, the economy as a whole - not just legal services - stands to gain significantly.  <\/p> <p>  The UPC has been designed to comprise several local divisions across the contracting states.  It was decided that Ireland will host its own local division, subject to the referendum passing.  This was an important decision.  Infringement litigation will not be spread evenly across each local division, and forum shopping is to be expected.  Internal conversations are already under way in many large companies to select one location to establish their base for patent enforcement, and a variety of other corporate functions will co-locate to this base.  Ireland can compete for this investment, but to stand a chance of success, the local division must be established here in a timely fashion.  After Brexit, Ireland has two powerful and unique advantages over other UPC locations.  We should bear in mind that a lot of the patent litigation that will take place in the UPC will be global in nature and involve parties originating outside Europe.  Being able to litigate on a pan-European basis before a court with native English proficiency and common law experience is a big deal for many such parties, particularly for those from countries with their own common law traditions like the US.  Ireland can now take advantage of a marketplace the size of EU and combine it with the fact the country is a hub of patent-intensive industries, both multinational and indigenous.<\/p> <p>  Let us get to the figures.  An attractive and timely-established local division in Dublin will support the further expansion of the patent-intensive sectors across the country, creating jobs, benefiting SMEs and boosting Ireland&rsquo;s innovation performance. It is expected to contribute at least &euro;415 million, or 0.13% in GDP growth, per annum.  It could rise to as much as &euro;1.663 billion, or 0.5% in GDP growth.  In addition to the broad economic benefits to the wider economy, there will also be increased expenditure and employment in legal, professional, and other technical advisory services.  That is the prize that we can compete for at the moment, but we must play our cards right.  While Ireland stands to gain significantly through participating in this system, we will only be able to do so if we participate in a timely fashion.  Establishing a well-run and attractive local division that is ready to go when the UPC starts operating or very shortly thereafter will be key to competing for patent litigation to be heard before the Irish-based court.  A slow start to implementation will prove costly and prevent Ireland from making the fullest use of the potential of the unified patent system.  We should also bear in mind that there will likely be a period between holding a referendum and setting up a local division should the public agree to the establishment of the UPC.  That must be factored into the equation.  It is possible that an Irish local division could be established soon after it is launched by the initial 16 ratifying states, which will likely take place in early 2023, but it could also be as late as two years down the line.  This is likely to affect the attractiveness and take-up of the Irish local division.<\/p><p>Projections indicate that while patent litigation activities could still increase, albeit from the existing extremely low base, we might only get a quarter of the cases that would be available to a well-run, timely and attractive local division.  This translates into a significant opportunity cost.  While we have stated that there is between &euro;415 million and &euro;1.66 billion to play for, a conservative estimate is that a significant proportion of this will not be available to latecomers to the system.  It will be off the table.  We are happy to go into more detail on that if the committee wishes.  In addition, delayed ratification in Ireland clearly would benefit locations elsewhere.  Many of those expected to gain would be key competitor locations for foreign direct investment, FDI. <\/p><p> Prompt action is now required.  While the Government has committed to running a referendum on this issue in May 2024, if not before, it is IBEC&rsquo;s view that May 2024 is the absolute latest date that a referendum should be held and even then, it is at the risk of missing out on significant opportunities.  Should other issues be put to the people earlier, the referendum on the unified patent court, UPC, should absolutely be included.  Work on enabling legislation should resume.  Government should also convene an inter-departmental preparatory group on the UPC and work with external bodies, such as IBEC, to try to influence decisions on the UPC at European level and prepare the groundwork.<\/p><p> Ireland is not out of the running by any means.  We have a unique position within the UPC system that could benefit the system as a whole and be of significant advantage to the Irish economy.  What we are delivering today is a simple two-part message.  The first part is that there is a substantial opportunity here.  The second part is very important in that much of the opportunity is only available within a limited timeframe.  This is the reasoning behind IBEC&rsquo;s call for a clear timetable, which captures the urgency of the opportunity at stake.  I thank the committee for its attention.  We look forward to answering any questions or addressing any specific issues that members of the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022071300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Naoise Gaffney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>On the first page of IBEC's submission, it states \"these issues have now been resolved, and the pace has picked up considerably across Europe with the new court on track to open its doors in early 2023, with or without Ireland.\".  To a certain extent, while the subsequent part of the submission does not suggest so, the above suggests that the boat has sailed on this anyway and that things are moving much faster than the State would be capable of catching up with, given all of the constraints in the way of the referendum and everything else.  Referendums do not happen quickly.  They are not easy and they are expensive.  The likelihood is that any Government would want to wait until there were several together.  The timetable that is suggested here is one that seems to be moving an awful lot faster than we would be capable of catching up with.  Does Mr. Gaffney think there is scope for us to catch up?  He has said it is gathering pace.  I know this issue has been kicking about for a while.

It is a fair to suggest that Ireland may not be at the starting blocks when the gun goes off.  That is probably quite likely at this stage.  The question for us now is how far behind the starting line we will be.  That is, to some extent, within our control.  I take the Deputy's point about referendums not being run lightly.  Much preparation needs to go into them and considerable material needs to be produced to educate the electorate but, at the same time, we still have a degree of choice and control.  We alluded to the fact that it would potentially be problematic if Ireland joined two years down the line, but if we only joined a few months down the line, it may be less so.

Mr. Gaffney will be aware that there are well-accredited groups that have a view about that courts such as the UPC limit democratic freedoms and, crucially, interfere with the creation of things such as patent-free medicine.  We have had a debate at this committee, as I know the Committee on Health and others have, on the TRIPS waiver and how important it is to get those medicines, especially in the midst of a global pandemic.  Dr. Mike Ryan keeps saying nobody is safe until everybody is safe and that the medicines should be gotten to the people who need them.

I will answer by way of analogy.  What we are concerned with here, with regard to the UPC, is a transfer of existing judicial powers.  It is not the creation of a new regime.  It is just the transfer of powers from one forum to another.  To the extent that the UPC can be compared to something in the sporting arena, I suggest that what we are faced with at present is the opportunity to allow the Aviva Stadium to be used on a regular basis for the Champions League.  All we are talking about is the venue.  Many of the other issues, especially around access to patent-free medicines, relate to the fundamental rules of the patent game.  Those are about how one plays football.  We are not talking about how one plays football.  We are just talking about the stadium one plays in.  It is a fair criticism of a different issue.  I would be very careful not to conflate the two, because one has very little bearing on the other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022071300002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Naoise Gaffney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>My colleagues have been before this committee quite recently on the TRIPS waiver issue.  The TRIPS waiver and the UPC are two distinct, but important, issues.  The commonality is patent.  The UPC and the new unitary patent system concerns patents granted by the European Patent Office.  There is always a choice to use national patents and opt out of the regime.  It just happens that Ireland and Denmark are the only two countries that are required to have a referendum on this issue for legitimacy.  The European Court of Justice, ECJ, will be over the unified patent court.

Will Mr. Gaffney give us an example of the kind of money being talked about when he says it is expensive, relative to a SME?  Is it prohibitively expensive, to the point where people decide they cannot afford it and will not do it, or is it manageable?  One person's very expensive is another person's small change.  I ask for a frame of reference of how it would impact on SMEs, in particular.  We know from talking to them that they are under the cosh, not just in the moment, but in general.  The smaller the operation, the more likely it is to be under massive pressure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022071300002#C00700","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Whether the company is small or very large, patenting is typically a global game.  There are very few enterprises, even the smallest ones in Ireland, that would be content just with securing protection within the Irish market and not going further afield.  The desire here is to get protection in as many other markets as it might be reasonably foreseeable for one to look to do business in.<\/p> <p>  We are focused here on the reform of the European system, so I will answer the question with regard to Europe.  There is a centralised clearing house for the granting of patents called the European Patent Office, EPO.  The process to get to the point where the EPO would give one the thumbs up and say one can have a patent, is one chunk of cost.  However, the EPO does not grant a single patent that covers all of Europe and instead, it gives one the option to get individual national patents in all of the participating member countries.  That is where considerable cost tends to kick in.  The cost of engaging with the EPO up to that point is unavoidable and will not change, but the first real saving to be achieved is at the validation stage.<\/p><p>That is where one takes the thumbs-up and turns it into a real patent.  Every additional country that one would like to seek protection in could cost another &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,000.  A significant issue is translation into international languages.  That is on top of the initial sunk cost that one probably incurred, of between &euro;7,000 and &euro;15,000, to get to the point where the EPO has given a thumbs-up.  In every year in which one wishes to keep the patents in force, one has to pay each individual national patent office a premium.  That is designed to ensure there is not a backlog of patents that people do not want.  Things die if people will not pay to keep them alive.  The cost really bites in the context of enforcement.  No one wants to litigate but sometimes people need to defend their rights.  If they want to litigate in Europe, they need to do so in every jurisdiction where they have a patent in force.  They need to go to Germany, France and the Netherlands.  Each litigation will cost hundreds of thousands of euro.<\/p><p> Now, for the first time, there is an opportunity to just do that once rather than doing it five times in different jurisdictions.  It is expensive anyway and will potentially still be out of the reach of small and medium enterprises, SMEs, but thankfully the Unified Patent Court, UPC, system provides specific financial supports for SMEs to use the system.  It was the EU's intention to make this as accessible as possible to SMEs.  There are significant savings to be had on the litigation front too.  At present, many SMEs may only have one or two patents.  That may not be because they only have one or two technologies worth protecting but because those are the technologies SMEs can afford to protect.  If it gets cheaper, they will be able to protect more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022071300002#C00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Naoise Gaffney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Do we have any research on the number of companies that have just one or two patents which could scale the number up?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022071300002#D00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>About one in five multinational companies across Europe and about one out of every 100 SMEs has a patent.

Translation has a risk.  Members know, as policymakers, that mistakes can be made whenever a document is translated.  One could have a verifiable, enforced patent in one location, which might have been the UK in the past, but it might have been translated incorrectly due to language barriers or some minor point in France, after which it was struck down and the right to that protection was lost.

Milan is currently in the hot seat and, until recently, Amsterdam was also in contention.  Certainly it is IBEC's view that it would be fantastic if Ireland were able to make a pitch for that.  We believe it should.  There are many voices in Ireland that firmly believe that.<\/p> <p>  However, for the purposes of trying just to communicate a simple message, IBEC has focused first and foremost on communicating to our European partners as well as users of the system, to ensure that Ireland communicates to them that we are committed to the system generally and that we have a firm timetable for our own local division.  Walk before you can run.  We believe there might be something of a credibility gap if we start making bona fide noises now about why we should be entitled to the central division when we have not even given our partners a clear indication of how and when we plan to implement the local division.

I join Deputy Stanton in saying that this needs to happen very quickly.  I have experience of working in two companies in Ireland, in SMEs in the medical device area, where patenting was a particular problem.  Cost was the main issue in trying to do patents in different countries and trying to figure out where one could and could not protect them.  If anybody looks at this, particularly at the high end of business and intellectual property rights, it is important that we would be very proactive in this area.<\/p> <p>  I have a couple of questions.

Mr. Gaffney put a very high figure into his opening statement.  He said that if Ireland were to get the court, it would contribute &euro;1.663 billion per annum to GDP growth.  How has IBEC calculated that number?  What specific services or business sectors are the witnesses saying will benefit from having this located here?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022071300002#E01200","speaker":"1616","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":38,"content":"<p>In our report in the fourth quarter of last year we placed a separate figure on the value to the legal services industry, which we did not put in our opening statement because I had the unenviable task of trying to keep it to eight minutes.  That report was a 50-page document.  My colleague, Mr. Sweeney, can go into the figures in more detail, but the value is in the order of &euro;100 million or &euro;200 million, depending on the level of activity.  In my answer to some of Deputy Stanton's questions I said that the large figures we place on what it would mean for Ireland if we have a successful local division here have very much to do with the gravitational effect on the onboarding of additional corporate activity.  Typically speaking, from a multinational perspective, which I will deal with first, when it comes to locating certain parts and functions of an entity in different locations, there is a tendency to keep certain functions close to the nerve centre.  Even if a body's headquarters are in one country, sometimes there might be a cluster of significant individuals - not necessarily the key people but significant individuals all the same - in some other jurisdiction.  Some of the last functions to depart that nerve centre are on the corporate side.  IP management is one such function.  If, however, a decision is made to relocate IP management activities, it tends typically to bring a lot of other corporate activities along with it.  It is therefore not just IP managers one sees coming into the country as the result of a gravitational effect; there is an ancillary pull on a lot of other activities as well.  One may therefore find a lot of that nerve centre, not just the IP element, moving to Ireland.<\/p> <p>  A really good point was made about this opportunity being to a large extent potentially more valuable to Ireland after Brexit.  The UK made a significant contribution to the design of this system back in the day, before Brexit was even on the horizon.  As a result, going back to Mr. Sweeney's point earlier, the UPC was designed very much as a nice hybrid of the Commonwealth traditions of the English-speaking world and the civil law traditions of France and Germany and the countries clustered around them.  Ireland now has this opportunity to step into Britain's shoes.  I was on a panel at a meeting in London on intellectual property in the first quarter of this year at which I made that point and then went on to tell the audience that, of course, Ireland is not the UK and that we have been trying to make that point for about 800 years.  At the same time, there is now an opportunity for Ireland to step up and to play in the top tier and, going back to Mr. Sweeney's point, to contribute to the overall betterment of the system in a way we may not see if we step back, are passive about this and allow the system to proceed in such a way that, essentially, it just becomes a clone of the German system; that is, I think, the way German practitioners would like it because that is the system with which they are most familiar.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022071300002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Naoise Gaffney"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I will make one other point.  In the higher education sector in this country we hold an awful lot of intellectual property rights.  In some cases the property is patent-protected; in some cases it is not.  Commercial companies may be sought to come in to assist.  They might look at the IP in the context of commercialisation and see how that might be rolled out.  The first question becomes patenting, the cost and the protection and whether one's rights can be enforced.  For a lot of countries, including Ireland, as Mr. Gaffney said, this is a global business.  Smaller SMEs will not go to China.  They cannot.  It is very expensive to litigate in the US and very difficult to enforce one's rights, so smaller companies end up having to partner with bigger ones, probably multinationals.  They can fight that space.<\/p> <p>  There is a significant benefit to Ireland of the IP we hold within higher education.  I do not think Mr. Gaffney referred to this in his opening statement but I am sure IBEC is well aware of it.  I would like to see some coalescing of IBEC's strategy with higher education in understanding that we have an awful lot of IP that could be expressed commercially but has to be safeguarded in the first instance.  I do not even know if we have a good repository in this country to understand how many European patents we have sitting in abeyance.  As the witnesses will know, they have to be removed every number of years, and that costs money.  There is a body of work to be done on that.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Stanton said, this is a very important topic for the committee.  We absolutely need to speak to the Department and to ask that what IBEC is asking to be expedited is expedited and that we try to get this matter to a referendum as quickly as possible, get legislation through and get it decided on.

There are also potential policy innovations with the UPC and the new system that will benefit the higher education system in respect of potential grants or support for them to enforce their rights through the new courts.  They might cover their costs.  That was one of the proposals at the outset.  For us to have that message, we need to be at the table of the preparatory committee trying to put those issues forward for us.

We take the issue very seriously here in Europe for the very obvious reason that we must keep our citizens fed.  It is one of the primary expectations of our citizens that it can be ensured the public can have safe, high-quality and affordable food available to them.  It is the whole purpose of the Common Agricultural Policy, which has its basis in EU treaties.  It is one of the original objectives of the treaties because post-war Europe was suffering from food shortages, and we needed to ensure citizens had safe, high-quality, affordable food.<\/p> <p>  For the past 60 years or so we have been working very hard to deliver on those expectations and dealing with a range of challenges in that period.  By and large, the system works well and Europe basically has self-sufficiency in all the main agri-food commodities.  We obviously have our challenges, for example, we are heavily dependent on imports of fertilisers and animal feed.  When it comes to animal products and the main crops like wheat, barley and corn, we are in a very good position.<\/p> <p>  That does not mean we are not challenged, and most recently by what is happening in Ukraine.  Over the decades we have had various shocks, including bovine spongiform encephalopathy, foot-and-mouth disease and various plant pests.  The most recent is climate change.  We have adapted to these challenges, and in the case of climate change, for example, we put in place the Green Deal and Farm to Fork, containing key priorities to basically ensure our agricultural priorities are sustainable moving forward and basically adapting to this existential threat to society at large, and not just in the agricultural area.<\/p> <p>  Of course, we have also had to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, which presented its own challenges to agri-food systems.  Probably the single biggest lesson from that is just how sophisticated those chains are.  There is no question that farmers and primary agricultural production are the bedrock of our agri-food systems and food security but to get the food from the farm to the consumers' table is a long and sophisticated process involving processors, ingredients and inputs such as fertilisers, energy, additives, transport and logistical systems, food processing, abattoirs, meat cutting plants etc.  There is also the retail industry itself.  Covid-19 taught us that any disruption in any part of the chain can basically have consequences for the entire operation.<\/p> <p>  We took those lessons into account and developed new strategies.<\/p><p>We presented a communication on food security.  Subsequently, we had yet another shock; we have been going through a very difficult period, with the Ukraine.  That has also proved a major shock to agrifood chains globally but not necessarily in Europe, I would stress, because we had a very resilient agrifood system.  However, the global system was already in a relatively fragile state.  It was recovering from the Covid pandemic and especially the shocks to logistical systems and then suddenly, the war in Ukraine effectively removed from global supply chains, Ukrainian wheat, maize and sunflower.  These are three commodities for which they had a huge share.  The loss of these stocks to global markets led to a further escalation in prices and provoked fundamental questions about how adaptable we are at global level to dealing with food security. <\/p><p> On response, I will highlight three initiatives on the part of the Commission.  First and foremost, we had communication on 23 March on food security which identified three strands of policy action.  The first is how we deal with food security in Europe itself, arising from what is happening in Ukraine.  As I mentioned earlier, we are in a pretty good position on that as we have a good harvest in prospect.  The second is how we deal with the situation in Ukraine itself, because the loss of its stocks to world markets was obviously very destabilising.  From a humanitarian perspective, Ukrainians have to keep themselves fed and Ukraine borders the EU so we must work very hard to try to allow Ukraine to re-establish itself on global markets.  Finally, we must look at the global situation including the humanitarian dimension.  Unlike Europe, large parts of the world have structural deficits in key agrifood commodities and were very vulnerable to what happened to Ukraine through, for example, the escalation of prices and in some cases even the availability of agrifood products.  We had to work to strengthen their position.  That includes improving and increasing their production capacity.  The final strand of the immediate course of action to deal with what is happening in Ukraine was the adoption of a communication of so-called solidarity lanes.  These are designed to basically compensate for the closure of the Ukrainian Black Sea ports through which they normally ship their commodities.  Now, in a very short time, we have defined rail, road and barge alternatives.  This is a huge logistical operation.  We cannot compensate for the loss of Black Sea ports overnight, but we are working extremely hard with Ukrainian authorities to basically provide outlets to allow its grains and sunflower oil to access more markets, to keep its own agrifood production system ticking over, to provide them with the revenues and to plant new crops in the next harvest cycle.  Otherwise a major component of the Ukrainian economy would be fundamentally damaged with both European and global consequences. <\/p><p>  In Europe we have a very resilient and powerful system with challenges, notably climate change, but the CAP does deliver on what is expected of it.  However, we are also challenged at the international dimension and especially from the circumstances arising from this war in Ukraine.  We had the measures in place to basically allow us to address them already this week.  I want to reassure the committee that this is being followed at the political level.  We had to present our various actions in the agricultural committee in the European Parliament.  Next Monday, there will be an agriculture Council meeting where we will discuss the situation on the markets and the impact of what's happening in Ukraine and of course, the European Council itself in its several meetings over the past few months has given a very high priority to this issue of food security.  With the Chair&rsquo;s permission I will stop here at this and I look forward to the committee&rsquo;s questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022071300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Scannell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Scannell.

We are very lucky to have him there.<\/p> <p>  He mentioned that we have dealt with other challenges, most recently Covid and previously foot and mouth disease.  Climate change is obviously the big challenge but we have time to deal with that, hopefully.  In context of Ukraine, what is the likely impact on food security in Europe this winter and next spring but also countries that Ukraine sells into, particularly Africa?  Is Mr. Scannell confident that the measures he outlined will be enough to alleviate it?  As well as food security, I am looking at food inflation and particularly the impact that will have on families across Europe and the world.  How effective will those measures just outlined be on food inflation?  <\/p> <p>  Second, is Mr. Scannell in a position to give an assessment of the talks that are under way as we speak in Turkey on freeing up some of that port access?  He mentioned the logistical challenges of trying to move crop exports on to road and rail.  At what stage are those talks?  Is the Commission involved or keeping a watching brief?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022071300002#B00300","speaker":"1602"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":53,"content":"<p>On the impact of what is happening on food security in Europe and at global level, one must look at the commodities on which the world was largely dependent coming from Ukraine.  I mentioned them earlier - wheat, maize and sunflower.  The EU imports virtually no wheat from Ukraine.  We did import relatively significant quantities of maize for our animal feed industry but there are alternatives to that on global markets and already, we see a drop in overall demand for animal feed largely for price purposes etc.  We are heavily dependent on Ukraine for sunflower oil but again there are alternatives to that such as rapeseed oil, soya oil and in some cases, even olive oils, although for different sectors sunflower oil is especially important.  I spoke earlier about the complexity of food chains so, for example, the fish processing industry is heavily reliant on sunflower oil for canned fish such as tuna and sardines.  It has certain qualities that are difficult to replace.  I mention that as an example of the complexity of these issues.  Therefore Europe is not immediately exposed in terms of its own supply chain on these commodities other than sunflower oil but the impact at global level is very significant because Ukraine accounted for a very large share of world trade in wheat.  The question is to what extent global markets will adapt to the loss of these Ukrainian grains.  First, we are trying through the solidarity lanes to ensure that that loss is kept to a minimum so that Ukraine can actually export.  However, as I mentioned, that is a big challenge due to the closure of the Black Sea ports.<\/p> <p>  On production levels in Europe itself, the wheat harvest will come on stream shortly.  We expect a European harvest of about 125 million tonnes.  To put that in perspective because these figures are so huge, that will allow us an exportable surplus of about 38 million tonnes which is really huge.  Europe is one of the biggest players on world markets for wheat.  That is about 30% of tradeable wheat.  Ironically in the circumstances, Russia will also have a very big harvest.  At global level, overall wheat production will be relatively stable.  It will be about 775 million tonnes which is little changed on the previous year.  However, that hides important sectoral differences.  What really matters in this context is the situation in the traditional exporting countries which includes Europe, Ukraine, Russia, the USA, Australia, Canada, and Argentina.<\/p><p>Markets will remain relatively fragile especially with the war ongoing.  Even in recent weeks we have seen some softening in prices.  Certainly, in Europe there is no need to panic.  I would be concerned about the global situation.<\/p><p> To give a bit of context, probably a bigger threat is the energy situation should Russia, for example, cut off the gas or reduce flows.  In that context, next week the Commission will adopt a communication on how we anticipate potential shortages in key energy inputs, notably gas, as the winter approaches.  Already a significant number of member states have introduced national provisions to reduce and prioritise who gets access to these key energy inputs.  That, in turn, leads to the Deputy's question about the inflationary impact.<\/p><p> We need to be very mindful that inflation in general has risen very sharply and increases in food prices have been a major contributory factor.  Traditionally energy and food are excluded from the main indices for inflation because they tend to be so volatile.  There had been an expectation that the increases we saw during the Covid pandemic would be transitory.  This was the assumption of the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve etc.  However, in large part as a result of the war in Ukraine it is not proving so transitory.  That has basically led to longer and more worrying levels of inflation.  Obviously, we all have a shared interest in doing more to bring inflation back significantly.  It has not been an issue for three decades or so, but those of us who are around long enough recall how painful it is to reduce inflation.  It is a painful and difficult exercise.<\/p><p> The UN is leading the efforts to reopen the Black Sea ports.  Apart from the UN itself, the key players are Ukraine, Russia and Turkey.  It would be a major bonus if they succeed.  There is already talk of a pilot shipment from the port of Odesa.  We have high expectations and hopes that these will prove successful.  However, we need to be prudent and anticipate a scenario where either it does not prove possible to reopen the ports or even if they do reopen that it will take some time for the normal logistics to pick up to their former levels.  That explains our solidarity lanes and the communications I mentioned earlier.  We cannot to reduce our efforts to provide alternatives to the Black Sea ports.  It would be wonderful if those efforts proved to be unnecessary because the Black Sea ports reopened, but it would be worthless to make such assumption.  I will stop at that.  I hope I have answered the Deputy's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022071300002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Scannell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":55,"content":"<p>My final question is climate change related.

We have very good and sophisticated satellite systems that give a read out on the climatic conditions throughout Europe, the impact on soil moisture level and in turn the impact for crops.  Already we have had to revise downwards on a number of occasions our expected overall harvest.  Two months ago, we had high expectations that we would have a very good harvest.  Now we are expecting something more in line with the five-year average.  We published our short-term outlook for cereal production last week.  We expect a drop of approximately 2.6%, which is not alarming in these circumstances.  For wheat we scaled back our forecast harvest from 130 million tonnes to 125 million tonnes, a not insignificant production but still in line with our five-year average.<\/p> <p>  Harvests tend to be unpredictable but even with the current prolonged dry conditions and even with the heatwave forecast for the next week or two, the harvest is sufficiently advanced at this stage for us to be pretty confident that we will nonetheless get a good harvest.  Obviously, the risks are on the downside especially with the heatwave etc.  There certainly will not be any issue with the availability of wheat on the European market.  I made the point earlier that we have massive export availability.  Our current projection is for 38 million tonnes.

His presentation and initial answers have been very helpful.  It is important to consider the origins of the Common Agricultural Policy because much of the focus in our generation has been on surpluses and so on.  The first Commissioner, Sicco Mansholt, came from a hungry Europe where there was famine in his native Netherlands.  Few will disagree with the view that surplus is certainly better than famine.  Having an assurance of food is something we all take for granted.  Just as we should not take peace in Europe for granted anymore, we certainly should not take food security for granted.  That is an important point to make.<\/p> <p>  In that vein, I want to focus on the immediate situation arising from the conflict in Ukraine.  When I say conflict, for the avoidance of doubt, it is the absolutely unconscionable assault on Ukraine by Russia.  Mr. Scannell spoke about solidarity lanes, rail and so on.  From all the evidence we have received, these will not go anywhere close to moving the actual harvest of wheat, maize or sunflower product that is normally exported from Ukraine.  Am I right in saying the only realistic way of getting significant access to market is for some mechanism to reopen the Black Sea ports?<\/p> <p>  I read the EU Council conclusions last week.  They put considerable focus on supporting the United Nations efforts in that regard.  Does Mr. Scannell think there are real prospects for that?  I ask him to quantify what the alternatives would be in the event that the Black Sea ports remain unusable.  We know the logistics of the different rail gauges between Moldova and Romania.  These are logistical issues that cannot be instantly overcome.<\/p> <p>  My next question relates to the alternatives.  Mr. Scannell spoke about Europe being able to access sufficient grain on international markets.  What is the increased capacity from countries like Canada and the United States?  Have other countries increased production this year?  It is well and good to say that we can be assured of food security in Europe, which of course is important, but it cannot be at the cost of starvation elsewhere.  I am wondering what the global situation will be.<\/p> <p>  My final question relates to the broader issue touched upon by Deputy Calleary.  I ask about the ongoing medium-term impact of climate change particularly on water availability in southern Europe.  There is drought in Italy and Spain.  Agricultural land which is normally very productive may in the medium term become unproductive.<\/p><p>I am interested in Mr. Scannell's opinion on how that is being assessed currently and what particular actions, if any, we can take to address that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022071300002#C00400","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":59,"content":"<p>There was a lot in that.  Regarding the extent to which the solidarity lanes can effectively compensate for the loss of the Black Sea ports, I acknowledged earlier that it is a huge challenge.  The Black Sea ports accommodated an average of 5 million tonnes of grains a month.  Currently, and notwithstanding huge efforts, we have managed to move 2 million to 2.5 million tonnes of grains in the month of June.  That is less than half, but it is an extraordinary achievement in the circumstances.  Obviously, however, if that is less than half, the system is not coping.  Bear in mind that one simply cannot replace these Black Sea ports.  One is not going to replace the volumes that are moved in these giant grain ships with road, rail and barges overnight, and not even in a matter of months.  If we could get it to 2.5 million to 3 million tonnes, that would be very respectable and take a great deal of the pressure off.  Bear in mind that the forthcoming Ukrainian harvest will be much reduced in any event because of the war with Russia.  A lot of the more productive areas are either in the war zone or are occupied.  It is important not to downplay or underestimate the contribution of the lanes, even at the current levels.<\/p> <p>  What is a bigger worry perhaps is not just the volumes that are being moved but the cost of that.  Moving through these alternative transport modes is much more expensive than using sea transport.  That in turn affects the competitiveness of Ukrainian grains, oil seeds and so forth.  We have to be very attentive that if these costs become prohibitively expensive, there will not be a demand in practice for these grains.  We are very attentive to that.<\/p> <p>  On the capacity of others to fill the gap, markets are resilient.  I can give the example of Europe itself.  We expect to have an exportable surplus of up to 38 million tonnes.  That is significantly more than last year.  Canada will have a very strong harvest, although it has to be accepted that this reflects an extremely poor harvest in the previous year.  Russia, ironically in this context, stands to profit from the current international situation in grain markets.  It is on schedule to have a very strong harvest.  Overall, the global availability of grains will be more or less on the same level as in the previous year.  However, what is perhaps more important is who has those grains and especially the position of the traditional big grain exporters, including the EU.  Often the best gauges of that is price.  I mentioned in that context that prices have eased not insignificantly in the past several weeks, basically because the northern hemisphere harvests are now coming on stream and there is availability and so forth.  I stress, however, that in the future markets are likely to remain fragile because a great deal is dependent on what happens in Ukraine and the extent to which Ukrainian grains, especially wheat, are able to access the market itself.  Even in the current projections we still anticipate that 10 million to 11 million tonnes of Ukrainian wheat will access world markets.  If that proves not to be the case, that will create supply pressures in the market.<\/p> <p>  The climate change dimension is huge.  Before Covid-19 our focus was on climate change for obvious and apparent reasons.  This presents massive risks to the viability of our agrifood production systems and that explains why we had the Green Deal and Farm to Fork.  The focus of the media, at least, has been somewhat distracted, understandably, by Covid-19, Ukraine and so forth, but we cannot afford to lose sight of climate change.  That is why, even in the context of what is happening in Ukraine, we reminded member states that in the preparation of their so-called Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, strategic plans they need to have resilience and food security very much in focus, including how they respond, working with the Commission, to what is happening in Ukraine.  That includes how they make their systems more resilient to climate change.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy gave the example of water availability.  We expect member states to use the resources available from the CAP to work with their farmers to ensure that they can deal with these challenges, including water availability.  Obviously that is a bigger issue in some member states than in others.  If one is following the media, Italy is currently going through a major drought.  The River Po is running dry and so forth.  It really brings home to us that this a huge problem.  These things are not happening once in a generation any more but happening every second or third year.  It is extremely important that member states are very ambitious in their CAP strategic plans on making their systems more resilient on climate change.<\/p> <p>  If the Deputy has any follow-up questions, I am happy to take them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022071300002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Scannell"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":60,"content":"<p>That is fine.

He has dealt with a fair amount of the subjects in which we are interested.  Food security comes down to the work that has always been done at European level to ensure the supply and the quality.  As Mr. Scannell said, supply on a world basis is not going to be the issue, but price will be a major one.  What is the disaster reckoning and what plans are put in place if there are difficulties with releasing that 10 million to 11 million tonnes of Ukrainian wheat and other necessary foodstuffs?  We have seen it already happen on some level in the energy sector, and it can take a long time for this to happen, where there is a reorientation in respect of who is buying from whom and who falls into what particular camp.  All of it is the outworking of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.<\/p> <p>  From listening to Mr. Scannell as regards food, and many new terms are being bandied about regarding the importance of resilience and strategic autonomy, Europe is okay at present.   However, I am wondering about the plans that are in place.  There are two issues.  We all see the European Union on its best day as a force for good in the world.  However, it also exists within the world and we know that globalisation and the world economic system have taken a complete reorientation.  It is how we cope with that and what disaster planning is put in place, particularly for those areas that will be under severe pressure such as the Horn of Africa and areas in the Middle East.

I make a distinction in that context between those countries outside of Europe that can access markets through their own means and countries that are reliant on humanitarian aid.  Taking the example of wheat, it is well recognised that the countries of north Africa and the Middle East are very dependent on wheat imports.  They import from around the world.  Before this crisis, these were extremely demanding market participants.  Countries such as Algeria, Egypt, Tunisia and so forth would put out their periodic tenders seeking submissions by X of the best prices and delivery conditions for 100,000 or 200,000 tonnes of wheat to meet the following specifications and so forth.  They basically were hard bargainers and often got very good deals.  We were even faced with a lot of complaints that they drove too hard a bargain.<\/p><p>However, markets are cyclical and when they receive a shock, such as what happened with Covid and its impact on logistical chains and then subsequently Ukraine, etc., prices rose.  The issue here is not so much availability, but affordability, and these countries are challenged in that context.  I mentioned that prices have eased somewhat in recent weeks.  I mentioned also that the northern hemisphere harvests are now coming on stream, so for the next several months there will be plenty of availability.  The question will be what kind of price they will be prepared to pay.<\/p><p> On the broader dimension, I mentioned we had a communication on 23 March on food security.  It had three components: Europe itself; Ukraine; and the international dimension.  We explicitly acknowledged that we have to be very mindful of, basically, instability of the world market and how that impacts, including the humanitarian dimension.  The Deputy mentioned the Sahel and Horn of Africa region, etc.  In the past several months, for example, I do not have the exact figure in front of me, but I recall it was something of the order of &euro;1 billion was pledged by the EU towards the Sahel and Lake Chad area and a further &euro;600 million to the Horn of Africa in direct humanitarian aid.  We had the so-called Lugano Conference just last week on Ukraine.  Within the package of measures there, there is &euro;500 million, I understand, to assist Ukrainians in dealing with the current challenges to their agriculture and food situation.  <\/p><p> We are very alert to and mindful of this international dimension.  It is not just a question of short-term fixes.  Basically, these countries have to work towards having more resilient agrifood production systems themselves.  We all accept that trade is extremely important, including for Europe.  Let us not forget we have a huge trade surplus in agrifood products.  It is a big part of our economy, especially in Ireland.  However, we need to very mindful also that a country is not, let us say, overly exposed, should there be there destruction on world markets for whatever reason, it could be a plant disease, a trade dispute, war, etc.  Many developing countries are very vulnerable in this respect and need to invest an awful lot more in their agrifood production systems to basically ensure they are not as vulnerable as they currently are to disruption of world markets.  Obviously, we have a duty to assist them in that process also through development aid.  That, as I said, was well signalled in the communication on 23 March.  <\/p><p> I will not pretend there are any magic solutions to this that can happen overnight.  It is and will be a very big concern.  What is happening in Ukraine has made that concern an awful lot greater.  Of course, everybody remembers the last big spike in world food commodity prices, which triggered the so-called Arab Spring.

It is no secret that the Commission is under much pressure to essentially accommodate concerns on food security at the cost of our sustainability objectives.  For example, when the new CAP reform enters into force from 1 January next year, we should essentially postpone certain sustainability-orientated reforms to basically not compromise our production.  Of course, there is a whole discussion to be had also on the extent to which sustainability measures are at the cost of productivity.  There is a very strong body of evidence that suggest that these sustainability measures are essential to ensure the long-term viability of our systems and we should not abandon them for short-term fixes.  On Monday, the agriculture Council will touch on many of these issues.  The Commission will present an update on the current evaluation process of the CAP strategic plans and the extent to which, if any, they need to be fine-tuned to take account of the food security-related issue.  Difficult choices will need to be taken.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy raised a very important issue on fertilisers.  When I highlighted earlier that Europe is in a good position traditionally, thanks to the CAP, etc., we still have our vulnerabilities.  I mentioned, in that context, fertiliser in particular.  We import huge quantities of potash and phosphates, as well as huge quantities of gas for our nitrogen-based fertiliser industry.  If those supplies were compromised for one reason or another, that would then call into question the availability and the cost of fertilisers, which in turn would have a big impact on farmers planting decisions and the prices they receive.  If they choose, for example, to use lesser quantities of fertilisers, that would compromise yields, which again brings us back to food security.  We are back, essentially, to the same kind of issues.  <br\/><br\/>On the extent to which recent weather conditions have basically allowed them to escape the consequences of less fertiliser use, I do not think it is the weather conditions <i>per se<\/i>, but there is a so-called concept of a phosphate holiday.  Basically, you can cut back on the usage of phosphates and potash for the short term.  Generally levels in soils are sufficient and Teagasc does much work with farmers to basically identify where they might be deficient in this context.  Essentially, you can cut back in the short term.  The extent to which you can do that in a second growing cycle or, indeed, a third is questionable.  If the Deputy asked me to highlight the areas that we need to keep very clearly on our radar moving forward in terms of food security, I would say fertiliser availability and, behind that, energy availability.  I mentioned the forthcoming communication on the coming winter.  That is very prominent on the radar.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022071300002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Scannell"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":68,"content":"<p>We have 25 minutes and three contributors remaining.

I will probably have some supplementary questions arising from some of the contributions earlier on.<\/p> <p>  In many regards, we are facing into a perfect storm with the war in Ukraine and climate change.  Mr. Scannell said that supply will not be the issue and cost is, but it is very concerning to see the impact climate is having on crop production.  I saw yesterday that France&rsquo;s wheat production is estimated to be down 7%, with a 15% drop in crops in Romania as well.  That is probably replicated in many areas.  Northern Europe is probably the opposite and probably has good growth.  However, there are certainly huge concerns in relation to climate and also the situation with the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia.  We see that there are 25 million tonnes of grains essentially locked in Ukraine now.<\/p> <p>  At yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence we had the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, in with us.  I raised the question about Odesa and the prospect of that port being reopened.  I do not want to put words in his mouth, but he said he was optimistic that something might happen in the near future in terms of reopening Odesa, which will be critical.<\/p><p>Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; raised the issue of fertiliser, which will be an issue of concern.  Mr. Scannell said we have the ability to sustain the amount of fertiliser we have over the next year or so, along with some other mitigation measures.  He might be able to give us some detail of how dependent Europe is on fertiliser from Russia and Ukraine.<\/p><p> I also want to touch on the issue of the humanitarian crisis tragically unfolding in Africa, Afghanistan and other areas and the impact climate and the war in Ukraine will have on those very vulnerable regions.  We know there was a crisis in those regions before the war in Ukraine.  Donations to the World Food Programme, WFP, across all of those regions have been down consistently over the past number of years, which has put pressure on it.  What analysis, if any, has been carried out on that?  I have heard what he said about money coming from Europe into the Sahel and the Horn of Africa.  That has to be welcomed.  <\/p><p> What analysis has been carried out on the displacement of people in those regions?  Obviously there is an issue.  People in Africa are being displaced.  Significant numbers of people are fleeing for their lives with their families across the Mediterranean Sea and are making their way to Europe.  Some horrific measures are being taken by some European countries to stop that influx of migrants.  The WFP is failing in many regards.  What impact will the number of displaced people have on the broader region?<\/p><p> In the view of Mr. Scannell, is enough being done by the European Union to avoid humanitarian crises in those regions?  I refer to the military spend by the EU to provide military assistance to Ukraine which, of course, the Ukrainian Government has asked for.  I will not get into that debate.  However, given the comparison between the military spend and the spend on humanitarian aid on regions that are at crisis stage, is enough being done by the European Union to give assistance to the many people who need it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022071300002#E00600","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I will start with the fertiliser issue.  Nobody would question that we are hugely dependent on imports, but we have to make a distinction between the different components.  For example, in terms of potash we were traditionally reliant on major imports from Belarus and even before the war in Ukraine we had taken sanctions against Belarus.  Now we have to turn to alternative sources on world markets for potash.  Unfortunately, very few are in Europe.  Canada and Morocco are major producers of potash and phosphate.  China is also a large producer, although it has restricted exports and given priority to domestic consumers.<\/p> <p>  Nonetheless, in terms of potash and phosphate, we need to take account of what I mentioned earlier.  Farmers can, in the short term at least, ease off on their use.  We have been able to cope pretty well.  The European fertiliser industry comprises major traders and is very good at sourcing products on global markets and selling them on global markets, including in Europe.  There has been no supply crash in Europe.<\/p> <p>  We are more concerned about nitrogen-based fertilisers.  We are very reliant on imports of Russian gas in that regard.  For nitrogen-based fertilisers we can do one of two things, that is, import fertilisers or produce them in Europe.  By and large, they have been produced in Europe, but that means importing gas.  That is what we have been doing.  A lot of that gas, as I acknowledged and we all know, comes from Russia.  The signs have been ominous in regard to Russia deciding to curtail supplies, such as recent maintenance issues on Nord Stream I and the formal cut-off of gas to Poland and Bulgaria.  It would be imprudent not to plan for a situation where gas supplies would become even more precarious.  I am repeating myself, but that explains why we have communication coming forward next week on how we work with member states to anticipate potential shortages to the end of this year.  As I mentioned earlier, this needs to be prominent on our radar screens, and indeed it is.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the humanitarian dimension, my expertise is in agriculture, CAP, supporting European farmers, etc.  The humanitarian aspect is important, but we have other specialist services that work in that field.  Food is obviously extremely important in this context.  I acknowledge our communication on food security, which very transparently highlights that there are major challenges at the global level, including in the humanitarian area which explains why, to repeat myself, there is &euro;1 billion for the Sahel and Lake Chad area and &euro;600 million for the Horn of Africa.  <\/p> <p>  Is that enough?  Frankly, I have to turn to the development community on that and the ongoing debate on the extent to which Europe and other international donors can, should and do work with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, FAO, WFP and other UN agencies, to not just provide humanitarian aid as a kind of short-term fix for clear shortages in the market of foodstuffs.  We are not dealing with a potential risk to food security in some of these countries; it is actually happening.  There are lots of figures available on the number of people in precarious food security situations, which has increased sharply in recent months and years.  <\/p> <p>  I return to Deputy Calleary's question on inflationary impacts.  In Europe, we spend a relatively small share of our overall household expenditure on food, with important distinctions between high, low and middle-income earners.  On average, it is relatively low.  In developing countries, the figure is relatively high, at 50% or more.  Anything that leads to an increase in food prices in these countries squeezes incomes and leaves a lot of citizens in these countries in a situation whereby they do not have money to buy food.  As I said, the FAO has produced a lot of figures that are very worrying in that context.  <\/p> <p>  The international community is working hard.  I mentioned the Lugano conference on Ukraine that took place last week.  The UN General Assembly, FAO and WFP are all preoccupied with how we deal with this issue, with the added complication that we saw a sharp increase in commodity prices even before the war in Ukraine.  As to solutions, perhaps the committee could invite one of my colleagues from our international services to come back to it at some future date.  That merits a long discussion in itself.  I am sorry if I am not able to give the Deputy the answer he hoped or expected.  I ask him to keep in mind my limitations in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022071300002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Scannell"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":72,"content":"<p>I have some very quick questions.

Each and every member state is very preoccupied with this for the very good reason that food prices have gone up sharply and this impacts on lower income groups in particular so it basically has a major societal impact.  What political system can afford to ignore that impact, which is why you cannot pick up a newspaper these days without reading about this particular issue?  I am not going to go into what Ireland is doing as compared to France as compared to Greece etc., but suffice it to say this is very prominent on the economic and political agenda Europe-wide.  In so far as the Commission itself has a role, I go back to our communication of 23 March on food security.  We signalled that in a European context, member states need to use the instruments available to them and that includes for example flexibility on VAT rates on food and food products in general; social support measures to funnel resources to lower income groups to help them deal with the price impact; and measures on the supply chain to allow farmers to deal with higher input costs, so that in turn their producer prices are kept at a reasonable level.  Obviously if producer prices are increasing, as a reflection of increased input costs, this has an impact further on in the food chain.  <\/p> <p>  This brings me to the Senator's question as to the extent we in the Commission are working to adapt the CAP to reflect what is happening in Ukraine.  I mentioned that member states are currently at a very advanced stage in their CAP strategic plan preparations for the newly reformed CAP from 1 January.  This is a huge undertaking but, as part of that process, the Commission has already written so-called \"observation letters\" to the member states on their preliminary plans.  We took that opportunity to remind them to factor in the need to review just how resilient their agrifood systems are in the light of what is happening in Ukraine and, in the background also, the far bigger existential threat to agrifood production systems, from climate change.  Basically we need to see from member states a high level of ambition on how they will anticipate and take into account climate change because this is not an issue they can afford to ignore, nor can farmers ignore it, nor indeed are they.  I do not think there is any member state or any farming organisation or individual farmer who does not feel impacted.  They are the ones on the ground who see the consequences.  We have been speaking repeatedly about the impact of the current dry spell in Europe and of the heatwave that is currently taking place on projected harvests.  Every farmer growing cereals in Europe is checking the weather forecast ten times a day.  They recall that they are doing this a lot more than they did in the past.  In terms of how they plan or what they plant, they now increasingly have to factor in the situation on water, fertiliser and the plant protection products used etc., so that they can be viable and more sustainable.  Nobody can escape the implications of this challenge ahead of us.  We have to remain flexible and that is why on Monday in the agriculture Council, we will hear from the member states on their take on the current situation and the extent, if any, to which our plans need to be adapted to Ukraine or to the climate change situation, etc.  I will stop at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022071300002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Scannell"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Scannell.

If my first question has already been answered, leave it at that and I will get the text later.  I am interested in hearing what Mr. Scannell has to say about a number of issues.  First, with regard to the &euro;500 million support that has been afforded to EU farmers, is there any conditionality attached to that?  Does Mr. Scannell know if it is a straightforward fund or what conditions are attached to it?  How does the Commission envisage this money being spent, or is it largely being left up to member states to decide what is needed?  Second, in the context of sustainability and climate change, obviously we are all operating in that context and agriculture must also.  I am going to ask a few questions about this country in particular.  In Ireland, how can we reorient our agricultural models both in the short and in the long term to try to ensure greater sustainability?  I am not asking Mr. Scannell to pre-empt the agriculture Council on Monday but just to give a general overview on that.  Third, and this is not going to happen unless they call a meeting this afternoon,  if I had to meet a group of sheep, hill or suckler farmers in north Leitrim or south Sligo to discuss climate change this evening and I told them I had a meeting about food security with the Commission this morning, what message could Mr. Scannell give them?  When we talk to farmers about CAP and food production, many of them will still say that the CAP was initially brought in to ensure food security.  To most farmers, this means you produce more food.  They see it as a simple straight line.  If Mr Scannell could give them one message, what might that be?  I did not attend a recent seminar on food security at which Mr. Scannell was speaking but one of my staff members did and they took notes.  It might have been the European Commission seminar last week.  One of the questions he was asked was what one single action could be taken to avoid a global food crisis and the answer Mr. Scannell gave was to stop the war.  He may have said more but that is the answer I have here.  Putting that aside - and let us assume that the <i>status quo<\/i>remains for the next six to 12 months - what single action does Mr. Scannell think could be taken in order to avoid a global food crisis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022071300002#G00400","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I will answer the first question as I did not touch on it earlier, regarding conditionality in the &euro;500 million package announced on 23 March.  That amount can be, and in most cases was, accompanied by twice as much from national funds so &euro;1.5 billion in total.  Yes, there is conditionality.  Essentially member states are expected to target those farmers most directly impacted by rising input costs, included fertiliser costs in particular.  We already have reports from members states on who they targeted accordingly.  It was mostly those in the livestock industry because they were very hard hit by very sharp increases in animal feed costs.  Cereals producers on the other hand, even though fertiliser and energy costs have risen sharply, benefited from even sharper increases in producer prices.  By and large, the livestock sector seemed to have been the biggest beneficiary across all the member states.  We will produce a report in due course on the overall take-up etc.  The conditionality requirements left much of the flexibility to the member states.  Frankly, we in the Commission are around a long time and we accept the situation varies enormously from one member state to another, from one sector to another, and indeed even within sectors.<\/p><p>We accept that the situation varies enormously from one member state to another, from one sector to another and even within sectors.  There is no single one-size-fits-all approach.  Member states have to be given sufficient flexibility to allow them to target who is most deserving of support.  I have heard nothing to suggest that they have abused that flexibility.  Hopefully I will not be disappointed when we get around to checking how they spent it.<\/p><p> On the issue of how we reorient our systems, Ireland was mentioned specifically.  It comes back to the CAP strategic plan, which is perhaps the single biggest reform of the CAP.  We are giving member states the flexibility to design their own agrifood production systems within the framework of the CAP, adapted to their own needs and challenges.  That includes climate change and sustainability.  Deputy Calleary would be familiar with this from his time as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Ireland has in its own hands the instruments to design a system that is fit for Ireland.  We in the Commission have an obligation to ensure that conforms to the overall structure and is consistent and coherent with what other member states are doing.  There is an obligation on all of us to ensure it fits in within the wider Green Deal, Farm to Fork, Fit for 55 objectives, that is, creating a sustainable agrifood production system that will keep us fed without excessive contributions to greenhouse gas emissions.  That is a big challenge but it has to be met because if we fail on that at member state level or EU level, the consequences will be huge, including for food production.  Food sustainability and food security are not opposites.  They are entirely complementary to one another.  If we fail at one we will fail at the other.<\/p><p> On the message to hill farmers and suckler farmers, the big strength of those sectors in terms of CAP sustainability is that, apart from contributing to food supply, they are extremely rich in their contribution to biodiversity and rural development.  Sustainability is not only about economics.  We would stress this.  There are three pillars, namely, the economic, the social and the environmental.  These sectors contribute hugely to the social and environmental pillars, as well as the quality dimension.  If I were working in any of these sectors I would be very proud of what I was doing.  They should be proud and they should be supported in what they are doing.  Sometimes they feel they are being ignored but that is not the case and should not be the case.  That would be a big mistake.<\/p><p> Regarding what single issue would help, I already mentioned stopping the war in Ukraine.  That would help hugely.  Putting that aside, the answer is innovation, basically.  Unless our agrifood production systems and our society in general become much more innovative in how we deal with and use energy, find alternatives and deal with climate change, we are going to be in huge trouble.  The CAP reform puts a very heavy stress on innovation because traditionally and historically it is always innovation that has come to the rescue.  If we are to move to systems that use less fertiliser and fewer plant protection products, we are going to have to find new technologies that allow us to meet these objectives.  In other words, we need innovation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022071300002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Scannell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I thank Mr Scannell.

I see some familiar names and faces from the members' colleagues on the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  We value our engagements with the Oireachtas very highly and see these opportunities as an important part of our work.  Joining me today are council member Dr. Adele Bergin, and Mr. Killian Carroll and Mr. Kevin Timoney from the council&rsquo;s secretariat.<br\/><br\/>IFAC is an official independent body established under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012.  Its mandate is to assess and endorse the official macroeconomic forecasts, assess the budgetary projections, assess compliance with the fiscal rules, and assess the fiscal stance.  Its focus is on the overall fiscal stance rather than on individual tax measures or spending items.<br\/><br\/>Following two difficult years due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Irish economy is now facing the challenge of a surge in energy and food prices due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  Together with other price pressures as the economy recovered from Covid-19, inflation in Ireland has increased to its highest rate in a generation.  The strength of the pick-up in inflation in recent months was not anticipated.  The Government&rsquo;s projections in April were for annual consumer price index, CPI, inflation of 6.2 % this year, while the inflation rate for June was already estimated to be 9.6 %.  Globally, forecasts for inflation have been revised up, while expectations for growth have been scaled back.  Higher energy and food prices, together with higher interest rates, will dampen growth in advanced economies.  Uncertainty is very high, including around energy supplies in Europe this coming winter.<br\/><br\/>Despite this, recent economic data for Ireland have remained robust.  Consumer credit card spending has continued to grow in recent months.  Employment and tax receipts remain strong.  Looking ahead, the Irish economy will inevitably be impacted by global and European developments, although Ireland&rsquo;s direct exposure to Russia is less than for some other countries.  Our specialisation in fast-growing digital and pharmaceutical activities may continue to be a source of resilience.  Nevertheless, high inflation is likely to lead to the first annual fall in overall household real income in a decade.  The impact of the higher cost of living creates real hardship for low-income households, who spend more than a third of disposable income on energy and food, and some other vulnerable groups.<br\/><br\/>Against this background, the Government published its summer economic statement on the 4 July.  This sets out its strategy for budget 2023<i><\/i>in September and updates the overall amounts the Government plans to spend in the years ahead, although it did not revise the full economic and budgetary forecasts compared with April.<br\/><br\/>Strong tax revenues have led to a new official projection for a budget surplus in 2022, one year earlier than anticipated.  This primarily reflects stronger than expected tax receipts, particularly from corporation tax.  The Government faces a delicate balancing act in the budget between protecting the economy and poorer households from higher energy and food prices, while avoiding adding to inflation through second-round effects.  Fiscal policy cannot permanently shelter the economy as a whole from higher prices.<br\/><br\/>In last October&rsquo;s budget, the Government set out plans to increase core spending by &euro;4 billion in 2023 to &euro;84.1 billion.  Core spending is Exchequer spending excluding one-off measures and unemployment benefits.  This was consistent with a new fiscal rule to grow core spending in line with an underlying sustainable growth rate of the economy of 5 %.  The IFAC welcomed this new rule as an anchor to keep the public finances on a sustainable path and to reduce the debt ratio to a more prudent level.  The summer economic statement now plans to raise spending in 2023 by &euro;5.3 billion, a growth rate of some 6.6%, with an additional &euro;400 million in measures from this September, taking the level in 2023 to &euro;85.8 billion.<br\/><br\/>The 5% spending rule is a significant strengthening of Ireland&rsquo;s fiscal framework, although some aspects of its design need to be clarified.  It is welcome that the Government has continued to use it as a reference point, even while deviating temporarily from the rule for the year ahead.  The rule provides a useful signal that policy should not try to compensate fully for higher inflation.  It is sensible, however, to allow some leeway during this period when inflation is very far from trend.<br\/><br\/>The summer economic statement further increased the size of the planned tax package from &euro;500 million to just over &euro;1 billion.  Inflation tends to raise the tax burden because it draws more income into the higher tax bands.  The upward revision to the tax package would help to prevent the tax burden from rising substantially.  Well-targeted temporary measures can also help to smooth the transition to higher prices or address one-off events, such as Covid-19 or the immediate needs of refugees, without impacting the underlying dynamics of the public finances.  The amounts that have been allocated will allow existing measures to be extended or could allow for some new temporary measures to be put in place.<br\/><br\/>Taken together, the plan outlined in the summer economic statement would strike a reasonable balance between creating space to support the economy and more vulnerable households, and avoiding adding to inflation by increasing demand excessively in an already inflationary environment.  The Government will, however, need to make difficult choices in the budget.  Increases of &euro;2.7 billion in permanent core spending remains to be allocated after taking into account the planned rise in public investment, rising pensions costs and the existing pay deal.  This amount is relatively large compared with those in recent budgets, but much of it is likely to be required just to stand still in terms of maintaining the existing level of public services, and welfare and pension rates.  Indeed, given the current trajectory of inflation, this amount would likely be insufficient to fully index public sector pay and welfare rates.<br\/><br\/>There is very limited space for new policy initiatives beyond cost-of-living measures at this time.  Better targeting of supports would improve the trade-off between helping those most exposed and risks of second-round inflation.  The council&rsquo;s full assessment of the budget package will depend on the details of what is announced on budget day, together with economic developments over the coming months.<br\/><br\/>Overall, the public finances have recovered well from the Covid-19 pandemic.  Prior to the surge in inflation, the budget balance was set to reach a sizeable surplus in the years ahead.  Combined with lower interest rates and underlying growth of the economy, the government debt ratio would fall significantly in the coming years.  The high average maturity of debt and large cash reserves provide some insulation in the near term from higher interest rates.  Nevertheless, the debt ratio remains high by historical standards and compared with other small advanced economies.  The over-reliance on corporation tax flatters this picture.  Taking the council&rsquo;s estimates that &euro;6 billion to &euro;9 billion of these receipts are excess compared with fundamentals, this implies that the current surplus is equivalent to a substantial deficit.  Corporation tax last year represented nearly &euro;1 in every &euro;4 of Exchequer tax revenue, amounting to nearly 7% of national income.<\/p><p>A large share of this is paid by just a handful of multinational corporations.  While these revenues could remain strong for some years, they depend on developments and decisions made outside Ireland.  These revenues are volatile and subject to the risk of a sudden large fall.<\/p><p> The Government should take measures to reduce its reliance on corporation tax by, at a minimum, capping and preferably reducing over time how much of this money is spent.  This would reduce the risks of a reversal in revenues and avoid overheating the economy.  The reduction in exposure could be achieved in various ways including paying down debt more quickly, making contributions to the rainy-day fund or by reinstating the National Pensions Reserve Fund in order that the corporation tax boom would be used to reduce the need to increase taxes in the future.<\/p><p> Looking ahead, major policy commitments and challenges need to be properly costed and factored into the Government&rsquo;s medium-term plans.  These pressures on public spending raise significant questions about how they will be accommodated within the Government's spending rule alongside existing policies.  There are three main challenges.<\/p><p> First, Ireland&rsquo;s population will age rapidly in the years ahead due to people living longer and the coming retirement of Irish baby boomers.  Annual spending on pensions is set to rise by about 1.5% to 2% of national income by 2030.  The pensions commission&rsquo;s preferred option involved raising the State pension age and substantial increases in PRSI rates, amounting to almost &euro;1,000 per year for a worker on a typical wage of &euro;35,000.  Maintaining the retirement age at its current level of age 66 would add approximately another &euro;800 in PRSI payments for a worker on a typical wage.<\/p><p> Second, the Government is required to halve Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared with the 2018 level.  This will be a major change to the way our economy and society functions.  However, the impact on the public finances has not been fully assessed or factored into budgetary plans.  Estimates from Mr. John FitzGerald put the cost at an additional 1.7% to 2.3% of national income on average over the years 2026 to 2030.<\/p><p> Third, the Government has not costed its major healthcare reforms under Sl&aacute;intecare beyond this year.  There is no clarity on how much progress has been made to date and what the overall cost is likely to be.<\/p><p> The public finances can play a key role in helping to address the impact of the higher cost of living, particularly on lower-income and disadvantaged households, but it must be done in a way that does not add to inflationary pressure to ensure that higher inflation does not become entrenched.  While Government borrowing was key to protecting the economy during the pandemic, the fiscal response now needs to be more balanced.  Fiscal policy cannot permanently shelter the economy as a whole from higher prices.  Despite the urgency of current pressures, it is important to maintain the economy and public finances on a sustainable path and address the longer-term challenges for the public finances.

IFAC does not have the mandate with regard to the summer economic statement, however.  Therefore, it does not produce any report after the summer economic statement.  While there have been few deviations, there have been changes.  Obviously, we do not have concrete projections for inflation in the summer economic statement.  In addition, some other things are missing.

From our perspective, we have a formal mandate with these four pillars.  We actually have a formal mandate to make reports twice a year on the SPU and on the budget.  We always felt that if we just did that, however, we would not necessarily be doing the best service for the Irish people or for what the legislation was intended to do originally.<\/p> <p>  For a number of years, we published a pre-budget statement ahead of the budget, which we sometimes discussed with Oireachtas committees.  We have often commented on the summer economic statement in the past.  This time, there is obviously quite a lot of substance in it.  There is a slightly curious position where the European requirement is focusing on the SPU in April and the draft budget in October but, of course, the summer economic statement and national economic dialogue are important parts of the Irish discussion.

We might look at existing levels of services, which the council commented on with regard to its assessment of the SPU and again today.  The summer economic statement provided &euro;2.2 billion in respect of maintaining existing levels of services and &euro;800 million in respect of pre-committed increases in capital ceilings.  Last year, that figure was approximately &euro;1.6 billion in terms of services for 2022.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Barnes pointed out that in its report in May, the council noted that the 3% increase that underpins this allocation has changed from the SPU despite higher inflation.  Given the fact that we are seeing higher inflation and that the numbers have not changed, from what we have seen, in more than a year, how much of the discretionary money does Mr. Barnes think will be eaten into when we factor in what is happening in terms of inflation?  Mr. Barnes also made the point that existing pay agreements are factored into the existing levels of service but not future pay agreements, one of which we know is under consideration.  He might give an indication of the impact the offer that was on the table, which has been rejected, would have on the discretionary funding the Minister has available for new policy measures in September were it to be accepted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#C00500","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":93,"content":"<p>It is welcome that the Department of Finance now uses this kind of existing level of service concept, which is similar to what the council talked about in terms of standstill.  In any typical budget, many of the spending increases are needed just to maintain wages and pay.  That is a welcome change.<\/p> <p>  One of the difficulties with the SPU is the existing level of service beyond the current year.  There are no real details about how finance gets to it.  Usually, it is a more realistic number than some of the numbers we have seen for spending in recent years.  There are no very clear underpinnings so it is harder to work out exactly how we would adjust that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the Deputy's bigger question on the higher inflation that is now expected next year, which is important, if we were to make up for the unexpected inflation this year, which will actually be a much bigger number that, our assessment is that if we were to just stand still, the total amount of spending that was allocated for next year in the summer economic statement would not be enough to index all these bits fully in line with inflation if we take into account wages, welfare rates, pensions and other parts.  Our assessment is that the costs of standing still are higher than the total amount for spending next year.  That means within the overall spending limit the Government has set, choices will have to be made between different aspects of it.  There may be some aspects where it is desirable not to fully index them.  There are obviously some areas within that which would be priorities.  As I noted earlier, there is obviously not going to be much space for any additional spending on new programmes unless, of course, taxes were to increase, which, not relative to the rule but in economic terms, would make a difference.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the Deputy's specific question on pay, we have not made that calculation so I do not know what the impact of that pay deal would be.  Obviously, given that space is limited within that spending limit, it may be that the more pay is increased, the less space there is, for example, increasing pensions and welfare payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Let us tease that out a bit further.

In terms of existing levels of service alone, we understand that is for the running of the Departments of Health and Education and all of the rest.  The food bills in our hospitals have gone up.  Hospital costs relating to laundry have gone up.  Energy costs for hospitals have gone up.  The Department has calculated &euro;2.2 billion just to keep all those services going.

This extra amount will be allocated in the budget.  Choices will have to be made about to what extent we stand still in different areas.  One of the major uncertainties in all of this, and also on the tax side, is what will happen to wages.  It is very hard to predict how wages will change over the next year.

I will start at the beginning.  We do not have an updated figure for inflation.  That is one of the reasons we will make a fuller assessment in September.  The pick-up in inflation in recent months has been really strong, and far greater than anyone had anticipated.  Some of that relates to major uncertainties about energy prices, wheat prices and other food prices.  We have seen movements in different directions there.  Coming into the winter, we might be much clearer about energy prices.  Some of these prices might fall.  We have seen a fall in wheat prices in recent weeks, but there are different pressures in other areas.<\/p> <p>  The euro is also weakening against the dollar.  Many of these things are priced in dollars, which will also add to inflation.  There are other sources of inflation with tightness in the labour market and other issues in the economy.  It is very difficult to know.  The most useful thing may not be to look at the year-on-year inflation but, rather, to try to work out the underlying dynamics.  It is very unclear as to whether there will be new shocks to inflation.  It will also take time for the shocks we have seen to work through the economy and in particular the effect on wages.  These things are very uncertain and we should have a bit more information in September.<\/p> <p>  In our models of the standstill, we index welfare payments, including pensions.  When we do it to prices, we do it to the economy-wide measure of prices.  The Deputy is right that in order to strictly speaking maintain the real living standards of people on welfare or pensions, we would need to use the inflation rate relevant to them.  This is likely to be significantly higher than the overall rate of inflation because we know they spend much more on things that have increased such as food and energy.  Partly because I do not have a clear view on inflation and much less for those groups, I do not know what is appropriate.  How that compensation should be made is really a choice for the political system.  It clearly makes sense to protect groups and sectors that are far more exposed than others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Mr. Barnes mentioned that the summer economic statement has revised up the Government's taxation package from &euro;500 million to slightly over &euro;1 billion.  He said that the upward revision of the tax package would help to prevent the tax burden from rising substantially.  I wish to tease that out.  Last month, Dr. Barra Roantree from the ESRI noted that the benefits from changes to the standard rate band is concentrated towards the top of the income distribution.  Therefore, changing the upper band gives no benefit to 80% of tax units.  The IFAC income assessment report in May noted that high-income households which would benefit from a tax change such as this would simply increase their savings, increasing their spending power.  We know that 80% of tax units do not pay tax at the top rate and only 20% would benefit from a change to the standard rate.  To have secondary effects and so forth, tax cuts can be provided to people who will increase their spending power and possibly fuel inflation.  Is that the best measure in terms of tax cuts?<\/p> <p>  I take two things from Mr. Barnes's opening statement.  I see a change in his position to the effect that tax cuts to the standard rate are required - so a tax rate for 20% of income earners.  An inference could be drawn that the increase in the tax package from &euro;500 million to &euro;1 billion is actually for this purpose.  Without second-guessing the Minister, I would suggest it is not.  I suggest that the Minister will and should extend the 9% VAT rate on petrol, diesel, kerosene for three months into 2023, which would be the bear minimum and would cost a few million euro shy of &euro;250 million on its own.  Has IFAC changed its position on those changes which it claimed in its May report would simply increase people's savings and the ESRI said is concentrated towards the top of the income distribution with no benefit to 80% of income earners?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#D00500","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":100,"content":"<p>The council's job is to look at the overall budgetary stance.  We do not take a view on either the design of specific temporary measures or of tax measures.  We were setting out that if the Government were trying to keep the tax system the same in economic terms as it was before - regardless of whether people think that is a good idea - the higher inflation now would draw more income into the higher band, leading to an overall tax increase.  In order to maintain it as it was before would require more of an adjustment to those tax bands in cash terms.  By increasing the amount allocated to that, the Government is making it more likely that there will be less of an increase.  In previous years, the Government has not always fully indexed the tax system, which has been a source of real tax increase.  As the Deputy says, it falls mostly on higher earners; that is how it works.  Sometimes it has introduced other measures to offset it.  There is often much confusion about the indexation issue and the impact of inflation on taxes.<\/p><p>If one wanted to keep the system as it is then today, in economic terms, one would basically have to index the bands by more.

The point has been made, and rightly so, that the budget will come down to choices and targeted measures.  The Government has increased the taxation package up to &euro;1 billion.

Mr. Barnes has argued that we need targeted measures.  He also stated that we need to ensure that we do not have second-round effects.  Taxation is quite expensive.

There are choices to be made.  One choice is about how one allocates a given amount of spending between different uses.  The other question is whether one wants to raise taxes to create more space.  One option would be, for example, to do less with indexation, which would give the Government, subject to one qualification, more space.  In that way, it could allocate more towards helping other groups in society through higher spending.  There is a case for doing that.  There is also a case for taxing people who earn higher incomes - and, perhaps, incomes that have done quite well in the past few years, as we discussed in our May-June report - and using that to help the more vulnerable groups.<\/p> <p>  One important caveat and one concern of ours is about the design of the spending rule.  The Government's spending rule is purely about spending.  If one takes, for example, the European spending rule, then that takes into account changes in tax policy.  If, for example, under the European rule, one increased taxes, and that could include through not indexing the tax bands, it would give more space to increase spending because, in terms of the overall balance, that would be neutral, which is what we really care about.  It is just that one reaches that point in a different way.  At a minimum, it would be good for the Government to clarify how that is treated.  From an economic point of view, however, it would be a very good improvement to allow discretionary tax measures to enter into that spending equation.  There are a lot of other good reasons for doing so as well.  It also closes down any incentive that the Government might have, in different circumstances, to cut taxes because it cannot do anything on the spending side politically.  In this context, it is very sensible that the Government should at least have the option within the spending rule to also change the tax and spending mix.  The council is not taking a view as to whether that is a desirable thing or not in terms of whether that should be done regarding the mix of spending and taxation that one wants.  The spending rule, which should really be about hitting a particular balance, should give the Government the option to raise taxes and give itself more space for spending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I hear what Mr. Barnes said to the effect that lower indexation would lead to more expenditure.

Obviously, one of the big concerns we have all had for years is the issue of corporation tax.

Some of the work is starting to be done.  We see the paper I mentioned from Dr. John FitzGerald that has estimates of about 2% of national income per year.  That gives you a sense of the kind of numbers.  This is an area the council is working on.  I think the Central Bank is working on it too.  The Climate Change Advisory Council has put out some more data as well, which is helpful, so I think we are getting there.  Most countries in Europe are in the same situation as we are, that we are basically a long way behind in our analysis of this major change, but I hope there will be some progress in the time to come.  It should be a major priority of the Government to work out the impact of this, because it is going to huge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":120,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Barnes think any revised fiscal rules would need to reflect the level of spending that would be needed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#F00400","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":121,"content":"<p>It is something to have in the background.

You have information from the Euribor six-month based on what the market expects interest rates to be.

There is the risk spread associated with Irish debt specifically and then there is the euro area risk-free interest rate.  If we continue to manage our public finances properly, there is no reason why the spread should not remain quite low, although there are risks.  We have seen tensions in the euro area as interest rates have increased, in particular as regards countries with relatively high debt.  As Mr. Timoney said, it is very hard to know what will happen in terms of interest rates.  There is a general view among economists that interest rates will ultimately rise from where they are today, but that they probably will not go back to the same sort of rates we saw in the past.  There has been a trend of declining interest rates over time.  As he also said, in the Irish case, something that gives us some protection in the short term is the fact that we have locked in low interest rates for much of our debt for many years ahead.  The fact that we borrowed to build up cash reserves means we have had to borrow more.  This means we have got a stock of low-interest debt.  In an environment where money is likely to be quite tight because of all the pressures on spending, this is one extra thing that will not help but it should not be a decisive factor.

I would add that the building of houses into those capital projects could be a good use of corporation tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#G00300","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":137,"content":"<p>There are two responses to that.  The short answer is \"No\".  There are two reasons for this.  First, as the national development plan reflects, investment needs be permanently higher in the future because we are going to move towards a more capital-intensive economy.  Whatever we do, it is going take us a long time to catch up on housing, energy production and other things.  It is not just a sort of temporary one-off that we invest in something and it will be done.  We have to build it into the baseline because it may not be as high, but investment will be higher than it has been historically.  There is obviously a difference between taking that money and spending it on investment compared with spending it on health.  Health is actually a poor example, but on truly current spending which has no future benefit, because there is a longer term benefit in the case of health.<\/p> <p>  One of the things that is important is that the money needs to be taken out of the economy.  This is money where basically a big chunk of it is coming from multinational companies in profits on worldwide or European trading activity.  It is not being generated within Ireland in the way that the revenue of a pub might be.  This is money coming into the economy.  Essentially, with this very large amount of money coming in, if you spend it, that will contribute essentially to overheating the economy further.  If you bring more money in, prices will go up and housing will become more expensive.  It is quite important not to spend it.  It is important to invest it, probably outside the economy.  That is a way of keeping the economy on a balanced path.  This is the experience of Norway, which has a similar but much bigger issue with the oil revenue.  In the early 1990s what they did is they spent the oil money as it came in and their economy had a huge boom and then a big collapse at the point where the money came down.  It is at that point that they decided to set up a sovereign wealth fund, which invests the money.  One rule of that investment fund is that it must not invest any money in Norway.  It is all invested internationally.  If you go to Norway, you still see the impact of the oil money.  It is very expensive to buy anything there.  Some of the oil money is still coming into the economy in a way, but compared with what it would be like had they spent that money even on investment projects that yield a future return, it would have been very much more destabilising to their economy.  While it seems attractive to use these moneys for investment - and definitely using it for investment is better than using it for current spending - it is ultimately a question of trying to keep the economy on a balanced path.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":138,"content":"<p>We are in a bit of a difficulty here because our capital investment has been incredibly low historically.

What research has been done in terms of the capacity that exists within the different sectors before we get into a position of overheating?  I have heard the Government say in recent times, even in the housing market, that money is no longer an issue any more, that it is actually capacity.

The level of investment that we have now is historically the highest share of national income.  Government investment is somewhere around 6% nationally.  Most European countries are possibly at around 3% or 4%, so this is a very high level of investment.  As the Deputy rightly points out, the real constraint is not actually finding the money to finance it, it is the capacity of the economy and the construction sector to absorb this without running up costs.  We wrote a paper about this a year ago but, unfortunately, the people who wrote it are not with me today and my memory is a little bit sketchy.  Thousands of extra workers will be needed to meet the Government's target in the housing sector alone.  We are in a period of very low unemployment, and there are not a massive number of people around, either with the right skills or even just around, who could contribute to that.  The real constraint on all of this is the capacity at which we can build houses and insulate houses, which is very important for climate change, and at which we can build other forms of infrastructure.  That is the limit.  Trying to increase capital spending even more is likely to run up higher costs, as we were discussing earlier.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the overall macroeconomic imbalance, we could achieve this by funding it through higher taxes as well.

We are not health experts and are not trying to second guess the way the health system should run, but our interest is in the budgeting.<\/p> <p>  The pandemic has been an unusual period for the health system.  There have been significant pressures on the system and the people within it.  For example, even now we know that the health system was sanctioned for a large number of posts that it is unable to fill.  The big question is whether those posts will be filled.  If there are filled, that will create a big pay pressure.  We do not really know if that is budget for.<\/p> <p>  We had concerns from before the pandemic when the background was a bit more stable.  The budgeting process around health was very unsatisfactory.  Usually, the Government put in an amount for health that did not allow for the irregular stand-still and wage increases.  What used to happen was that there would be big health overruns during the year, but they would often only appear in October or November.  At this time of year, officially it would look as though the health spending was on budget, but we would discover at the end of the year that there was a big hole in it.  In the years before the pandemic, that was running at about &euro;500 million or &euro;600 million a year of overruns.  That hole was essentially being filled by corporation tax, which was a very unhealthy dynamic during that period.  Many things have changed since.

The report on wages raises a question on the approach of using tax measures as opposed to other measures.  There is also the need for an increase in the minimum wage to living wage levels because of inflation.  This has been highlighted by Social Justice Ireland and others.  The IFAC report highlighted that incomes in the top five sectors have been increasing while we have had static incomes in lower sectors.  The report states there has been a long-standing divergence between the higher paid sectors and other sectors in terms of the hourly wage.  By contrast, hourly wages in the lowest-paid sectors have barely increased in cash terms.  In real terms this is a decline when we have inflation, including inflation in basic costs such as the cost of food.<\/p> <p>  Will the witnesses comment on the need for fiscal measures that do not just address the cost of living in a general sense but are very much targeted to addressing lower incomes?  A few years ago, there was an International Monetary Fund, IMF, report that was compiled over 30 years across a number of economies.  It highlighted that when the incomes of the bottom 10% increase, it has a positive impact on the economy whereas increases in the incomes of the top 10% do not have the same effect in the economy and can have a negative effect.  I say this in the context mentioned by Mr. Barnes, namely, that while Covid had a negative impact on many, there are some whose wealth increased.  A report by Oxfam states that the wealth of just nine billionaires in Ireland increased by &euro;16 billion during the Covid period.  In this context, the concern is that tax measures, even if they are about shifting the index point, would benefit those in the higher bracket but we are still not having a conversation about a potential third tier of higher tax or measures to address the widening of the wealth gap and the income gap.<\/p> <p>  I have questions on two of the three medium-term challenges identified.  I might follow up on them later.  There is another shorter-term issue I want to highlight.  We know the fiscal rules have been suspended at EU level.  One of the reasons this is important is because it allows for front-loading, not only for day-to-day spending but also for investment.  Mr. Barnes mentioned that investment needs to be treated differently.  With regard to front-loading, what is long-term investment with potential long-term rental returns, I am concerned that a narrow approach to annual spending ends up costing us.  With the very rigid application of the fiscal rules in the decade since 2008 the EU and individual states lost a lot of time and opportunities to invest in public services and public service infrastructure.  Now we see gaps in public services, and these have been highlighted.  We have also lost time for the transition needed for climate change.<\/p> <p>  A specific area where fiscal reticence on spending may be driving inflation is housing.  We know the fiscal rules were cited, and continue to be cited even though they no longer apply at EU level, as a reason Ireland has adopted a leasing approach rather than a direct build and purchase approach for social housing.  The guarantee of leases with a profit margin, which are subsidised by State for investment funds, has incentivised investment funds to compete in the purchase of housing.  This has also had an inflationary impact on the cost of housing more generally.  This is an example of how not having public spending and creating a reliance on a market structure has driven up the cost of housing.  Will Mr. Barnes comment on these points?  I will then ask questions on the medium-term challenges he identified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#J00600","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  There is a theme that will run through my answers to these questions.  IFAC's concern is with the overall balance of the public finances and their sustainability and how much money the Government is putting into the economy compared to how much it takes out.  It is about making sure it is not destabilising to the economy and that we are not contributing to economic booms or busts.<\/p> <p>  On the Senator's first point, Mr. Timoney is the author of a paper that is extremely important in the context of understanding the Irish economy.  We have really had a trend divergence between higher income earners, in particular these are people working in certain sectors such as technology and pharmaceuticals, and others.  Many high-paid jobs are being created in these sectors.  The people who have these jobs have seen very big wage increases.  Other people in other sectors have not seen very much.  Although these trends are probably especially strong in Ireland, partly because the economy is growing quite fast, we see them in many other economies also.  The returns for a digital worker having certain digital skills and certain high skills have increased over time while the returns for other jobs that require lower skills or lower levels of education have fallen behind or stagnated.  It is very important to think about these trends.  This could also be added to the medium-term challenges.  The council does not take a view on what the right response is.<\/p><p>That is a matter for politicians and the Government.<\/p><p> This raises an important question, namely, if this is what society is like, what does that mean for the Government in the future?  We have already seen that thanks to Ireland's progressive tax system, this dynamic means that more income is going into the higher tax brackets.  It is too early to be very confident about it, but it looks like this is leading to a permanent shift in the economy towards paying more tax as a share of national income because more people are now earning at higher rates.  That money is available for other things, including for redistribution to other people in the economy.  Again, we are not saying that is what should happen.  However, it is illustrative of some of the big questions that need to be considered.<\/p><p> That leads to the question of investment.  There was a period following the crisis where public investment in Ireland was too low.  That was a concern raised by the council at the time.  Usually, we would not go so far as to comment on particular items, but we became worried that the level of public investment was so low that public capital stock was getting to a level that would be problematic for growth.  We raised those concerns at the time.  In many countries, there is a strong incentive for short-termist politicians to cut investment because the cost of that does not becomes immediately apparent and current spending can be kept at the same level, rather than making the choices they should be making which may be more difficult in terms of cutting or pulling back on other areas of spending or raising taxes.<\/p><p> As it happens, in Ireland's public investment has, fortunately, more than recovered.  We are at the highest share of national income we have ever seen on a sustained basis.  It is very high by international standards.  That is being done in the context not of massive public borrowing, leaving the pandemic aside, but because of the way policy has been run in the past couple of years.  That is quite a significant achievement.  As we discussed earlier, the real constraint on public investment now is the capacity of the economy to deliver on public investment and avoid inflation in those sectors and more generally.<\/p><p> The question of treatment in the fiscal rules is a different question.  In terms of the situation Ireland is in, we are managing to combine a very high level of public investment with sustainable management of the public finances and economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":162,"content":"<p>Housing is an example of public investment, but it is routed through a short-term mechanism in terms of leasing.  Under Housing for All, quite large amounts of money are being directed towards a leasing model.  It has been well documented that a flood of investors are seeking to capitalise on the 25-year social housing contracts that are more costly to the State in the medium to longer term.  While inflation is increasing generally, housing inflation is out of synch.  Can Mr. Barnes comment on that?<\/p> <p>  Adding income disparity as a potential medium-term challenge was mentioned.  Could Mr. Barnes discuss the importance of measures that seek to address not just the redistribution of social protection but also the cost-of-living measures that may be introduced and the need for measures to target those at the bottom tier?  A medium-term piece on income disparity was mentioned.  Could he address housing, which is both an immediate and medium-term issue, and the specific issues of leasing and additional costs?  I ask him to address the inclusion of profit margins as an additional cost to the State and the creation of inflationary pressure.  For example, increased social housing on a not-for-profit basis might have a deflationary effect.<\/p> <p>  I wanted to pick up on two of the three medium-term challenges Mr. Barnes identified.  He mentioned the pensions commission report.  There is a real problem with it in that it explicitly excluded one of the largest forms of expenditure on pensions in the State from its discussions.  In terms of fiscal planning for pensions and treating that within a closed loop of PRSI when we have another strand of public expenditure, namely, tax relief on private pensions, that does not seem to have been taken on board and properly considered.  A few years ago, we spent &euro;2.7 billion on private pension tax relief.  Research has shown that the money is largely going to those persons in the higher and ever-growing income strata that were mentioned.  Surely fiscal prudence would involve examining the tax expenditure on pensions, as well as PRSI, when we configure how we plan prudently for a pension for everybody in the State.<\/p> <p>  Carbon targets have been factored in in terms of expenditure.  It is a question we as a committee raised with the EU Commissioner for Budget and Administration.  Sustainability was mentioned.  Fiscal sustainability needs to be understood within the sustainable development goals and the wider frame of sustainability.  We are working within very set planetary thresholds.  Our fiscal and financial policies are, to a degree negotiable, but they are sitting inside a non-negotiable planetary boundary in terms of the available emissions space and our carbon budgets.  I ask Mr. Barnes to comment not just on the idea of expenditure on climate and environment policies but also on the proofing of our fiscal policies to ensure that they are sitting within a very rigid carbon budget.  I am aware that this is a discussion at EU and global level, as well as in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I ask him to comment on housing, in particular the fiscal prudence of targeted measures towards lower incomes.  The IMF has said targeted measures towards those on lower income tend to stay within the economy and have a less inflationary effect, in that such money tends to go on basic expendables.  In terms of preventative spending, the health impacts, for example, of cost of living issues at a lower income level can be very negative, such as people going hungry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#K00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":163,"content":"<p>There are a lot of questions there.

There are some areas where we would be more concerned that we are missing bigger effects, in particular on the climate side but also in terms of Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p> <p>  The work of the pensions commission was important.  Taken at face value, the commission's proposals would essentially address most, if not all, of the future rise in pension costs.  Those costs are going to be very big because people are living longer.<\/p><p>There will also be a 50% increase in the number of people reaching retirement age.  There are huge pressures there, and it is important that an adequate response is made to that.  Already, the tax measures that were included are quite substantial.  They may be the price that people are willing to pay to maintain the pension system as it stands.  However, it warrants careful consideration and a proper debate based on the choices available.  The easiest thing is to do nothing.  The longer we wait, however, the more expensive it will be to fix.<\/p><p> Specifically on tax relief, that was not included in our own modelling either.  It is a good point, and something we plan to revisit in the second wave of that modelling.  The amount of tax relief will vary over time as the demographics of the population change.  Pensioners are not taxed in the same way as people of working age, so there is also an effect to be built in there too.  We did not look at the public sector pensions particularly well either because of a lack of information.  There is work that can be done to improve the model.  I think we will do that when we next revisit the modelling.<\/p><p> On sustainability, the Senator is correct that these things must be seen in a wider context, including climate.  There is the cost of trying to avoid climate change and reduce emissions as well as mitigating its impact, especially in the Irish case, with protection against flooding and insurance risks from extreme weather.  There are many things there, and that is one reason the Government needs to have a full assessment of the economic and budgetary impact of these things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I am glad that Mr. Barnes has indicated an intention to use it in IFAC's modelling.

Mr. Barnes's opening statement contained a very carefully-worded paragraph about the tax package and how inflation effectively draws more income into higher tax bands.  We have seen a fiscal drag with the tax bands for many years.  You would have to have an enormous increase in the standard rate of tax threshold to bring it up to the average earnings.  In September, there is likely to be just over &euro;1 billion in a tax package on offer.  The Government has said that it will widen the tax bands.  If it does so by about &euro;1,500, an average worker will get about &euro;5.60 more per week.  My question is about the macroeconomic impact of that but also the distributional impact.  What is IFAC's view of the effectiveness of spending money on putting &euro;5 in a lot of people's pockets compared with an alternative source of spending?  What would be the macroeconomic impact?  Has IFAC done an analysis of that?

This very much depends on exactly what happens to wages, but in economic terms it keeps the tax system as it was before in real terms.  There is no real economic or distributional impact; it is keeping the system as it currently is.  If you did not make that adjustment more taxes would be going up and more income would be dragged into those higher categories.  In recently years we have seen partial indexation.  That means there has been some offset for that but not completely.  One of the reasons why income tax has grown quite strongly is that there is more income being drawn into those upper categories.  From an economic perspective, this is essentially neutral.  You can take a view as to whether you think it should be neutral or not but those sorts of changes would broadly be neutral in the real amount of tax people are paying as a share of their incomes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":170,"content":"<p>What about the distributional impact and the economic effectiveness of spending money in that manner by giving a small amount to a lot of people rather than putting it to an alternative use?

That would generate additional resources that could be used for something else, such as for childcare or to compensate people for the higher cost of living.  That is a political choice.  Those are two different ways that it could be organised.  As we noted earlier, one of the concerns with the Government's spending rule is that it does not allow for an offset on the tax side.  With the European spending rule, there is a certain amount that you can spend but you can increase that amount by having an offsetting tax increase, a revenue increase.  The spending rules that the Government has specified do not allow that to happen.

This is a choice, of course, but otherwise we are basically leaving the bill to younger people.  It will not be our grandchildren.  Anyone under the age of 50 will be subject to these kinds of tax increases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I am conscious that there has already been a discussion on corporation tax revenues and the need for greater capital investment.  I do not intend to replay it.  One thing I would like Mr. Barnes to clarify is the role of depreciation.  I heard what he said about us having record levels of investment now.  Regarding net investment levels, however, I was struck by the research IFAC carried out some years ago highlighting the significant catch-up and the high depreciation in this regard.  As a share of overall investment now, what value is being assigned to depreciation?  I ask this because many of us would believe catch-up required in this context is still significant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#M00500","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":178,"content":"<p>Regarding a good way to think about this aspect, we went through a period where, and the Senator may remember our reports better than we do, depreciation was not far away from the level of investment.  I do not recall whether it was higher or lower.  That was problematic because it meant the capital stock was not growing in line with the economy.  The national development plan runs out in ten years, but at the end of those ten years, as the Senator said, investment will still be high.  We will still have these rates of 6% of national income, which is high by historical standards.  What we do not have a sense of is what will happen after that.  It might be natural that investment would fall a little after that period, but it will not fall back to the low levels we had at some points in the past.<\/p> <p>  One of the reasons investment will not fall to such a low level is because we will need to keep investing to maintain what we have built in the past ten years.  We will have a bigger capital stock.  In order to maintain that, we will have to invest more money.  This is exactly the kind of factor that medium-term budgetary plans need to build in.  This is a less pressing issue now because we are ramping up the capital stock heavily.  The new investment is big relative to the depreciation of existing investment.  This future context is a real thing.  A common problem in the public finances of many countries is that people like to build new things, but it is less exciting to tell people that existing capital infrastructure will be repaired.  This means we end up with capital stock that gets depreciated and, essentially, gets lost.  Over the longer term, I would expect investment to be permanently higher than it has been on average in Ireland in the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":179,"content":"<p>That is enough for me.

Turning to the issue of halving our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and the impact of that on public finances, the council has stated that this impact has not been fully assessed or factored in.  Is the council talking about the agricultural sector, for example?  The Irish Farmers Association has proposed a cut of 22% in emissions.  The Government may then say it should be 30%.  Is Mr. Barnes saying that there has been no analysis of the impact such emissions cuts will have on agriculture or on other relevant sectors in the context of the changes to come?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#M01000","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":183,"content":"<p>That is right.  We are still discussing how we are going to achieve these changes.  We have seen emissions increasing all the time, particularly since the recovery.  We see them going up again now.  There must be agreement on what the plan is.  There must also be some costings of the different options.  As I said, there will be some direct impacts.  If we all move to using electric cars, for example, then we will lose revenues from motor fuel duties.  Those duties represent a substantial part of the public finances.  We will then either have to find something else to replace them or we will have to make some other adjustment.<\/p> <p>  As I said, regarding the investment aspect, we think the national development plan has allocated significant amounts of money to the transition we will need.  The situation in other areas is much less clear.  One of the big questions everywhere is how we can bring about the changes we want to achieve.  In a purely economic sense, we could regulate people, tell them they cannot make a certain emission anymore and that they must do this.  The reality of the situation, however, is that we will probably have to offer some incentives to get people to change their behaviours or to provide some compensation to those who suffer as a result of these changes.  It will be difficult to work out what these amounts will be.  The point is that we do not know what they will be, but they could be significant.<\/p> <p>  Electric cars continue to be expensive.  Many countries have incentive schemes to subsidise people to move to electric cars or to subsidise the infrastructure to support such a change in other ways.  All those endeavours involve a cost.  If, therefore, we are going to rely on such policies, we need to figure out how much we think the Government will need to pay to get people to change their behaviour in that way.  We can think of sectors that will have adverse impacts from this transition and it may well be that the Government will choose to compensate people, provide them with incentives or to help them with the transition.  All these allocations of funding would have an impact on the public finances and these costs need to be worked out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#M01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":184,"content":"<p>It will be announced in the next few weeks what figures will apply to each sector concerning cuts in emissions.

There is a similar organisation for climate there, and they work closely together.  They have done good analysis of this but, ultimately - this is a warning of a very different sort - they had a number of court rulings regarding the fact that they were not meeting their emissions goals but also regarding air pollution.  The Dutch authorities have had to take drastic action in terms of taking measures that are very costly but were needed to meet these short-term objectives.  That is partly a lesson that we need to plan and start taking action quickly because if we do not, we may have to make much more violent changes.  I do not know whether it happened, but there was a time when the Dutch were discussing a drastic limitation of speed on motorways as a way of getting air pollution down.

It is also because the Government borrowed quite a bit during the pandemic when it looked like it would have to borrow more for Covid supports.  In the end, that money was not used, so the Government is sitting on unusually high cash reserves.  Taken together, it is a high level of debt by historical standards.  It is high compared with several other small euro area countries.  There are several factors.  It is a concern.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of factors that are quite favourable to Ireland's position.  One is that the NTMA does a very good job, which is very helpful in terms of the financing position.  As Mr. Carroll mentioned, the maturity on debt is quite high, so we do not have to repay too much each year and it will be a long time until we have to replace the whole debt stock.  Even if interest rates went up, we would only be paying on any new borrowing we have, and we do not need to take out much new borrowing.  The budget is in reasonably good shape, at least in headline terms.  There is also the fact that the economy is likely to grow much faster than the rate of interest.  That naturally tends to bring the debt ratio down.  If we had not had the cost-of-living crisis and all these distortions, the debt ratio would have been on a fairly good downward path, which is consistent with the fact that the economy is growing fast, we are benefiting from the corporation tax boom and unemployment is low.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of favourable factors but there are also risks.  Of course, the higher the level of debt, the more one is exposed to those risks.  One risk we discussed is higher interest rates.  As we stated, that could take time to feed  through but would ultimately add pressure.  As all present are aware, there is not a huge amount of space for extra spending, even beyond the cost-of-living measures and the immediate crisis.  The other big risk is a shortfall in growth.  If something were to happen to the Irish economy, such as the multinationals all going somewhere else or that kind of thing, that could make our debt position look a lot worse.  The big risk is probably on the growth side.  The other risk relates to the public finances.<\/p><p>The plan to have a 5% spending rule is a good one.  It would keep debt on a good trajectory.  If the Government of the day were to deviate from that on a persistent basis, if these pension, health, climate pressures and other things were to lead the Government to run a very different fiscal policy from the one it plans, those things are a risk to the public finances when there are high levels of debt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022071300002#N01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sebastian Barnes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Is what we are doing this year really an option?

Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Before we deal with the item on the agenda, we just want to deal with the issue of aviation.  We issued an invitation to Ms Lynne Embleton, the CEO of Aer Lingus, to appear before us next week.  Despite the repeated requests we have made, representatives from the airline have refused to appear before us.  We find that unacceptable.  We will be issuing a press statement to this effect and we will reissue the invitation to its representatives today.  We are receiving countless queries and complaints from passengers.  Aer Lingus is a huge airline and we will expect representatives of the company to come in before us next Wednesday.<\/p> <p>  The least the company can do is to explain the current position to its customers and to the public.  Our role as a committee concerned with transport, and as representatives elected by the people, is to assist in getting public information out.  We wish to do a collective body of work in this regard next week.  Aer Lingus is an integral part of that undertaking and the invitation I referred to will be going out to the company.  We look forward to Ms Embleton appearing before us next Wednesday.  <\/p> <p>  Senator Buttimer also made a proposal regarding Aer Lingus during the week.  In the context of national aviation policy, we will be undertaking work on this at the start of the next parliamentary year.  We have called for the review of the national aviation policy to get under way immediately.  Our colleague, Deputy Carey, has also put a proposal before us to the effect that we would seek to commence work in this regard immediately in September.  We have scheduled that in the work programme.  I look forward to doing that.  I call Senator Buttimer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#B00100","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I endorse Deputy Carey's proposal regarding the future of our aviation sector and industry.  This committee has worked collectively to support this sector during Covid-19.  Given the difficulties and issues facing the sector now, it is important that the future of our national aviation policy is reflected upon and changed.<\/p> <p>  I voice my disappointment and annoyance at the decision of representatives of Aer Lingus not to come before us next week.  It is incredible in the context of an airline that was responsible last week alone for the cancellation of approximately 100 flights from Dublin Airport.<\/p><p>The vast majority - 70% - of the cancelled flights from Dublin Airport were Aer Lingus flights.  It is unacceptable that we are held in such contempt by the airline, given the substantial payment provided to it  during the Covid-19 pandemic.<br\/><br\/>I received an email at 8.12 a.m. and the heading on it is &quot;Another wonderful move by Aer Lingus&quot;.  I want to read it into the record, although I will not name the sender.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>\tDear Mr Buttimer, I hope you are well.<br \/><br \/>Yesterday, July 12th flight EI107 from Dublin to JFK New York was cancelled.  We sat on the runway for three hours and then we were summarily told to get off, find our own accommodation and wait for an email from Aer Lingus for further information.  Getting off the plane, we were met with a skeleton crew who had no concrete or usable information.  As I had booked my flight through Expedia, I contacted them for updates.  It is now 8.04 on Wednesday morning.  Aer Lingus have still not updated their systems with Expedia to reflect the cancellation.  Incompetence, arrogance and a lack of concern for their passengers have been one reason I will never fly Aer Lingus again.  (I now add criminally understaffed).  They have had two years plus to boost and train staff in as they knew that Covid was going to be a recurring issue.  This should not be a huge surprise to them.  I made the mistake of giving them a chance.  That will never happen again.  And while we're at it, they might get someone to clean the bathrooms in the airport and pick up the rubbish.  [That is a different matter] <\/blockquote><p>The person signs off the email from the Travelodge in Swords.<br\/><br\/>This is one example given by a person I have never spoken to earlier this morning.  The attitude of the airline is unacceptable.  The behaviour of management towards us and, more importantly, the travelling public is completely unacceptable.  We have an obligation on behalf of the travelling public to hold Aer Lingus to account.  The airline is responsible for a huge proportion of the transatlantic flights coming into and going out of Ireland.  In that context, it is important that we hold it to account.  The August bank holiday weekend is coming up.  It is probably going to be the second-busiest weekend of the summer.  In terms of the number of passengers who have been discommoded or left unable to travel, what Aer Lingus has done is worse than the meltdown we saw with the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, in the third week of May.  What is equally bad is the reputational damage done to our country in terms of how tourists and people coming here see, regardless of whether it is their first or last experience of Ireland, what is happening.  It is not good enough.  I ask the Chair to have the secretariat invite representatives of Aer Lingus to come before the committee to appear before us next week, the week after or at some point prior to the summer recess.  It is not good enough to say that they will come before us in the autumn or at some later date.

We should do the work to which I refer in the autumn in parallel with the work that is going to be done by the Department.  We can, in turn, feed our report into that work.

It is extremely important that we bring Aer Lingus in to discuss what is happening with cancellations, baggage handling and all of its services, particularly as we head into the busiest time of the year for aviation.

I am principal officer of the climate delivery division, which is part of the new climate action pillar established in the Department in the past 12 months.  I am joined this afternoon by my colleague Ms Patricia Waller.  In the climate delivery division, Ms Waller and I work on facilitating the transition to electric vehicles in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The Climate Action Plan 2021 has set a high ambition for the electrification of transport, with a target of almost 1 million electric vehicles on Irish roads in 2030, including private cars, small public service vehicles, light and heavy goods vehicles and larger public transport vehicles.  The Government strategy to increase the uptake of electric vehicles in Ireland involves two main elements.  First is incentivising the purchase of electric vehicles through both financial supports and regulation and second is the provision of a high-quality, seamless electric vehicle charging infrastructure.  There has been significant investment from the private sector in delivering EV charging infrastructure in Ireland and this has been critical in supporting the uptake of electric vehicles to date.  However, in anticipation of much-needed step change increase in electric vehicle ownership, it is appropriate and necessary for the Government to set a framework and national plan for the provision of Ireland&rsquo;s EV charging infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  In this light, the Department developed a draft EV charging infrastructure strategy and issued it for public consultation in March of this year.  The strategy considers the different charging needs of urban and rural communities, as well as the need for a just transition to EVs in Ireland.  In developing principles to underpin the roll-out of EV charging infrastructure, the strategy takes into account the anticipated trajectory of EV uptake and the increasing demand that will be placed on electricity distribution networks through the electrification of transport.  Currently, the majority of EV charging, about 80%, is done at home.  Access to and installation of home charging infrastructure is relatively well established in Ireland.  A more significant gap exists in the provision of publicly accessible charging infrastructure, the demand for which will grow as EV uptake increases.  The strategy identifies four main categories of charging infrastructure, all serving different user needs depending on where and when people need to charge their EVs.  The first category is home charging or multi-resident unit or apartment charging.  It is expected that this will be the default charging option for the vast majority of people living in Ireland.<\/p><p>This type of charging will be standard, requiring a number of hours for a vehicle's battery to be 80% charged.  The strategy proposes that off-peak or night-time charging should be encouraged to ease demand on the grid.  The strategy also proposes promoting shared charging solutions.  This would be an Airbnb-type system for home chargers, whereby the owner would rent out his or her home charger, typically via a third-party app.  For people who do not have the access or the space to install their own home charging solutions, the strategy proposes that residential or neighbourhood charging solutions are developed in higher density residential areas.  These would replicate the home charging solution by providing standard and, preferably, off-peak charging options.  This concept has been successfully delivered in cities such as London, Oslo and Amsterdam to support the uptake of electric vehicles.<\/p><p> A variety of top-up charging solutions are then also needed for people who need to charge their batteries while on the go.  These solutions include destination charging, which involves a faster charge at a trip location or destination, taking typically between one to three hours to charge, depending on the duration of the visit, and en-route charging, which would more or less replicate the current forecourt refuelling option used by internal combustion engine vehicle drivers.  En-route charging will be in locations where the only purpose is to refuel, that is, there is no other reason for stopping there.  Therefore, en-route charging infrastructure needs to be at the highest charge power capacities.  Ideally, a charge at these locations should not take more than ten to 20 minutes, and that time will even come down in future years.<\/p><p> The strategy also sets out a high-level plan for the delivery of charging infrastructure over the coming years, with key delivery groups proposed to take forward the implementation of the strategy.  As well as publicly accessible charging infrastructure, there will be a need to consider charging infrastructure for niche sectors such as the electric small public service vehicle, eSPSV, sector and for the piloting of EV charging infrastructure for heavy goods vehicles.<\/p><p> A key element of the delivery plan is the establishment of an office called zero-emission vehicles Ireland, ZEVI, which will be launched next week and will co-ordinate the implementation of the EV infrastructure strategy and the delivery of EV charging infrastructure.  The office will be based in the Department of Transport and supported and resourced by colleagues in a number of agencies, including the SEAI; Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII; the National Transport Authority, NTA; and ESB Networks.<\/p><p> We were very pleased with the level of engagement with the strategy through the public consultation, with over 13,000 responses to the online survey.  One hundred stakeholders participated in two half-day strategy workshops, and we received about 60 detailed written submissions to the strategy.  The consultation responses are being reviewed, and we expect a revised strategy to be published alongside an implementation plan by the end of this year.<\/p><p> Finally, I should note that electric vehicle technology is changing rapidly, with new technologies being developed and introduced to the market at speed.  In this fast-changing context, while the overall trajectory of action is clear, predicting the specifics of charge point types and interfaces that will be available by the end of this decade is less so.  For that reason, while the strategy sets out the long-term structures and frameworks that will be put in place to deliver a comprehensive national EV charging network, the detail in the strategy relating to infrastructure delivery is mainly focused on the years from now until 2025.  In 2025 the strategy will be reviewed, with an updated strategy published for the years from 2026 to 2030.  That will review progress to date and reassess and refine the provisions, initiatives and funding pathways for future delivery.  We look forward to continuing our work in this area.  I am happy to take or to share any questions with my colleague.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#D00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aoife O'Grady","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":237,"content":"<p>We now turn to Mr. Meally for his opening statement on behalf of the SEAI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#E00200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I thank you, Chair, and joint committee members for the invitation to attend the meeting today and to discuss the Government's draft EV charging infrastructure strategy.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Graham Brennan, the programme manager for EV charging infrastructure.  I thank the committee for affording me the opportunity to present my opening statement.<\/p> <p>  The SEAI is at the forefront of delivering Ireland's energy revolution.  We are funded by the Government of Ireland through the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Transport.  We have had a major transformative impact on the Irish economy, and in the past decade our actions have underpinned more than &euro;1.2 billion in energy savings.  We are catalysts for action through our grant and incentive programmes and our capacity-building processes.  Citizens, communities, businesses and other stakeholders are at the heart of everything we deliver.<\/p> <p>  Transport is the single largest source of energy-related emissions in Ireland, representing about 40% of energy-related emissions, equivalent to about 20% of all greenhouse gas emissions.  While this decreased temporarily during the Covid-19 pandemic, it has since rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, despite even the dramatic fuel price increases in recent months.  The majority of transport emissions come from road transport, approximately 50% from private car users and 25% from freight and commercial fleets, which is difficult to decarbonise due to the dominance of the combustion engine and its associated fuel supply infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  Since 2011 the SEAI has actively promoted the purchase of electric vehicles, including battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles but excluding hybrid electric vehicles, and the associated charging infrastructure in Ireland.  Today we have over 60,000 EVs on our roads, representing about 2.7% of our total car fleet.  The annual sales rate of EVs has grown massively in 2022, representing 21%, or one in five, of all new car sales, up from 13% for the same period last year.  Demand for EVs is high all across the EU and the UK, with six-month waiting lists not uncommon for prospective car buyers.  If Ireland is to reach its target of 845,000 passenger EVs on the roads by 2030, representing 40% of the total car fleet, the EV sales rate will need to reach 100% of all new cars before the end of the decade.  That will require determined investment in public charging infrastructure and efforts to provide charging facilities to the more difficult locations such as on-street, apartment and multi-unit development-type locations.  The SEAI therefore welcomes the publication of the draft EV charging infrastructure strategy by the Department of Transport.<\/p> <p>  We are providing insights and expertise to our colleagues in the Department of Transport to assist the development of the EV charging infrastructure strategy and we look forward to the finalisation and delivery of the strategy as a key part of the overall shift to zero-emissions transport.  Adequate infrastructure is a key enabler of EV uptake in Ireland and can ensure that all vehicle users can complete their necessary journeys with confidence.  Infrastructure must be installed across a range of locations, including private, commercial and public sites, and involves a range of parties, including planners, electricity operators and IT systems.  The strategy aims to bring these interests together under one roof within the new ZEVI collaborative initiative under the Department of Transport.  The SEAI is pleased to continue to provide its expertise and services to this group in order to deliver on the climate action plan.<\/p> <p>  The SEAI's work supports the delivery of the climate action plan and Ireland's emissions reduction targets, including transport actions to support businesses, the public sector, and citizens and communities on their transition to low-emissions transport solutions.  The SEAI's work is integral to the achievement of major targets and policy objectives and includes promotion of EV uptake towards the national EV target by 2030 via grant support for private and commercial vehicles, information supports, interactive comparative tools, fleet guidance, dealer training and awards, transport energy awards, behavioural change campaigns and EV fleet trials.  The national EV target is currently the largest contribution to transport emissions reductions in the Climate Action Plan 2021, with a projected 3.2 Mt CO2 attributed to the target.  Promoting vehicle charging solutions availability to homes, businesses and public bodies via grant support for home chargers, apartment chargers, local authority chargers, and destination and community-based chargers is part of our remit.  The SEAI's work also involves supporting efficiency and emissions reductions in the public transport fleet - that is, public transport, local authority and other public sector fleets - through our public sector programmes and through supporting business fleet electrification via guidance, case studies and grant support for vehicles and charging.  Our work also involves supporting community low-emissions transport initiatives via our sustainable energy community network and community energy grants.  The SEAI was a leading agency supporting the work of the low-emissions vehicles task force, which published numerous reports on key activities to drive the adoption of low-emissions vehicles in Ireland.  The SEAI is also a member of the electric vehicle policy pathway working group, which presented its report to the Government in 2021.  As part of that group, the SEAI behavioural economics team completed a study which outlined the EV customer journey and identified the barriers to be addressed, many of which have been actioned since the report was presented to the Government.  The SEAI's work also involves delivering state-of-the-art energy modelling, policy analysis and advice and collating national energy statistics.  We drive and support national energy research to support innovative research and development activities in support of national emissions reduction targets.<\/p> <p>  We passionately believe that the clean energy transition must happen urgently, and we stand ready to support all of Irish society on this journey.<\/p><p>EVs offer one of the most promising and accessible options for reducing tailpipe emissions from road vehicles.  Importantly, with an ambition and capability of producing 80% of our electricity from our own renewable energy resources, we have the opportunity of removing our dependence on imported energy and stabilising our own transport energy costs into the future.  Electrifying the transport fleet will complement the growth in renewable electricity by providing a mechanism to store the electricity and eventually provide electricity back to the network to provide support to the network when needed.  Operating the number of electric vehicles desired by 2030 will require comprehensive and reliable charging infrastructure options and, importantly, will require intelligent management of vehicle charging via the home and via a smart grid.  The SEAI is ready to support the deployment of this infrastructure, develop new tools and methods to maximise this opportunity and carefully guide the public with the necessary information to make their change to electric vehicles go as smoothly as possible.  We thank our colleagues in the Department of Transport for their support for our transport programmes and close collaboration.  I welcome discussion with the committee, and my colleague and I are happy to answer any questions members may wish to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Meally","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Meally.

The ESB's strategy, Driven to Make a Difference: Net Zero by 2040, sets out a clear roadmap for the ESB to achieve net zero emissions by 2040.  It also commits the ESB to a science-based target for 2030 to provide assurance that we are decarbonising our operations at the necessary pace and scale.  Our support of e-cars is one of the means we will use to help us achieve these goals.  We are here to address the committee as representatives of ESB e-cars.  Mr. John Byrne, head of e-cars joins me here today.  We are mindful that the committee may have questions for ESB Networks on connections and related matters.  As discussed with the secretariat, these will be addressed by ESB Networks directly in the coming months as we are not here to speak for ESB Networks.<\/p> <p>  I will give some background on ESB e-cars.  The ESB established ESB e-cars in 2010.  We believed that we could support the electrification of transport by seeding, developing and supporting the transition to electromobility.  We recognised that charging infrastructure and support services would need to be in place to give citizens the confidence to purchase an electric vehicle.  There was no onus on the ESB to provide the infrastructure, but it was a role we embraced given our commercial semi-State status and interest in supporting low-carbon technologies.  ESB e-cars was established with three aims: to design and build an expanding public charging infrastructure for EVs across Ireland, thereby reducing the range anxiety that was an issue for early e-car drivers; to support the adoption of EVs in Ireland; and subsequently to stimulate demand for EVs nationally.  In recent years, the demand for EVs has increased dramatically.  Since ESB e-cars was established, we have expanded the network to provide ultra-reliable and fully interoperable EV charging with more than 1,350 public charge points servicing customers across the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  There are three types of chargers on our network.  The standard 22 kW is the most widely available charger on the network.  They are geographically located so that an EV driver is always within 35 km of the nearest charger.  These AC chargers will typically charge an electric vehicle in three to six hours depending on battery size.  The fast charger is a 50 kW charger and we have approximately 150 of them.  These are DC chargers and are substantially faster than the standard chargers.  An 80% charge will typically take 45 minutes.  The high-powered 150 kW chargers are located in hubs and are capable of charging two vehicles simultaneously.  These units can provide the latest generation of EVs with 100 km of range in as little as six minutes.  ESB e-cars is currently undertaking a &euro;20 million investment programme to further expand and enhance the charging network across Ireland.  The ESB qualified for &euro;10 million in funding from the Climate Action Fund with the ESB matching the funding with a further &euro;10 million.  This comprehensive investment programme is expanding and enhancing the public charging network across Ireland to help to meet the expected growth in EVs in the coming years.<\/p> <p>  There are three different elements to the current investment programme.  The first element is the replacement of 264 legacy standard AC chargers, and this is already 99% complete.  The second element is the upgrade of 52 locations to provide fast charging; this is 75% complete and the remainder will be completed in 2023.  The third element is to develop 52 high-power charging, HPC, hubs throughout Ireland, which can charge multiple vehicles simultaneously.  This is a substantial component of the upgrade and will see 52 HPC hubs being constructed as we negotiate access to both motorway and national road sites.<\/p> <p>  Data-driven analytics help to identify and locate the most suitable sites for hubs.  HPC hubs can charge up to eight vehicles simultaneously and can provide up to 100 km of electric driving range in as little as six minutes.  To date, 18 hubs have been completed, with a further 11 in various stages of construction.  We expect them to be completed in 2022, with the remainder to be completed in 2023.  These works will significantly modernise and strengthen the charging network by upgrading all charging points in strategic locations to cater for all EVs, adding next-generation charging hubs to the network.  We are committed to ensuring that our public charging network is reliable and that EV drivers have confidence in it.  Since the commencement of our investment programme, our reliability rate has increased from 84% to an average of 98% this year.<\/p> <p>  ESB e-cars firmly believes that the transition to zero-carbon transport will require a whole-of-system approach.  We need to see much more active travel - walking, cycling, etc. - and increased use of public transport.  However, there is likely be a strong desire for cars given the particular demographics and geography of Ireland.  Where this is the case, there are huge benefits in terms of both air quality and emissions from electric-powered vehicles.  In addition to private transport, significant volumes of both light and heavy freight continue to operate in the country but will eventually need to be decarbonised.  Electricity will therefore play an ever-increasing role here as battery performance improves and ever larger vehicles can be electrified.  Therefore, in time, more charging infrastructure will be required to support Ireland to reach the target of almost 1 million EVs on the road by 2030, as reasserted in the Climate Action Plan 2021.<\/p> <p>  The first round of climate action funding has been instrumental in delivering additional charging locations, improved reliability, faster charging times for drivers and a substantial reduction in carbon emissions.  The number of charging sessions on our system has tripled since the beginning of 2021 and we now reach approximately 70,000 sessions per month.<\/p> <p>  The ESB welcomes the recently published draft strategy, EV Charging Infrastructure Strategy 2022-2025.  We are delighted to have had the opportunity to participate in the workshops hosted by the Department of Transport and to input into the development of the strategy, as we are doing today.  ESB e-cars fully supports the strategy.  There is of course much work ahead to build on this important strategy, which we understand will be led by ZEVI, which is to be launched soon.  We look forward to collaboration with other stakeholders on developing the implementation plan to support the high-level strategy.  We note that while 80% of current EV charging is estimated to take place at home, this proportion will decrease over time as the EV fleet grows and the demographic of EV owners shifts.  In excess of 70% of EV owners are customers of ESB e-cars and we undertake regular customer surveys of our customer base.  The prioritisation of smart home charging from the end of 2022 represents a positive development and should, over time, help to alleviate pressure on the electricity grid at times of high demand.  The visibility that EV drivers will have of their charging profiles and energy demand will be further improved through smart meters, which will allow all customers to view their energy consumption in half hourly intervals.<\/p> <p>  Destination charging is a complex topic with widely varying dwell times depending on the situation and location.  The strategy must allow for a variety of charging approaches depending on the situation, which typically requires case-by-case analysis.<\/p><p>We welcome the statement that the new ZEVI office will place a renewed strategic focus on delivering high-powered public charge points in heavily trafficked areas and along key parts of the national road network.  Based on our analysis, we have already seen that demand for higher speed top-up charging is increasing with a greater number of electric vehicles on the road.  It is unclear from the strategy as to whether local fuel stations that are not located on primary or motorway routes will be included for future funding rounds nor is it clear whether they will be classified as destination or <i>en route<\/i>charging.  There are several hundred petrol stations across Ireland so clarity would be welcome around the treatment of these locations and whether these assets will be included in future funding rounds.<br\/><br\/>ESB e-cars would like to work with all relevant stakeholders to accelerate the timeline for the development of a pathway for the delivery of high-powered <i>en route<\/i>charging infrastructure on the strategic road network.  This is currently due for delivery in quarter 2 of 2023.  Earlier certainty on the requirement for this critical infrastructure will in turn allow for more infrastructure to be delivered within the period of this strategy.  The sooner we have the strategy, the sooner we can deliver on these goals.<br\/><br\/>Further clarity could be provided on the destination charging point schemes funding, including who is eligible to apply.  In addition, while individual landowners can apply for grant funding and then choose to run and operate the sites on an individual basis, this would have obvious implications for interoperability across the network.  ESB e-cars would welcome the opportunity to input into a set of key criteria for EV charging locations.<br\/><br\/>Ease of use and charge point interoperability will be a key enabler to mass adoption.  Electronic payments should become the default option at all charging locations.  EU regulations will likely require this in time.<br\/><br\/>We note that the ESB Networks&rsquo; Dingle Project was successful in assessing EV uptake and attitudes to EVs in rural areas.  The findings from the study were particularly informative from an EV perspective.  Of particular interest was that the average daily distance driven was approximately 80 km and the willingness of customers to embrace and harness the new EV technology made available under the trial.  Our existing charger network in Kerry saw an increased utilisation during the trial period and led to the roll-out of additional high-powered charging hubs in County Kerry.<br\/><br\/>The working groups and taskforce outlined by the strategy form a key part of driving towards delivery.  It is crucial to engage stakeholders from across the full spectrum of consumers, industry experts, original equipment manufacturers, and the public and private sectors.  ESB e-cars and other charging point operators should be facilitated in each of the working groups as much as possible because much of the delivery learnings have been acquired by these companies in recent years.<br\/><br\/>Most of the supports mentioned in the strategy are primarily capital driven.  While capital investment is most welcome and required by the industry, due consideration should also be given to providing early support to charge point operators to contain operating costs.  The period between now and 2025 is a particularly challenging period while national demand for EVs grows.  A moratorium on capacity costs at locations with high electrical capacity requirements should be explored and implemented where possible.<br\/><br\/>ESB has made a significant commitment over the past decade to support and encourage the transition to zero carbon transport and EVs on a universal basis.  ESB e-cars has grown to become the leading provider of EV charging infrastructure across Ireland.  We will continue to play a central role in the provision of ever faster, ultra-reliable charging infrastructure across Ireland over the next decade.  The electrification of transport and empowering and supporting customers and communities to achieve net zero will remain a key component in ESB&rsquo;s strategy and commitment over the next decade.<br\/><br\/>Mr. John Byrne and I are happy to address any questions that committee members may have at this time. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Suzanne Ward","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Ward.

There are a couple of reasons behind that, one of which is the need to provide EV charging infrastructure for people who do not have access to their own driveway.  I would not anticipate that the rates would be quite as cheap as home charging but we want to be able to provide a slower charge at lower rates when people can charge at night so it does not become prohibitively expensive for them to charge their EV.  Local authorities as road authorities in Ireland have control over that local and regional road network.  That is step one where we see them being a key partner.<\/p> <p>  Step two is that local authorities themselves are often landowners and own land with significant public car parking space, whether that is municipal offices, leisure centres or libraries.  We would see those types of publicly accessible car parks as being ideal locations for destination charging.  We have identified in the strategy that we would anticipate working very closely with local authorities in rolling out that.  In the context of the strategy we have identified that we would support local authorities through providing funding for them to identify what we would call a local area charging network.  That could be done on a regional basis with a number of local authorities, or if there is one very large local authority they might do one just for them.  That would identify the locations where one might have the neighbourhood charging and the destination charging in that local authority area.  It would identify an implementation plan about the prioritisation and the series in which these would be rolled out.  On that basis, we would have a sense of the right size and the right fit for EV chargers in that local authority area with regard to the public and State-owned lands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#G00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aoife O'Grady"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":251,"content":"<p>Returning to step one, in my constituency and throughout the country, and particularly in housing estates that were built less than 20 years ago, homes would have no front gardens but would have parking bays at the front.<\/p><p>Many people feel excluded from getting on board with EVs.

The grant provides &euro;600 towards the installation of the charger.  There may be a need for upgrading in the home for various reasons.  It might not be just because of the electric car.  The authority on the safe operation of electricity in the home, Safe Electric, makes sure that chargers are only installed in safe situations.  The grant is only for the charging infrastructure.  It is not for upgrading the wiring because is not within the remit of the programme.  Perhaps it is something that could be discussed in the future but it is not covered.  There are varying costs, but a charger and its installation would cost in or around &euro;800 to &euro;1,000.  The &euro;600 grant goes towards the cost of that.  The need for upgrading and additional wiring varies across different homes.  The cost of that varies depending on the age of the home.<\/p> <p>  If I could step back in terms of the first questions on EVs and the charging of EVs, I will allow Mr. Brennan to come in on the point of the home charging.  Why are EVs good for Ireland?  One, we can supply the fuel ourselves by generating it locally.  Therefore, local fuel supply can provide security of supply.  Two, we have relatively short distances to travel.  Cars now have a range of 400 km, which will cover anywhere in the country where we need to go, so they are ideal in this situation.<\/p> <p>  Where do we expect charging to be done?  We expect 80% of that will be done at home.  The phrase I have used before is, \"You charge when you are stopped.  You do not stop to charge.\"  It is not like a splash-and-dash at home and then get the fuel and the groceries and all of that.  It is a different mindset.  People will be planning their journey and saying whether they need a splash-and-dash for three or four minutes just to get me through those last few kilometres and then charge it when the car is sitting at home overnight.  That is why the home charging infrastructure and working with those hard to reach dwellings, such as apartments and others, are so critical as part of the strategy.  I will allow Mr. Brennan to speak about the piece of work we are doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Meally"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":256,"content":"<p>In terms of feedback, has Mr. Brennan heard that the extra electrical work is prohibitive for people getting the infrastructure in place?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#H00500","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":257,"content":"<p>There are a number of human factors here that we need to think about.  Electricians are being asked to go to homes and they have it in their heads that the installation of a charger is a fixed piece of work costing &euro;1,200.  When they go to a house, they are supposed to check the wiring that is there.  If they find the wiring to be undersized, according to the rules, they are supposed to upgrade the wiring.  Is that always happening?  Is the electrician saying that it is fine because it has done the homeowner for the past eight years?  There is an opportunity with the roll-out of smart meters.  While ESB Networks are changing the meters, there is a chance to figure out how many places need upgrading.  The rule of thumb is that if a house was built before 1996, there is a risk that the wiring is low in that regard.  I have not seen that become a major issue, but we are starting to see it because we are inquiring about it.  We are hearing of more cases where wiring is being upgraded with ESB Networks and Safe Electric.<\/p> <p>  On the point about the hardest cases for people who live in urban areas, such as Rathmines, being to get supply across a footpath, there are two solutions we are looking at.  One solution is to place a gully in the ground, and the other is to have an overhanging arm.  People are trying these solutions but everybody is afraid of the liability and questioning if it is within planning laws.  If we could get those questions answered, we would include them in the grant scheme and, thereby, widen our net.<\/p> <p>  The forecourt guys have a very small footprint, so they are worried about the size of all the charging equipment.

How is that modelled and what is needed between now and 2025?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#H00800","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":260,"content":"<p>We are doing work to try to establish that through, for example, the local authority side.  There are so many variables feeding into it.  Let us assume that between 70% to 75% of homes could have access to home charging.  If all of those homeowners use overnight home charging, they would always leave their home with a battery that is charged to 80%.  In new vehicles, that would provide a 300 km to 400 km journey.  For most trips in Ireland, that would mean they would not need to top up unless it is a very long distance.<br\/><br\/>We want to put in charging points at places that are convenient for people to use.  We heard that a 50 kW charging point takes between 45 and 50 minutes to provide an 80% top-up.  People are not going to stop and charge somewhere and sit for 45 to 50 minutes.  Our plan is to put that type of charging unit in or around trip destinations, where people are going anyway for a purpose.  It is either a supermarket, library, sports club, or swimming pool.  While they are there, they can charge their vehicle and it is ready to go when they come out.  There is also the <i>en route <\/i>charging, which is done for very long distance journeys.<br\/><br\/>What we have is a system whereby we know how much power the cars that we want to have on the roads in 2030 will require.  The challenges and difficulties are in analysing how that will be divided between the different types of charging and the different kilowatts.  The alternative fuel infrastructure regulation, AFIR, proposal is coming through the EU at present, which will set a mandatory regulation for the provision of high-powered charging along the trans-European transport network, TEN-T, core and additional motorway network.  That has to be done regardless of what we think our modelling needs.  That will be an EU regulation.<br\/><br\/>Over the coming six to 12 months, we plan to work with local authorities to identify what they have within their power to do, both in the context of neighbourhood charging and destination charging.  We will also launch destination charging schemes by the end of this year for sporting organisations so that people can have them in sports clubs.<\/p><p>We expect that through this process, we will get a sense over time of where the charging will go, the power that will be attached to it and then we will see where the gaps are.  It is an incremental process.<\/p><p> The other factor that is changing is that the battery lives of the vehicles are improving all the time.  Ten years ago, when we were starting out, one got 200 km to 250 km on a charged battery.  This year, most of the vehicles that are new to the market are giving 400 km to 500 km, with some coming in at 700 km.  In five years time, a 700 km range on the battery may be standard for a vehicle in Ireland, which will cover almost any single journey a driver might want to make.  This means that if drivers have access to a home charger, they will not need to top up elsewhere.<\/p><p> The issue is very complicated, with a lot of variables and assumptions.  It is impossible to say at this point what we will need by 2030.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#H00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aoife O'Grady","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":262,"content":"<p>Following on from that, we can potentially see a scenario in which, as the quality of batteries and chargers improve, a huge amount of the charging will happen at home.

My question is in regard to the notion that it will be a case of build it and they will come and the idea of induced demand.  It is the notion that the State will say, \"Here is the infrastructure\", and people will go out and use it.  Does that happen?

Anecdotally, from talking to people I know, they keep telling me their next car will be an EV because the infrastructure is not there at the moment.  They are not yet ready to make the commitment but they will be in a few years.  Part of that might be perception and the sense they need to see every forecourt with an EV charger.  There may be a need for a mind shift in drivers towards the idea of home charging.  People may not yet be able to visualise that.<\/p> <p>  There are pressures arising from oil costs and fuel demands that will nudge people towards purchasing EVs now there is availability of longer-range batteries.  Even without a home charger, a long-range battery might only need to be charged once a week or once a fortnight.  The cost of purchasing and running an EV will be weighed up in terms of the cost of electricity.  There is an awareness that the resale value of an internal combustion engine, ICE, vehicle will dive in a few years' time.  People know the shift is coming.  Approximately 22% of all cars sold in Ireland in the first few months of this year were sold with a plug attached.  Colleagues in Oslo tell me that was the tipping point for them.  Once they hit 20%, they got to 80% in approximately four to five years.  I do not whether that will happen in Ireland because we have other issues in terms of costs and we also have supply chain issues at the moment.  However, in terms of consumer perception, once we get to one fifth of the fleet being electric, everyone recognises that now is the time to move.

For instance, most people feel they would need to charge their cars on a more regular basis than is the case.

Some of the relevant inputs would be the traffic volumes and flows at a particular site, the capacity and speed of the infrastructure and whether the flows and location will support that infrastructure.  Another factor is the space that is available on the site.  Typically, the space that is required for EV charging infrastructure, depending on the scale of the operation we plan to build at a site, can be excessive.  It requires planning permission in many cases.  In some locations, space can be at a real premium, particularly in heavily urbanised areas.

That is indicating a step change every year.  The number of EVs being sold every year continues to increase significantly.  There are headwinds coming our way that we did not anticipate in 2021 in the form of the global supply chain shortages.  We know from contacts within industry that the number of EVs available on the market this year is much less than the industry anticipated this time last year.  We can see it ourselves.  Several people who have ordered an EV, including myself, are waiting for one.  The supply chain shortages started with Covid and the container shortages and then there were the shutdowns in China leading to low factory production.  Now we have the war in Ukraine adding additional layers in.  At the moment we are not quite sure when those shortages are going to be relieved and when we might get back to business as usual in the supply of EVs to the market.

Some people, ideologically, were willing straight away when the first generation of EVs became available to throw the car keys out the window and buy an EV; however, others were less willing.  For some people it must make economic sense and there must be an infrastructure, so there is a bit of a pioneering element to all this.  I am probably in that bracket.  I cycle and I take the train to the D&aacute;il but I have a diesel car for getting around Clare.  To be honest, I do not yet trust there is enough infrastructure on the ground and there are an awful lot of people like that.  They will wait until the infrastructure is there before making that seismic shift in how they live their lives.  That is the chicken and egg aspect.  A forecourt owner in the county told me it would cost him &euro;500,000 per fast charging unit in his forecourt.  He said a diesel or petrol pump costs virtually nothing because they all have tanks underground and with some of the larger companies the forecourt operators virtually pay for the pumps.  It is not so with fast chargers.  To Dr. O'Grady and Ms Waller, are there any incentives to get forecourts transitioning to this?  I cannot move and more people cannot do so unless the infrastructure is in the forecourt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#K02600","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":295,"content":"<p>We are aware of that problem.

The issues there are really to do with the grid connection and the grid upgrades and what needs to be done to facilitate fast charging, especially in rural Ireland where you may be well away from the power network and substations.  The infrastructure strategy proposes we set up a public-private forum because this is somewhere we need to work in partnership with the private sector.  We are aware a level of State funding supports will be required.  The question is what is the right size and amount for that and where does it go.  My feeling is it goes into the grid and the network upgrades needed to deliver energy to particular forecourts.  Then we come back to the question of what is the strategic location for the State and where do we provide those grid upgrades.  We are not going to be able to provide them to every forecourt operator.  The need will not be the same.  We have described home charging already.  I am sure the majority of people, especially in Clare, will have access to a driveway and a home charger.  If we imagine the majority of the population will be able to charge their vehicle at home there will absolutely be a need for public charging but it will not be the same as at the moment where everyone is reliant on forecourts for refuelling.  There will be a piece of work ongoing and we have already had very strong engagement with Fuels for Ireland and different forecourt operator-managers to try to assess what is needed and where the support should go.

What we are seeing is that as more people own an electric car and then speak to their neighbours about it, people are getting that information and trying out an electric car.  The reality is that, as we stated, 80% or more of charging will be done at home.  The person will have a car that will take him or her 400 km or 500 km around County Clare.  Most people overestimate the journeys they are doing and underestimate the cost they are paying for fuel.  The decision to make that jump from diesel or petrol to an electric car starts to come with seeing EVs on the road, picking up the information from neighbours and friends and then realising that if a car has a range of 400 km or 500 km, it will only have to be charged once or twice a week and that it will only be charged at home.  The cheapest tariff one can get for charging the car is to do so overnight at home.  Those are the decisions people make before deciding which car they want.  There are many people now who want to switch but cannot do so because of the supply chain constraint.

What we need to try to work out is how to break that down into how much of that energy demand will be apportioned by our 7 kW or lower charges and how much will be done.  Will an overnight or six-to-eight-hour charge typically be done at a place of residence or maybe a workplace during the day?  Then, we have destination chargers, which would be 25 kW to 50 kW, when a person would be charging from anywhere between 45 minutes to two to three hours.

Now, what we are trying to do is match our infrastructure to consumer behaviour.  Therefore, where people's cars will dwell for a long period of time, either at their home or place of work if they commute by car, we will provide a low-power charge or recommend a low power charge in terms of grid capacity.  It is also better for the vehicle anyway.  Then, where people have a shorter dwelling time of one to three hours but again, not a quick splash and dash, we would be talking about 25 kW to 50 kW.  Then, for real emergencies like when a person is on the motorway and the battery starts blinking with 150 km to go, that is when the splash and dash is needed.  That person just pops in, refuels for maybe five to ten minutes, gets 150 km on the charge and makes his or her way to the destination.  That is the challenge.

It is rolling out a cross-Border project, which also involves Scotland, for high-powered charging along both sides of the Border in Ireland and in Scotland.  It has been doing very well on that.<\/p> <p>  There are two steps in terms of local authorities.  I think there is a recognition from local authorities, certainly from all the ones to which we have spoken.  We have spoken at local authority conferences as well.  There is a recognition of the need to step into this space.  The questions then are what resources they need to do this job properly, what supports we can give them from central government, on which we are working with them, and what they need to do.<\/p><p>We would look at piloting a number of charging options for people without access to a driveway.  Lamp-post charging is running as a pilot in Fingal County Council and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  We are looking at what is happening in other cities around Europe.  Amsterdam has a nice model whereby people who purchase an EV make the city authority aware of this.  If they have access to a driveway, it is not an issue.  Really we are talking about people living in towns and cities or in villages with on-street access.  The city authority does a scan.  If there is an EV charger within 250 m of where people live that is vacant for more than 50% of the time, the authority says that people are fine.  That 250 m is built in because it has to be convenient.  If there is no EV charger within 250 m, people are prioritised for delivery.  If there is a charger within 250 m which is occupied for more than 50% of the time, the authority concludes that there is insufficient infrastructure and maps it.<\/p><p> We are working with local authorities.  Through the infrastructure strategy, we have proposed setting up a public sector delivery group which would involve them.  It is about working out the right way to do this.  Some local authorities do not want to put in on-street charging on streets because they also want to put in active travel routes beside the kerb, so that is a challenge.  There is the option of charging hubs.  Our key aim is to have infrastructure that is convenient to and used by people.  If we have infrastructure within 200 m or 300 m of where people live, that is ideal.  It does not have to be on-street.  A hub is also fine.  We will test a mix of different options over the next year or two.  We will probably find there are two or three solutions that really work for people in Ireland and roll them out more widely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#M02400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aoife O'Grady","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":338,"content":"<p>There will be two years of training and testing, but within that, there will be solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#N00200","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":339,"content":"<p>We will be delivering infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aoife O'Grady"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":340,"content":"<p>We are talking about four or five local authorities.

My colleague referred to that.  There have been many discussions with local authorities about those pilots, including D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  The issue with street lights is that they do not receive sufficient energy to power the EV chargers.  We need to look at whether there are trickle opportunities to use this model.  Street lights are not metered, so a meter cabinet has to be installed.  There are some technical, regulatory and physical issues that are being worked on with the local authorities.  Fingal and the other Dublin authorities have come up with a strategy.  They have been looking at options for charging hubs.<\/p> <p>  We believe the grant incentives are where they should be.  We, the Department and the Minister constantly review them to determine what should be upgraded.  We have changed the incentives over the years.  We started off providing commercial and private grants.  The commercial grant was dropped because there was an opportunity for benefit-in-kind and there was no need for an additional incentive.  As battery electric vehicles now have a longer range, we did not need to incentivise plug-in hybrids, which already had an ICE.  The idea is for the funding available from the Government to target battery electric vehicles.  The &euro;5,000 currently there is constantly under review.  It will not be there forever.  There should be price parity with petrol and diesel vehicles in 2024 or 2025.  The cost of running, buying and servicing an internal combustion engine is higher than an electric car.  It is cheaper to run an electric vehicle.  We are aiming to incentivise the markets.<\/p> <p>  We have changed the grant schemes over the last couple of years.  They were online.  The home grant applications are much easier and more straightforward online.  They can be processed relatively quickly.  It used to be that it took up to ten days to approve a grant for vehicle charges.  That is now instant.  Somebody would have to come in, look at a car, go away to think about it, get a grant offer and then come back in again.  A dealer can now get grant approval immediately when the customer is on the forecourt.  All of those changes have happened following a series of developments in the grant scheme.  They are constantly under review.

When I take a taxi to Heuston Station or wherever, I ask the taxi driver about EVs.  They have told me that EVs are great for urban driving but are not good on motorways because if one drives at any sort of high speed they burn into the battery.  In many cases, one cannot drive long distances.  Taxi drivers have tested EVs in great depth.  How far are we behind technology-wise in reaching a point where the average person can buy an EV car in the full knowledge that he or she can travel from Dublin to Limerick or Cork without fear and will not be required to stop at junction 14, which is what many people must do now?  EV cars are unaffordable for the average person and many people believe that the battery life is not long enough.<\/p><p>It is about feeding into that.  The discussion is very abstract.

I think Dr. O'Grady is correct.  It is about the cost and the initial shelling-out of that fee.<\/p> <p>  I have an abstract question to which the witnesses might not have the answer.  The EU INTERREG VA programme between academic institutions and local authorities is providing funding of &euro;6.4 million for a project.  I do not want to put the witnesses on the spot.  I am fascinated by it, given our interaction with local authorities.  What will that funding be used for?  Is it part of an academic exercise?  Have we drawn it down?  The witnesses can come back to the committee with a note on it if they do not have the answer.  This is mentioned on page 45 of the strategy.  I am curious to learn what it is about.  The strategy states: \"The Ireland-specific part of the project aims to fund up to 40 fast charge points in various locations on both sides of the Border with a target date for delivery of May 2023.\"  Is that funding being delivered?  Have we drawn it all down?  Is there more we can get from it?  I am aware that my questions are abstract today.<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for attending today and for the work they are doing.  We have made a huge shift as a country.  Each of the groups that are represented today have played a significant role in that.  It is great that the Department is driving the change.  It is about the messaging, the social media campaign and changing the mindset.  For the ESB, it about incentivisation.  I know that the initial cost of changing to EVs is the big one.  I still think it goes back to what Tom Cruise said about showing the people the money.  People like to have a few bob more.  If we can demonstrably show them in real terms that they are saving a chunk of money by investing in an EV in comparison to traditional cars, that will help make the change.  The Minister for Transport was criticised for suggesting that people should slow down when they are driving.  He was not far wrong, but it did not suit the narrative at the time for him to say that.  It is about us all being part of that change mode.  I am rambling.

I told my wife that I had always wanted to drive the Ring of Kerry.  I set my satnav and started driving.  I drove for a while and the satnav instructed me to take the next left.  I took the next left and continued on.  The road started to get narrower and narrower until there was grass in the middle of it.  I wondered how a bus would get around the area, because it was crazy.  I was thinking, as I was driving in my internal combustion car, how I would feel if I was in an electric car.  I was in the middle of nowhere.  I kept reassuring my lady wife that it was all right and I knew where I was going.  I did not have a clue if I was ever going to get out of the place.  I have difficulty with the idea of using EVs in rural Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I want to raise a few issues.  My colleague Senator Buttimer mentioned that in 2009, we were told by the Government to go out and buy diesel cars because it was the only way to live.  God help us, but so many families have been stuck with diesel cars that they cannot get rid of because it was the wrong decision to make.  Right now, we are in a transition period in respect of energy.  We are talking about EVs today.  We could be talking about hydrogen vehicles tomorrow.  Who knows what other technology is coming along?  I am a bit concerned about the amount of money that we are putting into the infrastructure.  We may learn, at some stage in the future, that we have gone in the wrong direction and we should have gone down the hydrogen route or somewhere else.  In my own driving experience, I have moved from petrol to liquified petroleum gas, LPG; from LPG to diesel; from diesel back to LPG; and from LPG back to petrol.  I have learned that if you drive slowly and carefully, you can save quite a lot of money.  That comes with age.  I am a little concerned that we might be heading in the wrong direction.  <\/p> <p>  There is another issue that I am concerned about, and I would be interested in hearing the witnesses' views on it.  How ethical is the mining of the raw material for the batteries of EVs?  It is all very well for me to get into my big 4x4 EV in Dublin, the manufacturing of which probably emitted as much carbon as would be emitted twice in the lifetime of the vehicle itself.  However, if the battery came from children mining in darkest Africa, where are we going with saving the planet?  Are we saving the planet at the cost of thousands of lives in these places?  That is one of the areas that I would like to touch upon.<\/p> <p>  I will mention another area I would like to touch on.  I have been living a bachelor's life for the last two weeks because my wife and daughter have Covid, so I am living in my son's house.  The hot water system is heated by solar panels.  It is absolutely fantastic.  I have never had such hot water that is available at all times.  Is there any chance we could use solar panels to charge our cars at home?  Would that require some retrofitting to be done to homes?<\/p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned night rates.  In County Louth, very interesting work is being done by EnergyCloud at the moment.  It is very innovative.  Energy that is generated at night, which is of no value to anybody to heat water in houses, is used.<\/p> <p>  Going back to the cost of charging EVs, I am interested in the figure of &euro;10 per 400 km.  I have two relations who switched to EVs recently.  They are both complaining that their ESB bills are through the roof.  I am not sure how they are being charged.  Perhaps Mr. Meally knows whether there is an opportunity to expand the work of EnergyCloud into vehicle charging.  I will leave it at that for the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#P01000","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I can respond to a few of the Senator's questions.  On the hydrogen versus battery debate, when a hydrogen fuel cell is used and is made from electricity, the round-trip efficiency is 50%.  If that is done by battery, the efficiency is around 87%.  If we are using electricity in both cases, hydrogen will always lose to a battery, economically.  We find that all of the manufacturers are making battery EVs.  For the cars, the feeling is that the batteries have it.  There is ten years of development in EVs.  The price of fuel cell vehicles is around &euro;50,000 at the moment.  That is where EVs were ten years ago.  No one is really building infrastructure for fuel cell vehicles.  When we move up in scale, there is even uncertainty as to whether hydrogen will work for heavy vehicles such as trucks.  It looks like the medium-sized vans will all be electric.  The trend is certainly there.  It is based on efficiencies.  Around 40 battery factories are being built in Europe now, so there will be tonnes and tonnes of battery production capacity in Europe.  Hydrogen is probably better suited for aviation.  It might also work very well in electrolysis for grid storage and perhaps in shipping.  Those are the niche areas where it can be used.<\/p> <p>  On mining, cobalt mining is the big issue.  Around 60% of that comes from Congo.  On the evolution of the technology, all the manufacturers, including Tesla, are planning to stop using cobalt.<\/p><p>They are replacing it with nickel.  Tesla is boasting that already some of its vehicles have stopped using cobalt.  There is also battery recycling to get the cobalt back.  The evolution of the battery has moved to lithium and sulphur.  This is possibly all there will be in the batteries in future.  There is tonnes of lithium around and sulphur is fairly cheap.  This is probably where it will go.<\/p><p> The point on EnergyCloud is a very good one.  We are switching the home charger programme so that we will only fund smart chargers.  The smart meter and the smart charger are separate entities.  Smart meters tell people how much energy they are using every 15 minutes.  Based on this, the supplier can decide to give them a package.  With a smart charger, if someone knows the price of energy will plummet because the amount of wind on the system that night will be enormous, they can use a smart charger to charge.  This is how it is evolving.  We will see it emerging.  The smart charger is essential.  I will leave the point on photovoltaic energy for someone else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#P01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Graham Brennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":407,"content":"<p>The whole idea with solar, as with EnergyCloud, is the smart use of energy.  Smart meters will allow this.  Cars are coming out with batteries that will be able to contribute to the grid.  At times when energy is needed, it can be taken from the cars.  If there was a storm in Kerry a car could power a house for two or three days.  This is the battery capacity.  The vehicle-to-grid technology that is coming will allow the energy to go two ways.<\/p> <p>  The solar panels on the house are for solar thermal energy that heats the water through a circuit.  Photovoltaic solar energy generates electricity.  If a car is parked outside the house during the day it provides an opportunity to charge the car with the energy straight from the sun.  Our grant schemes can be availed of in any home, ideally those that are south facing.  The opportunities for home energy systems include not only charging a battery but also running a heat pump and feeding the energy system.  The system is getting smarter.  EnergyCloud particularly looks at low-income homes and putting hot water into the cylinders and topping them up at night.  Generally, many of the issues to be addressed in these areas are regulatory as opposed to technical.<\/p> <p>  I have driven around the Ring of Kerry.  We can now see with an app where the charge points are, whether they are being used and the cost of charging.  Drivers look at the fuel gauge, the range and how far it is to the nearest charger.  People will not go out with fumes in the tank to do the Ring of Kerry.  They will make sure they have enough charge to get around.  They will make sure they know on the app where the charge points are.  They will know whether to go to the hotel they are staying in for an overnight trickle charge to be ready to go again the next day, or to a fast charger in the town.  All of this information is on the system.<\/p> <p>  To go back to the general point on taxi drivers and others, we have to rethink our use of transport as well as our use of energy.  People talk about the journey from Dublin to Cork but how often do they make that journey?  Are they thinking about the car they are using and the longest journey they would ever do?  Are they thinking about what they do five or six days a week? We have seen that 80% of the journeys carried out are less than 80 km long.  For a journey from Cork to Dublin people could drive to the train station in Cork, hop on the train and then use a bike to get around Dublin.  When they return to Cork, the car is charged.  People must think about the best way to use transport.  Cars will now allow us to go for 400 km.  The faster people drive on the motorway, the more energy they will use.  It is the same with petrol or diesel.  The heavier people are with the foot the more they will use from the fuel tank.  It is about getting used to this behavioural change.  The taxi drivers in Dublin to whom we have spoken who use the cars and who have received very generous grants are saving &euro;300 a week on average in fuel costs.  There are opportunities and there is a case for doing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Meally"},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":408,"content":"<p>They have gone through it quite forensically.

The average person might only do a long journey a couple of times a year but they want certainty.  If I am on fossil fuel, I can pull in along the motorway and get diesel or petrol.  There are factors and reliability.  The devil is always in the detail.  This is an aside.

They would go to the ploughing championship once a year to try out four-wheel drive.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in what Dr. O'Grady said about early adapters.  People adapted to electric vehicles before they were quite ready and before the market had settled in.  When I bought a car recently, I was mindful about buying a dual fuel or hybrid vehicle.  The salesman in the garage told me not to.  He said that the battery is too heavy for it and it causes a problem with the suspension in the car.  Even though my car has an internal combustion engine, it has all the technology to tell me when I am saving fuel.  The difference between 120 km\/h and 100 km\/h is amazing when it comes to the cost of running it.  Not every family wants to buy a great big four-wheel drive vehicle.  For the average family to buy a little Yaris to run around in or a small electric car the cost is still too high.  We have to do something if we are serious about moving in this direction.<\/p> <p>  Another problem we have is that people tend to change their cars every three or four years.  This will become a problem.  The carbon cost of manufacturing the car is probably 20 years.  How many 20-year-old cars do we see on the road?  There are very few.  A lot of education and a lot of cultural change must take place.  Is the Department doing anything about this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#Q00400","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":410,"content":"<p>We are doing a lot.  We always need to do more.  The average family in Ireland does not purchase a new vehicle.  The people in Ireland who purchase new vehicles are a very small minority of the population when we look at the overall car fleet and how many new vehicles are purchased every year.  To get to the average family in Ireland we need a second-hand EV fleet.  We are only now hitting the point of EV sales when we will see EVs coming through to the second-hand fleet.  At present there is a very small second-hand fleet in Ireland.  They tend to be much older vehicles with significant battery degradation.  We need to keep new vehicle sales coming through so that they follow through to the second-hand market two or three years later.  The average family will then be able to purchase a three-year-old EV with a high-quality battery.  Many of the vehicles now have battery warranties for seven to eight years.  People will have security of mind and will know they will get another five years out of the battery.<\/p> <p>  I chair the EV policy pathway implementation group.  A subgroup of that group is looking at how to activate and generate the second-hand market for EVs in Ireland.  We have a challenge because many of this country's second-hand vehicles have traditionally come from the UK.  Brexit has meant significant additional taxation charges because the UK is outside the EU VAT system.  There are several elements to this.  Another challenge is that with Covid many vehicle leasing and rental companies stopped purchasing new vehicles.  This is one of the reasons we see such high car rental prices at present.  They do not have sufficient vehicle demand.<\/p><p>We are working to see if we can get an incentivisation for those leasing fleets to start purchasing EVs.  This is because, traditionally, those vehicles make their way into our second-hand market after two or three years.  Therefore, regarding cost and affordability, getting the second-hand market right will help.  The upfront cost of an EV is high.  Even with our grants, a significant gap still remains between the cost of some EVs and equivalent ICE-powered vehicles.  As more and more EVs come onto the market,, we will see those costs reduce.  They are still higher than those for vehicles with internal combustion engines, but within a year or two - given the running costs and the difference between the low cost of running an EV and the increasingly high cost of running a petrol or diesel car - people will get their money back within a few years.  This aspect will cause a switchover, as well as the cost of vehicles coming down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#Q00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Aoife O'Grady","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657666800,"counter":412,"content":"<p>Is it foreseeable that a situation will ever arise where it will be possible for me to drive into a forecourt, open a little pocket in the side of my car, wheel out the used battery and wheel in a new battery and take off?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022071300002#R00200","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657666800,"counter":413,"content":"<p>Some vehicle manufacturers are piloting programmes where the batteries are rented.

How does this situation stand now?  How many charging points are in place?  What are the challenges in this context?  What is the situation regarding people being able to get the turbochargers that can recharge their EVs much faster?  I would like to get the witnesses' perspective on these issues.
