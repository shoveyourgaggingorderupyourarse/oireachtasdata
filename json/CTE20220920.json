On behalf of the committee I would like to welcome the following representatives from the CRU: Ms Aoife MacEvilly, chairperson; Dr. Paul McGowan; Mr. John Melvin; who are all welcome back, and Ms Karen Trant, who is welcome.<\/p> <p>  As is usual before we begin, I will read out the note on privilege.  I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice whereby they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If their statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

In this regard, I ask any member joining us online, prior to making his or her contribution, to confirm that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.<\/p> <p>  I call now on Ms MacEvilly for her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#D00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":6,"content":"<p>We thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss some of the work under way in relation to the strategic priorities within our new strategic plan.  I will start by outlining the current priority work we are undertaking to empower and protect consumers.  <\/p> <p>  In light of exceptionally high and volatile wholesale EU gas prices, retail electricity and gas prices are increasing dramatically, thereby putting pressure on all domestic and business customers, many of whom are already struggling to pay.   The CRU is deeply concerned about the impact these price increases will have on all customers and particularly on vulnerable customers.  We therefore have introduced a new suite of consumer protection measures to be in place for this winter.  The decision paper has been provided alongside this paper and in summary, the key measure include: extended debt repayment periods for customers in debt; lower debt repayment on top-ups for customers with financial hardship prepayment meters; customers on financial hardship meters to be put on the most favourable tariff available from their supplier; and extended moratorium periods for disconnections this winter.<\/p> <p>  We are currently working through the supplier of last resort process for Panda Power customers.  There have been three supplier of last resort events in the Irish market this year, through which we have ensured that supply is maintained for some 100,000 affected customers. <\/p> <p> The CRU has also just completed overseeing the implementation of the electricity credit scheme, along with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, ESB Networks and suppliers.  We are ready to support any future interventions in line with Government decisions. <\/p> <p>  Some further workstreams to protect costumers include: working with industry to provide the negative public service obligation, PSO, levy to customers as quickly as possible; continuing customer communication campaigns to highlight the importance of registering as a vulnerable customer, to be aware of your rights as an energy customer and to make the best use of the better information and tariff options for customers with smart meters; continuing the roll-out of smart meters and leveraging the benefits of smart services; working with our customer care team to assist customers in distress, and engaging with our Department and other stakeholders to implement market and consumer protection measures arising from the evolving European Commission policy. <\/p> <p>  We will be stepping up market monitoring activities this winter, focusing on key customer debt and disconnection trends, and have included with this statement some of the latest data in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Turning to our next strategic priority to drive a low-carbon future, we are working to both increase the level of renewable electricity capacity on our system and to ensure we optimise the use of those renewables, as well as the infrastructure and technologies that support their roll-out, for the benefit of customers and the climate.<\/p><p>We welcome the increased connection of renewables, particularly solar projects, at scale this year, which will deliver significant benefits for consumers.  This includes the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, contribution to the PSO levy rebate.<\/p><p> We are working to enhance the integration of these renewables through the publication of the single electricity market high-level design on system services future arrangements, with further work progressing on the detailed design.  The new high-level design allows for a phased approach and enables EirGrid to procure system services in fixed contracts and a layered procurement approach.  We welcome EirGrid's publication of its consultation on the low-carbon inertia competition.<\/p><p> One of the key enablers in achieving our 80% renewable electricity target is the delivery of offshore renewables at scale.  The CRU is holding consultations on offshore grid connection policy, which will enable developers to bid confidently in the forthcoming offshore renewable electricity support scheme, ORESS, auction.  A new CRU division will be established shortly to advance further work, including the regulatory framework for the offshore asset owner and operator and offshore network planning, standards and licensing. <\/p><p> We are concerned about the current gap in offshore safety regulation.  International experience suggests that offshore renewables require regulation from a safety perspective.  Ideally, a safety-by-design approach to the prevention of major accidents is required.  Recognising the ambition in terms of scale and timing that Ireland has for offshore renewables, it is imperative the country implements an appropriate legislative framework in this area at the earliest opportunity, including designation of the body that will assume responsibility for this.<\/p><p> Firm access is an important area for existing and new renewable projects, and a consultation on a new approach will be published shortly.  It is important to ensure this is facilitated by accelerated delivery of network infrastructure to provide value for consumers and generators.  This is especially the case as ongoing curtailments and the operation of a tight system at a time of high wholesale prices is driving imperfections market charges significantly higher this year.  Overall, lengthy planning and permitting processes and delays in delivery of critical energy infrastructure, including generation capacity, transmission and distribution networks, and the North-South interconnector, are adding high costs and increased security of supply risks for Irish consumers as well as delaying the achievement of our decarbonisation obligations.<\/p><p> As an example, Wind Energy Ireland advised us in March last that there were in excess of 1,200 MW worth of wind projects in the planning system, more than 500 MW of which had been in planning since 2020 or before.  We were further advised at that time that in excess of 600 MW worth of battery storage was in the planning process.  We will need this infrastructure to support security, sustainability and competitiveness for Irish customers.<\/p><p> It is clear that, given the scale of the infrastructure delivery required over the short term, we will need a change in the planning process and the resources allocated to local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to expedite projects through the planning process.  We will also require the support of this committee and the Government to ensure delivery.  For example, the North-South interconnector, which is vital for security of supply, has not yet commenced construction, despite having full planning permissions in place in Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland.<\/p><p> As we discussed electricity security at length with the committee on 30 August, I will briefly mention gas security in light of the Russia-Ukraine crisis.  While Ireland is less dependent on Russian gas than other member states, it is important we play our part this winter and in the following winters by reducing our use of gas and electricity.  The CRU is working on a range of such measures, including through our network tariff decision.  Our objective to incentivise demand reduction at peak times and times of low renewable generation, which may also cause system stress, is aligned with the new EU proposals on emergency interventions to address high energy prices.  Such measures will also support our decarbonisation goals. <\/p><p> As the EU moves away from reliance on Russian gas supplies and develops new supply sources, it is also critical that Ireland enhances our security of gas supply.  This is particularly important given the key role of gas in electricity security of supply.  We welcome the publication of the Department's energy security review in this regard.<\/p><p> In relation to the CRU's people and organisational capacity, we are currently recruiting to expand our team to address some of the new requirements of the climate action plan and clean energy package while prioritising the use of our resources for the energy crisis in the short term.  The CRU notes that the committee has forwarded other topics for discussion and has included, as an appendix, the most recent and relevant historical data concerning domestic customers' debt and disconnections.<\/p><p>We are also happy to discuss the other topics highlighted by members, including demand management and the European response to demand reduction. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Ms MacEvilly for her opening statement.

I have a number of questions.  First, I welcome the information provided by the CRU in relation to domestic and non-domestic disconnections and the moratorium we have discussed previously at this committee, including the new suite of consumer protection measures that have been introduced until the end of March.  This suite of measures is welcome, particularly given it was raised in the media last night as if it did not exist, despite being discussed and welcomed in the Chamber.  It is important we reiterate that to give confidence to people who might find themselves in difficulties this winter, notwithstanding anything that might be announced in the budget next week.<\/p> <p>  I also welcome the work the CRU is doing in rolling out the negative public service obligation, PSO, levy, which was announced by Government some weeks or months ago.  This will go some way to alleviating the pressures.  The one thing I want to focus on in relation to consumer ability to pay is the view the CRU may have on standing charges.  This has been raised in this committee previously.  I want to know whether the CRU has the legislative framework with which to address these charges and by address I mean lower.  I raise this on behalf of the many constituents who have been in touch with me because it is an increasingly large issue.  The variances between suppliers, for instance, can be quite significant.  I would welcome the views of the CRU on this issue. <\/p> <p>  I have two further questions.  Should the committee be concerned about the exists from the market particularly by Panda Power and other suppliers.  I understand a number of others have exited this year already.  Is this something we need to be concerned about?  Does the commission know why that exit took place?<\/p> <p>  Regarding the comments on safety regulation, and of course that is something we should all be concerned about, I am assuming the safety regulation to which the CRU has referred is not included in any legislation either passed by or before the Oireachtas?  I refer specifically to regulations that come under the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA.  Does the CRU have knowledge of other jurisdictions within the European Union which have brought regulations in or is there a European example that could be provided to the committee?  That would be rather helpful.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#F00300","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I will start and will then hand over to my colleagues.  In terms of Panda Power and the supplier of last resort, it is unfortunate for customers that we are losing suppliers in the energy market at the moment.  It is a sign of the intense pressure the energy sector is under.  We have never had a supplier of last resort event in Ireland prior to this.  They can be common.  There have been quite a number in the UK over the last number of years and I think in the range of 30 in the last year.  We have seen these events happen across Europe because the challenge for suppliers is that they are also facing these really high and volatile energy prices.  Suppliers have to go out and spend more money to hedge for their customers, to post collateral to buy gas and electricity.  It is putting pressure on a number of the smaller suppliers in the market, Panda Power being the latest one.  That is broadly what Panda Power has told us in terms of it decision to exit the market.  That is why we have a supplier of last resort process.  It is in place through legislation and then through processes we have developed with the network operators and suppliers of last resort to ensure that where this happens there is protection for customers and security of supply in that they will be automatically transferred to a supplier of last resort with no discontinuity in supply.<\/p><p>We have done this to ensure that, where such a situation arises, there is protection for customers and security in their supply, in that they will automatically be transferred to a supplier of last resort with no discontinuity in supply.  Overall, it is not good for competition because the more suppliers we have actively competing in various ways and offering different types of products to customers, the better it is for customers.  We continue to work with all suppliers in the market.  We will continue to ensure that, at the end of this crisis, we will have a competitive market that delivers value and choice for customers.<\/p><p> I might ask Ms Trant to address some of the other points that the Deputy raised, after which Dr. McGowan will discuss the offshore safety regime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>We are aware that issues have been raised around the standing charge.

For example, the supplier might have a higher commodity charge and lower standing charge or a higher standing charge and lower commodity charge.

The Petroleum Safety Authority Norway started a project, based on legislation, in 2020 to determine an appropriate safety regime for offshore renewables.<\/p> <p>  The matter is being examined more widely across Europe.  For example, the Health and Safety Executive in Great Britain has begun work on advising offshore renewable firms as to what a safety regime might look like.  It has been interacting with them in advance of legislation being introduced.<\/p> <p>  We are members of various safety bodies, the most relevant in this case being the North Sea Offshore Authorities Forum, NSOAF, whose members are safety regulators that are involved one way or another in hydrocarbons in the North Sea.  The NSOAF has established an offshore renewables safety working group to begin examining best practice.<\/p> <p>  Currently, we do not have a statute in place that identifies who is responsible for the regulation of this new sector in terms of major accident hazards.  Its hazards are different than those in the hydrocarbon sector.  Obviously, there are no hydrocarbons involved, but collisions, fires and other hazards can still occur on these installations.  As such, it is important that there be a safety regime.  Our perspective is that the priority should be to identify and put in place a safety regime and to identify who carries that out.  We are agnostic in the latter respect.  We have experience from the offshore hydrocarbon sector, so it is something that we would be equipped to do, but a statutory framework would be needed in order for that type of work to begin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul McGowan"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I wish to ask a short follow-on question relating to our discussion on standing charges.<\/p><p>Is the commission aware of other similar regulatory bodies in other jurisdictions that regulate standing charges specifically or is it rather a market-to-market sort of arrangement?

My understanding is that not every jurisdiction necessarily has a fixed element of the charge.  Some go with pure per-unit rates.

The UK also tends to have a standing charge arrangement as part of the billing.  The regulatory regimes vary from member state to member state.

To pick up on the issue of standing charges, the Minister for Finance stated yesterday that the energy companies must justify those standing charge increases.  I raised questions with the Minister previously regarding standing charges and he pointed to the CRU.  We heard today from the commission that it does not have responsibility in that regard.  To whom exactly are the energy companies accountable for these increases in standing charges?  To whom might they justify those increases?  That is the first question.<\/p> <p>  My second question is on the PSO.  In its opening statement, the commission stated it is working with industry to provide the negative PSO levy to customers.  Is it not the case that 85% of our renewables are under the renewable energy feed-in tariff, REFIT, scheme and 15% are under the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, with an opportunity to claw back that PSO?

We estimated that the price they would earn on the market would be at a certain level, which, if I recall, was around the &euro;50 per MWh rate.  As it turned out, prices started increasing, so they actually earned more from the market in that year because we operate on the basis of estimating.

There is an estimation forward and a look back to see what was actually earned and to make sure that nobody earned more than they were entitled to or, indeed, less.  There are sometimes corrections in the other direction.  Regarding RES, there is a different approach to the payment of support for renewables.  It is seen as a two-way contract in which, once the price suppliers earn on the market goes above a certain level, that will automatically be clawed back.

Ireland has a high level of low usage, which we understand relates mainly to holiday homes.  It is important to note that where people have holiday homes, even where they may not be using a lot of electricity, we support those homes through the provision of electricity networks that are there to ensure there is sufficient power whenever they use those homes.  It is right that people pay a fair share towards the cost of networks.  From the suppliers' point of view, the low usage charge in some cases relates to the fact they have costs in serving those customers, even when such customers are not necessarily using the charge.  We have not looked at that as a specific area of concern at this point.<\/p> <p>  On the cheapest available tariff being available as standard, we looked at what the best options are.  As the Deputy knows, the way competition tends to work for domestic customers is that suppliers have a standard charge and they then offer discounts to attract new customers.  They will often offer those same discounts to existing customers who sign up for an additional year or who avail of things such as paying by direct debit or getting paperless bills.  We think that is a useful part of competition in the electricity sector.  If suppliers are asked to provide those discounts to all customers regardless of whether they have lower costs, such as direct debit or paperless billing, then ultimately everyone is paying the same charge, there is very little competition and everyone is paying a slightly higher charge.<\/p> <p>  It is really about who we want to protect the most.  The people we focused on, through our current consumer protection measures, are vulnerable customers and customers on financial hardship prepayment meters because we believe they are the ones where we need to target the most support.  We are also asking suppliers to make it clearer to their existing loyal customers that discounts are available for them, especially if they are willing to commit for an extra year or a period of the suppliers' choice.<\/p> <p>  We have looked at self-disconnection and tried to get some figures on it.

There are recommendations that will impact energy companies including extending moratorium periods for disconnections and extending debt repayment periods and while these amount to regulation of energy companies, surely we should see recommendations that go further.  It is very hard for us to justify the use of six-month profits of around &euro;400 million for future investment in infrastructure.  Various arguments have been made in defence of that but we cannot justify it when consumers are at their wits' end, struggling and worried about repayments.  I ask the CRU representatives to comment on that.  There are no recommendations like capping unit prices or other measures that would have a real impact on consumers' bills.

That is why the EU is stepping in with a new package which aims to limit the profits of generators, particularly those that are not facing the higher cost of buying gas on international markets, that is, those generators that have renewables and other technologies within their portfolios that are earning the higher prices but are not facing the higher costs.<\/p> <p>  We do not have anything in our regulatory toolbox to deal with that.

Reference is made to the different options around security of supply, including battery storage.  Is there an opportunity in the very short term to procure battery storage for public buildings?  I am thinking of public hospitals in particular.  Cork University Hospital, CUH, has always had a really good approach to energy and has tried to be as sustainable and green as possible but it is still a significant energy user in the Cork region.  The hospital would have peak-time levels of usage almost throughout the day.  It has been suggested that we could procure battery storage.<\/p><p>That battery storage would be acquired in off-peak times and distributed during peak hours of 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. or whatever it is.  I have heard this could be done in a place like Cork University Hospital, CUH, for around &euro;1 million.  It sounds like a lot but in terms of preventing potential electricity supply issues during winter, it is something we have to look at.  If on a wider scale across the health sector and HSE you can procure battery storage, charge the batteries off peak and distribute them during peak hours, it would take massive pressure off the grid during peak hours.  Has that been looked at?  Could it be recommended?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#L00500","speaker":"1545","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":60,"content":"<p>Under the national emergency security framework, the public sector is being asked to take the lead in many of the responses, and peak reduction is one of the key responses.  Also, in the regulation currently making its way through the European Commission formation process, one of the proposals is to seek to procure demand reduction from entities.  For example, a university hospital may participate in this and, if it were to win the competition, would be paid for the reduction it provides at peak times.  There is a desire for the public sector to take a lead in this and, assuming that regulation makes its way into law, an outcome of that would be a proposal or mechanism whereby people would compete to provide reductions.  That could provide the revenues necessary for, in the case the Deputy described, battery storage.<\/p> <p>  In terms of security of supply, hospitals tend to have backup generation on site.  I engaged with HSE representatives last week.  They also tend to have backup batteries on sensitive equipment to protect it from voltage surges.

It appears we are not utilising it.  I could go on with examples of things we could be trying to do that are relatively low cost and low-hanging fruit.  It seems to me that the witnesses are in a pivotal position to tell the regulated entities that they need to adopt this as part of the expectations of what they are doing.  It does seem to me that that is not happening.<\/p><p> To go back to Deputy O'Sullivan's point, I could imagine an energy-saving company going into Cork University Hospital - or any other hospital - with an offer, but it would be very hard to expect the hospital to do this given all the things on its plate.  Could the CRU not mandate its regulated entities to be such energy-saving companies for some of these areas of opportunity?  As I said before on this committee, we should not waste a crisis.  Perhaps the CRU is at a pivotal point to make that switch.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#N00700","speaker":"1549","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":77,"content":"<p>On the planning question first of all, it is not necessarily our area of expertise but there are some potential options.  The Attorney General had announced a review of the overall planning system and we would welcome the expedition of that.  Very specifically, there are EU regulatory requirements for expedited processes for renewable projects, given their importance.  For example, there are periods within which the entire planning process - all aspects of environmental permits and so on - must be completed in order to expedite those projects.  We welcome seeing that being transposed.  More recently, the REPowerEU package last year noted the need to expedite the connection of renewables but also the supporting grid - in other words, the necessary network infrastructure in order to not just build the renewables but connect them effectively into the network so that they can deliver the benefits for customers and that those could be considered in the overriding public interest, which is a particular route and option that could be used to expedite planning.  Those are the kinds of areas that we think are worth considering, which are set out in the EU regulatory toolbox and that might support expedited planning processes.  We have also called out the need to support the local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to ensure they have sufficient staff, inspectors and other resources to expedite the projects.  They are independent agencies that have to go through thorough processes, which they must ensure are robust, but they must have the resources to do it more quickly so that the projects that can be delivered can be delivered more quickly.  That is our view on the planning side.  It is about process and resources.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the demand side, generally I agree that we are at the very start of looking at what demand side can deliver.  For a system that has an 80% renewables target and, further, would be looking to be a zero-carbon electricity system in time, it is imperative that we optimise demand side as part of our future network.  We must change our thinking on how we plan electricity systems and incorporate demand side more effectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":78,"content":"<p>There is no point in just appealing to us all to do it unless the regulator enforces it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#O00300","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":79,"content":"<p>Yes.

All we can do is seek to remove obstacles.<\/p> <p>  Another aspect of the Deputy's question refers to work under the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, more than the CRU.  Energy supply companies have obligations under a European directive from 2012 or 2014 to offer energy saving advice and engagement with their end customers.  This is done through SEAI's part of the energy sphere rather than us.  On the matter of accepting that demand comes and is not expected to be flexible, a significant change is required in the energy industry and among the demand customers.  The European regulation that is currently being developed seeks active participation from demand side, both at peak and with reductions in demand next winter, over the whole period and especially at peak periods.  We held a consultation on the network tariffs.  There are elements which we can address, barriers we can remove and signals which we can send.  Active participation has to come from the entities and, under the GDPR rules, it has to come from individuals in their homes, who would seek to participate and use those smart meters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Melvin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":84,"content":"<p>We see smart meters both as an enabler for gathering information across the network but also for the consumer.  There have been barriers to engagement from consumers.  There is an information gap.  Customers do not really know what their consumption is like and they need to be able to see that before they opt to use a smart tariff.  One area which will be developed this coming quarter is a data portal and a hub.  Customers will have what is called a push-all.  Information from smart meters will be pushed to the hub.  It will be available to customers so that they can review their consumption.  The aim is to have a dashboard and portal in order that customers have an easy, accessible way to see what they are using.  We think this will send a signal for people to engage with smart tariffs.<\/p><p> The other area relating to smart meters we are looking at is that ESB Networks is prioritising those with microgen capability.  Those who have microgen installed will get smart meters to push that.  Once people are aware of their consumption and not afraid to make a choice, they will engage with it.  We are also running campaigns.  They are digital at the moment, but we will be increasing them to encourage the use of smart meters and smart tariffs.  It will take time.  We think that once the data hub and data portal are up and running, it will be six to 12 months after that before we see a real uptake in smart tariffs.  It is about information; people want information before they make the choice.<\/p><p> There was a point about the GDPR.  What we wanted to do there was bring customers with us.  We would not be able to mandate that information to transfer.  That would be in breach of GDPR rules.  A meter point reference number, MPRN, is personal data.  Without a customer's agreement, we would not be able to do that.  There is no doubt that this has been a sensitive issue.  We need to manage that carefully for both customers and the programme.

One was on energy demand growth in this country compared with the rest of the EU.  It clearly shows that Ireland is a complete outlier in the context of energy growth demand.  That was on the argument relating to data centres.  The second was on the specifics about data centres and their connections.  I really appreciate the answer, but it raises more questions.  Rather than focus on that now, I will ask the committee to write back to Ms MacEvilly with my questions because the urgent matter we have to focus on is the energy demand for customers over the winter.<\/p><p>The CRU has made proposals.  Considering the scale of the crisis, what the CRU is proposing is a bit piecemeal.  That is not to be insulting.  It is probably limited, but I want to ask a few question in respect of that limitation.  If we acknowledge that there has been a complete failure in the energy market - prices have gone up when they should not have, profits were being made when they should not have been and so on - would the CRU be in a position to demand that over the winter months nobody will be disconnected and that the limited definition of what constitutes vulnerability will not apply?  In other words, there should be no disconnection over the winter months and the moratorium should be extended to all household customers and businesses, particularly small businesses.<\/p><p>Would it be possible to extend the moratorium to prepay meters?  Would it be possible to just say that people should not be disconnected if they fail to put money in their meters?  Would it be possible for that instruction to be given by the CRU to the various companies?<\/p><p>It has come to our attention in the past week that many apartment dwellers live in areas with district heating systems.  For some reason, the price per kW\/h for gas for these people is at least three times higher than it would be for those of us here.  There might be a technical explanation for that but these customers cannot switch.  They cannot go onto <i>bonkers.ie <\/i>and switch around different companies because they live in buildings that are connected to district heating systems.  The committee is constantly told that this is the future, that district heating is good for the environment and so on.<\/p><p>However, they are being left in a very difficult position.  They cannot switch and are being charged more than anybody else.  Can we find some way of putting them on a moratorium?  When we look at the figures 250,000 people are in arrears for electricity and 148,000 households are in arrears already for gas bills.  So this is a really serious crisis which we know and I argue that not enough is being done and that the extension of the moratorium must apply to everybody.  In particular, we must consider what is happening with district heating systems.  I am also told that the CRU does not regulate district heating companies.  If not, why not?  I ask because if there is no regulation then these over-the-top measures are imposed on people who live within them and if they are the future then where are we going?<\/p><p> On the question of vulnerability, we looked up the definition which showed two things.  One, is where people are dependent on energy for disability equipment etc.  The other day a 78-year-old person told me that she has stopped using her electric chair on her stairs because she is worried about using electricity.  So she needs to register as vulnerable but does not realise that and people who use electric chairs, hoists or special equipment for their children think that if they turn on anything they will be in trouble.  Dependency is definitely vulnerable.  The other definition for vulnerability concerns age, mental health and all the rest.  Is it not true to say that the definition for vulnerability could be extended way beyond those two restricted areas given the current crisis?<\/p><p> Lastly, can the CRU instruct all providers to put everybody on the most beneficial tariff rather than limiting it to only the vulnerable?  Is it possible for the CRU to ask all of the suppliers to give people all of the most beneficial tariffs, ensure there are no disconnections over the winter and, in particular, let us consider prepaid and district heating?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#Q00900","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>We will endeavour to answer the Deputy's questions.

On its own it might be beneficial but we also need to consider the wider suite of social welfare and other Government supports that will be needed to assist customers in very difficult circumstances this winter.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy has raised some really good points about the different definitions and I will step through them.  First, the most critical group is the vulnerable customers who are reliant on medically assistive devices whether it is assistive living, oxygen condensers or other medical devices.  Those customers can never be disconnected for reasons of non-payment.  We need to get that message out there because people should absolutely not avoid using assistive technology in their homes because they are afraid of their bill.  We need more of those customers registered as vulnerable customers and that is one of the targets of our information campaigns.  That is a really important protection and we do not think that enough people are aware of it.  Maybe the people who are in those situations might not think of themselves as that vulnerable but their family members might recognise that these are people who would benefit from that protection and should be registered.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy correctly pointed out, the next level of vulnerability are those who, because of reasons of age or health, might be particularly vulnerable to disconnection during the winter.

We are seeing the outcome of that now.  Our customer care team is dealing with some difficult cases.  It is about balance.  Nobody wants disconnections.  The process is there not to have a disconnection at the end of it but to have an engaging customer who is still working with the supplier, entering a payment plan or finding an option that helps them to retain their supply.  We will monitor that over the winter.  That is why we are stepping up our monitoring of what is happening.  There have been quite low levels of disconnection since the moratorium for Covid was lifted.  We will continue monitoring the situation to try to understand what we are seeing.

I want to concentrate on the issue of security of supply.  There was a report on \"Morning Ireland\" this morning by the political editor, David Murphy, who seems to have access to a freedom of information, FOI, request from the IDA, which showed a level of concern about the inability of some of the data centres to connect to the grid based on a direction from CRU and the impact that had had on the sentiment within foreign direct investment.  While we rightly have to concern ourselves with the vulnerability of citizens of the State at every possible opportunity, we also have to ensure that we are in a position to provide gainful employment for people.<\/p><p>Anything like the information that would seem to emanate from that report or through that freedom of information is concerning to me and to many people because it somehow sets a bad image of the country.

It is not personal towards anyone but I wonder if the witnesses have done any analysis of the CRU.  Do the witnesses believe the CRU is fit for purpose in light of what has happened?  The CRU has the statutory responsibility and it was indicated in the opening statement that it intends to broaden its remit and employ more people.  Is it on foot of some analysis the CRU has done that it needs to broaden its work?  When something goes wrong, it is easy to have the benefit of hindsight and make judgements, but has the CRU done any critical analysis of how we have ended up in the situation we are in with the way those auctions were run, which we talked about the previous day?  We can say there were planning and regulatory issues but did the CRU look into its own heart, procedures and processes?  In doing so, will the witnesses talk to us a little bit about that?  I do not want to be critical but the way the CRU is constituted, it is answerable to this committee and this committee only.  Regardless of whether that is good or bad, it places a certain encumbrance on us in terms of holding the CRU to account.  Maybe it would suit us if the CRU was accountable to the Government.  Then we could be more critical of it and less critical of ourselves, but we have that responsibility.  I want to tease through the idea of the CRU being fit for purpose a bit more.  That is not a reflection on any individual but on the overall architecture of what the CRU is.  The CRU did not set it up either; it was set out in statute.

When we asked for additional staff, it included many new areas like offshore energy generation and the strategic impact of same in anticipation of new functions coming in.

One of the areas where we want to enhance internal capability includes security of supply.

Norway has security of supply concerns this year with regard to low water levels for hydro.  Finland and Sweden have security of supply concerns linked to nuclear.  None of that is to say that the capacity remuneration mechanism, CRM, that we designed was perfectly put in place, perfectly designed or perfectly operated.

It sets out a very clear pathway to how they might be able to participate and the encumbrances that would prevent them.  The documentation that was produced in 2014 and 2015 charted what happened.  I go back to what I said the last day about the way in which the criteria allowed the ESB to participate.  I have not suggested it did anything wrong.  It saw what was in front of it.  It cornered a big slice of the market and failed to deliver.  I find that hard.  I have said this to people in the ESB.

I find it hard to accept it has failed in such a spectacular way, although I must take its word for it.<\/p> <p>  Those in the CRU are in a regulatory position and have a different role.  The ESB pays its fine and moves things on.  The CRU goes back with its T-3 auction and the bid goes from &euro;46,000 or &euro;47,000 per megawatt to &euro;138,000 within a very short period.  I believe that warrants deeper investigation by the CRU.  In fairness to the witnesses from the CRU, on the last day they asked me to provide the evidence or documentation I had.  Sometimes it requires a regulatory authority to put all the bits and bobs together.  If it starts to quack like a duck and walk like a duck, maybe it is a duck.

Ireland has the highest rate of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, in the OECD.  It is really important to ensure there are no huge variations in temperature for COPD patients because such variations can cause their airways to close.  We also have the highest rate of hospitalisation of COPD patients.  I am also concerned about people who rely on hoists and dialysis machines.

People would expect the CRU to be across standing charges and that such charges would have to be negotiated with it.  That is the crux of the problem.  This is the climate committee.  The only reason it exists is because we are in a climate crisis.  Suppliers are increasing standing charges in order to offset energy reduction because the increasing price will be a reduction in the amount of energy people consume.  It is vital that the Minister addresses that.  It shows the problem we have in facing the climate crisis under our current economic model.  It is only for profit.  We should never have sold the shares we sold in ESB.  It should not be for profit anymore.  We cannot just keep consuming.  That is me making a statement after asking the witnesses a question.

I have another set of questions on the energy demand piece.<\/p> <p>  On the standing charges and the moving away from price regulation, I believe it is pretty clear that the position in the European Union is no longer about moving away from price regulation but is about much more hands-on measures on price caps and thresholds.  This is clearly what we are seeing right now from the EU.  In that regard, the standing charges piece seems to be absolutely central.  The point was made previously by Senator O'Reilly and others about why we do not have the lowest cost of default.  The witness mentioned that some prefer lower carbon options but now we know that the renewable energy or the lowest carbon options will be the lowest cost options.  It is not just a matter of preference.  We have a collective public priority to move towards the lowest carbon option and that also happens to be the lowest cost.  Why would we not put a requirement in for the lowest cost and the lowest carbon option in that regard?  This is around the transition from gas.  I am really surprised to see the key role of gas in security of supply when we know that gas has this huge price volatility.  I am aware that there is an emergency measure for gas because many people in Ireland are on gas heating, but we should look specifically at how we are helping people to transition away from that more volatile and more expensive fuel of gas and at supporting people more actively, not to just to choose, but to be supported into moving towards lower carbon options, be that individually or collectively with district heating.<\/p> <p>  I note that the EU directive is not just around giving back to customers.  We do not want to end up with just another subsidy to fossil fuel companies.  It is about channelling it to those who need it most.  It may well be that those levies put on those companies, and on gas in particular with its huge profits, may be directed into supporting people proactively to make a transition to cheaper low carbon, which is something that people may not be able to do on their own.  That might need to be fully funded by the State.  I am thinking in particular of collective users.<\/p> <p>  On the standing charges issue, in all of this talk of smart meters and hubs it strikes me that first of all we need to be realistic that 42% of people in Ireland lack basic digital skills and will not be going online to deal with these issues.  If the standing charges are allowed to increase regardless of use it completely undercuts such measures.  It is not just bad in the context of energy shortages and the poverty impact this will have on people; it is also very impactful around the transition to low carbon.  It seems that it is counter indicated with transition to energy reduction if the standing charges go up in any way.<\/p><p>In that regard, Ms MacEvilly might comment on the low-usage standing charge for those who have extremely low energy usage.  The fact is that was removed, but as I understand it, from May, the standing charge for those with very low energy usage went up.  They were effectively penalised, as they are no longer getting the benefit of being a low energy user.  Could Ms MacEvilly comment on standing charges and how credible it is to talk about smart metering if it all gets undermined by a standing charge increase?  There is a need for a far more hands-on approach to address the price thresholds and the transition to lower carbon options.  I have a different set of questions, but I will group them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#DD00800","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":195,"content":"<p>On the standing charges, first, where homes are connected to the network there are costs associated with providing those network services to those customers, which must be recovered.  Some of those costs exist even if the customers are using very little electricity, because it is a holiday home or because they upgraded their home to A-rated status or whatever else, or they are using solar photovoltaic, PV, during the day for their electricity but they still require additional electricity at peak times.  There is a basis for having a standing charge.  It is a socialisation of costs, which ensures that everybody pays their way and that customers who can afford to invest in upgrading their home are not being subsidised by customers who cannot afford to do so.  We do think there is a basis for having a standing charge.  It is a fixed cost, if one likes, associated with serving customers.  Some of the concerns Senator Higgins raises are about whether the standing charge becomes such a high portion of the bill that it perhaps disincentivises those who are trying to reduce their energy costs.  That is perhaps something we will examine when we look periodically at the component costs of a typical customer's bill.  We look at the extent to which there are fixed costs, unit charges, the PSO levy and VAT.  All of that changes over time.  It is a good point to look at that and see if after the current round of price increases over time there is a dramatic change in the proportion of fixed costs versus unit costs that would give rise to concerns about disincentivising reduced usage.  That is valid and is something that we will continue to monitor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#EE00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":196,"content":"<p>It strikes me as more of an emergency concern as well.

In some of the written pieces from the CRU on the ongoing data centre discussions, I noticed there were multiple references to EirGrid but almost no reference to the review the CRU conducted that considered the options of doing nothing and a moratorium on data centres until the demand can be safely and securely facilitated by the network, and then the subsequent connection measures.  I say this in the context that we were told, the time we met EirGrid and the CRU, that a 9% increase in electricity demand over five years was not an outlier, but I know from the information we have been given since that it is an outlier, and it seems the average in most EU countries is an overall net growth of zero percent.  There has been either flat or declining energy usage in most countries, so effectively zero percent growth in electricity demand is the norm, whereas Ireland has had a 9% increase in electricity demand for the same period.  The figures for the same five-year period show a 265% increase in the electricity demand from data centres.<\/p> <p>  In the current context where we are having literally to consider measures such as keeping the lights off or reducing the use of lights, has the CRU reflected on the decision not to apply the reasonable standard of having a moratorium until the demand can be safety and securely facilitated by the network and instead to go with a couple of connection measures?  On the decision the CRU made not to limit the expansion of electricity demand by data centres but to look instead at connection measures, will the delegation comment on two of them in particular?  One is the question of backup generators and the extent to which they rely on fossil fuels.  We know, for example, that two of the new data centres that have been given planning permission have diesel backup generators.  Perhaps the witnesses could comment on the danger of locking in that in terms of backup generation, which is fossil fuel-based generation happening in data centres that are being built and ones that are newly proposed to be built.<\/p> <p>  The CRU mentioned the ability of data centres to provide flexibility in their demand by reducing consumption.  I would like to clarify what is meant by that.  Are we saying the data centres must reduce demand at peak times and they can be required to do so?  Is it, as mentioned here, something they could be requested to do or is it, and I was quite concerned by the reference to this earlier, the idea of procurement auctions around demand reduction?  Is the suggestion we would have to bid for companies to reduce their energy demand?  I was very concerned about the suggestion, which seemed to be, and I hope I got this wrong, that a hospital might bid for energy reduction bonuses or payments against other companies.  We certainly should not have a situation where for-profit companies can choose not to reduce energy where hospitals are effectively being told they should seek to reduce their energy costs and so forth by bidding for demand reduction.  Either Deputy O'Sullivan or Deputy Leddin made the very sensible suggestion that surely we should just pay for battery power in our public and essential services rather than have them going into a demand reduction procurement market.

However, we are on a different trajectory to the overall average.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about data centres.  In the new data centre connection policy, we looked for on-site back-up generation.  We are completely open to that being a combination of on-site renewables and battery storage, which might work in some cases.  As a part of the new approach to carbon sectoral emission limits, that is something we start to look to in order to understand their impact on future growth in this kind of space because it is-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#JJ00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":233,"content":"<p>To clarify, the CRU is open to it being renewable but there is no requirement to that effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#JJ00300","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":234,"content":"<p>That was the published decision.  The focus of that decision was very much on security of supply.  The other options around flexible demand support security of supply but would also be a lower carbon solution.  Sometimes data centres refer to it as chasing the wind or following the sun.  Some of these large global operators have data centres at multiple sites across the globe.  Therefore, at times of low renewables or at peak times in Ireland, they could switch the processing capacity and the electricity demand or load to locations that have high renewables at that particular time.  That is attractive.  Of concern to us is that in the responses we have received to our consultation on the network charges, the indication from some of the sector is that while this is a future option, it may not necessarily be available this winter.  There is some concern in our minds about whether it will be available.  We need to understand that better.<\/p> <p>  On the procurement for demand-side services, we were considering an approach in our network tariff whereby people would be charged and could avoid the charge by reducing their use at specific times.  The EU regulation on emergency measures and supportive energy prices sets out a different approach whereby customers should be incentivised in the manner the Senator described.  In other words, they would compete to earn money to reduce their use.  I am simply repeating what is in the regulation.  That approach must be implemented on a non-discriminatory basis.  It would tend to argue against the approach we were looking at and argues for a different approach that still targets the same benefits.  We are pleased to see that as part of the package.  However, perhaps we need to reflect on the approach we are taking to ensure it aligns with the EU requirements.  I do not think that necessarily rules out the idea that there could be other options to support essential services to get batteries on site.  If that were a policy decision that the Government was to take, there may be other ways of incentivising them.  I am not sure that hospitals are best positioned to bid to reduce use.  What we want to do for hospitals is to ensure they have continuous supply.  That is why they are on the priority list for any of the emergency measures.  Perhaps a different approach is required for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#JJ00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":235,"content":"<p>To be clear, has the CRU reflected on the decision not to suspend the increase in demand for data centre energy until it could be safely and securely facilitated by the network?  That was the second option, which was not chosen.  As I understand it, this does not relate simply to the day-to-day.  The discussions were around what conditions would be attached to connections and to requests for connections.  It would have been within the remit of the CRU to have, for example, a conditionality around requirements for energy usage or reductions.  There is therefore no hard power that requires data centres to reduce their energy use.  The option was not chosen to make an obligation to comply with such requests a condition of having access to the grid.  Is that correct?  Has there been any reflection on that given, as the CRU has said, the disappointing information that is coming through on foot of the CRU not going with the moratorium two years ago, when that was one of the options available to it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#KK00100","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":236,"content":"<p>We will be reflecting first on the new Government statement on data centres because that implements or introduces some different concepts or approaches.
