I would like to welcome everyone to this public meeting of the Joint Committee on Autism.  We have received apologies from Senator Garvey.  Before we start business today, I would like to read some formal notices and the Covid-19 code of conduct.  The Ceann Comhairle of the D&aacute;il, Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l, and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Senator Mark Daly, published a Covid-19 code of conduct for the parliamentary community in May 2022.  Members, staff and visitors are requested to continue to be vigilant and follow public health advice on preventing the spread of Covid-19 infection so that we can continue to manage risk for ourselves and for others who are more vulnerable, including colleagues and their family members who may be elderly or have underlying health conditions or both.  All members of the parliamentary community and visitors are strongly encouraged to wear face masks, not a visor, in busy or crowded locations in the Leinster House complex.<\/p><p>Medical grade masks should be worn wherever recommended by public health advice, and for ten days after a diagnosis of Covid-19.  This will help to reduce the risk of Covid-19 spreading among the parliamentary community.  I ask for everyone's full co-operation on this matter.<\/p><p> On privilege, I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the parliamentary precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.<\/p><p> For the information of the witnesses, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references they may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p><p> The first item on the agenda is the minutes from our previous meeting, the private meeting held on 14 July 2022.  These minutes were already approved at a virtual private meeting but I ask for their approval in public session.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p> On behalf of the committee, I would like to extend a very warm welcome to the parents' groups who are with us today.  We are joined by Ms Ger Kenny, Ms Ciara Jones and Ms Caroline Poole from the Autism Support Hub based in Luttrelstown in Dublin; Ms Margaret Lowndes from the Dublin 12 Campaign for Autism Inclusion; Ms Karen O'Mahony, CEO of the Rainbow Club in Cork; and Ms Sarah Murphy, Ms Miriam Jennings and Ms Elaine Jenkins from the special needs schools and classes.  We are very grateful to our witnesses for taking time out of their schedules to contribute to the public session of the joint committee on autism.  We are particularly grateful as it can be particularly challenging to make arrangements, especially during school time.<\/p><p> The committee is pleased to hear directly from parents today as they have first-hand lived experience of the challenges associated with accessing assessments, school facilities and, indeed, services for their children.  It is imperative to the work of this committee that we hear from families of autistic persons and to ensure their views inform our committee's final report.  Before we hear from our witnesses, I propose that we publish their opening statements on the committee's website.  Is that agreed? Agreed.<\/p><p> We will now hear opening statements from our witnesses and we will then have questions and answers with members. I propose that each organisation represented here has five minutes to make its opening statement.  Each member will have five minutes for questions and answers.  We will call members in accordance with the list we circulated.  If there is time afterwards, members may ask additional questions.  As this session is scheduled to last a full three hours rather than a split session of one and a half hours each, I suggest we take a five-minute sos, roughly one and a half hours into the session.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p> First, we will hear from Ms Ciara Jones from the Autism Support Hub.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#A00200","speaker":"1639","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":7,"content":"<p>We would like to thank the Chair, Deputies and Senators for the opportunity to speak to them today.   Ms Kenny, Ms Poole and I are from the Autism Support Hub, based in Dublin 15.  In the first instance, we are here today as parents of autistic children, and second as advocates trying to make a difference to help and support families.  It is important to say that while today is a great privilege, we, as parents, should not have to be here, but the sad reality is circumstances necessitate this due to the blatant failures of the State to provide basic supports for our children.  We, as individuals, have to constantly fight, fight, fight for the basic supports for our children to allow them to prosper and grow to reach their full potential.  This should not require a battle.<\/p> <p>  Back in 2020 I decided to set up the Autism Support Hub, and with the support of three other mothers, two of whom are with me today, we set out on a journey that has been a privileged one, a journey into the private lives of many families we meet each week.  The original purpose of the hub was to help and support parents of recently diagnosed autistic children, but it soon became apparent the remit of the hub was far greater than this.<\/p> <p>  At its essence, when setting up the hub, I did not want parents of recently diagnosed children to experience the same sense of loss, worry and helplessness that I experienced when my son, Gavin, was diagnosed just over ten years ago.  I am sad to say that ten years later families are still experiencing the same sense of loss upon receiving their child&rsquo;s diagnosis, and this is not right.  Families need to be better supported from the get-go.<\/p> <p>  We open our doors to meet parents in a private capacity and safe space where we share our own knowledge and experience.  Through this engagement with parents, we offer them support and information they need to navigate their own personal journey.  We stay with them on this journey until they feel empowered to go it on their own.  Each week since the opening of the hub, we have met families in crisis who are battling the unfair system we find ourselves in when it comes to accessing services and supports.  These services are seen as a luxury, but they are the difference between our children thriving and barely surviving.  This is the reality for many of us.<\/p> <p>  We see so many families struggling around school places.  Either they have none or the one they have is unsuccessful due to the lack of training of teachers and, therefore, there is no understanding of the child&rsquo;s needs within the school setting.  As we know our children having the appropriate school setting is of the highest importance.  We need principals, teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, to have mandatory and continuous training for our children to have a positive school experience and not have parents worried sick for the day when their children are gone and often suffer the backlash when their children are home - for example, around masking.  Where parents express difficulty with their school, we suggest Ms Kenny contact the principal to offer free Tusla accredited autism training under autism clubs and education umbrella, ACE, also founded and supported by Ms Kenny for teachers and SNAs.<\/p> <p>  The Autism Support Hub at its essence provides moral support to the parents who walk through our doors.  Sometimes this is a chat, a hug or  simply saying \"we understand\", but we also offer practical support.  Week in, week out we support families with the many burdensome forms that exist when trying to access support, be they educational or financial, from home tuition, domiciliary care allowance, DCA, and carer's allowance to mention but a few.  Parents come back on many occasions for the continued moral support and, unfortunately, for the support in appealing the many DCA applications refusals.  Reform of how these forms are assessed will go a long way in supporting families.<\/p> <p>  We also offer families the opportunity to attend professional talks through the Parent Led Autism Network, PLAN, again set up voluntarily by Ms Kenny.  She has rolled out PLAN in other parts of Dublin where they are a much needed support for families.  PLAN offers free talks by professionals on a wide variety of autism topics.  These talks are booked out month on month and again have proved an incredible support for parents trying to cope.<\/p> <p>  In Dublin 15, we have Little Seeds autism arch club, which offers a social outlet to more than 70 autistic children.  Only last week Ms Kenny opened Little Seeds autism support therapy services to these 70 families.  As we know, such therapies should be offered by the HSE and disability services but are not.  She went about not only finding the therapists but setting up the service.  The reason for these therapy services existing within this group is due to the hard work of local fundraising.<\/p> <p>  We also rely heavily on the support of AsIAm, as some situations require more professional support and advocacy which is beyond our expertise and knowledge.  We direct these families to the community support team in AsIAm through their autism information line.<\/p> <p>  We would like to thank members for listening to us today and we hope going forward they agree that what we are doing in Dublin 15 can be mirrored on a national level with the support of the members and Government bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Ciara Jones"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Jones.

I am a parent of two children with additional needs and the chairperson of the support group and campaign.  I acknowledge the input of our vice chairperson, Helen Holmes, who worked with me on today's submission but is unable to attend.<\/p> <p>  Our organisation was set up in 2018 due to the frustration of parents regarding the lack of education provision, support services and therapies for children in our area.  We advocate for equal opportunities in education and improved disability services and to promote acceptance for our children with additional needs in our community and beyond.  The work of our campaign over the past four years has resulted in the opening of a brand new autism special school in Crumlin in 2021.  Thirty-six children were enrolled initially and that has now increased to 48.  In addition, according to the website of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, the service provision in the Dublin 12 community has increased from seven primary autism classes and one early intervention class in 2018 to 16 primary autism classes and three early intervention classes now.  It is also worth noting that, at secondary level, there are currently only six autism classes.<\/p> <p>  We achieved this by presenting our autism inclusion proposal for Dublin 12 to show there were not enough suitable placements within the community for our children and that children as young as four years of age were continuing to be placed on home tuition or bussed out of the area.  Continued pressure and meetings with the Department of Education, the NCSE, Ministers and our Deputies and Senators followed, as well as the arranging of local protests.<\/p> <p>  While we are happy with the progress to date, there is more work to be done to ensure all schools in the locality have an autism class to ensure inclusivity for all.  There are only three primary schools and three secondary schools across Dublin 12 with no autism classes and no immediate plans to open one.  We continue to liaise with these schools and the NCSE and Ministers on how they can be assisted.<\/p> <p>  In addition to this, we advocate for children with additional needs who attend a mainstream setting to receive the extra support and the correct resources needed to assist them and to support teachers in their roles, be it full training in autism or training in other comorbid conditions.  The NCSE provides training but places are extremely limited.  Teachers need training when in college so they have more time to understand the different abilities of the wonderful children they will meet in their classroom.  In January 2021, the first national training programme for special needs assistants, SNAs, was introduced by UCD.  This is a positive step forward but the course needs to be accredited as the SNAs need to be able to work and look after our children every day.  We look forward to the course being rolled out further.<\/p> <p>  At present, special schools throughout the country have no therapists.  The new special school opened in Dublin 12 was given the school inclusion model, SIM.  The SIM is not fit for purpose.  It does not allow therapists to work directly with children but instead gives teachers advice on how to handle situations.  This model is not suitable for a special school, or any school.  Our vision is for all schools in Dublin 12 to have at least one autism class and for children to receive suitable educational placements.  We want schools to be able to liaise with each other while building their autism school communities and to have support from the Department of Education and the NCSE to do this.<\/p> <p>  Our autism support group for parents was also launched four years ago in response to a massive need for families to have a place to go in the area where they could meet other families dealing with similar issues.  We pride ourselves on our three core pillars of inclusion, support and advocacy.  We provide monthly support groups for parents and a safe space to come and chat or just listen.  Our community has grown, and it is great to see parents now connecting with each other.  We have been organising activities for children with additional needs for more than 40 families in our community since 2018.  We have run family Lego clubs, sports clubs, sensory play activities and trips to jump zones and farms.  We have held Christmas parties and arranged socially distanced visits from Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny during the Covid pandemic restrictions.  In partnership with Dublin City Council, we were asked to hold an autism awareness morning and a celebration party for World Autism Day in April to promote awareness and acceptance in our community.<\/p> <p>  A common theme among our families is that their children have very limited opportunity for social interaction, so we reached out to sports and swimming clubs.  We liaised with the local library and now we have an amazing cubby that children can use.  Many of our local sports clubs offer neurodiverse children an opportunity to take part in football, GAA, boxing and swimming.  These sessions are specifically tailored to meet the needs of our children while also providing them with a safe place to enjoy sports like their peers.  To promote advocacy for parents, we invite a number of key speakers to talk to us to ensure we understand our own rights and those of our children in areas such as education and disability services.  Parents want to be empowered when it comes to their own children, and there is no better advocate for a child in their early years than their own parent.<\/p> <p>  The roll-out of the progressing disability services model, which has been delayed, is fantastic on paper but in reality it is a different story.<\/p> <p>  We spoke previously at a joint committee in May 2022 on the main issues, including communication, inconsistencies across the teams, waiting lists, recruitment and grants for families to access therapies.  We also met the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to discuss these issues and, most important, to make recommendations for the improvement of services.  Families are waiting too long for interventions for their child, and big social media announcements in advance of any real action give false hope to parents.  A child who is referred to the disability teams will not be seen by a member of the team for up to two years.  That is two years of families being left in limbo with no support.  Families seek out our local support group as they want reassurance, understanding and to be supported.  As parents we need a clear pathway to services with the HSE.  A letter saying your child will be seen in two years and no other communication during that time is simply not good enough.  A key area affecting families right now is the cost of living.  Private therapies are in increased demand due to the failure of the HSE.  This time last year a 45-minute session with a private occupational therapist cost &euro;100.  Now it costs &euro;120.<\/p> <p>  If the committee takes only one thing away from this meeting, it is that it really listens to the parents and caregivers on the ground supporting their children and young adults.  We are the people who can tell the committee the reality of dealing with the health service and accessing education.  Too much time is spent discussing the same issues year after year with absolutely no change.  While the system fails the people it is trusted to help, local support groups are left to support families through these challenging times.  Families support families.  Support groups need to be recognised for the voluntary work they do.  These are parents who come together and help their communities.<\/p> <p>  When parents start their journey, it can be very lonely, but in Dublin 12 they now know there is a group to support them and that makes a huge difference.  It gives them peace of mind in a space where they can build friendships for themselves and their children.  As the saying goes there is strength in community.  Alone we can do so little, together we can do so much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#C00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Margaret Lowndes"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Lowndes and invite Ms. Karen O'Mahony from the Rainbow Club Cork Centre for Autism to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#C00200","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I am a mum to four children.  Two of my sons, Sean and Stephen, are autistic.  I am also a co-founder of the Rainbow Club Cork Centre for Autism.  I am grateful for this opportunity to come before the committee today and discuss the many issues we see in our lives and the lives of the 1,028 families who attend our service weekly.  For years, families like ours have been treated badly by heavily funded State agencies, left behind without support, put into situations they do not deserve, and our teens, children and young adults discriminated against and neglected in so many ways.  This story is not uncommon.  I am sure the committee members have all heard these stories, but the reality is this is our life every day.  My sons have been let down by the State and the education system that did not cater for their needs, breaking the trust of Sean and Stephen and leaving them with trauma and emotional fallout that was often aggressive and which our family had to endure.  The current provision of child and adolescent mental health services needs to be examined, and there are many teens like my son Sean on medication that is not being monitored appropriately.<\/p> <p>  A black hole we ended up in with no one to get us out led Jon and I to campaign and set up the Rainbow Club so that children and families could receive support in an holistic, caring and loving manner which they deserve and in which will thrive.  We provide 21 activities and interventions six days a week.  We cater for children from two years old up to adults of 23.  We provide a place that can help them to cope daily, build friendships, reduce anxiety around sensory issues, regulate themselves, accept themselves for who they are and what they need, and encourage them on their pathway, being by their side along that journey.  We provide sibling support, parent training, counselling and support groups.  We advocate in schools for families.  We support families with housing difficulties or difficulties with forms and service provision, or who are experiencing hardship and homelessness.  Our sports department has many programmes, all of which target the difficulties that stop and exclude children and teens from participating in mainstream sports daily by building a model that will allow them to learn, with no expectation or stress in an activity that is supposed to enhance positive mental health and well-being.  Computer and games programmes is the future for many, and is the skill the children need to know about and learn.  The groups are all set up for every child so he or she can be part of a group enjoying activities, growing in confidence and equipping them with what that child needs for his or her adult life.<\/p> <p>  We are proud of what we have built.  Shame on this State for not supporting us with the funding we so desperately need to expand and provide more services to families in Cork city and county.  Families are so desperate that they travel to us from Limerick, Kilkenny, Waterford and now Killarney, all because there is nothing there for them.  We will replicate.  We will get our forever home because I will not stop until Rainbow Club is national so no one is left behind.  I will never give up fighting until this country sees the child and family at the centre.  Rainbow Club is a universal model for autism which is now seven years old, thriving in a little corner in Mahon, Cork, and filled with laughter, healing and progress every day.  It is a community model that has the family at the heart of it with a strategy that is actually achieving its goals.  Our organisation, including our caf&eacute;, offers an inclusive environment for all and provides jobs for local people and autistic adults.  Our caf&eacute; is a training caf&eacute; that welcomes students from the National Learning Network, NLN, L'Arche, Aspect, schools and colleges.  It is where Se&aacute;n, the Autistic Baker, found his love for baking.  It is a haven for all, buzzing with chatter and modelling acceptance every day.<\/p><p> Rainbow Club is a beacon of hope.  It shows the way services should be provided, the impact this model has on families' quality of life and the impact of the wrap-around support to the autistic person to thrive and live a fulfilling, positive life, allowing him or her to participate and give back.  Autistic people have the right to be included, accepted and supported in their life but this is not the case.  They are made to feel more excluded and rejected every day in the society we have created, and that needs to change.<\/p><p> The committee has the opportunity to listen to all sides.  Autistic persons, advocacy groups, community groups and parents should all be part of the discussions and debates for this new policy, ensuring every voice is heard.  &ldquo;People first&rdquo; should always be our goal.  Trying to put supports in place is not acceptable anymore; action is now needed.<\/p><p> Alternative education is another programme we want to provide in education, with a sensory diet for the child and teen who cannot cope, and if the correct supports are in place, it can provide a wrap-around for the individual and a transition back to school, all catering for the needs of the person in a caring nature.  Summer provision is also a must.  Without appropriate respite, these families need support and consistency throughout the year.  We also supply that, again without State funding.  Too many schools refuse to do it or to carry it out effectively.  Too many children go without help, routine or structure during the summer months and the fallout for them and their families is a high price to pay.<\/p><p> I ask the committee members for three things, namely, a plan and policy that will provide what autistic people and their families need, support for the Rainbow Club model and the impact it has and can have for families in Ireland if replicated, and a thought for children such as my sons, Sean and Stephen, when they make decisions, implement change and continue their oversight of the policy that will impact on their future.  The committee can make the world a better place for them if it hears their voices today.<\/p><p> I thank members for listening to the voices I represent in the Rainbow Club.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen O'Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Mahony and invite Ms Jennings to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#D00200","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee members for the opportunity to address them.  We are a parents' group whose children attend special schools and classes countrywide.  The vast majority of our children have complex needs and life-altering disabilities.  Their needs are severe, multiple and present from the cradle to the grave.<\/p> <p>  The July provision school programme came about following a High Court judgment in 1993 that recognised that children with severe needs lose skills over the long school holidays that may never be recovered.  It was replaced by the expanded summer programme in 2020, which saw an increase in eligibility from 15,000 children in 2019 to 80,000 children in 2021.  We believe, however, that our children's need for a school-based summer programme was not safeguarded.  No plan was put in place to ensure that complex-needs children, for whom the scheme was set up, would access it.  Department of Education figures from 2021 show that 80% of children in special schools had no access to the programme, while less than 5% of the 8,000 children in special schools got the full recommended four weeks.<\/p> <p>  The home-based programme promoted by the Department is not an appropriate alternative.  The National Council for Special Education has stated this is the least effective way to deliver the programme, given many children with autism and intellectual disabilities cannot cope and will not tolerate strangers in their home environment.  A home-based programme cannot be mooted as an alternative to the school-based programme to facilitate children for whom it is not suitable.<\/p> <p>  The school day provides more to our children than a curriculum.  It provides routine, stability and an opportunity to be a part of a world outside of their home.  Our children have access to school facilities such as sensory and occupational therapy rooms and secure play areas.  The impact of the long school break during the summer is significant and frightening.  Our children's essential routine stops abruptly and they cannot understand why.  They cannot communicate their multiple worries and uncertainties given so many are non-verbal.  They regress rapidly.<\/p> <p>  We have submitted real-life stories from ten our families, as the committee will have seen.  The pressure on the child, parents, siblings and extended family is immense.  There are no summer camps, playdates or family holidays during the nine or 13 weeks away from school.  The long break causes an increase in the number of episodes of sensory overload, a regression in skills and a greater incidence of anxiety, self-injurious behaviours, aggression towards parents and siblings, destructive outbursts and absconding.  When a child is regressing and losing the ability to cope, this puts a strain on families trying to support him or her.  Family relationships come under immense pressure.  Siblings end up assisting with care and are left with no summer holidays themselves while parents try to hold the family unit together under incredible levels of stress and in a constant state of hyper-vigilance.<\/p> <p>  We ask, for the sake of our children and their families, that the committee fight for complex-needs children to be fully included in the school-based summer programme.  We ask that a tiered approach to the provision of the programme be established based on absolute need.  We voiced our concerns to our schools, local representatives and the Department of Education, along with the Minister for Education and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, earlier this year, yet we still watched from a lonely distance as families prepared for a summer break, anxiously wondering what would happen to our children over the summer.  Many families learned only in June that their school would not provide the programme, while many parents scrambled to ask their employer for unpaid leave, just to cope.<\/p> <p>  We have been proactive in our advocacy for our children and have worked hard to propose solutions.  We have contacted the departments of education in all 36 jurisdictions in Europe.  We have identified, as has the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, a highly effective special school summer model in Malta.  The Maltese utilise a combination of school staff and external multidisciplinary professionals, students and trainees, such as nurses, doctors, speech therapists and respite workers, to work with the children over eight weeks of their school holidays.  A fresh approach benefits not only the children but also the professionals, who gain valuable experience.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, has received information from interviews with three Irish special school principals running very successful school-based programmes.  These principals often employ external professional staff and trainees and they start planning in January.  We need the Minister of State and the Department of Education to design a fresh approach and to commence work on it urgently.  We need collaboration between Departments to ensure our complex-needs children will get access to our next summer programme.  They cannot afford to lose another year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Miriam Jennings"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Jennings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#D00400","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Ms O'Mahony referred to medication and CAMHS.

I commend them on all the work they are doing to support their autistic children and autistic adults in their community.  I have a question on financial supports which some witnesses mentioned.  Does this all come through fundraising or do they get any Government support whatsoever?  Are any grants available?  I know they indicated that the HSE has not been forthcoming.<\/p> <p>  Some of the witnesses also mentioned that they had managed to engage therapists to offer interventions.  We have heard from the HSE that it cannot find them in the community.  How come they seem to be available?  Is it just that they are not willing to work for the HSE because of various conditions?  What is the witnesses' understanding of it?  <\/p> <p>  I congratulate Ms Lowndes on the number of schools which have been opened in her locality and the pressure she applied to bring that about.  When a special school or an autism class is opened are the staff who are put in adequately trained?  We frequently say that we need more autism classes and need them in every school and in every community so that children do not have to travel miles to get to a suitable school.  While that is correct, they are often opened without the proper planning and the proper resources being put in.  Is that a major issue?  <\/p> <p>  Because of the lack of assessment of children, they do not get the school place they deserve to get.  As it could be years before they are properly assessed, does that delay mean they are not being put in the proper placement which does damage to them?<\/p> <p>  A number of witnesses spoke about proposals on the summer provision.  I could not agree more.  This is something that needs to be planned now for next year.  We need to start the planning process now and put it in place from January onwards.<\/p> <p>  I thank Ms Jennings for the examples she provided from principals and people working in various services.  They give an insight into what is required.  Many schools are not given approval until May which is far too late.  They may be using it as an excuse not to proceed with the summer provision.  However, it is a problem that they are not told what funding is available until May or June which is too late.  This process needs to start much earlier.  It needs to ensure that the children with more complex needs are catered for first and not left on their own at home maybe with unsuitable home-based tuition if they are lucky enough to get a tutor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#E04300","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":63,"content":"<p>There was one specific question for Ms Lowndes.

It is not just about getting that building open; it is everything else that goes with it.  When we campaigned, we wanted trained teachers, SNAs and therapists on site.  We asked for that.  Teachers are not given sufficient training.  Teacher training is the bare minimum when it comes to children with special educational needs.  When they go looking for NCSE courses, there are very limited places.  We recently discovered that when the first autism class is opened, the school gets some NCSE training programmes.  However, there is no training for the second, third and fourth.  The trained teacher has to train the other staff which makes no sense to us.  Training should be mandatory.  About two years ago the North of Ireland was looking to introduce mandatory training for teachers.  I am not 100% sure if it has gone through; I do not think it has.  Mandatory training should be brought in down here.  It is up to teachers as to which side they go, but they need to learn the whole aspect of education.<\/p> <p>  It is the same with the NCSE which does not seem to think this is urgent.  It is a case of open an autism class, give the go-ahead and the teacher is trained two days before they go in or in some cases there is no training until the children are in there.<\/p><p>We have an autism class at the moment that was due to open on 31 August and did not open.  It will not open until the first week of October.  There are actually children sitting at home, and that teacher is currently training.

This year, in Dublin 15, there were, I think, 15 children who had come through primary school and there was no secondary school place for them, so some of the schools in Dublin 15 were asked to open an autism class.<\/p> <p>  Two years ago, I set up ACE, which is Autism Clubs and Education, so I receive funding from Tusla.  I source speakers to provide free training workshops to teachers, SNAs and professionals.  I will be starting a workshop in October and I will be notifying the schools.  We also have a Facebook page.  That workshop will go back to the beginning on topics such as what is autism; understanding autism; setting up an autism class; and dealing with anxiety.  I would love for it to be compulsory for schools.  I do not think that they should have a choice in whether they take the training or not.  It should be compulsory, whether they come to ACE and do it through me or they do it through the Middletown Centre for Autism or other organisations that offer workshops.  No teacher or SNA should be in a class teaching a child with autism who has never had that experience before. <\/p> <p>  On another matter, I also have the Parent-Led Autism Network, PLAN, which provides free parent information talks.  It is funded by Tusla.  They have been going on for the past four years.  There are free training workshops to help parents who are struggling with their children.  We have both Zoom and in-person information talks.  All topics are autism-related.  It went nationwide, particularly during Covid-19.  A lot more families, with the pressure of homeschooling their child, were reaching out and looking for help.  <\/p> <p>  PLAN has been replicated in Dublin 5, 13 and 17 for the past two years.  They have a big launch night coming up in October.  PLAN in Balbriggan is very successful as well.  For me, the dream would be to have PLAN rolled out nationwide.  I would love to see every county in Ireland having one - PLAN Galway, PLAN Limerick, PLAN Kilkenny, and so on.  Even if they had the budget for one speaker per month and a Zoom licence, they could reach out to so many more families while they are on waiting lists.  Tusla recognises that this is a bit of a stopgap.  This is help that people can get through Zoom for some of the talks or meet with other parents and have contact with them.  That is a little of what I have been able to set up myself in the last few years and it has been a big success.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Ger Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":69,"content":"<p>Thank you very much.

We are really in the middle of a perfect storm at the moment, because we have a combination of no staff training and no therapists.  When my son was diagnosed eight years ago, we had some access to speech and occupational therapy.  There was a plan at that stage.  When he started school, the teachers had somebody to refer to around his sensory needs.  He had a sensory programme.  Now, there is nobody in our Children's Disability Network teams, CDNTs, to see those children.  They do not know them in school, they do not know them starting school, they do not know them as they grow up, and the teachers are not trained to understand the absolute depths of the behaviour, of how to teach these children to communicate or how to manage their sensory needs.  It is not really about education or health.  The two matters are absolutely knotted together, for life, but we are in a very bad place at the moment when the teachers do not understand the behaviours that are arriving into these many autism classes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Elaine Jenkins"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I would like to say about the autism classes that it tends to be the last teacher into the school that gets the autism class.

I have met a number of the witnesses in the flesh over the past few years and a few on Zoom as well.  It is nice to put the face to the name.  We only have five minutes, which is very short.  I would prefer to hear from the witnesses.  I have two specific questions and then perhaps I could come in at the end again.  One relates special school classes.  The summer provision programme does not work.  It is great for me as a Government TD to be able to say to people \"you have more funding than ever before\" but, on the ground, obviously, that is not translating.  People are not taking up the scheme for one reason or another.  There are difficulties there.  I think Mrs. Jennings hit the nail on the head that the people that that course was originally designed for are not benefiting from it.  They need the most help and attention, specifically during those months where there is no school.  I would like to ask the witnesses about the staffing of that course.  I sat in a staff room for 15 years professionally and I cannot recall, and I may be wrong, a principal or teacher coming in saying \"anybody up for doing summer provision this year?\"  I genuinely cannot.  Is it a case that we need to look at a regional model where schools would band together or is it a case that we are going to compel schools to do it?  If we continue to use a discretionary element and allow schools to make the decision, we might end up on the same road we did with the ASD classes, which is part of the mess we are in today.  I would be interested if the witnesses could give me a two-minute answer on that.<\/p> <p>  Ms. O'Mahony is up from Cork, like me, so I may have to go to her for my other two minutes.  I know the work Ms O'Mahony does, I know the confines of the space that she is in.  It is not practical.  She is making the best of what she can, but when I hear that there are 1,028 families coming through her doors every week, bearing in mind the setting she is in, I ask myself how they manage it.  Could she give us a picture of how she manages it day to day and what a new site would do for her?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#F01100","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Thank you Deputy O'Sullivan.

As Mrs. Jennings mentioned earlier regarding the Department of Education freedom of information figures for 2021, only 410 children in special schools had the school-based programme.  A bigger figure is that 80% of them had none.<\/p><p>We spoke to the parents in our group earlier this year and as of June the attendance numbers look to be down somewhat, even on 2021.  We can sit here and complain or we can do something about it.  What we do as a group is to try to find solutions that we can bring forward.  As Ms Jennings mentioned, one angle we took was to find out what the other jurisdictions in Europe are doing.  We contacted each of them and many replied.  The one we had most interaction with was the Maltese department of education.  We met them three times.  They were extremely helpful.  They talked us through what they do in summer.  They have a similar system to us in that they have special schools.  They are now copying our model for special classes and rolling that out but they also have a lot of autistic children in mainstream education.  They offer a programme which is available to every child, every year, for the full summer break.  They offer the work initially to educators early in the year who decide whether they will do it.  If not, then it is offered to others, for example, speech therapists, OTs, doctors, nurses, trainee police etc.  We believe everybody who will be working with our children as adults should know them as children and they benefit as much from that as our children do.  <\/p><p> The Maltese programme is an eight week long summer programme.  They cover the curriculum in their winter school.  Summer is basically camp-based in school with school transport.  Some of the school staff participate but not all.  The difference between our programme and theirs is that theirs is equitable.  Every child gets the opportunity to attend.  In our case, some schools offer a severe to profound class, but not an autism class.  Sometimes 10% of a school can attend and there is a lottery.  The Maltese programme is reliable.  It is run for eight weeks every year so parents can plan the summer.  They do not have to take unpaid leave.  Siblings can have a life during the summer.  Finally, it is flexible.  Not every child will be able to attend for the full summer so parents can choose which weeks the child attends.  <\/p><p> We are asking for a Maltese-type programme to be introduced from 2023 onwards and, as Ms Jennings said, we need a tiered approach.  That is what we are hoping for.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#F01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Elaine Jenkins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":77,"content":"<p>Can I clarify that no schools have a choice in this?

Complex needs can mean autism, intellectual disability, including a moderate intellectual disability with medical needs, for example epilepsy or other comorbid mental health issues.  It also includes other syndromes like Down's syndrome, which my son has.  He has a combination of all of those.  Autism and disability are wide spectrums and the children who have missed the summer programme are those complex needs children.  The summer programme was set up for these children.  Only 410 children were provided with the full four weeks which was recommended by that High Court judgment nearly 20 years ago now.  Here we are.  Loads of money is being thrown at it; t is a State funded system but it is not State controlled.  Every school can decide and they use the excuse that they did not find out until May or June.  The Department does need to get the guidelines out a bit quicker every year, but the programme has been in place for nearly 20 years.  It is not a surprise and the special schools in particular do not offer the programme.

We take up about 18,000 sq. ft.  We have used every little piece of space we have, but this is not the ideal dream for Rainbow Club obviously.

It is a perfect site for us as it would cater for all of our current needs and allow us to expand.  There is a lot of conversation about what we do.

Last night I sat down and read your submissions for the best part of two hours.  In all honesty I could hardly bear to read them and then I thought, what am I talking about?  These are the lives the witnesses lead.  The submissions were very powerful, especially where the different parents of children A-L spoke about the impact on their families.  There was one phrase that somebody used which I think will stay with me forever.  They said that they were literally living in the shadows of society, that they do not belong anywhere.  <\/p> <p>  It is clear that the members of the committee are very concerned.  Some people have lived experience of this.  I do not personally.  I have family members who do, but I do not.  The submissions made me aware of the huge responsibility that we have in this committee, that in 12 or nine months time when we have finished our work that we make progress.  One of the good things about all of the documentation that we received from the witnesses is that it included some solutions and some ideas.  It referenced the model in Malta and what I really liked about that model was how flexible it is and I would like to hear the views of the witnesses.  In the past, in Malta, if they could not get enough people to run the programme they increased salaries to make it worth people's while.  As Ms Jenkins said, they include everybody from students, to graduates, to police trainees.  They mixed school and non-school, medical and various different sectors to make sure that they could run the programme. We have had teachers' unions in here.  We have spoken to others who are all part of this system, including the Minister.  We need to try to find a system that works and the Maltese one seems to have a lot of positive aspects.  I think the question was asked a few moments ago whether the witnesses believe it should be mandatory and I think Ms Jenkins said that the answer to that is above her paygrade.<\/p><p>I think what the Maltese model allows for is a model where we do not have to say to schools that every single one of them must do it next year, but where we can say we have a model here that will reward those who want to do it.  Literally, every day that goes by, when something is not happening to put things in place for next year, is a day lost.  I would like the witnesses view on that because there are a lot of pieces to this jigsaw.  What do we need to do now so that we are not running after our tails next March, April and May?  I thank the witnesses again.  They certainly gave me a great deal of food for thought.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#G01300","speaker":"1605","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":90,"content":"<p>Who wants to take the first question?

The first thing I would say is that I think everybody here is a very reluctant advocate.  We certainly would not choose to be here but we come here because this is our lived experience.  To answer Deputy Harkin's question, we want to come with solutions.  It is very important to us to be part of the solution and to bring what we know to those who have the power to do something.<\/p> <p>  We looked at the couple of schools providing a more or less full summer in-school programme, and the committee has received the information.  We contacted three special school principals who sat with us and went through a full case study.  They were fantastic.  The first thing I will say about those principals is that each and every one of them said the reason they do it every single year is that they could not imagine these families being without this for nine weeks, not to mention that some of our children in the secondary school system go without this for 13 weeks.  They said they could not not do it.  They work all year round to identify and line up people to work in the programme.  They are seeing a pattern where it is getting harder every year to obtain staff and retain their own staff.  One principal said that perhaps the expansion of the programme and allowing their current teachers to work in the community on the home model, with children with less challenging needs has maybe resulted in the loss of a couple of staff from their in-school programme.  They work all year to plan it and they ask their own staff in January who is available.  They work from there and they rely very heavily on keeping intensive local lists and students who have been in on placement.  They have a very good relationship with universities from which they place students.  Special schools would have students coming from all the disciplines within the multidisciplinary team for experience.<\/p> <p>  This year we took one of those schools as a case study.  It had lost a significant number of staff who had normally done the programme and who were not available this year.  We took a look at who it had available and at the multidisciplinary students who were available there.  We also interviewed three of those students as part of the case study.  The bottom line was that it really was a win-win.  Those students could not talk enough about their whole experience and what they had learned.  It was what they went to college for and it was the icing on the cake.  The experience over three to four weeks in the special school was something a couple of them had never been exposed to.  They all said it was extremely daunting to start with but they got magnificent support.  It just brought out so many positives for them in terms of capitalising on all they had learned in college and of a commitment to continue to be available and to work with the school going forward.  <\/p> <p>  This is what our schools need.  Our school principals tell us they need these local lists and these people to call on, so that certainly was a win-win.  I refer to the practicalities of it and of how these schools are delivering a very detailed programme.  Let us not forget that to deliver a special school programme for children with very complex needs and where you are talking about a 1:1 ratio nearly all of the time, you are talking about a huge responsibility for the principal and the child, but also for the student or that person who is coming in that is supporting.  Each of the schools needed a significant hand-over time.  That was done by one of the schools in June and it paid for it from its own board of management fund in order to have those students in from five to ten weeks on placement and for a hand-over for the specific child they would be working with.  They made it work.<\/p> <p>  What we identified were the lengths these principals were willing to go to in order to ensure those families had the remaining support in the summer.  A principal told me that each week they can gain from the summer programme, hopefully, means slightly less regression in September.  The principal said that regression is inevitable as the school holidays are simply too long, but they are trying to work on lessening that regression.<\/p> <p>  The school on which we did the case study was quite unique.  It had a good working relationship with its overnight service, that is, the respite services for the few children availing of that service.  In that case, because it had the problems with employing staff this year, each child in the school had a four-day week.  However, it immediately identified the children who would be with the overnight service within these weeks in July.  It worked with it so that the night the children were with the overnight service could be the fifth day they were not at school and that it would have them the other four days.  It was an example of cross-department or cross-service partnership working really well for the benefit of the child.  The child was the focus.<\/p> <p>  These principals know exactly what our families are living with.  They really identify the absolute strain and difficulties our families face for nine weeks.  The Deputy will have read the stories and they are not easy reading but I can guarantee they are the reality and all of our families are always available to speak.  In terms of the reality of raising a child with very complex needs, in many of our families, a lone carer cannot do that and a second parent has to take unpaid leave.  Two parents have to be at home for that period of time.  In many case their siblings, their younger brothers and sisters, take over some of those care needs.  It is wholly inappropriate for a child to be a carer when that child is under the age of ten.  That is what is happening in the summer with our complex needs children.  We find siblings want to leave home a lot sooner as they cannot cope with living with their brother or sister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Miriam Jennings"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":92,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#H00400","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":93,"content":"<p>It is very difficult to be a mother and feel you have failed your other children while you were trying to be everything to one child.

I sometimes go back to the saying that nobody knows the shoe is cutting a person except the person who is wearing it.  That is the reason this committee was set up, that is, to listen to the voices.  However, I am sick of listening, and that is the God's honest truth.  I am sick of listening to the issues across other committees without any action.  I hope this committee will implement some of the actions each and every witness brought up here today.  It is a prime example of the saying that if you want the job done, you have to do it yourself.  I refer to many of these organisations, parents groups and hubs were set up.  I know that in Ardara, County Donegal, parents, and more so women, are coming together and setting up support groups for each other.  AsIAm, the national organisation, provides training and we, as a committee, have had that training.<\/p><p>AsIAm provides very appropriate training and that should be implemented in every school.  We must provide children with whatever supports they need.  Not every child requires a place in a special school and may only need a special class.<br\/><br\/>I do not mean to be controversial but there are a hell of a lot of Ministers.  We have  the Minister for Education; the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Madigan, who <font color=\"#00241A\">has responsibility for special education and inclusion; and the <\/font>Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  With so many people the can is kicked down the road.  I have seen that myself as an activist and as a person who works closely with organisations such as AsIAm and Independent Living Movement Ireland plus there are autistic adults too.  Do the organisations represented here find that when they raise issues with Ministers that have been told that the issues are not within the remit of that Department?<br\/><br\/>I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  It is a very effective committee as there is cross-party support for issues.  I also work closely with some of the Departments, unions and the Department of Education on issues which cry out for mental health supports to be provided in all of the schools.  These supports must be implemented as well.  Parents, young people and organisations provide solutions and answers but there is a lack of political will.  This committee enjoys cross-party support for the provision of better services.  We are not looking for autistic children and adults to receive special treatment just to receive their basic human rights and supports.  There are no supports in place for parents or families so they and the organisations must find that draining and feel like they are banging their heads off a brick wall when they seek answers.  This committee has only recently been established and it is good to bring people in here such as the mothers of autistic children and the people affected but we need implementation.  We know the situation with the summer programme, having listened to parents, so now there must be implementation because otherwise we could be here this time next year talking about what we need.  We know the answers and this is really about implementation.  In terms of dealing with different Departments though, not Ministers as such, have the delegations experienced the same as what I think others have experienced?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#H00900","speaker":"1657","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":99,"content":"<p>A few years ago I sent an email describing what my organisation does to the then Minister who had responsibility for disability services.  I received a return email that stated that my organisation and its work did not come within the remit of the Department, which is strange when our children are autistic and have a disability.  The response has stuck in my head and I still have the email.<\/p> <p>  We have engaged with so many Senators and local Deputies, and have had huge support from the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, who constantly tries to support.  There is a lot of goodwill but nothing has happened.  Recently the Minister of State, Deputy Josepha Madigan, visited us and acknowledged our work.  We constantly repeat our message that an entire pathway needs to exist for each child and everything needs to work together to provide enough support for the entire journey, which applies not just to school but to services as well.  There must be a very clear pathway for each child and his or her future.<\/p> <p>  One constantly worries about the next step.  For example, while these children attend national school one wonders whether placements will be found in secondary schools, and also what will happen after respite.  There are families who have children in primary services that are planning as far as three years ahead for the onset of adult services.  I know of a family who, a fortnight ago, had found a respite place for their young adult but the transport service was cancelled at the 11th hour.  The mother in that family had lost her husband previously and she worked on the pathway for two and half years only for transport to be dropped at the last minute.  There is a breakdown in communications which makes it seem like there are steel walls between Departments.  I urge people to start talking together and allow for Department officials to work with families and organisations.  I also want Departments to be receptive to our clearly telling them what works and does not work, and to be receptive to our clearly identifying what services must be put in place.  Our experience is that there is a lot of goodwill but nothing has happened to provide long-term plans and an ability to implement stuff.<\/p> <p>  The summer provision has been a big issue this year.  I have tried to engage on getting home tuition and summer provision for the past four years but have encountered one barrier after another.  On inquiring one is bounced from one person to another and nobody can give a final answer as to what we need to do.  We face that reality every day after we have gotten up in the morning perhaps without having slept that night and still having to do a whole day.  We are not here because we want to be but because we need to be.  We are here because we are all trying to fight for families who may not have a voice as strong as ours.  We are also probably further along this journey than some of the newer families.  They are only starting their journey and they are lucky to have people like us around them because when I started my journey there was nobody available.  If what I have learned and experienced over the years can help somebody else then that is what I will do but we should not have to sit here with us all pleading and begging for help to be provided for our children when that is a simple human right.  They are entitled to such just like everyone else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen O'Mahony"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I shall respond to the point made about responsibility for issues being passed between Departments and Ministers.  A number of our special schools are a dual model so a health and education model.  Many of our families would say that many of the needs of their children with complex needs concern more of a health model.  Some children follow a curriculum in special schools but many of the children for whom we advocate do not.<br\/><br\/>We definitely have some dual conversations with the Minister of State with responsibility for special education and, <font color=\"#00241A\">concerning disability, with the <\/font>Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  We keep them constantly up to date with our research and the models that we propose.  In addition we have had numerous meetings with them where we told them everything, which we have identified this morning, about the absolute need for survival and support in the summer.<br\/><br\/>Interestingly, based on further research we conducted this year, we envisage another issue for the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  We have all of the information now so we know how valuable placements are for our students in third level colleges.  One student has told me that they only got to go to a special school, do a placement and get experience because they knew the lady who worked there who, in turn, said a placement could be organised but none of that person's classmates got the same opportunities.  It is crazy that we are not seeing these advantages and opportunities.  On this specific issue there is a three-pronged ministerial approach and Ministers should talk to each other.  Yes, there certainly are areas where we have found a 50:50 split within ministerial communications. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Miriam Jennings"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":101,"content":"<p>The same applies to everything and not just autism classes or special schools but mainstream schools.  There are a lot of autistic children who are in mainstream education but they do not get any support whatsoever and that is really bad.  We advocate for all autistic children but currently the parents we know of autistic children in mainstream education have huge issues because they do not get anything.  There are not enough National Educational Psychological Service\u00a0assistants and therapists.  Also, teachers are not trained enough.  Therefore, children suffer because they are left in the mainstream system.  We have asked for therapists to be brought into the mainstream system, first in special schools but the provision needs to be across the board.  The children in mainstream education who may have an exemption from studying Irish could, for example, receive assistance from therapists at that time whether speech and language therapists or occupational therapists.  This what we must do in future.<\/p> <p>  We have heard stories about children going to school and see the coke bottle effect.  They get in the school door and they are masking all day.  God love them, one wonders how they feel about the situation.  Just because some of these children can communicate or are verbal does not mean that they can actually communicate and, unfortunately, things escalate when they get home.  The parents and their families try their best to help their children but when there is nothing from the HSE and mainstream education is not supported then we fail these children.<\/p><p>However, when you have no support from the HSE and mainstream schools are not supported, we have to consider who is being failed and we are failing the child.  It is definitely all the way across, including the mainstream, the special classes and special schools regarding the HSE and a clear pathway between the HSE and education.  With the change of the Minister responsible - I believe it is now the responsibility of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman - these need to be working together to find one big pathway by which a parent can get the diagnosis and can take their time to understand the diagnosis.  It is an awful shock when you get a diagnosis.  Sometimes, it can be a bit like a funeral.  Parents bounce back but they cannot do so when they are fighting.  Parents are fighting the NCSE and are looking for places and spots.  A clear pathway is needed in which parents can enter a system and log everything in with information about where to go, instead of being handed a load of sheets of paper to look for schools.  This is where parents' groups come in.  This is what we all do because parents come to us to ask where to go, where are the suitable schools in the community, where is the nearest children's disability network team, CDNT, what do they provide etc.  It is awful for parents who have been in the system for so long like most of us here, who have kids who are eight, nine and ten years old, to have to sit brand new parents down who think they will get everything and explain the reality that they might need to take out a loan to access private therapies.  When we are talking about everything in this committee, I really hope that members take notice that there are autistic children in mainstream education.  They may be in an inappropriate setting or they might be in the right place but they still need extra help, especially as they go forward.  Respite or adult services might not be for them but we also know through As I Am that a lot of adults do not have employment.  These are the big issues.  The committee needs to be looking across the board at a whole system change. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Margaret Lowndes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Lowndes.

All of my colleagues and I are deeply appreciative of their attendance plus the testimony from all of them has been harrowing to say the least.  As a Government representative, I am deeply embarrassed by the provision of services and the complete disconnect across multiple Departments, which the witnesses have properly articulated.  I was particularly struck by a comment made by Ms O&rsquo;Mahony who said that families have been badly let down by heavily funded agencies over many years and that is the reality.  We are an advanced modern economy yet we look to Malta for a blueprint of a model on how to do things.  The money is there and without question the challenges can be addressed but the problem is the different silos and trying to navigate across different Departments.  I know that she got an email saying it was not a certain Minister&rsquo;s responsibility.  I am sure that the witnesses will not be surprised to learn that we get the same email, which shows the disconnect in the public service and that this is not just experienced by witnesses, as parents.<\/p> <p>  This committee has the best of intentions but the delegations need to see results.  An immediate result that we should aim for is probably the summer programme.  As Ms Jennings pointed out, the whole idea of the summer programme is not progression but to address regression, which is a very telling point for us to take on board.  We are not being asked for supports to improve the education but to address regression.<\/p> <p>  My first question is for the delegation from Special Needs Schools and Classes.  In terms of its aspiration to have the Maltese model in place for 2023, has the Department done anything yet about the matter?  Department representatives have visited Malta but has the delegation seen practical steps taken in regard to the scheme?  According to the group&rsquo;s case study the programme needs to start from January onwards.  Let us bear in mind that we are almost in October so is January realistic?  Have they received an indication from the Department that the scheme will be rolled out in 2023?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#L00200","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":111,"content":"<p>We have had meetings.

She has been a great champion of those with special needs.  We have had many engagements and it is important, having brought her all the way to Dublin, that we give her an opportunity to highlight a more parochial challenge.  She spoke earlier about the connection between special schools and the children's disability network teams or CDNTs and how important it is that we get the information we need from the CDNTs and that such information is given to the schools.  It is fair to say there has been a complete breakdown of the CDNT in Longford.  Regardless of what figures one uses, we are all agreed that there is a staff allocation of 12.5 for the team in Longford but at the moment there are only 2.8 staff servicing that operation.  There is only 0.5 out of 4.5 in speech and language therapy and the social worker has been off since just before Christmas.  It is fair to say that it is a crisis situation in Longford.  Ms Jenkins was one of the parents who, on behalf of the special needs classes and schools group in Longford, wrote to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, about this and copied in the local Oireachtas Members.  She asked for an external review of the staffing in what is a calamitous situation with the CDNT in Longford.  It is clear that the system is broken and is failing children and parents.  Has Ms Jenkins had any response to the email she sent to the Minister of State?  Has she received any update on what action has been taken to remedy what is, in effect, a crisis in the CDNT in the Phoenix Centre in Longford?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#L00500","speaker":"1597","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":115,"content":"<p>No, unfortunately not.<\/p> <p>  The example I used that may have caught the Minister of State's attention, as well as that of Deputy Flaherty, is that of my own son.  He started in an absolutely beautiful new, purpose-built special school in September but he was not seen by any therapist that year.  The speech therapist from the HSE who came to the school talked to the teacher for 45 minutes about the six children in the class and then left.  There was no plan put in place.  Parents in Longford have been having conversations with the CDNT but we all have different needs.  My son has sensory and speech needs while other parents have children with behavioural needs and so on but what we are getting is the same as every other CDNT.  We are getting offered parents' online courses and are being told what we are not doing right.  The most recent figures the parents group got are that there is only 0.5 out of 4.5 in speech therapy, 0.5 out of 4 in occupational therapy and 1 out of 2 in psychology.  If memory serves me, there has been a shortfall in psychology for two years.  As I said earlier, all of that is impacting how our children get on at school.  If our children do not have a sensory programme in school and our teachers do not know how to put one in place - it is not their job to know - then there are issues.  If our children have behavioural issues in school and our teachers are not trained in how to deal with them and we have no external behavioural specialist, then there are issues.

The great value of this committee is that we get to hear of the first-hand, lived experience.  What Ms Jones started off her submission with really struck me.  She should not need to be here.  There will always be a role for emotional support across parent groups, especially when parents first get that diagnosis, and for a sharing of experience and knowledge but parents should not be sourcing services themselves.  They just should not have to do that.  They have enough to do without that.<\/p> <p>  As Ms O' Mahony said to this committee, there must be much more of a focus on the child.  The support services have to follow the child.  I was looking at an organisational management chart recently and was reminded of it when mention was made of the NCSE.  Just in terms of education alone, there are so many pieces to such charts.  That is not to mention autism, where one is also dealing with health services, speech and language therapy and so many other bits and pieces and it is so fragmented.  I do not know how parents manage to get their heads around it, especially new parents.  <\/p> <p>  Ms Lowndes spoke about the situation in schools.  I was a primary school teacher for 15 years before I arrived here but I know that if I was put into an autism classroom, I would feel like I was at the bottom of the mountain again.  I would be relearning my job from scratch.  I have talked to primary school teachers who are in autism classrooms.  They are afraid to go out sick or to take time off for training because they know that a substitute teacher will arrive into the classroom and even with the best will in the world, that is going to be so disruptive for the children.  As a result, they are turning up to school in all sorts of conditions in order to provide the best service they can with the training they have and the facilities that have been provided.<\/p> <p>  There are so many issues that we could focus on, including summer provision which is very important, but I want to talk about the CDNT structures.  To pick up on what Deputy Flaherty said, I do not think that Longford is on its own in this regard.  As I said to Ms O'Mahony, I know of one school in Waterford where children in the autism classroom are going to three different CDNTs within the county.  The principal of the school would love to see the services provided within the school.  My God, the children are there.  Could we not have speech and language therapy provided in the school?  Could we not have occupational therapy provided in the school?  What is our guests' experience of the new CDNT structure?  Is it working for parents and the schools?  Is it working for everybody within the system who should be providing wraparound supports to children?  When I was a primary school teacher I taught children with autism and I, like most people within the system, wanted to do my very best for them but I was not always able to put my hands on the levers that I needed.  I was not always able to figure out the pathway to talk to people in CAMHS, to talk to the SENO or to the NEPS psychologist.  There are so many bits on that organisational flowchart.  I ask our guests to share their experience of the CDNT structure.  Is it working for parents?  Is it working for children?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#M00400","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I can talk about my experience.  My son is 14 now.  When he was younger, we lived in St. Catherine's catchment area and it provided a lot of the services.  It had a multi-disciplinary team.  However, Progressive Disability Services, PDS, has watered down those services.  The aim was to remove the geographic element whereby the kind of service one got depended on where one lived.  The idea was good, that there should be national provision and everyone should be getting the same services.  It should not matter, in terms of one's diagnosis, whether one lived in Galway or in Wicklow.<\/p> <p>  My son went to a preschool which was run by St. Catherine's.  They rented a house in the middle of Bray.  They had a lot of students in there and provided speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and psychology services.  There were new graduates in disability studies, people who had done social care and people who were training to be social workers.  It was absolutely brilliant.  He was there for three or four years before he started school.  He did not start school until he was six.<\/p><p>That service is gone because the funding is gone from St. Catherine's.  I think it went a good bit before that.  Then he went into mainstream, and then it was the HSE's services.  He has Down's syndrome as well and most children with Down's syndrome have speech and language problems.  Within the HSE disability services, it took maybe two or three years to get things up and running and meanwhile he is growing up.  Now with the new progressing disability services, PDS, he has moved on and is in a special school.  There was a speech and language therapist in that school but that therapist is long gone.  He has not had speech and language therapy for six years or maybe more.  I cannot even recall.  Unless I pay for it myself he does not get it.  The social worker from the services came out but that is it.  I feel a bit sorry for her because she has nothing to offer.  She has come with empty pockets because they do not have the therapists.  The therapists who are in there are so inundated with so many needs.  There has been such a lag because it took so long to implement the thing in the first place that the therapists are moving to the private sector where we pay them to do the services.  We had something ten years ago that really worked for my son.  It was absolutely brilliant.  But anybody who has a four-year-old now has nothing.  We had a good start for him and I am very grateful to St. Catherine's for that.  There was a very good CEO there who, a bit like Miriam's school principal, thought about how they could make this work for the child.  It was all focused on the child but in my opinion, what happens now is that everything is very systems led.  It is about the Act or the school or the service.  There is lip service paid to \"It is about following the child\".  In fact, none of these people would have jobs if it was not for our children, but it does not follow the child.  It is really about the system.  One must fit in.  Any services to which my young fella had access, for example when he was six and in St Catherine's, he completely lost when he moved schools.  It took years to get those back up and running.  Once they did get back up and running we made a few relationships with therapists.

There has to be somebody there to support that family.  It is not okay any more to say that PDS will do.  It has been spoken of over the past nine years but it came in at a time when we were already at a crisis point.  There were already waiting list numbers through the roof.  The pandemic was another excuse for them to pull back loads of stuff.  They could have very effectively still rolled out services in a very safe way.  They could still have come back earlier in Covid and done that but the support was not there and it is still not there.  That needs to change massively for families.  There will be massive fractures.  A lot of our young adult non-autistic family members have mental health issues because of the life they have been living and are living.  They are falling through the cracks also.  Families are trying to navigate it all and they are expected to be the occupational therapist, the speech and language therapist and the psychologist.  It is easier if the supports are put into the school where they can help to support the teachers to do their job better and to be more confident about teaching in that environment.  We know then that the family has a little bit of a buffer.  The child is in school and they have the therapists in the school so the educators and the therapist are working together.  That makes life a little bit easier but it makes a hell of a lot of difference to that child.  That is the most important thing.  The children are the centre point here.

We opened a special school, Dan&uacute;, in Dublin 15, but the behavioural therapist is there to engage directly with staff, not with children.  It is not a full-time therapeutic service.  I do not understand that.  The summer provision is there to support the most vulnerable children, yet they are not the ones seeing the benefit.  During the summer there were parents identifying the gaps in data and the need in Dublin 15 for special classes.  It was not the NCSE leading this but a parents' group.  We talk about these children being our most vulnerable but we do not have mandatory training.  We expect the schools and the principals to adapt but we are not making that happen.  All the answers are there.  That is another frustration.<\/p> <p>  Will Mr. Kenny, Ms Jones and Ms Poole tell us what it is like when a parent comes to the support hub and how it helps them practically?

I wanted to create some sort of safety net for parents of newly diagnosed children.  When they come through the door, they are really in crisis.  They are in an awful state.  Initially, when they contact us we read their emails, which are very much about the child, their diagnosis and what they feel they need to put in an email to get an appointment.  Very soon, after the parents come in, it is about the emotional support they need for themselves before we even move on to the children.  We see parents who are broken and are very lost.  As parents or as expecting mothers, we have expectations.  We assume our children are going to go to school and to talk, but when your child is diagnosed as being autistic, those expectations do not exist anymore.  The child might not go to school and they might not be able to speak.  I never thought my child would be unable to say \"I love you\".  I spend some of the time wondering if he even feels loved.  They are not things we expect to have to deal with as parents.  Parents who come through our doors are so desperate.  It is the breakdown of everything that has led to that point: the lack of support and information.<\/p> <p>  The reality is simple things like putting a schoolbag on a child's back does not always happen for a parent of a child who is autistic.  They do not even have a school place half the time.  I had to fight very hard for a secondary school place.  We imagine when we put our children into school, they will thrive at five years old.  As parents of autistic children we are lucky if we get a school place, and if we get a school place, we are lucky if it is in the appropriate school setting.  If it is not, it is just an avalanche of pain and regression.  When somebody tells you your child is autistic, it is like they take your child from you.  Everything you thought is gone.  They hit a reset button.  Your child is given back to you but everything is gone.  The expectations, dreams and what you thought would be is gone.  You are on your own journey and it is a lonely journey because nobody is there to help you and nobody understands.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, we are in a situation today where, as parents, we are reliant on our children to teach us what they need because we are learning from them.  We do not always have the tools for our children to learn from us.  We are dependent on other people to help us.  That is through services and schools.  We assume our children are going to make friends when they go to school.  It can be a simple thing like that.  Our children sometimes do not even have the ability to make a friend.  That is another worry for us.  They are not in the appropriate school setting.  We are putting our children into autism classes when principals who choose the teacher to teach our children have received no training on what autism is.  How are they supposed to make the right decision on the right person to teach our children when they do not understand themselves?  There are little things.<\/p> <p>  We help our parents when the domiciliary care allowance, DCA, application is rejected.  We know that 60% of appeals are passed by the second officer, so what did the first officer do?  They did not even look at it.  I think of the hours we help parents to put into DCA applications.  It is traumatic.  They have to put in everything.  It is so much information.<\/p><p>It is almost like a counselling session for parents when we take them through the form, because they have to verbalise the reasons they feel they are entitled to DCA.  They have to verbalise their children's disability.  They are sometimes nearly hearing it for the first time.  We come in behind those parents, we listen and we help.  We empower them with information and we empower them with support.  We let them know that we are there each week and that they can come back.  Even if they are not stuck for something for their child but they are feeling low they can come into us. <\/p><p> The reality is that we are so busy trying to help our children and our children's mental health, that too often the parents mental health is forgotten about.  I see it all the time.  Week in, week out, we see parents, just like Ms Jennings said, who are worrying about the siblings.  My children would not even know to put themselves first.  They do not even know what that means.  They do not expect to be put first.  As parents, we always worry whether we are doing enough.  We are always worried about getting it right.<\/p><p> The hub has provided so much support.  We will open our doors on Thursday for the third year.  We have seen more than 160 families come through our doors over that period of time.  That includes families who feel empowered, who no longer feel alone and who feel supported.  Sometimes, if they are lucky enough, there will be a place in Ms Kenny's social club.  They can come and they can meet families.  It is an unbelievable service.  If we had one of them in every town and in every county, at least parents would feel that they were not alone, that they had this knowledge now and that they had this power.  At least they could stand on their own two feet and try to help their child in a little better than they had been able to because they are stronger.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#O00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Ciara Jones","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":147,"content":"<p>This is a parent-led support.

I will continue from what Ms Jones said about the support in Dublin 15.  My own story is that my son has now just turned 21.  Nearly nine years ago, there was nothing for him there socially, nowhere for him to go and nothing for him to do, so another parent and I set up the club Little Seeds Arch Club.  We are affiliated with the Arch Clubs umbrella, which is for children and adults with special needs in Ireland.  I would love to see similar clubs in counties in Ireland and for them to have their own support groups.<\/p> <p>  Little Seeds opened its doors nine years ago to seven children and we now support 70 families.  The children are from the age of seven to 22.  We have a girl who is 22.  It is fantastic for them to have their own safe environment and they love that hour.  We do Lego with them, we play basketball and we get professionals in to do occupational therapy with them.  We have outings in the summer when the club stops, because it is like the school year and it runs from September to June.  We organise outings where we bring the siblings along and make them feel just as special.  I would love to see this rolled out across all the counties in Ireland.  Many of them have clubs, but I know there are not as many in the midlands.  I would love to see Little Seeds replicated.  <\/p> <p>  Many of our families are on waiting lists for therapies, both private and public.  Little Seeds provides autism therapy services through fundraising.  Ms Jones has done fundraising for the club.  We are able to offer subsidised therapies which include music therapy, play therapy, sibling workshops, yoga, well-being and art.  Through our own fundraising there is so much that we can subsidise for families who are struggling.  The parents get on so well and they are not alone on this autism journey.<\/p> <p>  I will speak for myself.  My son, Mark, is 21 now.  I know what it was like 15 years ago when services were still as bad.  It was a lottery as to whether we got a little therapy and whether Mark had a class to go to.  I can remember ringing and being told they would put my son on a waiting list.  In the years that have lapsed since Mark was diagnosed, we are probably still in the same situation with waiting lists for therapies and for everything.  Really and truly, we should not be.  Ireland is such a great country in a lot of ways.  It is not a Third World country.  Our children and our parents should be at the top of the list.  We are the spokespeople here today for our children.  We are their voice and we need to make a difference.<\/p> <p>  There is the idea of rolling out what they have in Malta was mentioned.  We should be replicating that.  That model seems to be going so well.  Ireland should be far greater at catering for our children than what it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Ger Kenny"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I am sorry that I keep going back to the issue of complex needs.  For example, in Bray, Bray Lakers is a very good service and it provides an after-school activity.  It has an hour class here and an hour class there.  However, I cannot bring my son to that because he will not go in.  This is particularly the case if there is an intellectual disability with autism and with other things as well, in particular a moderate intellectual disability.  He needs stability, routine and predictability.  School provides all of that for him.<\/p> <p>  I have tried every special group.  I said I wished I lived in Cork because the Rainbow Club sounds great.  Everybody does little bits here and there.  I tried special needs rugby, soccer, Bray Lakers and everything else.  I have tried every group out there to try to progress, but he does not have the capacity.  It is so stressful for him and for me trying to get him to do these things.<\/p> <p>  We have schools everywhere in the country.  Every town, city, county and village have schools.  That is what he loves.  He loves school.  Schools run all day and this allows me to work.  I am a single parent and this allows me to work to earn the money to pay for everything like we all have to do.  We already have a lot there.  We just need to tweak the school system.  While I am all for the extra clubs too, many complex needs children cannot access those clubs, just like they cannot access home-based provision.  The Department states all the time that one can a home-based tutor if they cannot the July provision in school.  However, there is so much about being in school, such as getting on the bus and all the minutiae of life that is important to people, both children and adults, who do not really understand because they do not have the intellectual capacity.  We build this life for them that they can enjoy and that they can progress in but we have to do it within the boundaries of what works, so introducing lots of new things like a tutor, for example, for home-based provision does not work for my son and for many children with complex needs.  It is so stressful.  He could not tolerate a stranger in the home.  We could not have him going on an outing, for example, with a tutor.  He is 6 ft., he is a massive, they would be terrified that he would run off and there would be safety issues.  He is not really verbal so he could not say if anything went wrong.<\/p> <p>  The GAA and soccer clubs all get money.  All these mainstream social groups get money to provide a service, which is great for the kids who can access that.  However, there are a number of children, mine included, who have an autism and intellectual disability, ID, diagnosis along with other issues and who cannot access that.  That is what happens with summer provision.

I am conscious that I am the only person from Cork here today.  We have been talking to Ms Lowndes about how the model that Rainbow Club is offering.  The youngest children are two years of age.  These children are not in school or preschool.  Some of them cannot go into the preschool because there is not enough access and inclusion model, AIM, provision.  Therefore, we are now having these children as well.<\/p> <p>  Quite a number of our children have complex needs.  We have certain rooms to cater for those children&rsquo;s needs.  However, it is all about the model and the pathway.  When a family comes to us, they are giving us their information, the child&rsquo;s diagnostic report comes to me and I read through it.  We look to see where the child&rsquo;s difficulties are, the challenges and what we need the staff to know and how they can provide support.  The next thing is that the child is placed and mom and-or dad will come to meet with us and see where the other provisions need to be put in place.  The siblings are sent to sibling group.  If there are other therapeutic interventions that they need, that is all done through us.  Again, we do the school liaising, forms and phone calls.  We recently sent out packs to all of the GPs in County Cork because they needed to know where we are and what we do.  There is a very clear transition for a child.  We send out photographs of the room and the staff.  We tell the parents what to do when they come, such as not to come too early so as not to wait, and all of this other stuff.  The information is given to the staff.  All staff have access to that.  Every staff member who interacts with that child knows exactly what he or she needs.<\/p> <p>  We are adding to that all of the time.  As challenges come up - and there are difficulties - we are adding to that information and addressing them.  We are putting in the whole sensory diet.  We have families that will have their children come to us after school.  Some will stay two and three hours because mam is on her own, she works and the grandparents will be minding this child with very complex needs and are not able to, so we take the child.<\/p> <p>  It can be done and it is working.  It is already in play in Cork.  We did not have anything when we started.  There was nobody I could go to for information.  We started everything - policies, all of our implementation, all of our strategy and what we were going to do.  The pathway is there for the child.  When we feel the child is ready for another step, we bring the parents in tell them we think the child is ready to move on.  A load of our children graduated to the teen hub this year.  They were ready for the next step of the journey.  Our life mentor coach will go into schools and help many of our older lads with the next plan for college.  It is very doable.  We have been doing it, and we are not a Department.<\/p> <p>  We have had loads of conversations with Ms Lowndes as well.  We are also talking to Waterford about replicating its model.  We are looking at the Dreambig Project down there.  They have a very similar vision.  This is something that can happen; it has already happened.  We are all on the same page and want and need the same thing.  We have identified very clearly what needs to happen.  We should be getting support and help to make that happen and make life a bit better.  If we all come together, it can happen much faster.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#Q00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Karen O'Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":156,"content":"<p>Our guests are an incredible bunch of people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#Q00700","speaker":"1648"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I am conscious of time.

I thank our guests for coming in.  I know that it is stressful for them to come here and describe the circumstances of their children's situations and what they have had to go through over the years.  I thank them for doing that.  I know that it is not easy.<\/p> <p>  The system Ms O&rsquo;Mahony described works because it is proactive.  It anticipates the needs of the child.  It could, as she said, be replicated by the State, if the State were to anticipate and co-ordinate the different things and come at it from the parents&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s perspectives and not its own perspective in the context of how matters have been organised historically.  I work with Vicky Casserly in respect of children in hospital.  Again, we try to anticipate things the child and parent need.  For example, if parents are in a multidisciplinary situation, we seek to ensure that all of the appointments are on Mondays, instead of three or four different days over two weeks, in order that people to not have to fill their cars with petrol three or four times or make three or four different childcare arrangements.  It involves thinking about matters from the perspective of the person who is using the service.<\/p> <p>  In that vein, I want to come back in very strongly on the points relating to CAMHS and medication.  Our guests are experienced in dealing with the education system, the HSE and all of these different things.  While I know all of those are very difficult matters, our guests have a level of knowledge of the system and their children.  That is an impossible thing to replicate when it comes to medication and the pharmacology of medication and what that means when it comes to managing side effects and the child&rsquo;s growth.<\/p> <p>  My son has very bad epilepsy.  His medication was changed in April.  We got a cancellation appointment with a neurologist tomorrow in Crumlin to go back and check that.  I was just thinking about our guests when I left.  My child has a neurological injury.  He is getting a follow-up appointment.  Our guests&rsquo; children have neurodiverse situations and they are also under medical supervision, albeit a different type, and their children, who are on medication, are not being supervised or followed up with in the same way. <\/p> <p>  I never do this, but I want to state my view on CAMHS and a system that allows that to happen.  It is negligent beyond words.  It is criminally negligent to put a child on mind-altering medication and fail to follow it up in an appropriate way, every six or 12 months over the period, and to fail to care about that child, not just proactively, but to make sure that it is done properly.  I am sorry to be so strong about something, but I feel that this is something that is out of our guests&rsquo; hands and their control and I just want to make the point very strongly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#Q00900","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I wish to make a point about CAMHS.

Some of their testimony has been harrowing, but it was very important it that it was placed on the record.  One of the probably most alarming aspects has been what Ms Lowndes said in terms of the new CDNT and the PDS programme, namely, that unless people are on their knees, they will not get a service.<\/p><p>It seems that a monster has been created with the new structure that is being rolled out.  Somebody has to say \"Stop\" and that this is not working.  That is an important message to come from this meeting.  I know that one of the groups is to meet the Minister afterwards.  It is certainly a message we will be articulating.  We will reference the email that parents in Longford sent to the Minister earlier, just to give them voice as well.  Longford has been deteriorating under CHO 8 management for many years and the retention of local staff now seems to be another serious issue.  Other local counties, while not fully staffed, are managing to provide a service.  The progressing disability services programme has been in place for more than ten months but, rather than the support increasing, it is decreasing dramatically.  It goes to the heart of what Ms Murphy said in respect of it not being child centred and the services not following the child.  A very good example of that relates to special classes.  If a child comes in from another county and another children's disability network team, CDNT, an SNA for the child is not guaranteed and suddenly the primary school has to carve up its limited resources.  Everything the witnesses have told us today has cut to the heart of the problem, which is that the forgotten people in this are the children.  It is a damning indictment on us as a Government, and for that we apologise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#Q02500","speaker":"1597","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":176,"content":"<p>My apologies again for leaving the meeting.  A number of Deputies are running to different meetings and so on.<\/p> <p>  I heard the remarks of Deputy Flaherty.  I missed part of the discussion while I was out of the room.  He referred to a monster being created.  I believe some of the witnesses will meet the Minister after the meeting.  If it is appropriate, I ask that they send us a short email or whatever to let us know what progress, if any, they make.  That can be sent either to individual members or to the committee - I will let the Chairman decide on that.  It is an area with which I am not as familiar with as perhaps I ought to be and I would be interested to hear of any progress they make.<\/p> <p>  My second point relates to Deputy Carroll MacNeill's comments on CAMHS.  I received emails from parents, especially after the south Kerry issue, regarding children being over-medicated or inappropriately medicated.  I would like to hear the views of our guests on that and how to protect children from that happening.  Parents go to the expert; the person who knows.  It is their child.  One is always in a more vulnerable position when one goes to a person who knows more; it does not matter who the person is.  How can our guests, as parents, advocate strongly in this position and feel that they really have a voice here?<\/p> <p>  Ms Jennings made the point earlier that principals have stated the numbers are decreasing and they just cannot get the numbers to work.  As regards the Maltese model, the documentation provided by the witnesses states that it is originally offered to school staff who not only earn an increased salary to work in special schools year-round, but are also well rewarded for completing the summer school.  That is something we need to consider because people have extra costs, such as on childcare, transport or whatever, but we should be upfront regarding people also needing a break and time off.  The document further states that when numbers to run the programme were not achieved, there was an expansion to recruit staff from other disciplines.  There are two important pieces there.  If we could use them, it might make the job of some principals a bit easier.  I read what the principals said and what the students said.  It was the only thing in all the documentation that gave me some hope.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AUS2022092000002#R00200","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I, too, apologise.  I had to leave to attend another meeting.<\/p> <p>  I wish to follow up on the issue of employment.  The difficulties we have in CHO4 are well known now.  On average, it is taking eight to nine months to employ a home care worker, let alone therapists and whatever else.  I am familiar with the Rainbow Club and how it successfully hired people in the recent past.  Have any of the witnesses who are involved in advertising for therapists or whatever the case may be found it difficult to hire those people?  The HSE is telling us that is its biggest difficulty.  In my CHO, there is 38% vacancy rate for employment.  That does not instil confidence.  Are the witnesses experiencing the same difficulty as the HSE in hiring therapists?  <\/p> <p>  I spent 15 years in a classroom as a secondary school teacher.  I never received any modules in special education.  That is going to back to 2002 or 2003.  If I were to lose my seat in the morning, I could well find myself in a classroom tomorrow, teaching kids with a variety of needs, or in the ASD hub that is in my school at the moment.

Our children are often difficult for us to understand, so, with all due respect, how can we expect an educator to understand all the children in his or her classroom, who have a variety of needs?  I do not pretend to understand dyslexia or dyspraxia because I do not have experience of them.  With one in 20 boys on the autism spectrum, according to a HSE psychologist, the teaching unions, the teaching colleges and the NCSE teaching council need to step up and face the reality that there are diverse needs in every classroom every day and those needs are not being met.  We covered the fact that the lack of therapists is exasperating the whole issue because children are not having their sensory needs met.  Teachers do not know how to teach children how to communicate.  They might do a two-week picture exchange communication system, PECS, course but that is not going to bring our children up a level.<\/p> <p>  A big concern we have is that there are no ambitions for our children.  A lot of the attitude is to get the children through this year.  A teacher will do his or her year or two years in the autism class and it will then be somebody else's turn.  We want our children to able to read and write when they leave school, however.  We need the basics for our children but that will not be possible until the teachers are trained.   Other countries do it well.  In Slovakia, students do part of their teaching degree and then focus on speech or occupational therapy to finish the degree.  There are examples of other countries in Europe that do it really well.

That would allow teachers to be the best teacher they can be for all students; to be a teacher who teaches inclusive education rather than having continuous exclusion.  From the time a child is diagnosed, they experience exclusion every day, right through every step of life.  It is not rocket science.  We know that students studying for a degree in teaching will  have autistic students, so why does the degree not include autism training?  It is very simple.

They should not have to do it but they do it because, as has been said, they are child-centred and are thinking of the children and the needs of their kids and all kids throughout the country.  The Government and successive Governments have let parents and their children down, and that is not acceptable.<\/p><p> Deputy Flaherty mentioned a case in respect of Ms Jenkins in my county and where we are at the moment regarding a disability team.  We have 2.8 posts across the whole service.  Last April Ms Jenkins, Deputy Flaherty and I met with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  In our county we had more than 230 kids waiting on an assessment of needs and more than 700 children waiting on services.  At that time we had, I think, 11 posts.  Now we have 2.8 whole-time equivalents: one psychologist, half a speech and language therapist, half an occupational therapist, 0.8 of a physiotherapist and no social worker.  The reality is that we are not giving children the opportunity to fulfil their lives.  Early intervention is early intervention, and that is what we need.  I know from personal experience about going private.  In particular, music therapy is something we did as a family, and I found it fantastic.  It made a huge difference to my son's speech before he went to school.  Some parents, however, are not in a position to do that, and that is not acceptable.<\/p><p> We need to call out the HSE.

In other jobs and other lines of work, if you are not doing your job you lose your job and you are gone and replaced.  We have asked the HSE to appear before our committee in a number of weeks to discuss the disability teams and the staffing levels across the country.

We have two occupational therapists working for us for seven years and we have been lucky.  Just last week we had a music therapist and a play therapist working on well-being.  A lot of it can be down to word of mouth.  For example, a parent might know of a therapist and give me the contact details.  I make contact with them, meet them, talk to them about the club, say what we are looking for and what the age group is and so on.  We have been really lucky and any therapist we have in Little Seeds Arch Club we have had for a number of years and we have been able to keep them.  It works both ways; we are so delighted to have the therapists in and working for so many families and the therapists are delighted too because they see the work that is being done in Little Seeds Arch Club and they see that we can reach out to so many families.<\/p> <p>  I would always say to our families that if they are on private waiting lists they should stay on them and if they are on public waiting lists they should stay on them.  What we can offer our families is something that can keep them going in the meantime.  We will have a sibling workshop, we have mindfulness and in October play therapists will be working with some of our children who have a lot of anxiety around school.  These will be much smaller groups so we could have 20 to 22 children in each of the groups we have in Little Seeds Arch Club.  For the therapists, this new therapy service that launched with us last week would have much smaller groups.  The music therapy will be on this evening so I had better get back in time for it and that is just for six young teenagers.  We have never had that before and it is something new we are offering our families.  We are delighted to say we are not Government-funded but that we are funded through fundraising and we can offer these therapies to our families.  We got a lot of the therapists through word of mouth and I made contact with the therapists, met them, did their Garda vetting and so on.  I spoke to them about the club, the families, the ages of the children and so on and everybody has been on board.  We are lucky in Dublin 15 and I am delighted with the service we have been able to provide but it is not Government-funded and it has started from a little seed.<\/p> <p>  We have been assisting other groups.  For example, in Athlone they opened their own arch club last Sunday and I was like a proud Mom looking on from the side.  I spoke to the girls about Little Seeds Arch Club on a Zoom call and about how we operate in Dublin 15.  Balbriggan is opening its own club in the coming weeks and Clondalkin and Skerries have clubs in the pipeline.  Nenagh has a big group of 100 children attending and all of it has stemmed from Little Seeds Arch Club.<\/p> <p>  The work that can be done is amazing.  We are a voluntary group, there are no wages and nor do I want any wages.  It is all about the hours put in and it has been created from my son being diagnosed nine years ago when there was nothing out there for him.  I could see how it was more difficult for him socially, including to make friends, because I have two older children, and I wanted something in the area for him.

You are a model for parents groups across the country.  As a State, we need to support and replicate what you are doing across the whole country.  We need to support you financially as well for putting in a significant amount of your time to highlight the needs of our kids.  I will give a personal commitment and I can speak for all the members of the committee also.  This is a committee we wanted to set up because we wanted to make a change.  The commitment is there from the leaders of the three Government parties to set up this committee.  We want to put forward proposals next March when we will lay a report before both Houses that is going to make changes.  Some changes have started to be made as a result of this committee being in place and issues have been highlighted in the national press.  The will is there.  I firmly believe action will be taken.  I know that across all parties, we want to make a difference.  We want to see changes made for your children and for my son.  I have a young child who was diagnosed with autism and when Ms Jones was speaking earlier, I could remember when we were told the news as a family.  I am very positive for his future and it is my job as a parent to work to make sure he gets the services, the intervention and the help to be what he can be.  I give that commitment that we will work as a committee to make sure changes are made.  We will not accept the situation as it is.  The HSE needs to step up to the mark and make the changes and put the staff and levels in place for services our children are entitled to.<\/p> <p>  Your contributions will assist us in writing our final report.  At the first meeting of this committee after it was established, we decided to meet parents and get the lived experience.  We will formulate our proposals based on the lived experience of what is needed for our children.

I will start by outlining the current priority work we are undertaking to empower and protect consumers.  <\/p> <p>  In light of exceptionally high and volatile wholesale EU gas prices, retail electricity and gas prices are increasing dramatically, thereby putting pressure on all domestic and business customers, many of whom are already struggling to pay.   The CRU is deeply concerned about the impact these price increases will have on all customers and particularly on vulnerable customers.  We therefore have introduced a new suite of consumer protection measures to be in place for this winter.  The decision paper has been provided alongside this paper and in summary, the key measure include: extended debt repayment periods for customers in debt; lower debt repayment on top-ups for customers with financial hardship prepayment meters; customers on financial hardship meters to be put on the most favourable tariff available from their supplier; and extended moratorium periods for disconnections this winter.<\/p> <p>  We are currently working through the supplier of last resort process for Panda Power customers.  There have been three supplier of last resort events in the Irish market this year, through which we have ensured that supply is maintained for some 100,000 affected customers. <\/p> <p> The CRU has also just completed overseeing the implementation of the electricity credit scheme, along with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, ESB Networks and suppliers.  We are ready to support any future interventions in line with Government decisions. <\/p> <p>  Some further workstreams to protect costumers include: working with industry to provide the negative public service obligation, PSO, levy to customers as quickly as possible; continuing customer communication campaigns to highlight the importance of registering as a vulnerable customer, to be aware of your rights as an energy customer and to make the best use of the better information and tariff options for customers with smart meters; continuing the roll-out of smart meters and leveraging the benefits of smart services; working with our customer care team to assist customers in distress, and engaging with our Department and other stakeholders to implement market and consumer protection measures arising from the evolving European Commission policy. <\/p> <p>  We will be stepping up market monitoring activities this winter, focusing on key customer debt and disconnection trends, and have included with this statement some of the latest data in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Turning to our next strategic priority to drive a low-carbon future, we are working to both increase the level of renewable electricity capacity on our system and to ensure we optimise the use of those renewables, as well as the infrastructure and technologies that support their roll-out, for the benefit of customers and the climate.<\/p><p>We welcome the increased connection of renewables, particularly solar projects, at scale this year, which will deliver significant benefits for consumers.  This includes the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, contribution to the PSO levy rebate.<\/p><p> We are working to enhance the integration of these renewables through the publication of the single electricity market high-level design on system services future arrangements, with further work progressing on the detailed design.  The new high-level design allows for a phased approach and enables EirGrid to procure system services in fixed contracts and a layered procurement approach.  We welcome EirGrid's publication of its consultation on the low-carbon inertia competition.<\/p><p> One of the key enablers in achieving our 80% renewable electricity target is the delivery of offshore renewables at scale.  The CRU is holding consultations on offshore grid connection policy, which will enable developers to bid confidently in the forthcoming offshore renewable electricity support scheme, ORESS, auction.  A new CRU division will be established shortly to advance further work, including the regulatory framework for the offshore asset owner and operator and offshore network planning, standards and licensing. <\/p><p> We are concerned about the current gap in offshore safety regulation.  International experience suggests that offshore renewables require regulation from a safety perspective.  Ideally, a safety-by-design approach to the prevention of major accidents is required.  Recognising the ambition in terms of scale and timing that Ireland has for offshore renewables, it is imperative the country implements an appropriate legislative framework in this area at the earliest opportunity, including designation of the body that will assume responsibility for this.<\/p><p> Firm access is an important area for existing and new renewable projects, and a consultation on a new approach will be published shortly.  It is important to ensure this is facilitated by accelerated delivery of network infrastructure to provide value for consumers and generators.  This is especially the case as ongoing curtailments and the operation of a tight system at a time of high wholesale prices is driving imperfections market charges significantly higher this year.  Overall, lengthy planning and permitting processes and delays in delivery of critical energy infrastructure, including generation capacity, transmission and distribution networks, and the North-South interconnector, are adding high costs and increased security of supply risks for Irish consumers as well as delaying the achievement of our decarbonisation obligations.<\/p><p> As an example, Wind Energy Ireland advised us in March last that there were in excess of 1,200 MW worth of wind projects in the planning system, more than 500 MW of which had been in planning since 2020 or before.  We were further advised at that time that in excess of 600 MW worth of battery storage was in the planning process.  We will need this infrastructure to support security, sustainability and competitiveness for Irish customers.<\/p><p> It is clear that, given the scale of the infrastructure delivery required over the short term, we will need a change in the planning process and the resources allocated to local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to expedite projects through the planning process.  We will also require the support of this committee and the Government to ensure delivery.  For example, the North-South interconnector, which is vital for security of supply, has not yet commenced construction, despite having full planning permissions in place in Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland.<\/p><p> As we discussed electricity security at length with the committee on 30 August, I will briefly mention gas security in light of the Russia-Ukraine crisis.  While Ireland is less dependent on Russian gas than other member states, it is important we play our part this winter and in the following winters by reducing our use of gas and electricity.  The CRU is working on a range of such measures, including through our network tariff decision.  Our objective to incentivise demand reduction at peak times and times of low renewable generation, which may also cause system stress, is aligned with the new EU proposals on emergency interventions to address high energy prices.  Such measures will also support our decarbonisation goals. <\/p><p> As the EU moves away from reliance on Russian gas supplies and develops new supply sources, it is also critical that Ireland enhances our security of gas supply.  This is particularly important given the key role of gas in electricity security of supply.  We welcome the publication of the Department's energy security review in this regard.<\/p><p> In relation to the CRU's people and organisational capacity, we are currently recruiting to expand our team to address some of the new requirements of the climate action plan and clean energy package while prioritising the use of our resources for the energy crisis in the short term.  The CRU notes that the committee has forwarded other topics for discussion and has included, as an appendix, the most recent and relevant historical data concerning domestic customers' debt and disconnections.<\/p><p>We are also happy to discuss the other topics highlighted by members, including demand management and the European response to demand reduction. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I thank Ms MacEvilly for her opening statement.

I have a number of questions.  First, I welcome the information provided by the CRU in relation to domestic and non-domestic disconnections and the moratorium we have discussed previously at this committee, including the new suite of consumer protection measures that have been introduced until the end of March.  This suite of measures is welcome, particularly given it was raised in the media last night as if it did not exist, despite being discussed and welcomed in the Chamber.  It is important we reiterate that to give confidence to people who might find themselves in difficulties this winter, notwithstanding anything that might be announced in the budget next week.<\/p> <p>  I also welcome the work the CRU is doing in rolling out the negative public service obligation, PSO, levy, which was announced by Government some weeks or months ago.  This will go some way to alleviating the pressures.  The one thing I want to focus on in relation to consumer ability to pay is the view the CRU may have on standing charges.  This has been raised in this committee previously.  I want to know whether the CRU has the legislative framework with which to address these charges and by address I mean lower.  I raise this on behalf of the many constituents who have been in touch with me because it is an increasingly large issue.  The variances between suppliers, for instance, can be quite significant.  I would welcome the views of the CRU on this issue. <\/p> <p>  I have two further questions.  Should the committee be concerned about the exists from the market particularly by Panda Power and other suppliers.  I understand a number of others have exited this year already.  Is this something we need to be concerned about?  Does the commission know why that exit took place?<\/p> <p>  Regarding the comments on safety regulation, and of course that is something we should all be concerned about, I am assuming the safety regulation to which the CRU has referred is not included in any legislation either passed by or before the Oireachtas?  I refer specifically to regulations that come under the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA.  Does the CRU have knowledge of other jurisdictions within the European Union which have brought regulations in or is there a European example that could be provided to the committee?  That would be rather helpful.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#F00300","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I will start and will then hand over to my colleagues.  In terms of Panda Power and the supplier of last resort, it is unfortunate for customers that we are losing suppliers in the energy market at the moment.  It is a sign of the intense pressure the energy sector is under.  We have never had a supplier of last resort event in Ireland prior to this.  They can be common.  There have been quite a number in the UK over the last number of years and I think in the range of 30 in the last year.  We have seen these events happen across Europe because the challenge for suppliers is that they are also facing these really high and volatile energy prices.  Suppliers have to go out and spend more money to hedge for their customers, to post collateral to buy gas and electricity.  It is putting pressure on a number of the smaller suppliers in the market, Panda Power being the latest one.  That is broadly what Panda Power has told us in terms of it decision to exit the market.  That is why we have a supplier of last resort process.  It is in place through legislation and then through processes we have developed with the network operators and suppliers of last resort to ensure that where this happens there is protection for customers and security of supply in that they will be automatically transferred to a supplier of last resort with no discontinuity in supply.<\/p><p>We have done this to ensure that, where such a situation arises, there is protection for customers and security in their supply, in that they will automatically be transferred to a supplier of last resort with no discontinuity in supply.  Overall, it is not good for competition because the more suppliers we have actively competing in various ways and offering different types of products to customers, the better it is for customers.  We continue to work with all suppliers in the market.  We will continue to ensure that, at the end of this crisis, we will have a competitive market that delivers value and choice for customers.<\/p><p> I might ask Ms Trant to address some of the other points that the Deputy raised, after which Dr. McGowan will discuss the offshore safety regime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":233,"content":"<p>We are aware that issues have been raised around the standing charge.

The Petroleum Safety Authority Norway started a project, based on legislation, in 2020 to determine an appropriate safety regime for offshore renewables.<\/p> <p>  The matter is being examined more widely across Europe.  For example, the Health and Safety Executive in Great Britain has begun work on advising offshore renewable firms as to what a safety regime might look like.  It has been interacting with them in advance of legislation being introduced.<\/p> <p>  We are members of various safety bodies, the most relevant in this case being the North Sea Offshore Authorities Forum, NSOAF, whose members are safety regulators that are involved one way or another in hydrocarbons in the North Sea.  The NSOAF has established an offshore renewables safety working group to begin examining best practice.<\/p> <p>  Currently, we do not have a statute in place that identifies who is responsible for the regulation of this new sector in terms of major accident hazards.  Its hazards are different than those in the hydrocarbon sector.  Obviously, there are no hydrocarbons involved, but collisions, fires and other hazards can still occur on these installations.  As such, it is important that there be a safety regime.  Our perspective is that the priority should be to identify and put in place a safety regime and to identify who carries that out.  We are agnostic in the latter respect.  We have experience from the offshore hydrocarbon sector, so it is something that we would be equipped to do, but a statutory framework would be needed in order for that type of work to begin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul McGowan"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I wish to ask a short follow-on question relating to our discussion on standing charges.<\/p><p>Is the commission aware of other similar regulatory bodies in other jurisdictions that regulate standing charges specifically or is it rather a market-to-market sort of arrangement?

The UK also tends to have a standing charge arrangement as part of the billing.  The regulatory regimes vary from member state to member state.

To whom exactly are the energy companies accountable for these increases in standing charges?  To whom might they justify those increases?  That is the first question.<\/p> <p>  My second question is on the PSO.  In its opening statement, the commission stated it is working with industry to provide the negative PSO levy to customers.  Is it not the case that 85% of our renewables are under the renewable energy feed-in tariff, REFIT, scheme and 15% are under the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, with an opportunity to claw back that PSO?

We estimated that the price they would earn on the market would be at a certain level, which, if I recall, was around the &euro;50 per MWh rate.  As it turned out, prices started increasing, so they actually earned more from the market in that year because we operate on the basis of estimating.

Ireland has a high level of low usage, which we understand relates mainly to holiday homes.  It is important to note that where people have holiday homes, even where they may not be using a lot of electricity, we support those homes through the provision of electricity networks that are there to ensure there is sufficient power whenever they use those homes.  It is right that people pay a fair share towards the cost of networks.  From the suppliers' point of view, the low usage charge in some cases relates to the fact they have costs in serving those customers, even when such customers are not necessarily using the charge.  We have not looked at that as a specific area of concern at this point.<\/p> <p>  On the cheapest available tariff being available as standard, we looked at what the best options are.  As the Deputy knows, the way competition tends to work for domestic customers is that suppliers have a standard charge and they then offer discounts to attract new customers.  They will often offer those same discounts to existing customers who sign up for an additional year or who avail of things such as paying by direct debit or getting paperless bills.  We think that is a useful part of competition in the electricity sector.  If suppliers are asked to provide those discounts to all customers regardless of whether they have lower costs, such as direct debit or paperless billing, then ultimately everyone is paying the same charge, there is very little competition and everyone is paying a slightly higher charge.<\/p> <p>  It is really about who we want to protect the most.  The people we focused on, through our current consumer protection measures, are vulnerable customers and customers on financial hardship prepayment meters because we believe they are the ones where we need to target the most support.

It is very hard for us to justify the use of six-month profits of around &euro;400 million for future investment in infrastructure.  Various arguments have been made in defence of that but we cannot justify it when consumers are at their wits' end, struggling and worried about repayments.  I ask the CRU representatives to comment on that.  There are no recommendations like capping unit prices or other measures that would have a real impact on consumers' bills.

Reference is made to the different options around security of supply, including battery storage.  Is there an opportunity in the very short term to procure battery storage for public buildings?  I am thinking of public hospitals in particular.  Cork University Hospital, CUH, has always had a really good approach to energy and has tried to be as sustainable and green as possible but it is still a significant energy user in the Cork region.  The hospital would have peak-time levels of usage almost throughout the day.  It has been suggested that we could procure battery storage.<\/p><p>That battery storage would be acquired in off-peak times and distributed during peak hours of 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. or whatever it is.  I have heard this could be done in a place like Cork University Hospital, CUH, for around &euro;1 million.  It sounds like a lot but in terms of preventing potential electricity supply issues during winter, it is something we have to look at.  If on a wider scale across the health sector and HSE you can procure battery storage, charge the batteries off peak and distribute them during peak hours, it would take massive pressure off the grid during peak hours.  Has that been looked at?

Also, in the regulation currently making its way through the European Commission formation process, one of the proposals is to seek to procure demand reduction from entities.  For example, a university hospital may participate in this and, if it were to win the competition, would be paid for the reduction it provides at peak times.  There is a desire for the public sector to take a lead in this and, assuming that regulation makes its way into law, an outcome of that would be a proposal or mechanism whereby people would compete to provide reductions.  That could provide the revenues necessary for, in the case the Deputy described, battery storage.<\/p> <p>  In terms of security of supply, hospitals tend to have backup generation on site.

As we set out ambitions, as we have done for offshore and so on, it is a concern if this system continues to fail.<\/p> <p>  The commission is the regulator.  Does it not have more power than it is exercising to get demand management into the system through the entities it regulates?  For example, with electric vehicle, EV, charges the commission could seek to move our whole taxi fleet to EVs.  The public service vehicle could be much more efficient to run.  The commission could promote high utilisation and lower costs compared with each of us having our own car in our driveway and so on.  To what extent is the commission leveraging what it could do?  Is it leveraging, for example, status yellow weather warnings?  If we know that there is going to be cold weather of between 5&deg;C and 7&deg;C tonight with no wind should the commission not be out there saying that now is the time to trigger these changes?  Consider smart meters for example.  As I understand it, and maybe the witnesses will correct me if I am wrong, smart meters are not being utilised to their full extent because of GDPR objections to utilising them.<\/p><p>Surely in an energy crisis we can find a way to make use of smart meters, of which we now have 1 million - nearly half of all homes - to help us utilise this technology we have put in at very considerable expense.  It appears we are not utilising it.  I could go on with examples of things we could be trying to do that are relatively low cost and low-hanging fruit.  It seems to me that the witnesses are in a pivotal position to tell the regulated entities that they need to adopt this as part of the expectations of what they are doing.  It does seem to me that that is not happening.<\/p><p> To go back to Deputy O'Sullivan's point, I could imagine an energy-saving company going into Cork University Hospital - or any other hospital - with an offer, but it would be very hard to expect the hospital to do this given all the things on its plate.  Could the CRU not mandate its regulated entities to be such energy-saving companies for some of these areas of opportunity?  As I said before on this committee, we should not waste a crisis.  Perhaps the CRU is at a pivotal point to make that switch.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#N00700","speaker":"1549","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":297,"content":"<p>On the planning question first of all, it is not necessarily our area of expertise but there are some potential options.  The Attorney General had announced a review of the overall planning system and we would welcome the expedition of that.  Very specifically, there are EU regulatory requirements for expedited processes for renewable projects, given their importance.  For example, there are periods within which the entire planning process - all aspects of environmental permits and so on - must be completed in order to expedite those projects.  We welcome seeing that being transposed.  More recently, the REPowerEU package last year noted the need to expedite the connection of renewables but also the supporting grid - in other words, the necessary network infrastructure in order to not just build the renewables but connect them effectively into the network so that they can deliver the benefits for customers and that those could be considered in the overriding public interest, which is a particular route and option that could be used to expedite planning.  Those are the kinds of areas that we think are worth considering, which are set out in the EU regulatory toolbox and that might support expedited planning processes.  We have also called out the need to support the local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to ensure they have sufficient staff, inspectors and other resources to expedite the projects.  They are independent agencies that have to go through thorough processes, which they must ensure are robust, but they must have the resources to do it more quickly so that the projects that can be delivered can be delivered more quickly.  That is our view on the planning side.  It is about process and resources.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the demand side, generally I agree that we are at the very start of looking at what demand side can deliver.  For a system that has an 80% renewables target and, further, would be looking to be a zero-carbon electricity system in time, it is imperative that we optimise demand side as part of our future network.  We must change our thinking on how we plan electricity systems and incorporate demand side more effectively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":298,"content":"<p>There is no point in just appealing to us all to do it unless the regulator enforces it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#O00300","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Yes.

All we can do is seek to remove obstacles.<\/p> <p>  Another aspect of the Deputy's question refers to work under the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, more than the CRU.  Energy supply companies have obligations under a European directive from 2012 or 2014 to offer energy saving advice and engagement with their end customers.  This is done through SEAI's part of the energy sphere rather than us.  On the matter of accepting that demand comes and is not expected to be flexible, a significant change is required in the energy industry and among the demand customers.  The European regulation that is currently being developed seeks active participation from demand side, both at peak and with reductions in demand next winter, over the whole period and especially at peak periods.  We held a consultation on the network tariffs.  There are elements which we can address, barriers we can remove and signals which we can send.  Active participation has to come from the entities and, under the GDPR rules, it has to come from individuals in their homes, who would seek to participate and use those smart meters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Melvin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":304,"content":"<p>We see smart meters both as an enabler for gathering information across the network but also for the consumer.  There have been barriers to engagement from consumers.  There is an information gap.  Customers do not really know what their consumption is like and they need to be able to see that before they opt to use a smart tariff.  One area which will be developed this coming quarter is a data portal and a hub.  Customers will have what is called a push-all.  Information from smart meters will be pushed to the hub.  It will be available to customers so that they can review their consumption.  The aim is to have a dashboard and portal in order that customers have an easy, accessible way to see what they are using.  We think this will send a signal for people to engage with smart tariffs.<\/p><p> The other area relating to smart meters we are looking at is that ESB Networks is prioritising those with microgen capability.  Those who have microgen installed will get smart meters to push that.  Once people are aware of their consumption and not afraid to make a choice, they will engage with it.  We are also running campaigns.  They are digital at the moment, but we will be increasing them to encourage the use of smart meters and smart tariffs.  It will take time.  We think that once the data hub and data portal are up and running, it will be six to 12 months after that before we see a real uptake in smart tariffs.  It is about information; people want information before they make the choice.<\/p><p> There was a point about the GDPR.  What we wanted to do there was bring customers with us.  We would not be able to mandate that information to transfer.  That would be in breach of GDPR rules.  A meter point reference number, MPRN, is personal data.  Without a customer's agreement, we would not be able to do that.  There is no doubt that this has been a sensitive issue.  We need to manage that carefully for both customers and the programme.

One was on energy demand growth in this country compared with the rest of the EU.  It clearly shows that Ireland is a complete outlier in the context of energy growth demand.  That was on the argument relating to data centres.  The second was on the specifics about data centres and their connections.  I really appreciate the answer, but it raises more questions.  Rather than focus on that now, I will ask the committee to write back to Ms MacEvilly with my questions because the urgent matter we have to focus on is the energy demand for customers over the winter.<\/p><p>The CRU has made proposals.  Considering the scale of the crisis, what the CRU is proposing is a bit piecemeal.  That is not to be insulting.  It is probably limited, but I want to ask a few question in respect of that limitation.  If we acknowledge that there has been a complete failure in the energy market - prices have gone up when they should not have, profits were being made when they should not have been and so on - would the CRU be in a position to demand that over the winter months nobody will be disconnected and that the limited definition of what constitutes vulnerability will not apply?  In other words, there should be no disconnection over the winter months and the moratorium should be extended to all household customers and businesses, particularly small businesses.<\/p><p>Would it be possible to extend the moratorium to prepay meters?  Would it be possible to just say that people should not be disconnected if they fail to put money in their meters?  Would it be possible for that instruction to be given by the CRU to the various companies?<\/p><p>It has come to our attention in the past week that many apartment dwellers live in areas with district heating systems.  For some reason, the price per kW\/h for gas for these people is at least three times higher than it would be for those of us here.  There might be a technical explanation for that but these customers cannot switch.  They cannot go onto <i>bonkers.ie <\/i>and switch around different companies because they live in buildings that are connected to district heating systems.  The committee is constantly told that this is the future, that district heating is good for the environment and so on.<\/p><p>However, they are being left in a very difficult position.  They cannot switch and are being charged more than anybody else.  Can we find some way of putting them on a moratorium?  When we look at the figures 250,000 people are in arrears for electricity and 148,000 households are in arrears already for gas bills.  So this is a really serious crisis which we know and I argue that not enough is being done and that the extension of the moratorium must apply to everybody.  In particular, we must consider what is happening with district heating systems.  I am also told that the CRU does not regulate district heating companies.  If not, why not?  I ask because if there is no regulation then these over-the-top measures are imposed on people who live within them and if they are the future then where are we going?<\/p><p> On the question of vulnerability, we looked up the definition which showed two things.  One, is where people are dependent on energy for disability equipment etc.  The other day a 78-year-old person told me that she has stopped using her electric chair on her stairs because she is worried about using electricity.  So she needs to register as vulnerable but does not realise that and people who use electric chairs, hoists or special equipment for their children think that if they turn on anything they will be in trouble.  Dependency is definitely vulnerable.  The other definition for vulnerability concerns age, mental health and all the rest.  Is it not true to say that the definition for vulnerability could be extended way beyond those two restricted areas given the current crisis?<\/p><p> Lastly, can the CRU instruct all providers to put everybody on the most beneficial tariff rather than limiting it to only the vulnerable?  Is it possible for the CRU to ask all of the suppliers to give people all of the most beneficial tariffs, ensure there are no disconnections over the winter and, in particular, let us consider prepaid and district heating?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#Q00900","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":315,"content":"<p>We will endeavour to answer the Deputy's questions.

On its own it might be beneficial but we also need to consider the wider suite of social welfare and other Government supports that will be needed to assist customers in very difficult circumstances this winter.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy has raised some really good points about the different definitions and I will step through them.  First, the most critical group is the vulnerable customers who are reliant on medically assistive devices whether it is assistive living, oxygen condensers or other medical devices.  Those customers can never be disconnected for reasons of non-payment.  We need to get that message out there because people should absolutely not avoid using assistive technology in their homes because they are afraid of their bill.  We need more of those customers registered as vulnerable customers and that is one of the targets of our information campaigns.  That is a really important protection and we do not think that enough people are aware of it.  Maybe the people who are in those situations might not think of themselves as that vulnerable but their family members might recognise that these are people who would benefit from that protection and should be registered.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy correctly pointed out, the next level of vulnerability are those who, because of reasons of age or health, might be particularly vulnerable to disconnection during the winter.

We are seeing the outcome of that now.  Our customer care team is dealing with some difficult cases.  It is about balance.  Nobody wants disconnections.  The process is there not to have a disconnection at the end of it but to have an engaging customer who is still working with the supplier, entering a payment plan or finding an option that helps them to retain their supply.  We will monitor that over the winter.  That is why we are stepping up our monitoring of what is happening.  There have been quite low levels of disconnection since the moratorium for Covid was lifted.  We will continue monitoring the situation to try to understand what we are seeing.

I want to concentrate on the issue of security of supply.  There was a report on \"Morning Ireland\" this morning by the political editor, David Murphy, who seems to have access to a freedom of information, FOI, request from the IDA, which showed a level of concern about the inability of some of the data centres to connect to the grid based on a direction from CRU and the impact that had had on the sentiment within foreign direct investment.  While we rightly have to concern ourselves with the vulnerability of citizens of the State at every possible opportunity, we also have to ensure that we are in a position to provide gainful employment for people.<\/p><p>Anything like the information that would seem to emanate from that report or through that freedom of information is concerning to me and to many people because it somehow sets a bad image of the country.

It is not personal towards anyone but I wonder if the witnesses have done any analysis of the CRU.  Do the witnesses believe the CRU is fit for purpose in light of what has happened?  The CRU has the statutory responsibility and it was indicated in the opening statement that it intends to broaden its remit and employ more people.  Is it on foot of some analysis the CRU has done that it needs to broaden its work?  When something goes wrong, it is easy to have the benefit of hindsight and make judgements, but has the CRU done any critical analysis of how we have ended up in the situation we are in with the way those auctions were run, which we talked about the previous day?  We can say there were planning and regulatory issues but did the CRU look into its own heart, procedures and processes?  In doing so, will the witnesses talk to us a little bit about that?  I do not want to be critical but the way the CRU is constituted, it is answerable to this committee and this committee only.  Regardless of whether that is good or bad, it places a certain encumbrance on us in terms of holding the CRU to account.  Maybe it would suit us if the CRU was accountable to the Government.  Then we could be more critical of it and less critical of ourselves, but we have that responsibility.  I want to tease through the idea of the CRU being fit for purpose a bit more.  That is not a reflection on any individual but on the overall architecture of what the CRU is.  The CRU did not set it up either; it was set out in statute.

When we asked for additional staff, it included many new areas like offshore energy generation and the strategic impact of same in anticipation of new functions coming in.

One of the areas where we want to enhance internal capability includes security of supply.

Norway has security of supply concerns this year with regard to low water levels for hydro.  Finland and Sweden have security of supply concerns linked to nuclear.  None of that is to say that the capacity remuneration mechanism, CRM, that we designed was perfectly put in place, perfectly designed or perfectly operated.  The point of the EY report was to examine the design and operation of the CRM to see how it might be made better.

There is a balance to be struck in all these decisions.

It sets out a very clear pathway to how they might be able to participate and the encumbrances that would prevent them.  The documentation that was produced in 2014 and 2015 charted what happened.  I go back to what I said the last day about the way in which the criteria allowed the ESB to participate.  I have not suggested it did anything wrong.  It saw what was in front of it.  It cornered a big slice of the market and failed to deliver.  I find that hard.  I have said this to people in the ESB.

I find it hard to accept it has failed in such a spectacular way, although I must take its word for it.<\/p> <p>  Those in the CRU are in a regulatory position and have a different role.  The ESB pays its fine and moves things on.  The CRU goes back with its T-3 auction and the bid goes from &euro;46,000 or &euro;47,000 per megawatt to &euro;138,000 within a very short period.  I believe that warrants deeper investigation by the CRU.  In fairness to the witnesses from the CRU, on the last day they asked me to provide the evidence or documentation I had.  Sometimes it requires a regulatory authority to put all the bits and bobs together.  If it starts to quack like a duck and walk like a duck, maybe it is a duck.

Ireland has the highest rate of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, in the OECD.  It is really important to ensure there are no huge variations in temperature for COPD patients because such variations can cause their airways to close.  We also have the highest rate of hospitalisation of COPD patients.  I am also concerned about people who rely on hoists and dialysis machines.

People would expect the CRU to be across standing charges and that such charges would have to be negotiated with it.  That is the crux of the problem.  This is the climate committee.  The only reason it exists is because we are in a climate crisis.  Suppliers are increasing standing charges in order to offset energy reduction because the increasing price will be a reduction in the amount of energy people consume.  It is vital that the Minister addresses that.  It shows the problem we have in facing the climate crisis under our current economic model.  It is only for profit.  We should never have sold the shares we sold in ESB.  It should not be for profit anymore.  We cannot just keep consuming.  That is me making a statement after asking the witnesses a question.

I have another set of questions on the energy demand piece.<\/p> <p>  On the standing charges and the moving away from price regulation, I believe it is pretty clear that the position in the European Union is no longer about moving away from price regulation but is about much more hands-on measures on price caps and thresholds.  This is clearly what we are seeing right now from the EU.  In that regard, the standing charges piece seems to be absolutely central.  The point was made previously by Senator O'Reilly and others about why we do not have the lowest cost of default.  The witness mentioned that some prefer lower carbon options but now we know that the renewable energy or the lowest carbon options will be the lowest cost options.  It is not just a matter of preference.  We have a collective public priority to move towards the lowest carbon option and that also happens to be the lowest cost.  Why would we not put a requirement in for the lowest cost and the lowest carbon option in that regard?  This is around the transition from gas.  I am really surprised to see the key role of gas in security of supply when we know that gas has this huge price volatility.  I am aware that there is an emergency measure for gas because many people in Ireland are on gas heating, but we should look specifically at how we are helping people to transition away from that more volatile and more expensive fuel of gas and at supporting people more actively, not to just to choose, but to be supported into moving towards lower carbon options, be that individually or collectively with district heating.<\/p> <p>  I note that the EU directive is not just around giving back to customers.  We do not want to end up with just another subsidy to fossil fuel companies.  It is about channelling it to those who need it most.  It may well be that those levies put on those companies, and on gas in particular with its huge profits, may be directed into supporting people proactively to make a transition to cheaper low carbon, which is something that people may not be able to do on their own.  That might need to be fully funded by the State.  I am thinking in particular of collective users.<\/p> <p>  On the standing charges issue, in all of this talk of smart meters and hubs it strikes me that first of all we need to be realistic that 42% of people in Ireland lack basic digital skills and will not be going online to deal with these issues.  If the standing charges are allowed to increase regardless of use it completely undercuts such measures.  It is not just bad in the context of energy shortages and the poverty impact this will have on people; it is also very impactful around the transition to low carbon.  It seems that it is counter indicated with transition to energy reduction if the standing charges go up in any way.<\/p><p>In that regard, Ms MacEvilly might comment on the low-usage standing charge for those who have extremely low energy usage.  The fact is that was removed, but as I understand it, from May, the standing charge for those with very low energy usage went up.  They were effectively penalised, as they are no longer getting the benefit of being a low energy user.  Could Ms MacEvilly comment on standing charges and how credible it is to talk about smart metering if it all gets undermined by a standing charge increase?  There is a need for a far more hands-on approach to address the price thresholds and the transition to lower carbon options.  I have a different set of questions, but I will group them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#DD00800","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663628400,"counter":415,"content":"<p>On the standing charges, first, where homes are connected to the network there are costs associated with providing those network services to those customers, which must be recovered.  Some of those costs exist even if the customers are using very little electricity, because it is a holiday home or because they upgraded their home to A-rated status or whatever else, or they are using solar photovoltaic, PV, during the day for their electricity but they still require additional electricity at peak times.  There is a basis for having a standing charge.  It is a socialisation of costs, which ensures that everybody pays their way and that customers who can afford to invest in upgrading their home are not being subsidised by customers who cannot afford to do so.  We do think there is a basis for having a standing charge.  It is a fixed cost, if one likes, associated with serving customers.  Some of the concerns Senator Higgins raises are about whether the standing charge becomes such a high portion of the bill that it perhaps disincentivises those who are trying to reduce their energy costs.  That is perhaps something we will examine when we look periodically at the component costs of a typical customer's bill.  We look at the extent to which there are fixed costs, unit charges, the PSO levy and VAT.  All of that changes over time.  It is a good point to look at that and see if after the current round of price increases over time there is a dramatic change in the proportion of fixed costs versus unit costs that would give rise to concerns about disincentivising reduced usage.  That is valid and is something that we will continue to monitor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#EE00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":416,"content":"<p>It strikes me as more of an emergency concern as well.

In some of the written pieces from the CRU on the ongoing data centre discussions, I noticed there were multiple references to EirGrid but almost no reference to the review the CRU conducted that considered the options of doing nothing and a moratorium on data centres until the demand can be safely and securely facilitated by the network, and then the subsequent connection measures.  I say this in the context that we were told, the time we met EirGrid and the CRU, that a 9% increase in electricity demand over five years was not an outlier, but I know from the information we have been given since that it is an outlier, and it seems the average in most EU countries is an overall net growth of zero percent.  There has been either flat or declining energy usage in most countries, so effectively zero percent growth in electricity demand is the norm, whereas Ireland has had a 9% increase in electricity demand for the same period.  The figures for the same five-year period show a 265% increase in the electricity demand from data centres.<\/p> <p>  In the current context where we are having literally to consider measures such as keeping the lights off or reducing the use of lights, has the CRU reflected on the decision not to apply the reasonable standard of having a moratorium until the demand can be safety and securely facilitated by the network and instead to go with a couple of connection measures?  On the decision the CRU made not to limit the expansion of electricity demand by data centres but to look instead at connection measures, will the delegation comment on two of them in particular?  One is the question of backup generators and the extent to which they rely on fossil fuels.  We know, for example, that two of the new data centres that have been given planning permission have diesel backup generators.  Perhaps the witnesses could comment on the danger of locking in that in terms of backup generation, which is fossil fuel-based generation happening in data centres that are being built and ones that are newly proposed to be built.<\/p> <p>  The CRU mentioned the ability of data centres to provide flexibility in their demand by reducing consumption.  I would like to clarify what is meant by that.  Are we saying the data centres must reduce demand at peak times and they can be required to do so?  Is it, as mentioned here, something they could be requested to do or is it, and I was quite concerned by the reference to this earlier, the idea of procurement auctions around demand reduction?  Is the suggestion we would have to bid for companies to reduce their energy demand?  I was very concerned about the suggestion, which seemed to be, and I hope I got this wrong, that a hospital might bid for energy reduction bonuses or payments against other companies.  We certainly should not have a situation where for-profit companies can choose not to reduce energy where hospitals are effectively being told they should seek to reduce their energy costs and so forth by bidding for demand reduction.  Either Deputy O'Sullivan or Deputy Leddin made the very sensible suggestion that surely we should just pay for battery power in our public and essential services rather than have them going into a demand reduction procurement market.

However, we are on a different trajectory to the overall average.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about data centres.  In the new data centre connection policy, we looked for on-site back-up generation.  We are completely open to that being a combination of on-site renewables and battery storage, which might work in some cases.

The focus of that decision was very much on security of supply.  The other options around flexible demand support security of supply but would also be a lower carbon solution.  Sometimes data centres refer to it as chasing the wind or following the sun.  Some of these large global operators have data centres at multiple sites across the globe.  Therefore, at times of low renewables or at peak times in Ireland, they could switch the processing capacity and the electricity demand or load to locations that have high renewables at that particular time.  That is attractive.  Of concern to us is that in the responses we have received to our consultation on the network charges, the indication from some of the sector is that while this is a future option, it may not necessarily be available this winter.  There is some concern in our minds about whether it will be available.  We need to understand that better.<\/p> <p>  On the procurement for demand-side services, we were considering an approach in our network tariff whereby people would be charged and could avoid the charge by reducing their use at specific times.  The EU regulation on emergency measures and supportive energy prices sets out a different approach whereby customers should be incentivised in the manner the Senator described.  In other words, they would compete to earn money to reduce their use.  I am simply repeating what is in the regulation.  That approach must be implemented on a non-discriminatory basis.  It would tend to argue against the approach we were looking at and argues for a different approach that still targets the same benefits.  We are pleased to see that as part of the package.  However, perhaps we need to reflect on the approach we are taking to ensure it aligns with the EU requirements.  I do not think that necessarily rules out the idea that there could be other options to support essential services to get batteries on site.  If that were a policy decision that the Government was to take, there may be other ways of incentivising them.  I am not sure that hospitals are best positioned to bid to reduce use.  What we want to do for hospitals is to ensure they have continuous supply.  That is why they are on the priority list for any of the emergency measures.  Perhaps a different approach is required for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022092000002#JJ00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Aoife MacEvilly"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":455,"content":"<p>To be clear, has the CRU reflected on the decision not to suspend the increase in demand for data centre energy until it could be safely and securely facilitated by the network?

At the outset, I thank him and the committee for the invitation to be here today.  I am accompanied, as the Cathaoirleach has already outlined, by the following officials from my Department, namely, Martina Mannion, assistant secretary for special education and inclusion; Brendan Doody, principal officer, special education section; and Martin McLoughlin, principal officer, special education section.<\/p> <p>  The topic before the committee today is aligning education with the UNCRPD and in particular, a focus on progress being made on aligning special education policy with the vision for inclusive education as articulated in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  As Minister for Education, I am committed to making a difference for students who have additional needs as part of an inclusive education system.  I know that this commitment is also shared by the Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion in the Department of Education, Deputy Madigan.<\/p> <p>  It is important that I outline to the committee the Government&rsquo;s ambition to develop an inclusive education system that meets the needs of all children regardless of disability or other disposition.  At the outset, I wish to pay tribute to all our school staff at every level for the work they do.  Their work and commitment ensures that children with special educational needs can attend school and participate in school life to the fullest possible extent.<\/p> <p>  As a Government, we fully recognise the importance of an inclusive and all-embracing education system.  It is my firm belief that our education system should be adaptable and responsive to the needs of students.  Being able to access education in an inclusive way is key to living life to its fullest.  In doing so we are helping children and young people to grow and develop and to be as independent as possible.<\/p> <p>  As a Government, we continue to work to realise the goals of the convention and to deliver a truly inclusive education system.  Having undertaken extensive consultations and research, the National Council For Special Education, NCSE, will provide policy advice on the future of special schools and special classes, taking into account the requirements of the UNCRPD.<\/p> <p>  While I await the NCSE policy advice, my Department&rsquo;s policy remains very clear.  We want to ensure that all children with special educational needs can be provided with an education appropriate to their needs.  This means that children with special educational needs should be included, where possible and appropriate, in mainstream settings with the necessary additional teaching and care supports in place.<\/p> <p>  In circumstances where children with special educational needs require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are provided for.  We fully recognise that these more specialist supports and settings also have an important role to play.<\/p> <p>  I am happy to say that the vast majority of children with special educational needs are educated in mainstream classes.  The benefits of mainstream education are known and recognised.  We must continue to build a society with inclusion at its heart, where everyone is welcome and where full participation is the right of every person, no matter as to their background or need.  Our schools are where we nurture and develop the future of our society.  There should be no barriers to inclusion and no artificial segregation.<\/p> <p>  In the last few years, there has been a very significant increase in the number of children and young people being diagnosed with special educational needs, particularly in the area of autism.  We have responded to that by providing additional supports in mainstream classes and additional special class and special school places necessary to meet the emerging needs of those children and young people.<\/p> <p>  The Department this year will spend over &euro;2 billion, or over 25% of its total educational budget, on providing additional supports for children with special educational needs.  This represents an increase of over 60% in total expenditure since 2011.  This funding provides for 14,385 special education teachers in the mainstream school system in 2022, an increase of 620 on the previous year.<\/p> <p>  Provision has been made for an additional 1,165 special needs assistants, SNAs, in budget 2022, which will bring the number of SNAs to 19,169 by the end of 2022.<\/p> <p>There were 2,118 special classes in place at the start of the 2021-22 school year.  Additional provision for 383 additional special classes in 2022-23 will bring the total number of classes to 2,535 in the 2022-23 school year and will represent an increase of 339% since 2011, at which time 548 were provided.<\/p> <p>  Three new special schools have been opened in the last three years, two in Dublin, namely, Danu Community Special School and Our Lady of Hope School, Crumlin, and one in Cork, namely, Carrigaline Community Special School.  Additional places continue to be provided to ensure that children with the most complex educational needs receive an education in line with their needs.  Two further special schools will open in Dublin and Cork during the current school year.<\/p><p>We have worked hard to strengthen and streamline the planning systems between the Department and the NCSE to ensure that there are sufficient special education places available to meet needs throughout the country.  Significant investment has been made to ensure that schools have the necessary accommodation and facilities to receive children and young people with disabilities.  Professional development for teachers and school leaders is key to building capacity and confidence among teachers and their leaders and a truly inclusive culture and school environment.  It is worth noting in particular that we have invested significantly in supporting school leadership in recent years.  In fact, the extent of supports in that regard has never been greater.  For example, in last year&rsquo;s budget the Government provided administrative principal status for teaching principals in schools with two or more special classes.  <\/p><p> It is also worth referring to a number of recent developments, the outcomes of which are likely to influence the way in which our system develops into the future.  We are aware through policy advice from the NCSE that the current range of supports in schools, for example teaching and care on their own, do not fully meet the needs of some children with special educational needs, SEN, particularly children with complex needs in the areas of communication, speech and language, sensory impairments, self-regulation and positive behaviour skills.  Under the school inclusion model which is currently at pilot stage, we aim to broaden the range of supports provided to include speech and language, occupational and behavioural supports in order that schools are better equipped to meet the needs of these children so they can achieve better life outcomes.  The Department is working with the Departments of Health and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the HSE to develop and strengthen more coherent structures to enable children and young people to access therapeutic assessments and supports.  This work is being supported by the Department of the Taoiseach. <\/p><p> As regards the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act, this legislation has been in place for almost 20 years and it is timely that we should review it now.  There has been significant change in Department policy and education provision has increased substantially in the intervening period.  There has also been legislative change that impacts on education.  This review will help ensure that our laws reflect current policy and international norms on provision and inclusion.  It is envisaged that the full review will be completed by early 2023. <\/p><p> Regarding Irish Sign Language, ISL, the Irish Sign Language Act 2017 provides people whose main language is ISL with certain statutory entitlements.  In recognition of this, earlier this year the Department launched a new scheme to provide ISL in-school support for students who are deaf and whose primary means of communication is ISL.  We are creating a new specialised in-school support post for individual students in order that they can fully access education and participate in school life.  We also will provide training and support for the school community, including teachers and special needs assistants to help with communication using Irish Sign Language.  This is a positive development and the latest step in ensuring that we have an inclusive education system where everyone is supported to reach their full potential.  The implementation of this Act in education will, I am confident, create a more inclusive school environment for these young people. <\/p><p> As regards transitions, the whole area of supporting the transition of young people with a disability right through the education system, with a particular focus on enabling young people to make informed life choices, is a priority.  We are working with colleagues across a number of Departments to ensure that this remains a focus of the third action plan under the comprehensive employment strategy for persons with disabilities, which will cover the period from 2022 to 2024.  The development of a demonstration transition programme has been agreed to address the transition needs of young people with disabilities in the two-year run up to their departure from school.  Under the proposal, the pilot will take place on 20 project sites.  There will be representation from a cross-section of schools to include students with disabilities in mainstream post-primary settings, located in special classes attached to mainstream and in special schools.  <\/p><p> Separately, I announced on 15 November a further planned development in the transition space.  The Department is partnering with an NGO with experience in the area of transitions to support the transition of post-primary level students with special educational needs to employment, training or further study in seven schools across the country.  Under the proposal, a careers and employment facilitator will engage with students and their parents and collaborate with teachers in complementary activities such as mini-companies, work experiences and transition planning.  This development is in the initiation phase and is planned to progress later this year. <\/p><p> My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte, recently announced that the HSE has commenced a process to reinstate health and social care supports which had previously existed in special schools.  This involves the provision of an additional 136 whole-time equivalent, WTE, posts, which is on top of the 85 reinstated posts for special schools that were announced in 2021.  This builds on the 290 posts funded in budget 2021 and budget 2022, which the HSE will also continue to recruit to the children&rsquo;s disability network teams.  This programme of work has already commenced and will be monitored closely for the remainder of 2022 with regular communication between relevant stakeholders at local and national level to ensure progress.  Each one of the approved additional 136 WTE posts will deliver services on a 34-hour-week basis.  The allocation to special schools will be aligned with the level of service and disciplines provided prior to the establishment of children&rsquo;s disability network teams under the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People, PDS, programme.  <\/p><p> We have come a long way in ensuring that children and young people with a special educational need can access an appropriate education.  There is strong evidence to support this and I have provided some of this earlier.  However, there are times when we experience difficulties and challenges for a smaller number of young people and the Department of Education is working intensely with the NCSE to address this.  I am extremely grateful to schools for their co-operation and their leadership in this regard.  The Department is fully committed to the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  This will be achieved by increased investment in education provision and supports; the implementation of evidence-informed advice; the provision of continuous professional development for school staff; the strengthening of initial teacher education; and through consultation with teachers, parents, children, young people, school communities and general society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022092000002#A00200","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her opening statement and welcome the &euro;2 billion her Department is providing for special educational needs.  That is 25% of the Department's budget.  I compliment the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, on fighting for that budget and I hope we will see the same in next week's budget.  I know an awful lot of resources have been achieved through that extra money including new special education teachers, extra SNAs, extra classes, school places and indeed new schools.  I was delighted to welcome the Minister just last week to my own constituency for the opening of Stewarts special school's new building.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Minister that there should be no barriers for education.  I thank her, her officials and the NCSE for all they do to break down the barriers that do unfortunately exist.  Notwithstanding the level of investment that goes into this area, as the Minister said herself in a response to a parliamentary question from me, there are still some parts of the country where an increase in population has created a shortage of school places for children with additional needs.  My constituency of Dublin Mid-West is one of those areas.  We have a rapidly growing population in Clondalkin, Lucan and our village areas but that population growth has not been met by additional capacity.  As the Minister will be aware, we have a number of primary and secondary schools awaiting new buildings.  It is essential that autism spectrum disorder, ASD, units and special educational needs classrooms are part of that capital investment.  I do a lot of work with the Clondalkin Autism Parents Support Network, which has been doing an unofficial audit of ASD places available from next September.  They cannot get that information from schools.  I would love if the Minister would use her time here to outline what plans there are to invest in growing areas like this and to explain how those decisions on the allocation of resources, capital expenditure and plans are made and what data are used.  She also may be able to give us an indication of the talent pipeline when it comes to teachers and SNAs.  Is attracting talent into special education a challenge?  Is there something more we could be doing if it is?

I acknowledge the tremendous work of the local community and in particular the school community there.  The Deputy is quite correct that significant progress has been made.  For example, she referred to Dublin and we have been conscious in recent months that there were specific requirements in Dublin in terms of 80 places being required in special classes and 50 special school places.  Due to the great work of all of these school communities on the ground, the 50 places in the special schools were provided for.  Throughout Dublin, 300 additional places have been provided.  That is a significant achievement.  Obviously as the Deputy has outlined there will always be ongoing demand and challenge.  I acknowledge that right throughout the country we have seen significant uptake from school communities.  I would like to take the opportunity to acknowledge that where we have seen best practice in one school, we have seen almost a domino effect of other schools taking up opportunities to develop in a similar vein themselves.<\/p><p>Therefore, I am grateful to the schools that have taken it upon themselves to set the ball rolling in communities, because this has been very positive in local communities. <\/p><p> Regarding planning for future supply, because this is obviously a key element of the work we must do, particularly concerning additional special classes, almost 700 projects are currently progressing or are under way as part of the school building programme.  In turn, this will deliver more than 1,300 new SEN classrooms and 200 replacement classrooms, catering for approximately 7,800 SEN pupils across primary and post-primary levels.  Almost 100 of these projects are on-site now.  Ultimately, this will deliver classroom spaces for almost 1,000 additional SEN pupils.  <\/p><p> As of late, we have seen, and this aspect has been referred to, that 25% of the budget of the Department of Education is now being expended on special education.  This is right and proper, and not before its time.  There have been achievements but there is also a body of work that must continue and do so apace.  Reference was also made to staff and support of staff.  We now have the highest number of special education teachers, with 15,000 of them, with the number of SNAs standing at more than 19,000.  A course is being funded by the Department for special education teachers to support that area of development.  <\/p><p> Equally, we are looking at our initial teacher training.  A significant component of that is inclusive education.  Within the school system itself, we are also considering progression models for our students in respect of the types of curricula they might wish to follow.  At the junior cycle level now, for example, we have level 1 and level 2.  These will now transfer over as part of the senior cycle programme as well.  Therefore, this is an ongoing body of work.  We are continuing to tackle it from the construction point of view and from a staffing perspective.  We are grateful for and appreciative of the genuine goodwill and determination of the school communities themselves.  They recognise that the best model is the inclusive one and that we have an obligation to meet the needs of all our students at all times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022092000002#B00300","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and her staff for attending.  I am curious about the school inclusion model, which is at the pilot stage.  It is intended to include many supports and to reach out to different areas, including speech and language, occupational therapy and supports in schools, to ensure they are equipped in that regard.  I understand it is to be completed by 2023.  I ask the Minister to outline how this is progressing.  It seems like it is a good way of finding out where we stand when it comes to this issue.  I also mention community healthcare organisation, CHO, 9.  I tabled a parliamentary question in May 2022 concerning waiting lists, and CHO 9, which includes my area of Dublin North-West, had one of the longest waiting lists for children to get an assessment.  I think that has now improved, and perhaps the Minister will comment on this.  I ask about this because I was worried about this situation when I spoke to the special educational needs organiser, SENO.  There seemed have been little movement then, but perhaps something more has happened since.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is probably familiar with Gaelscoil U&iacute; Earc&aacute;in in Finglas.  A prefabricated building is being erected there for special education and people with disabilities.  I am, however, worried about the numbers.  The school has 294 pupils and it needs approximately 308 to get an extra teacher.  It would be a disaster if there was a need to double up classes.  Will the Minister please look at this situation?  I ask because I do not think that would be a good idea.  The class sizes would then shoot up to about 27, and that would be a disaster.<\/p> <p>  I also wish to ask the Minister about the effects of the pandemic.  We know it had a huge negative impact on people with disabilities.  What plans does the Minister have to address such a situation, if something like it were to happen again?  It has been an absolute disaster.  Will the Minister also comment on the use of seclusion and restraint in schools and the use of reduced timetables?  People are sometimes penalised.  I note my comrade mentioned some of the schools.  I have had experience where principals have been avoiding taking on people because they have had a disability of some description.  I do not know if this is common, but I have experience of this aspect from dealing with such situations in the past.  I wonder how we can deal with these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022092000002#C00200","speaker":"1470"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":472,"content":"<p>On the school inclusion model, this is spread across 73 schools and covers three counties, namely, Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.  It is an inclusive and good model.  The Deputy is correct that it is one we are seeking to trial.  I appreciate his personal interest in this subject.  Within this model, there are 12 therapists and four National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, psychologists working directly with staff.  I have seen on the ground how well this approach works.  There has, however, been an impact in respect of the Covid-19 pandemic and other measures.  During the time of Covid-19, therapists were withdrawn and various other things had to happen during the pandemic as well.  The model has now recommenced and we are aiming to complete the review as fast as possible.  Great learning will be derived from it.  It is a model that deserves to have its place.  It remains to be seen whether that will be in its entirety as it exists now, or whether there will be opportunities for modifications, or whatever, in future.  It is an excellent model, however, and it is one I am pleased to say we have recommenced piloting.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the reduced timetables, it is important that such reduced timetables for children with special educational needs are used and used appropriately, and in a way that meets their needs and benefits those pupils. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022092000002#C00300","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":473,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022092000002#C00400","speaker":"1470"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":474,"content":"<p>It is also important that the necessary supports are in place.

I contacted her recently and I am aware she is trying to do her best with a system we probably need to look at more.  My own experience is that children with disabilities are not fully seen or heard and that the provision of services varies depending on a child's disability, their age, where they go to school or where they live.  I always say no matter what part of the country you live in, be it Carlow, Kilkenny or Donegal, you have the same entitlements.<\/p> <p>  I will give the Minister an example from a school near me, namely, Holy Angels.  I thank the Minister because she visited the school and is very much aware of it.  The school is getting its new build, so this is a good news story.  Holy Angels has discharged 14 pupils, but out of this group, seven are waiting for differential aptitude test assessments.  Without the assessment, the child will end up in a mainstream classroom without any additional supports.  Some of these children have already lost out on ASD preschool placements because they have not had their assessments to date.  There are six children who require placement in St. Laserian's Special School in Carlow, which is an excellent school, or maybe in special classes within the locality, but, again, without educational assessments, they will not get placements.  As a result, these children will also end up in mainstream education.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is aware of this and is working on it.  It is important.  I have been working with the parents in order that we get as many assessments done as soon as possible.  Before Covid, things totally changed but all students in a place called New Brunswick in Canada are educated together in their local school.  Every child, whether they are able or disabled, with complex needs, are talented students, thriving students or disadvantaged students, all study together.  They all learn together with their own tailored experience.  In 2019, the NCSE spoke about this idea.  To fully include all students it suggested looking at this model.  I understand that since the suggestion came in late 2019 we have had the coronavirus and we have lost a lot of ground but is this a model the Minister is looking at?  She might come back to me on that.<\/p> <p>  I have another question on a matter one or two parents have contacted me about.  Has the Department had any engagement with the State Examinations Commission to ensure reasonable accommodation be made at State examinations for students with epilepsy who experience a seizure during the exam.  Families have been telling me epilepsy should be included as a serious health condition so an enormous burden is not placed on a student to prove they have had a seizure.  I am aware the State Examinations Commission rules stipulate that while candidates who experience a serious medical condition are entitled to sit deferred exams, this does not apply to those who have commenced an exam.  The same issue arises for those who experience seizures.  Is the Minister looking at this?<\/p> <p>  I met a group of parents earlier.  They spoke about the summer experience of children attending special school.  It was about the July provision or the lack of it.  As the Minister knows, it is probably one of the best programmes for children who need routine and their parents.  It is hugely beneficial to the children and the parents.  I am wondering what the update is on that.  I must give the Minister this book.  There are many stories in it from parents who have been affected because their children's school did not do the July provision this year, so I want to ask her about that too.<\/p> <p>  This is my final point.  The Minister is very much for inclusion and that is part of our ethos going forward.  It is great students sitting State examinations get their papers in both Irish and English.  This is welcome, but we now have Syrian, Ukrainian and Lithuanian students here.  English is not their first language.  Would the Minister consider having papers available in those languages as well as in English and Irish in the 2023 exams?  I would appreciate it if she could come back to me with some answers on these.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022092000002#D00700","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":484,"content":"<p>On the assessment of need, the Deputy will appreciate it is a HSE issue but I can follow up on it with my colleague.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's area, it is important to say that we have been successful, and I acknowledge the Deputy's local school communities.

It is a matter for the commission, which is independent, but it is my personal view, and core to my beliefs around senior cycle reform, that we maximise the potential for every student inasmuch as we possibly can in terms of taking the exams and how it will benefit them.  I am confident that, as part of this review following the running of these examinations, there will be opportunities to look at things further.  The last full review of the reasonable accommodations scheme was in 2017.  There will be a much more in-depth review to come.  It will probably be hand-in-hand with the senior cycle reform as well but it is a matter for the State Examinations Commission.  I 100% support the philosophy that we give the maximum opportunity to our students to showcase their talents and abilities on a given day.<\/p> <p>  On the July provision, or the summer provision as we call it now it is no longer limited, a considerable investment of over &euro;40 million was made and there was significant uptake.  It is a provision that is made available for children with additional needs but also those at risk of educational disadvantage.  It is my absolute desire and determination that more schools will find themselves in a position to make these summer provision programmes available.  This year, a considerable number of changes were put in place, in that there was much engagement with schools on what would be required to make the programme more attractive.  An example would be ensuring the burden would not automatically fall on the principal of the school or school leadership.  Finances were made available that there would be an overseer put in place.  There was also flexibility for schools as we referenced earlier, in that it would not just be July and could be whatever time during the summer period that would suit them.  There was an online programme for the payment of staff.<\/p><p>There is a variety of measures.  A full review will take place.  I know we need greater availability of the programme for students and families.  We are looking at models in other parts of the world to ascertain what is best practice internationally.  I am open to considering other Departments that may be in a position to support work in respect of July provision coming in.  We will revert as soon as we can with this new model.  It will be a model that looks to international best practice.  In particular, we are keen to look to the model in Malta, as well as other providers that may be able to support us in running the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022092000002#D01200","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":490,"content":"<p>Reference was made to the Canadian model by the NCSE.

We sought a date before the summer recess, when known issues could have been highlighted before the new school year commenced.  We are already several weeks into that term and the situation has worsened in some cases.  All present know that timing is key in helping children with special educational needs and disabilities.  It is unfortunate that the insights and points this committee has to offer were not prioritised.<\/p> <p>  In her opening statement, the Minister outlined the amounts being spent and the increase in support, all of which are more than welcome.  However, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and Irish law are clear on this.  Every young person is entitled to an appropriate education but the reality is that many children and young people are being denied that right.  The pre-budget submission of this committee, which is based on the contributions of witnesses, families and advocates, highlights the lack of school places, inadequate transitions between primary and secondary schools and insufficient ASD classes and SNA supports.<\/p> <p>  Cork South-West has no special school and a severe shortage of special classes.  The classes that are in place are doing incredible work but they are oversubscribed.  Last week, I raised the case of an autistic child who has been moved between different primary schools.  The Minister's office and that of the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, are aware of this case.  His education has been disrupted to suit the needs of the Department rather than it being the other way around.  He spent the past year in a non-ASD special class, which has led to his developmental regression.  Needless to say, that is not due to any issue with the class; the class is just not suitable.  An ASD class is now opening in the town closest to the child - it is closer to him than his current school - but it is already full even though it has not yet opened, so he will not get a place there.  His mum asked me how, after eight years in primary education, the Department is not aware of the numbers coming through into second-level education.  It does not make sense.  There seems to be a complete lack of even basic planning.  That is just one example among many.  What does the Minister have to say to the parents of that child?<\/p> <p>  My next question relates to SNA provision.  The Minister will be aware that a national school in Ballydehob has had to fundraise to increase its SNA hours.  It is just one of many schools in my constituency that have had to take that action.  I cannot imagine how many of them there are across the country.  It is symptomatic of a significant gap between the identified needs of students and the SNA allocation and resources being assigned by the Minister and the Department.  The system of assigning SNAs relies on old information and, in some cases, assessments made many years ago.  When I raised this matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, she referred me to the appeal and exceptional review process.  That process puts the onus back on overstretched principals and teachers to do the work of the Department.  In addition, more than 50% of all exceptional review applications result in the allocation of additional SNA or part-time SNA supports.  That obviously illustrates the flawed and ridiculous approach of the Department on this issue.<\/p> <p>  Finally, the summer programme, formerly known as July provision, is a major concern for the committee.  We have called for the Department to develop it as a standard and to ensure that all children who want access to the programme can do so.  Parents and principals have outlined their frustration with the process, the delays in announcing it and the poor communication, not to mention the underpaying of SNAs.  Ultimately, it is children who suffer as a result of this disorganisation.  What is being done to ensure that every school is available for the summer programme?  Why is the Minister not announcing the scheme now, before Christmas, to support as many schools as possible participating?  I ask the Minister to also address the low rates of remuneration for SNAs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022092000002#E00500","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":494,"content":"<p>As regards summer provision, I have already stated that there has been a substantial increase in schools taking up the summer provision programme.  It is not enough and I would be the first to say that.  I also clearly articulated that we are looking at a variety of models of best practice internationally, and even going beyond that to see what other types of resources we can put in place to facilitate schools that might not believe they have the necessary staffing resources.  It is a voluntary programme.  Staff can volunteer to be part of the summer provision programme or they may choose, for their own reasons, not to be involved in the programme.  We have put in place a number of measures this year to ensure the maximum number of people can avail of it but we are not stopping there.  A full review of how the programme worked this year is taking place.  We are engaging with international best practice.  We are also engaging with groups and organisations that might be in a position to be part of this remodelling or re-envisioning of the summer provision programme.  It is an excellent programme.  I have visited many of them.  I have seen them operating on the ground and the extraordinary benefit to children and young people who can avail of them.  It is my ambition that there will be far more schools in a position to provide the programme.<\/p> <p>  As regards SNAs, there is no assessment required for SNA provision.  In terms of the provision in schools, we have more than 19,000 SNAs now in schools, the highest number we have ever had.  There is no doubt that the work of SNAs is very important.  Recognising that, there has been a significant increase in the provision of SNAs in each of the budgets that I have presided over in recent years.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy specifically referenced the number of classes in her area and the difficulties there.  We are coming from a base that requires that we grow.  There is no doubt about that.  As regards her area specifically, there are 41 new classes in the primary sector in her constituency and 22 new classes at post-primary level.  It is not enough but it is significant progress from where we were.  We continue to advance that body of work and yo prioritise.  Testament to the priority that we are placing on this is that 25% of our budget is now expended solely on the area of special education.  It is being given priority.  We see that priority manifest itself in things such as summer provision, which involves a &euro;40 million investment, double the investment in recent years, just to ensure that the maximum number of schools will be in a position to promote it.  A significant body of work has been completed.  There is more work to be done but we are certainly putting in the resources and ambition to ensure the maximum number of children are being supported.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022092000002#E00600","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":495,"content":"<p>On the point I was trying to make in respect of summer provision, the Minister's response was that not all of the schools are taking it up and it is a voluntary programme.

The point I was trying to get across is that children are entitled to that education.  Throughout the summer, we had families taking unpaid leave for the month of July.

The allocation is not working.  It is being put back on schools and overstretched principals.  Principals, particularly those in rural areas, are managing so much.  They have to manage the school and all the various paperwork and then re-appeal for all these things, with an allocation then being granted 50% of the time.<\/p><p>The schools that are refused an allocation do not understand why and are fundraising to employ SNAs separately.  This is at a time when there is no shortage of SNAs.  When roles are advertised, many applications are received.

We are better now than was the case perhaps in years gone by.  For example, it will be automatic for all new school builds.  A 1,000 pupil post-primary school will have a four-classroom SEN base.  The position will be likewise for primary schools, depending on their size.

During Covid, a huge amount of the teaching online was very challenging for children who are visually impaired.  Much of the teaching was digital in nature and required a lot of technology.

We learned to rely on it, and secondary school students who are moving towards independence very much rely on it.<\/p> <p>  As already referred to by one of my colleagues, the use of digital technology does not exactly happen during State examinations.  The State Examinations Commission is an independent body but it does sit within the Department.  The reality is that children who have worked, studied and learned through digital means for their whole education - and my ten-year-old is doing everything on a Polaris, which is like an laptop without a screen - cannot work in the same way when sitting State examinations.  To me, that seems like a very clear breach of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The Department's stance disadvantages children because they have learned one way and then are asked to sit State examinations in a completely different way.  A simple fix would be to allow for PDF versions of examination papers.  When it comes to a clear breach of human rights, although the State Examinations Commission is a non-departmental public body, in this case it would be appropriate for the Department to step in with the commission, whose representatives I have met, and say that action needs to be taken fast.<\/p> <p>  We have discussed the issue of reasonable accommodations.  I brought a copy of the detailed Irish document on reasonable accommodations to the meeting.  Let me cite the UK example as best practice.  By my word count, the document is about four times as long as the Irish document and is incredibly detailed.  In the UK, digital papers are allowed and allowance is made for a number of issues.  We know in the Irish experience that the offer of a scribe and extended time do not suit everybody.  For many children who are sitting examinations,  unless they have a scribe to explain the pictures, they are told not to use them.  That places them at a clear disadvantage.  There are a couple of simple things that we could do to remedy the situation.  The Minister stated that the Department will review reasonable accommodations in tandem with reform of the leaving certificate examination in general.  The Department could review this earlier.  I have emphasised to the State Examinations Board that a review is urgent.  The Department's stance is clearly contrary to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.<\/p> <p>  I do not want to misrepresent the State Examinations Board, but when I met its representatives, I did not feel a sense of urgency about reviewing reasonable accommodations.  I am sorry to be bearer of bad new but we all know that we have some of the lowest levels of full-time employment for people with disabilities in this country.  Not allowing digital assistance in State examinations is part of that as it acts as a barrier to third level education.  I did not get a sense that the State Examinations Board had any immediate impetus to conduct a review.  I talked to the State Examinations Board about allowing PDF versions of examination papers and asked if it had the capacity to make PDFs digitally available during State examinations.  I was told that it would not, which puts us into the territory of seeking a tender.  As we all know, the tender process takes longer.  I am not being flippant when I say that I have staff in my office who can make a PDF document that is secure and would meet the security requirements of the commission.<\/p> <p>  Let me clearly outline my three suggestions for the Department.  The first is to instruct the State Examinations Commission to undertake a review of the list of reasonable accommodations.  I accept that would be a longer project.  The second would be to allow in that process some kind of a forum and consultation between parents and relevant educators.  My experience of visiting teachers has been excellent because they know exactly what they are doing.  I know that people within a Department do not always feel that they can speak up, but visiting teachers are the experts.  I strongly believe that we can learn from them.  It is they who should be asked about reasonable accommodations.<\/p> <p>  The third suggestion is that we should just get on with introducing the use of PDF documents.  I suggest that we provide this option to the leaving certificate students who will participate in the next round of examinations.  I cannot emphasise enough how great a difference this initiative would make to the very small number of students affected.  Their lives would be transformed by being able to access State examinations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022092000002#F00500","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":503,"content":"<p>I cannot disagree with any of the points made by the Deputy.

I appreciate that, this September, we have had record numbers of places in the schools that have come on board.  However, to give a quote, a deputy principal in one of the schools says that clear training and planning for the opening of ASD classes is needed in schools, and that it is not enough to sanction one and then leave it to the principal to project manage and upskill the staff.  It is said that the NCSE is not supporting the process as it should, and that the waiting lists are incredibly long to get education staff on the courses on managing challenging behaviour.  There are more children than ever with learning difficulties in classrooms.  SNAs are being run ragged, giving ten minutes here and ten minutes there, which does not provide effective support to the children who need it.<\/p> <p>  I also know of schools that were obliged to take children on board.  That is great.  I am delighted there are places for children, and I will certainly fight for that.  However, the allocation of SNAs did not go up proportionately in response to the number of children with complex needs.  We have this interplay involving the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the HSE and the Department of Education.  To take CHO 7, it is desperately under-resourced in terms of the failure of recruitment to bring in the occupational therapists and special needs specialists that are required.  We have a difficulty in that regard.  I am concerned about the transparency and accountability of how we are going to ensure the supports are put in place around children.  Those are the first two points.<\/p> <p>  My third point is that, post Covid, we are hearing of a lot of mental health issues and the need for mental health supports, particularly for children with disabilities, and the fact they are recovering post Covid but they can be experiencing or manifesting trauma.  I would like to know what plans are being put in place for that.<\/p> <p>  There is obviously the issue of school transport.  There are still residual issues on that and I would like to hear the Minister's comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022092000002#G00400","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":508,"content":"<p>In terms of school transport, children with additional needs are entitled to the school transport system.  Where the system is readily available, it is made available.  Where there is a particular challenge, alternative arrangements can be put in place with regard to access to a taxi or other means to get them to school.  They are entitled to that.  More than &euro;289 million has been made available for the school transport system.  The other point is that we are very conscious that the needs of children who fall into the special educational needs bracket can come at different times of the year, so there is no time limit or timeframe in terms of their access to that school transport support.  We have more than 15,500 children availing of school transport from the special education point of view, and that will continue to grow.<\/p> <p>  With regard to resources in schools for special classes, the resources that are made available are one teacher and two SNAs to six pupils, and they are provided for.  I hear the point the Senator raises around the wider element of therapeutic supports in that instance.  Considerable engagement has taken place with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, with regard to putting in place those specific resources in schools.  There has been an announcement around 136 posts into special schools, with 44 of those posts to be put in place immediately and then, over three different tranches, the additional ones will be put in place throughout the autumn as they recruit.<\/p> <p>  On the wider question of supports within the school, a programme of professional support for schools with newly established special classes has been developed by the NCSE.  The programme has been completed by the NCSE and will be available to schools as soon as is practical.  The NCSE has worked very hard to put this together.  The programme will involve a variety of supports, including seminars for principals, a four-day intensive training course for teachers, a two-day training course for new teachers and whole-staff CPD.  There is an acknowledgement that the more a school is supported, the better it is.<\/p> <p>  The NCSE is heavily committed to this body of work.  There is a new person taking up the position of CEO within the NCSE.

If teachers, SNAs and schools are being obliged to provide places, which is absolutely right - and every child deserves to be educated as close to their own home as possible and have their needs addressed - but if the supports are not going in for the teachers, then it is less likely they will volunteer for the July provision.  I take Deputy Cairns&rsquo; point that the July provision should be mandatory and that other resources should be used to make sure we provide that.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned that schools would be obliged to find that support for their staff, especially in managing challenging behaviours.  I do not want to overemphasise that because many challenging behaviours arise where children are manifesting the strangeness of their environment.  That is sometimes a vicious circle in that the staff around them are not equipped to cope with their needs and, consequently, the children are more anxious, which leads to children being sent home or having a reduced provision.  It is a nasty cycle that needs to be arrested as a matter of urgency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022092000002#G00600","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":510,"content":"<p>The point that I made about the new model from the NCSE is that there are new additional supports.

I welcome the Minister.<\/p> <p>   I have a number of questions.  Some of them have already been asked, but I would like to ask the Minister if she would consider making disability and autism training a mandatory element of all teacher training courses, going forward.   Would the Minister also make it mandatory for all qualified teachers to undergo disability and autism training as continuing professional development, CPD?  Whether you are at primary, secondary, post-leaving certificate, PLC, or even university level, you are going to encounter students with additional needs, who are autistic.  If we are serious about being inclusive, it is imperative that we ensure all staff are properly trained.  It is the biggest issue we hear from the people who come in here, who have first-hand experience with disability.  They talk to us about the lack of awareness and lack of training in all sectors, but it is vitally important in education. <\/p> <p>  The Minister gave details about the number of special schools and classes, etc., that have opened of late.  Of course, that is absolutely welcome, but it is not enough to have the physical space.  I have been talking to parents in cases where special classes or schools have opened, but they have not been properly resourced.  They do not have the properly-trained teachers in place or enough SNAs.  They do not have a sensory room or the necessary equipment, or there is no open communication between the principal or the school in general with the parents.  There is no access to therapeutic supports.  We do not have enough NEPS psychologists, and we know that there are huge shortages of therapists within the CNDTs.  I know the support they can give to teachers in a school with students who are transitioning, especially from one school to another, about their needs.  That support is invaluable.  I remember receiving that when I was teaching; it was an invaluable support given to students coming from primary schoo but is not there at the moment.<\/p> <p>  A point that has been made, especially by organisations like AsIAm, is that we need to look at classrooms being inclusive, instead of students in the special or autism class being put out in the prefab on the outskirts of the school, for example.  They should be made the centre of the school as well.  Also, the use of restraint and expulsion of students with additional needs from special schools happens and it should not happen.  It is not acceptable, but is very much linked to the lack of training and resources in schools.<\/p> <p>  A number of people have brought up summer provision.  It was established as July provision after a High Court hearing in 1993, which recognised that children with severe needs lose skills over the long school holidays and these skills may never be recovered.  When July provision was replaced by the extended summer programme, the eligibility opened up from 15,000 to 80,000 students.  Of the 8,000 students who attend special schools, fewer than 5% actually received summer provision this summer gone.  I think only 410 students got the full four weeks.  Is there some way of safeguarding the children in our special schools going forward to ensure that they will be prioritised for summer provision?<\/p> <p>  The Minister spoke about looking at other options in other jurisdictions.  She mentioned Malta, and yes, it has a very good scheme and is worth looking at, but they use people from other professions.  Actually, a number of schools now, in the west of Ireland, I think, have run a very successful July provision.  They start organising in January, they go to their own staff and staff in other schools in the locality and then they approach student occupational and speech and language therapists, people who are in third-level education, to come in and work with the students.  It has been really successful.  It is a model that needs to be looked at.<\/p> <p>  In my own area, on school transport, the remote area grant was offered to a number of parents in Cavan around 8 August.  That was too late.  It was not suitable for their needs, so they turned it down, and now they are eligible for a bus or taxi.  That then has to go to tender, which takes a number of weeks.  Then, the driver may have to be Garda vetted and the bus checked.  I know one student who has not yet attended their autism class because they have no way of getting there.  Why can that not be done months in advance?  The transport is approved maybe six months prior or longer, but was not actually enacted.<\/p> <p>  Irish Sign Language, ISL, was mentioned.  I have been contacted by people with a third-level qualification in ISL from Trinity College.  Even though it is an official language of the State, it is not recognised as a teaching subject.  When I contacted the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, about this, they blamed the Teaching Council, and when I contacted the Teaching Council, they blamed the NCCA.  Can this be addressed?  These people are qualified and they may have another qualification in a different subject.  They could teach Irish Sign Language to students in our schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022092000002#H00600","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":516,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Tully.

On her first point about disability and autism training, I absolutely see where she is coming from.  I spent long enough teaching to appreciate the importance of giving confidence, and confidence will only come when people feel they have the familiarity and training in it.  Regarding the Teaching Council, inclusive education is now part of the initial teacher training qualification.  Teachers must be trained in that as part of their affiliation and accreditation with the Teaching Council.  I appreciate that CPD in this area is very important, but if we get it right starting with the new teachers coming out and it being part of their course and qualification, that is the most valid building brick we have.  We must continue to offer CPD alongside that.<\/p> <p>  Therapeutic supports have been raised by a number of speakers.  We have made progress in consultation with the Minister of State at the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and at the Department of Health, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, and those Departments.  It is an advantage, obviously, to the schools.  We need to have those resources in our schools.  We are seeing a step-by-step return now, with 136 posts coming into the special schools, 44 of which have been automatically reinstated.  The others will come in three tranches.  The Department of Education can make the provision for teaching staff with one teacher and two SNAs and the other therapeutic supports, but we are also working with the other Department to ensure that that is put in place.  Obviously, it is a holistic approach.<\/p> <p>  On the remote area grant and the 8 August date, I take Deputy Tully's point.  We are coming close to finalising the entire root-and-branch review of school transport and looking at mechanisms of how to refine it.  It has improved of late, and I appreciate the Deputy's acknowledgement of that.  There are areas where we absolutely can do better and I certainly will take that point on board about timing, etc.<\/p> <p>  On the July provision and the model the Deputy referenced in other schools, I have seen some of those models and they are superb, where schools and staff were thinking outside the box and they went to other organisations or groups or third-level students, etc.  To be fair, regarding third-level students, that happens quite a lot already.  They are relied upon quite a lot, but there is greater scope there.  That is why I earlier referenced that we are looking at other models - the Deputy is familiar with Malta.  We are looking specifically at approaching different groups and organisations, seeing the models that have worked and doing things differently for the model that will unfold for summer 2023.  I am absolutely committed to ensuring that we have maximum uptake, if at all possible.<\/p> <p>  I have a few other points on schools and the resources made available to them.<\/p><p>From the Department's point of view, aside from staff, both teachers and SNAs, a considerable special-class start-up grant of &euro;6,500 is also made available to the school, as well as an ICT grant of &euro;6,700 and an enhanced capitation grant which is around &euro;720 per student.  The Department of Education gives considerable resources to special education and that is right and proper.  I know I am repeating myself when I say that 25% of our entire budget is now dedicated to special education.  As I said at the start, considerable progress has been made.  We are moving in the right direction.  A body of work still needs to be done, but I will certainly take on board the positive and concrete suggestions made by the Deputy.  I appreciate that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022092000002#H00800","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":519,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her attendance and I have been listening with interest.  I will raise three or four points with the Minister.  In light of what happened during the Covid pandemic, is the Department now planning our education system so we can deal with whatever happens if we have another pandemic or emergency, rather than just waiting for something to happen and then making decisions that might have a negative effect on our children?  I am asking about forward planning based on the experiences of the past two years.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the needs of the child and the needs of the school.  We should only talk about the needs of the child.  It is important that we concentrate on the child and what the child needs and that we build everything else around that.  What I mean by that is, if training is required by teachers, they should not take days off from their time in the school because that is disruptive.  Forward planning involves an effort to deal with all the issues so that children who have disabilities have a calm learning experience.<\/p> <p>  The school transport situation was, and still continues to be, a disaster in my constituency, and I am sure in other constituencies.  It has had a negative effect on children with disabilities.  One school in my constituency has four children who still do not have a bus.  A bus was allocated and approved last May.  The school interviewed and appointed an escort for the bus.  The contract was signed and no bus has arrived.  This falls to the Department.  I raised it with the T&aacute;naiste last week.  The information was sent on to the Minister's Department and I ask that be resolved as a matter of urgency.  It is not good enough.<\/p> <p>  Another child who is in a wheelchair has no school transport.  Today is 20 September.  These things should not be happening.  There is no excuse.  As a member of this committee, I understand that we all try to put things in place to create an atmosphere where everything is being looked after.  Whatever is happening with school transport, and I have my own ideas about that, it has affected children with disabilities and with special educational needs and we need to rectify the problems anywhere they have arisen as a matter of urgency.  The onus should not be put on parents to try to bring a child who is in a wheelchair to school, costing them &euro;90 per week.  It is not acceptable.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the design of schools for people with disabilities, are there experts within the building unit who are vetting the design of all new schools to ensure they meet the requirements of universal design?<\/p> <p>  I also ask the Minister about the EPSEN Act 2004.  What provisions for the child will be implemented from that Act?  We need to be serious about this.  It seems to be done in a haphazard way.  Services are not being provided in a uniform way throughout the country and within schools.  I know of children who have disabilities who must go to school outside of their area or parishes because facilities are not available in their areas.  They have to leave their friends to go to other schools for education.  Their siblings want to go to the nearest school but are not with their brother or sister in the national school.  We have a lot of things to seriously correct to ensure that we are meeting our commitments.  The most annoying thing at the moment is that the school transport system is not working properly.  We have been caught napping on that.  The decision to offer free transport was well intentioned but has created unintended negative consequences for children and parents, and especially for children with disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022092000002#J00300","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I will start with the last question regarding school transport.  The waiving of school transport fees was introduced as a cost-of-living measure.  This time last year over 103,000 children in mainstream education were availing of it.  Presently 124,000 tickets are available free of charge to families.  That is an increase of over 20% of children availing of the school transport system.  That is a considerable benefit to families.  I am talking in general rather than about the specific area of special education that the Deputy has raised, as he raised both.  I do not want any family to be discommoded.  That has never been the intention.  Some families find themselves outside the criteria for the provision of mainstream school transport and have availed of concessionary school transport in the past.  It is interesting to note that even concessionary school transport has seen an increase of one third.  That is notwithstanding that some families have been affected where others have become eligible and they are not.  However, in the greater scheme of things, 124,000 families are availing of free transport, notwithstanding that we are still working through some issues.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is 100% right that there have been extraordinary learnings from the pandemic.  I visit many schools who say that in many instances, the pandemic pushed us on almost five to ten years as regards our learnings and things we might have expected to have taken a long time to get across the ground.  We are now in a much better position, notwithstanding the sadness and challenges that the pandemic obviously brought.  However, we have seen positive steps in the areas of technology, remote teaching and learning and in how we have managed exams in the past while, as well as how best practice and learning has been incorporated for the benefit of students.  That will obviously be a guiding principle going forward.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy referenced the needs of the child.  I could not agree with him more.  The education sector serves the student and it must take a child-centred approach and I agree 100% with the Deputy and appreciate that he made that point.  Everything else is a service around it and that is the objective.  Everything we are doing in education, whether specifically in the area of special education or in senior cycle reform, is all about putting the student at the centre.  When we talk about the child-centred approach, I wish to be clear that in general, never before has the student voice sat at the centre of all that we do.  Students are articulating on behalf of students.  Students are part of the National Council for Curriculum Assessment, NCCA, for the first time ever.  We are very focused, and I am particularly focused, on ensuring that the student is at the centre, and remains at the centre, of all that we do.  <\/p> <p>  I should have asked the Deputy at the outset to give me details of those specific cases that he raised around school transport so that I can follow up on them.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked who is charged with ensuring that the universal design for learning is the way it should be.<\/p><p>There are two aspects to it in that there is the universal design from a building point of view but there is also teaching methodology.  Within the Department, obviously the principles of universal design are embedded in every aspect of the Department's work.  In terms of guidance that is given for building projects, including the large-scale ones, those where additional classroom space is being made available or the reconfiguration of space specifically to meet the needs of children with additional needs, all are guided by universal access and there is a universal design process there for all of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022092000002#J00500","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":522,"content":"<p>What about the EPSEN Act?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022092000002#K00200","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":523,"content":"<p>The review of the Act is ongoing.

The Joint Committee on Autism had appear before it many different parents' support groups set up by parents themselves and they discussed how teachers should be trained properly.  As the Minister has stated that new teachers coming through will have inclusive education, can she explain what she means by inclusive education?  Is that just about special needs or does it include all forms, such as the needs of people from ethnic minority groups?<\/p> <p>  I was speaking to AsIAm a few weeks ago and its representatives said that while we have a lot of buildings and schools for children with special needs, we do not have the services within the schools.  It is one thing to have a building but the services are more important and meeting the children where they are at.  One of the organisations that appeared today, I think it was the Dublin 12 Campaign 4 Autism Inclusion group, said it is extremely important that we see the child, the young person, and meet them where they are at.  The parents of some children with special additional needs believe themselves that their children should be in mainstream schools.  So those services should be there.  <\/p> <p>  The committee met representatives of the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, a few weeks ago and they spoke about the budget going forward.  They only have four requests but the one on which I want to focus is mental health supports within our schools. <\/p> <p>  Something that has not been touched on as we come up to the budget concerns SNAs.  Will there be an increase in SNA payments this year in budget 2023?  While I welcome that there are now 19,000 SNAs in the system, I regret to say they are not valued and their qualification is not recognised.  This is not a personal attack on the Minister.  I am myself a qualified SNA and I know what it is like to work in a classroom with children with complex needs and how we should value our SNAs.  Those are my questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022092000002#K00600","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":527,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  On the learning needs of all pupils and meeting the pupils at the place that you find them, I could not agree more.  That fits in with the point the Senator raised as regards initial teacher education and what that involves in terms of inclusive education.  That specifically involves meeting the learning needs of each individual student and meeting them at the place that you find them in.  As for budget 2023 and how we are fixed, I would love to be able to tell the Senator.  We are currently in discussions around the budget.  The Senator specifically raised the INTO request and I have met INTO representatives about a package around mental health and well-being and I wish to be truthful and say that everything is on the table at this point.  I have had a number of asks from a number of different partners in education and they are all on the table but it is all very much part of the discussion and negotiation and I mean that sincerely.  Even at this point, I know we are only a week away, but that is the nature of it.<\/p> <p>  Regarding SNAs, we have seen a significant increase in the number of SNAs.  There is an unprecedented level in excess of 19,000 SNAs in the system now.  I want to acknowledge the invaluable role of SNAs and I know Senator Flynn has that background.  In terms of pay, that is very much a part of the public sector pay deal.  As regards our capacity to grow the number of SNAs going forward, again like the INTO request, that is part of the greater mix at the moment.  We will know a lot more this time next Tuesday.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022092000002#K00800","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  The questions from our members today are based on information the committee has received from various witnesses who have appeared before us over the past two years.  The summer provision is one thing and I note with interest the Minister's commitment to it.  It is vitally important that it is out there strongly and that every plan is put in place for next summer.<\/p> <p>  On SNAs and the part that they play in the entire school community, particularly special schools and schools with special classes, the whole group puts together so much work and dedication.  As a society we cannot underestimate or undervalue the commitment that is being given at school level in terms of what they are doing.  In some instances, an allocation of SNAs is made and then the school authorities look at it and say they need more help and resources.  I know that there is a process to appeal it to the National Council for Special Education but it is something that needs to be looked at to ensure the method of appeal is not cumbersome.  I certainly have come across situations where they have had to go to the nth degree and eventually they get it.  The Department will say that a huge number of SNAs are being appointed overall but there may be something that should be looked at in that regard.  <\/p> <p>  On school transport, the Minister is meeting the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in the morning to discuss school transport issues specifically.  I have a question on school transport for people with additional needs.  Sometimes families or the school authorities may not have ticked the right box when the application was put in as to whether they want a transport grant or a taxi.  Sometimes the taxi does not work out.  People could go for a taxi but then have to revert because of complex needs or because of a number of issues.  There should be a bit of flexibility and some kind of cooling-off period or trial period that would give the option to either go A or B after a period of two, three or four weeks or whatever is deemed appropriate.  That has to be done.  There is no question or doubt but that a huge amount of work has been done in mainstreaming special education and in ensuring special classes.  There are very difficult, complex cases that continuously come to the committee's attention.  While the Department and everybody are trying to do the greater good, there should be accommodation when challenges are encountered.<\/p><p>I compliment the Minister on her recent visit to the excellent Holy Family Special School in Charleville.  She visited a number of schools but that school was the highlight of the day, as were the issues we dealt with.  I compliment her specifically on that as we talked about special education.<\/p><p> I ask the Minister to address the issues of the appeal mechanism for special needs assistants and the need for a little flexibility on transport for children with additional needs.  On the overall issue of transport, where there are priorities at present, people with additional needs should get concessionary tickets, if they are available or if there is a lottery for them.  There is a mechanism for that.  Again, the situation is ever evolving and new information is coming on a daily basis, from society and the Department.  Special education will have to keep evolving to meet the needs as we go forward.  The Minister has alluded to that in a number of her contributions.  I thank the Minister and ask her to address those few questions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022092000002#K00900","speaker":"1456","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663628400,"counter":530,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair.

There is always further scope in future but it simplified the process this year.
