The Chief Whip did not even have the basic courtesy to ring our Whip to discuss the proposal.<\/p>  <p>  In the D&aacute;il yesterday, I asked the Taoiseach to outline details of the proposed sale of Aer Lingus.  He steadfastly refused to provide me with any information, despite the extensive briefing of the media and trade unions that has taken place.  Late yesterday evening, at about 9 p.m., it was revealed that Aer Lingus is to be sold.  It is all about orchestration of news media, news management and an absolute contempt for the D&aacute;il.  The Government Whip should be proposing to refer this matter to the transport committee, where witnesses should be called and a proper analysis undertaken of whether this deal is in the best interests of the country.  The Government has spent months behind the scenes, behind closed doors, working on this deal.  Perhaps it was delayed until now because of the by-election or other electoral considerations, but it is entirely unsatisfactory that notice should be circulated to Members late at night, at the 11th hour, to announce a change to the scheduling of D&aacute;il business the following day at 9.30 a.m.  It was a kind of slippery, sleeveen approach to orchestrating the business of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700003#A00500","speaker":"992"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1432715400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1432715400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Order, please.

That is set out in the NIRAS report, but we have had no briefing on that report.  From my understanding, it is an analysis that is clearly focused on making Aer Lingus a low-cost airline.  It identifies that all ground-based operations, administration and staff costs in Aer Lingus are 40% higher than at Vueling or EasyJet.  It talks about the outsourcing of all ground-based operations.  There is no cost comparison with British Airways, for example, or other airlines at that level.

I am aware that staff salaries make up the greater proportion of costs and that an increase in capitation and subvention payments through the child care support programmes would assist providers to address this and other cost issues.<\/p>  <p>  I have indicated that if resources become available, I will review the scope for increasing the level of payments.  Any decisions in this regard will be informed by the recommendations of the interdepartmental group.<\/p>  <p>  As regards upskilling, my Department has provided support to early years professionals to meet new qualification requirements that I plan to introduce.  Under the Learner Fund, &euro;3 million was allocated in 2014 and 2015 to almost 2,500 early years professionals who have or are currently in the process of upskilling.<\/p>  <p>  The objective of the Learner Fund is to ensure that all existing early years professionals are supported, so that they are in a position to continue to work in the sector when the new qualification requirements are in place.  When this is achieved, other measures can be considered which would further support the upskilling of the early years sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700009#G00700","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1432719000,"counter":312,"content":"<p>At a recent meeting of the Committee on Health and Children, a representative from a children's advocacy organisation stated that during the course of their research on the quality of child care in this State, one woman commented that she earned more in her local chipper than she did in her role as a child care worker.  It was pointed out that it was common for workers to subsidise their child care wages with income from a second job.<\/p>  <p>  We know that most child care workers are not entitled to sick pay and teachers delivering the ECCE scheme are forced to go on the dole for the summer months.

Many have commented that, as a result, the quality is being bled out of child care.<\/p>  <p>  Pay rates for child care workers in Ireland are extremely low.  Hourly pay rates vary from &euro;9.27 per for four years' experience up to &euro;10.03 for ten years' experience.

The Aer Lingus Act 2004 contains a provision stipulating that the Minister for Finance may not dispose of any shares in the company without the general principles of the disposal being laid before and approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  A document setting out the general principles was laid before the House earlier this week.<\/p> <p> At the outset of this debate I pay tribute to Aer Lingus and to its management and staff.  I want to recognise the contribution Aer Lingus has made to Ireland and to emphasise that I see the IAG proposal as an opportunity to ensure this company has the opportunity to continue to grow, to develop and become stronger.  As a country, we are proud of the fact that Aer Lingus is one of the oldest airlines in the world still operating today.  It was one of the first State companies established by the newly independent State in 1936.  It pre\u00addates the likes of CIE, and Bord na M&oacute;na.  The decision to establish Aer Lingus was more than just the setting up of an airline.  It was an expression to the rest of the world of the optimism and openness of a fledgling country finding its wings.  More than 75 years later, that recognition of its heritage, its importance, its contribution and its potential holds true for this country and this generation.  Since its establishment Aer Lingus has served and continues to serve the country well.  Aer Lingus and its employees have played a huge part in the development of the Irish aviation sector into the vibrant industry that it is today.  The Irish aviation sector is rightly recognised and respected around the world.  One of the great successes of Irish aviation policy over the past 30 years is that the two largest Irish airlines now have roughly 80% of the market in and out of the country.  In most countries the market is split more equally between domestic and foreign airlines.  The success of the Irish airlines means that the majority of people flying in and out of our country do so on an Irish aircraft.<\/p> <p> Alongside this recognition, I must emphasise three factors that have been decisive in my evaluation of the IAG proposal.  First, the airline industry is inherently cyclical and has been severely impacted in the past by a number of global shocks such as 9\/11 and the 2008 financial crisis.  The industry is currently in its fifth consecutive year of positive global airline profitability.  However, as a relatively small albeit currently well capitalised airline, Aer Lingus is dependent on the capacity decisions of its larger competitors and may be more vulnerable to future industry shocks or aggressive direct competition than the larger airlines.  Second, the European airline industry remains relatively fragmented compared to the USA.  Many of the European legacy carriers have been forced to implement significant restructuring plans in recent years.  This has also driven consolidation amongst European airlines with many formerly State-owned airlines either becoming part of larger groups or having failed.  I do not want to leave it to chance only to find that it is a forced decision in difficult times.  Third, Aer Lingus is no longer our national flag carrier.  That decision was taken nine years ago when 75% of the shareholding was sold.  Nor is the State the majority shareholder in the company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700010#H01000","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432720200,"counter":331,"content":"<p>The Minister's speech is in transit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700011#J00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1432720200,"counter":332,"content":"<p>We own a minority 25.1% shareholding and I want to use the opportunity now to maximise the benefit of that residual shareholding to put the company on a firm footing for the future while protecting key general national interests.  In reality, the State has little or no influence today in relation to the company although it can, with the support of others, prevent the disposal, if not the transfer, of the Heathrow slots.  I want to protect and strengthen that position.  I want to ensure that, in the national interest, we have guarantees over the use of the Heathrow slots in a time of transition.  I want to ensure the best opportunity for increased employment and growth in the company.  I want to ensure that Ireland's essential links to the global economy are enhanced.<\/p>  <p>  As background to the offer, I note that in 2012 the Government decided, in the context of the State asset disposal under the EU-IMF programme, that the State's 25.1% shareholding in Aer Lingus could be sold on terms and at a price that were satisfactory.  Subsequently in June 2012, Ryanair indicated its intention to make an all-cash offer of &euro;1.30 per share.  For a number of reasons, this was unacceptable to the Government.  No other bidder has emerged to date.  While initial proposals were rejected, the board of Aer Lingus indicated to IAG in January 2015 that it would be willing to recommend the financial terms of a proposal based around a share price of &euro;2.50.  An inter-departmental steering group, which was established when the Aer Lingus shareholding was included in the State asset disposal programme, was asked to review the potential sale.  The group was chaired by the Department of Transport Tourism and Sport and included representatives from the Department of Finance, the Department of Public Enterprise and Reform and NewEra.  NewERA engaged expert external financial advisers, Credit Suisse and IBI Corporate Finance, and legal advisers, McCann FitzGerald, to assist the steering group in its work.  The group has engaged in intensive work over the last few months and has recommended that the Government should accept the IAG offer.  I have been briefed by the group over the intervening period and have also had discussions with IAG directly.  All key stakeholders have been before the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.  I have also kept Government briefed on key developments.  Yesterday, 26 May, the Government decided to proceed with a sale subject to D&aacute;il approval of the general principles.<\/p>  <p>  The IAG board and the independent Aer Lingus directors have announced that they have reached agreement on the terms of a recommended cash offer to be made for Aer Lingus.  This involves a cash payment of &euro;2.50 per share and the payment of a cash dividend of 5 cent per share.  This latter element is payable in any event this coming Friday, 29 May 2015.  The offer will be subject to a number of conditions including the receipt of EU merger clearance of the transaction on terms satisfactory to IAG.  It also requires the passing of a number of Aer Lingus shareholder resolutions to approve the provision of the connectivity commitments to the State, the making of amendments to the Aer Lingus articles and the re-designation of one Aer Lingus share held by the Minister for Finance as a \"B\" Share.  All of these are necessary to implement the connectivity commitments offered by IAG.  It is also subject to the Minister for Finance accepting the offer, which condition IAG may not waive, and to Ryanair accepting the offer, which condition IAG may not waive unless Ryanair's shareholding is 5% or less.  I will come back to this point later.<\/p>  <p>  The process to date has taken time.  It should have.  We are dealing with a hugely significant matter.  Aer Lingus and its operations represent a significant and legitimate national interest.  Aer Lingus plays a key role with almost 45% of the airline seats at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports on Aer Lingus flights.  It also supports significant numbers of jobs and is in the top 50 of Irish employers.  I recognise the intrinsic value that Aer Lingus brings to the Irish economy.  I recognise the importance of ensuring it has a viable future.  I recognise the benefit and, indeed, the need to set it on a route to continued growth.  The proposed merger with IAG provides the best opportunity to meet these objectives, which is a credit to the company's management and staff.  However, I must emphasise that across Europe many formerly State owned airlines including Cyprus Airways, Malev, and Hungarian Airlines have now failed.  While a number of European airlines remain under State control, some are undergoing significant restructuring or are open to potential disposal.<\/p><p>In fact, Finnair and the Portuguese airline TAP are the only other examples of a national, small independent carrier competing against generally larger companies.  The Aer Lingus board and chief executive have clearly recognised and stated publicly that the IAG proposal presents the company's best opportunity to do so and reduce risk.  I have to balance this against the limited role the State has now where, acting with others, it can prevent slot disposal but not use of these slots.  I want to take the opportunity to strengthen this role while placing the company in a better position to compete.<\/p> <p> The factors that the Government would take into account in considering any sale of its shareholding were clearly outlined at the outset.  In addition to price, other issues that were identified were the potential impact of a sale on connectivity including transatlantic connectivity.  We have also had regard to competition in the air transport market.  Employment issues generally and jobs in Irish aviation were particularly important as was the future of the Aer Lingus brand.  I will have regard to each of each of these aspects in outlining my rationale for this disposal.  <\/p> <p> There is one other aspect that I want to mention.  Government aviation policy is based on competition between at least two airlines with significant home bases in the Irish market.  We are fortunate to have in Aer Lingus and Ryanair two very successful companies based in Ireland.  I recognise the outstanding achievement of Ryanair since its foundation and am proud to acknowledge its contribution not just in Ireland but also to the aviation sector and customers across Europe.  However, given our status and the importance of connectivity, it has consistently been the Government's position that Ryanair should dispose of its shareholding in Aer Lingus.  The Government would not wish to see Ryanair remain as a significant minority shareholder in Aer Lingus following a takeover by IAG.  For this reason, we welcome the fact that the IAG offer will be conditional on Ryanair accepting the offer and it will not be possible to waive this condition unless Ryanair's shareholding is less than 5%.<\/p> <p> I now want to turn to the issue of connectivity and the impact that the sale of the State's shareholding in Aer Lingus will have in this regard.  I am convinced that a merger with IAG provides an excellent opportunity to strengthen Aer Lingus, to protect its brand and to enable it to grow and succeed as a commercial entity.  However, in selling the State's shareholding in the airline there are other national interests that have been taken into account in reaching a decision.  Primary to this is the question of connectivity and connectivity through Heathrow.  Sometimes the depth of concern here is not always appreciated.  It does not arise because of a fundamental disbelief in the commercial viability of these routes.  It does not arise from a fear that our airports cannot deliver these services.  It arises because right now, connection through Heathrow is a significant national interest.  <\/p> <p> Heathrow is the most significant destination airport from Dublin.  It accounts for approximately 8% of air transport seats by destination.  In comparison, the next largest hub airports from Dublin are Paris and Amsterdam, which account for about 3% and 2% of air transport seats respectively.  The Heathrow route accounts for just under 20% of passengers at Cork Airport and nearly one quarter at Shannon.  Heathrow is the UK's only airport with the requisite size and scale to deliver a comprehensive service to long-haul destinations across the globe.  In 2013, it provided access to 180 destinations in 85 countries while being serviced by 82 airlines.  The high level of frequencies of connecting flights from Dublin, Cork and Shannon helps passengers achieve attractive, time-minimising connectivity options.  These are essential to our interests.<\/p> <p> The commitments secured in our negotiation with IAG retain the protection that has been available for the last nine years and provides assurances for the coming seven years.  On slot disposal, the Government can at present, with its existing shareholding plus 5% from others, prevent the disposal of slots.  Under the new arrangements, the Minister for Finance in consultation with my Department would have that ability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700011#J00300","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432720800,"counter":334,"content":"<p>That is not possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700012#K00200","speaker":"1178"},{"type":"speech","time":1432720800,"counter":335,"content":"<p>Furthermore, in the new proposal commitments that are being given for at least seven years post-acquisition, all Aer Lingus's current winter and summer daily scheduled frequencies on routes between Heathrow and each of Dublin, Cork and Shannon will be maintained.  In addition, all of Aer Lingus's other London Heathrow slots will be operated on routes to and from Ireland in the first five years.  These are guarantees we do not have at present.<\/p>  <p>  I should also mention that under the proposal, the Aer Lingus group will not change its name and Aer Lingus will operate all its scheduled international air transport services under the Aer Lingus name.  Aer Lingus will also maintain its head office in Ireland.  Again, these improve the protections currently in place.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to draw to the attention of the D&aacute;il that, in addition to these commitments, IAG has confirmed, as outlined in the formal announcement, that for the 2016 summer season two new transatlantic destinations can be added and that by 2020 four transatlantic routes will be in place, delivering up to 2.4 million additional passengers.  This will enable Ireland to become an important hub for European traffic across the Atlantic.  As part of the north Atlantic Joint Business with American Airlines, Iberia, British Airways and Finnair, Aer Lingus will benefit directly from the sales and marketing of the bigger group, in particular in the United States.  In addition, Aer Lingus's planned long haul growth would benefit from being part of lAG's global cargo network and customer loyalty unit, Avios.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to the benefits of the deal for other airports, IAG plans to sustain and grow business at Cork, Shannon and Ireland West Airport Knock and have, in particular, referenced the Cork-Amsterdam and Cork-Paris routes, the transatlantic routes from Shannon and the Knock-London route.  For example, IAG has a strong presence in Paris with 56 daily flights, 45,000 active frequent flyer members and a strong sales force.  I am assured that growth opportunities with tourism and business interests in the Munster region will be pursued to exploit the potential that exists in all the short haul routes currently operated by Aer Lingus from Cork.  Aer Lingus has indicated that a combination with IAG would also underpin a new Cork-Germany service, which will be announced shortly.<\/p>  <p>  In Shannon, in the context of sustaining and growing its business, IAG will consider options, including Aer Lingus codeshare and accepting customers originating from Shannon, that could enhance existing all-business British Airways two daily services from Heathrow to JFK via Shannon.  The Aer Lingus Shannon flights to Boston and New York are expected to be strengthened as a result of the company becoming part of the North Atlantic Joint Business.  Aer Lingus support for existing American Airlines flights to Philadelphia will provide opportunities for additional capacity and increased connectivity to the US.  In addition to the Gatwick route becoming more sustainable, Aer Lingus will also actively work with Knock airport to explore new growth opportunities that will be available as part of the IAG group.<\/p>  <p>  I want to assure the House that IAG has confirmed that existing employment rights of the employees of Aer Lingus will be fully safeguarded upon completion of the offer.  It has also confirmed that it endorses Aer Lingus statements that it will honour its collective agreements and is prepared to confirm that it will re-register existing registered employment agreements, REAs, under the new legislative framework when it is introduced.  The chief executive of Aer Lingus confirmed Aer Lingus's position on REAs in a letter to me yesterday, indicating that Aer Lingus considers that having clear registered employment agreements that safeguard the respective interests of employees and the company is mutually beneficial.  In addition, Aer Lingus has committed to expanding the scope of REAs, where appropriate, to include staff groups not covered by the current agreements.  The letter also indicates that Aer Lingus will engage in a process of consultation governed by agreed structures with staff and its representatives when any restructuring is required and that it does not foresee a likelihood of either compulsory redundancy or non-direct employment.<\/p><p>This, together with the expected increase in direct employment in Aer Lingus as a result of this deal, is a very compelling proposition and a significant improvement on what is now there.  International Airlines Group has also stated clearly that under its ownership there will be significant job opportunities in the Aer Lingus business.  In the coming year alone the assessment is that there will be net employment growth of approximately 150 jobs in Aer Lingus.  By 2020, growth in Aer Lingus could lead to the creation of up to 635 new highly skilled jobs, including over 400 pilots, as well as engineers and ground staff.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700012#K00300","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432721400,"counter":337,"content":"<p>Good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700013#L00200","speaker":"1178"},{"type":"speech","time":1432721400,"counter":338,"content":"<p>I want to address each of the principles contained in the D&aacute;il resolution.

This is to facilitate the retention of one share which would be redesignated as a B share in Aer Lingus, as detailed in the announcement.  The rights attached to this B share would be enshrined in the Aer Lingus articles and allow the Minister for Finance, in consultation with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, to object to any proposed disposal of Heathrow Airport slots, any proposed cessation of the operation of Aer Lingus Heathrow Airport slots on certain Irish routes for a specified future period and any proposed change of the Aer Lingus company name, brand, head office location or place of incorporation outside Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700013#L00300","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1432721400,"counter":339,"content":"<p>That is nonsense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700013#L00400","speaker":"1178"},{"type":"speech","time":1432721400,"counter":340,"content":"<p>As the B shareholder, the Minister for Finance would have no rights to dividends or votes at general meetings.<\/p>  <p>  The steering group has received detailed financial advice from its advisers on the question of price.  The financial advisers have considered a range of valuation methodologies which they consider to be relevant.  The steering group has concluded that a price of &euro;2.50 is acceptable.  The D&aacute;il is being asked to approve in principle the disposal of the shares for a cash payment of at least &euro;2.50 per share, payable on completion of the transaction.  The proposed offer also refers to the payment by Aer Lingus of a cash dividend of 5 cent per share.  The dividend will be paid on 29 May to Aer Lingus shareholders on the Aer Lingus share register on 1 May.  Obviously, this is payable, irrespective of whether the proposed offer proceeds.<\/p>  <p>  Price has been an important but not an exclusive consideration in the State's evaluation of the proposal.  It would generate proceeds for the State of approximately &euro;335 million.  It represents a premium on the share price on the day prior to the announcement of lAG's initial approach and the Aer Lingus initial public offering price of &euro;2.20 in 2006.  Prior to the IAG approach, the Aer Lingus share price had not traded at this level since late 2007.  The board of Aer Lingus has publicly stated the financial terms of the proposal are at a level which it would be willing to recommend to its shareholders.<\/p>  <p>  It is a principle of the proposed sale that the Minister for Finance's acceptance of the offer will be on the basis that the legally binding commitments agreed by IAG and detailed in the announcement are conferred on the State as the holder of a B share in Aer Lingus.  This was a significant area of negotiation.  In essence, the commitment is that the existing Aer Lingus winter and summer daily scheduled frequencies to Heathrow Airport from Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports would be maintained for a period of seven years from completion of the transaction, the final two years of this period being subject to a condition that airport charges at these airports would remain at or below 2014 levels, adjusted for inflation.  Furthermore, for the first five years Aer Lingus would operate the remainder of its slots on routes between these or other airports on the island of Ireland.  Furthermore, lAG's proposed offer includes a legally binding commitment that the Minister for Finance would be entitled to block a proposal by Aer Lingus to change the company name, brand, head office location and place of incorporation from Ireland.  This is unlimited in time and provides protection that is not currently provided.<\/p>  <p>  If IAG proceeds to make a formal offer, the impact on competition will be subject to review by the European Commission under the EU merger regulation.  While we believe no significant adverse impact on existing competition is likely to arise, given the relatively limited overlap of existing route networks, we cannot prejudge the Commission's review.  If, as part of that review, IAG is required to offer remedies that are unacceptable to the Minister for Finance, the principles of the disposal recognise our right not to proceed with a sale in these circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue that the Government considered was the potential use of the proceeds of any sale of the State's shareholding.  The Government has agreed that the proceeds should be used to establish a new connectivity fund as part of the Ireland strategic investment fund.  The Minister for Finance will seek the approval of the Oireachtas in due course for the payment of the proceeds of any sale of the State's shareholding into this fund in accordance with section 46(2) of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014 should the sale proceed.<\/p>  <p>  The chief executive of Aer Lingus has confirmed to me that the strong expressed preference of Aer Lingus is to utilise direct labour wherever efficient and effective.  In addition, the company's clearly demonstrated preference and practice for many years to restructure only in a manner as required and so as to avoid compulsory redundancies is noted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700013#L00500","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1432721400,"counter":341,"content":"<p>That is pathetic.

It has been Ireland's flag carrier State airline and served the country well.  As a private company in the past nine years, it has flourished and grown in the face of stiff competition.  However, as a small carrier competing against larger companies in a changing European environment, it faces difficult challenges and risks.  Its board and senior management recognise this and see IAG's proposal as a means to address it and enhance the company's opportunities to grow and develop.  It can do so and as part of IAG.  The Government believes a sale of the State's shareholding on the basis of the IAG proposal is the right decision in the interests of the country and the company.<\/p>  <p>  I will conclude with five key reasons we should do so.  First, it would strengthen the competitive position of Aer Lingus.  It would reduce risk the company faces.  It would provide the company with an opportunity within a larger group to grow and face challenges in a changing aviation environment.  Second, it would give greater certainty around connectivity with Heathrow Airport.  It would strengthen the guarantees we have around the disposal of slots and, furthermore, provide new guarantees around slot use for at least seven years.  Third, it would promote Ireland's wider connectivity and bring growth to our airports.  It is anticipated this move would bring benefits to the Aer Lingus long-haul and short-haul networks with IAG.  There would be a focus on sustaining and growing routes from Dublin, Cork, Shannon and Knock airports.  The fourth reason relates to the reason it would create employment.  It is envisaged that by the end of 2016, 150 new net jobs would be created in Aer Lingus, rising to a total of 635 new net jobs by 2020.  Fifth, it would protect the Aer Lingus brand and keeps its head office in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Under the terms of the deal, Aer Lingus Group plc will not change its name and Aer Lingus will operate all scheduled international air transport services under the Aer Lingus name.  Aer Lingus will maintain its head office in Ireland.  We are seeking the approval of the House to proceed to do so on the basis of the principles I have laid before Members and which have been presented today.  In the interests of the company and the country I call on Members to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700013#L01200","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"speech","time":1432722000,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and thank him for beginning a process of informing us about this particular deal.  My party and I are deeply disappointed that the Government did not afford the transport committee an opportunity to engage with it, the Department and the various stakeholders in order to discuss the background and details of this deal.  Deputy O'Mahony, as Chairman of the transport committee, has performed his function to date in an independent and transparent way and sought to add to the discourse on the decision the Government is ultimately taking.  He will be disappointed that the committee was not given an opportunity to parse the finer details of this deal so that Members of the House could take a collective view rather than having the Minister present Members with some of the more positive and salient points of the deal but little about the associated risks.  There has been a lot of talk in the past couple of days from those on the Government side of the House and others regarding the previous decision to sell 75% of the company.  On that occasion, the transport committee was afforded an opportunity to debate the matter in detail.<\/p>  <p>  For the life of me, I cannot understand the haste with which the Government is moving, considering that it has had six months to address the overall offer.  I cannot see the necessity to have the debate over the next two days and have a vote on it on Thursday, before we leave.  The House is not sitting next week.  Next week could be used well by the transport committee to go through the matter in detail.  It has shown the capacity over recent months to meet at short notice and on days the House is not sitting in an effort to add to the broader debate and afford a better understanding to the people whom we represent as to why we take decisions.  The approach shows what the Government thinks of the commitments it made in regard to transparency and affording the House an opportunity to exercise the mandate its Members were given, particularly regarding the teasing through of important decisions and the discussion of legislation.  In saying this, I am not attacking the Minister personally.<\/p>  <p>  It is often said that our Parliament is weak by comparison with others across Europe.  In the Minister's previous role as Minister of State responsible for European affairs, he will be well briefed and will understand that many parliaments operate really effectively because they show regard for their individual members by giving them a say in decisions that are taken and by allowing them to analyse in detail the background to the decisions that must be taken.  More often than not, they make mature decisions.  The Government, comprising Fine Gael and the Labour Party, talked a lot about a revolution in the way in which it would do business.  Today, that revolution is on its knees.  Sadly, we are not allowing this Parliament the kind of input I believe is important in this debate.<\/p>  <p>  From the very start, I could never really get my head around the necessity, from the Minister's perspective, to sell the remaining 25% stake.  A decision was taken in 2006 to change Aer Lingus's semi-State status and trade it publicly, thereby ensuring it would be run on a commercial basis in the best interest of all, including workers, passengers and the country.  I supported the decision and believed it was correct.  One aspect of the decision was to retain a 25% shareholding in the company for strategic interests.  From where I am looking at the matter, granted without the benefit of all the information the Minister has, I do not believe the State has any less of a strategic interest in the airline than it had back in 2006.  For the life of me, I cannot understand how the Government has failed to realise the importance of retaining the shareholding and having control, although not absolute control, over the direction of the company, or an input into it.  The Minister now tells us the State will have a B share, one share, and that this will somehow have attached to it all the rights, responsibilities and benefits as obtained previously, with the exception of profit and voting rights.  If that is the case, I am somewhat amused that IAG would want to purchase the 25% that the Minister is selling.  What benefit will it ultimately derive if the State still retains all that control?<\/p>  <p>  The company was performing exceptionally well as an independent company, which really underpins the view that the right decision was taken in 2006.  Since then, passenger numbers have grown from 7 million to 11 million, as the Minister knows.  Aer Lingus has developed important access to the north of England and has managed to develop business there and take passengers through the hub in Dublin.  In addition to seeing a growth in passenger numbers, the company's costs have been reduced significantly.  It is now a much leaner and fitter independent entity and is able to take on the challenges the Minister talks about.  It is well capitalised and profitable.<\/p>  <p>  Some years ago, Ryanair and easyJet would have had passenger numbers of 11 million.  Their respective figures are now 100 million and 60 million.  Through strategic alliances and various other corporate tie-ups, there is no reason Aer Lingus could not be such an entity.  While the Minister talks about possible difficult periods ahead in the aviation sector, he should realise those threats have always existed.  Other airlines have survived.  Therefore, I cannot understand the necessity to proceed with the deal at this time.<\/p>  <p>  The current growth trajectory of the company is such that remaining an independent carrier would not be the tragedy some proponents of this deal have depicted.  As I stated, the company carried up to 11.1 million passengers last year.  In 2014, revenue was up 9%, and there was an operating profit of &euro;71 million.  I accept that is attributable to the efforts of the staff, management and chief executive of the company.<\/p>  <p>  Aer Lingus has successfully emerged from the worst financial crisis in the history of this State, or one of the deepest in the OECD, as a lean and growth-oriented company with very significant cash reserves to take on the kinds of challenges that arise.  Any company facing a difficult trading period would love to find itself with the balance sheet, growth strategy and cost base of Aer Lingus.  Over recent years, Aer Lingus's passenger numbers have grown remarkably.  Perhaps the growth has something to do with IAG's interest, particularly because Aer Lingus's growth is concentrated on the north of England.  This has effectively highlighted the weakness of British Airways' approach to the regions.  Senator Sean Barrett has made much of the fact that the entire north of England and Scotland have no direct access to the United States, even though British Airways is the dominant player in that market.  It has routed every flight through Heathrow.  There are some concerns that it may wish to do the same with Irish passengers.  Much has been made about the limited capacity at Heathrow but this has been the case since I entered public life and politics.  Despite the shortage of slot access, it always manages to squeeze an extra aircraft in and continues to grow successfully without the additional runway.  I am not so sure the bulk of the business involving direct flights from Ireland to the United States could not be pushed through if there were sufficient desire on the part of IAG or British Airways.  I have some concerns in that regard.  They are certainly not mollified by anything I have said here today.  I would have believed that, by remaining independent, Aer Lingus could do more than just survive over the longer term and could emerge as a very strong carrier in the region.<\/p>  <p>  I have never really got into the debate on the share price offered by IAG because, quite frankly, I took the view that it was the wrong decision and that the strategic interest of retaining a shareholding was principally the most important point we should consider.  However, now that the Minister has taken the decision, I will comment on this.  Twenty-four Heathrow&ndash;London landing slots are worth a possible &euro;400 million, depending on whom one is prepared to listen to.  Acquiring the slots will, as the Minister knows, give IAG 55% of all the slots at Heathrow, where space is at a premium.  There is a very real benefit to IAG in that regard.<\/p><p>The Minister talks about the guarantees and I will address them later in my contribution.  I am not as enthusiastic about those guarantees as the Minister seems to be.<\/p> <p> P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, who is an expert in this area having founded Aer Arann and is also a serial investor in a range of sectors, believes that the share price should be in excess of &euro;3, which would give the company a valuation of about &euro;1.7 billion.  However, the Minister seems to accept that what is on offer at the moment, namely, &euro;2.50 plus the 5% dividend which was already on its way to the Government, is adequate.  I do not believe that the takeover is better for the future of Aer Lingus as a company.  Aer Lingus has done a good job to date in competing with British Airways and other much larger rivals.  I understand that British Airways is trying to expand into the Irish market because it sees the lucrative business that is there as we emerge from recession.  It is not out-competing its Irish rivals.  It is attempting to buy in.  This is very much as a result of the very strong presence of Aer Lingus in the north of England routing passengers through Dublin onwards to the US.  <\/p> <p> The reality is that Ryanair and easyJet are two very considerable airlines.  In fact, they are bigger than British Airways in terms of passenger numbers.  This demonstrates to me that if another option was put forward by the Government as a strong shareholder, we could see the retention of an independent airline with a strategic tie up with somebody like IAG or somebody else.  IAG has a strategic partnership with American Airlines that works really well.  It talked about how that has worked in some of its statements to the stock exchange last night.  There is no reason the same could not have been done here.  <\/p> <p> I believe the takeover deal is anti-competitive and bad for consumers.  Virgin Atlantic seems to be of the same view and has expressed its position.  I understand it is in the process of lodging a complaint with the EU competition authority.  Virgin Atlantic appeared before the Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications and set out very clearly how it believes a tie up between British Airways and Aer Lingus would limit the product offering to Irish consumers travelling to the US.  I have not heard the Minister or Government address this issue at any point.  The trend in the aviation sector is toward consolidation.  I believe this is anti-competitive and bad for the consumer.  These trends have come and gone.  We have previously seen consolidation in the aviation sector.  Large companies emerge, enter financial difficulty and sell off bits and pieces of the company at a later stage.  Consolidation and fragmentation of corporations throughout history has been cyclical.  We may be going through a phase of consolidation but as sure as night follows day and boom and bust or turnaround occur in economies, we will see fragmentation at some point.  It is not clear how Aer Lingus will fare when the fragmentation happens within that larger group and the shareholders want to release the value that has been built up over time.  This is a real concern and I remain to be convinced that the Government's approach is in the long-term interest, particularly because of our status as an island nation and the need to retain that strategic carrier.  It is a fact that while a smaller number of large airlines in a market might increase net margins for airlines, it reduces competition, increases fares and makes it more difficult for new airlines to enter the market.  It takes fragmentation at a later stage to address that and it is not clear how or in what form Aer Lingus would emerge from that.  <\/p> <p> Regional connectivity is the one area about which I have had the greatest concerns from the start having seen the difficulties that emerged when Aer Lingus decided to re-allocate slots to Heathrow from Shannon to Belfast in August 2007.  I saw the impact this had on companies and tourism interests in the region and the damage it did to efforts to attract and maintain foreign investment in the region.  This is where I have always seen the limitations of the 25% shareholding.  At the time, the fact that the State had public interest directors or was in a position to appoint them after that, had a presence in the boardroom and over time was able to change the articles of association so that a decision like that became a board decision rather than a management decision and the retention of that shareholding allowed for the reversal of that decision.  That was a good decision and the right decision.  <\/p> <p> The Minister has put a lot of stock in the fact that individual airports have welcomed this decision.  He is joined by some of his departmental advisers today and they will have a knowledge of all of this.  The reason the management of Aer Lingus moved the slots from Shannon to Belfast in 2007 was because the then management of the airport decided to give sweetheart deals to Ryanair, much to the annoyance of the management of Aer Lingus.  The airport treated the management of Aer Lingus poorly and as a result, it left.  The approach that was taken in Shannon at the time was largely responsible for the removal of those slots so to some extent, I must take the Minister's acceptance of management's support for this with a grain of salt.  Management got it wrong in the past so there is no reason it is infallible on this move.  I would much prefer to see the State retaining its shareholding and having that input at board level, which resulted in the reversal of that management decision and has benefited everyone.  The same situation happens in Cork and the mid west.  There has been a significant amount of investment in that region involving IDA and Enterprise Ireland-supported businesses.  It is not just about passenger numbers.  There has been much discussion and effort relating only to the workers at the airport.  Yes, they are a hugely important component of this debate but there are people working in other enterprises and business and tourism interests in those regions who are completely dependent on the services operated through the airport.  One of the most important services is the access to Heathrow.  It is not just about the impact on workers at the airport.  The entire micro-economy of those regions could be fundamentally affected by any change to slot access to Heathrow.  This is why I remain unconvinced that this is in the best interests of the overall economy of this State or the regional balance that is so important to keep people living outside the city.  <\/p> <p> Of course, I am not surprised that Dublin Chamber of Commerce weighed in relatively quickly in support of this deal.  All along the way, Dublin Chamber of Commerce failed to reveal that Aer Lingus is a member and a very significant partner of Dublin Chamber of Commerce and Cork Chamber of Commerce so it has a significant say in the position of those chambers of commerce.  It is a conflict of interest.  Dublin Chamber of Commerce is presented as some kind of independent external adviser that sees all the benefits but it does so largely in the interests of a very significant member.  <\/p> <p> Very sizeable cities in the UK do not have a presence on the north Atlantic route.  I find it difficult to see anything in the cast-iron assurances that have been offered by IAG that would either stand up to legal challenge in the long run or would ultimately be enforceable over time.  While the Minister says that the Government has done a deal and managed to get from five to seven years, I do not believe that if an event occurred in the running of IAG or if it had some financial difficulties, it would not be in a position to move on.  If one looks at the document that was presented to the Stock Exchange - a document that does not seem to form any part of the Government's deliberations, it refers to cautionary statements regarding forward-looking statements.  Much of what the Minister has been talking about for the past day concerns the forward-looking aspect of this deal.  <\/p><p>Within this there are certain assumptions.  I wish to read the caution that forms part of the document:<blockquote>All forward-looking statements in this announcement made by the IAG Group are based upon information known to the IAG Group on the date of this announcement and all forward-looking statements in this announcement made by the Aer Lingus Group are based upon information known to the Aer Lingus Group on the date of this announcement.  In particular, statements are made in this announcement as to IAG&rsquo;s approach and plans for growth of Aer Lingus&rsquo; business, the addition of new destinations to Aer Lingus&rsquo; route network and to related implications for employment.  These statements are based on certain assumptions as to economic, business and operational conditions prevailing at the time Aer Lingus will decide to make the associated investment in new aircraft and additional employees.  In the event that these conditions are significantly different from the ones envisaged at the date hereof, IAG may need to make changes in its approach and plans.  Neither the IAG Group nor the Aer Lingus Group undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, save as may be required by law.<\/blockquote>That sets a very cautionary tone, which is a requirement under Stock Exchange rules.  That said, it is worth noting that the assurances, guarantees and the forward-looking statements on jobs and so forth could well be impacted on by any significant change that takes place.  I was struck yesterday by the backdrop to one of the Minister's press statements which almost looked like the set of &quot;Blue Peter&quot;.  The words &quot;jobs, strategic investment and guaranteed connectivity&quot; were writ large, as if someone was trying very hard to reinforce and sell this message.  I wondered what it was about.  It might just have been part of the Minister's public relations machinery, but it looked a little like an oversell and an over-spin of what was actually a complex transaction that would effectively reduce the State's interest in strategic infrastructure.  <br\/><br\/>In the time available I would like to ask the Minister some more questions about the so-called B share because certain issues are still not clear in that regard.  He spoke about the articles of association being changed to give a certain character to the share, setting out, effectively, what could and could not be done.  He went on to say the name of the company, the brand and the head office would not change, but what he did not say was whether the articles of association could or would change.  He said at one stage that as the B shareholder, the Minister for Finance would have no rights to dividends or to votes at general meetings.  If a decision was taken by the board to change the articles of association and it held a general meeting, is it possible that the articles of association that give the significant powers to the Minister through the B shareholding could effectively be wiped out or changed?  Is that a possibility?  Nothing the Minister has said so far helps me to understand the position in that regard.  <br\/><br\/>Some of the spin in advance of yesterday's announcement, largely provided for <i>The Irish Times,<\/i>suggested the Minister for Finance would have a veto.  Over the course of the day the veto appeared in the character of the B share.  The Minister is now informing the House and the language he has used is careful and concise.  There are about six or seven lines on the issue in his speech.  I am really concerned about the extent to which the B share can actually be used to do what the Minister has attested.  Can the conditions in which the B share will be held after the transaction takes place be changed?  Is it possible that at a future extraordinary general meeting or annual general meeting the articles of association could change, effectively wiping out the assurances given?  I ask the Minister to deal with this question.<br\/><br\/>On the period of five or seven years, I am not too sure about the character of these assurances because it is not clear how they will be guaranteed.  There has been talk about a legally binding agreement, but if one looks at the risks and the forward-looking statements, it is possible that other events could require the company to take a different direction.  It is possible that IAG could be subject to a takeover bid.  We know that Qatar Airways owns 10% of it.  Obviously, Qatar Airways, as constituted, would not be in a position to buy IAG because of certain EU rules, but it is not impossible to suggest some other company might buy it.  How will the assurances stand in the event that IAG is taken over in the medium term?  Will they remain?  The articles of association of IAG would surely change as time passed were that to happen.  <br\/><br\/>There is also a question about the assurances the Minister has given on jobs.  He has said Aer Lingus has stated that where restructuring is required, &quot;it does not foresee a likelihood of either compulsory redundancies or non-direct employment.&quot;  The phrase &quot;it does not foresee&quot; is rather weak.  The Minister is familiar with the Nyras report which was commissioned jointly by the boards of Aer Lingus and IAG in February this year to look at potential cost savings arising from the proposed merger.  It was paid for by both boards and involved a comparison of Aer Lingus with Easyjet and Vueling Airlines, two low-cost carriers.  It was made in order to see if Aer Lingus was out of kilter with these low-cost models and the report found that costs in Aer Lingus were about 40% higher.  Therefore, if IAG was to benefit from the consolidation of the two entities, it would have to reduce costs.  The report refers to outsourcing ground-based operations and the savings to be made in doing so under the heading of &quot;Cost Reduction Phase 1&quot;.  It estimated that savings of 20% could be made in ground handling operations, 40% in catering services, 15% in maintenance and 25% in heavy maintenance operations in moving operations to eastern Europe.  If any or all of this were to come to pass, there would be a very significant loss of direct jobs.  That is the only way the company would achieve such cost savings.  While the Minister has talked about registered employment agreements, I want to know if it is possible as a result of the takeover, notwithstanding what the chief executive has said in his communications with the Minister, the way in which ground handling, catering, maintenance and heavy maintenance services are provided could be changed to the extent that the cost savings identified in the report could be achieved.  The Minister will have to explain it to us more clearly.<br\/><br\/>I would also like the Minister to help us to understand another issue.  He probably cannot help us to understand where the Labour Party is because it seems its members have difficulty in understanding it themselves, but he might be able to help me to understand some statements made by the T&aacute;naiste in recent days.  When pressed about the cause of the delay in reaching a decision, she said there were some complicating factors.  She mentioned Ryanair in strangulated syntax that seemed to suggest the Government was somehow constrained in making a decision because it was going to be dependent on whatever Ryanair might do.  It seems from what the Minister has said, however, that he has had no communication with Ryanair and that the group concerned has had no communication with the company either.  I am sure it would be entirely wrong if the Minister had discussions with Ryanair on this issue.  In that context, I need to understand who briefed the T&aacute;naiste and what the complicating factor actually was in the case of Ryanair.  Perhaps the Minister does not know, but he might find out because it raises serious concerns.  It suggests the T&aacute;naiste had access to information on Ryanair's position and how it might complicate a decision the Minister might take.  My understanding, from the presentation Mr. Walsh made to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, is that the offer from IAG was an indicative one which was subject to confirmation in the event that both the Government and Ryanair acceded to the request for the purchase of shares, nothing more and nothing less.  How the T&aacute;naiste could believe Ryanair was involved in the Government's decision I do not know, but I hope the Minister will be able to help me on that issue.  <br\/><br\/>My party remains strongly opposed on the basis that we understand what it took to get Aer Lingus to the point where it could be a successful, independent entity by changing its character from a semi-State to a publicly traded company back in 2006.<\/p><p>However, we can see no logic in any of the documents produced by the Government or anybody else that would suggest now is the time to cast away the strategic interest the State has in an airline, notwithstanding the limitations of such shareholding.  Nonetheless, it is critical in retaining boardroom representation, which, of course, feeds into the strategic direction of the company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700014#M00100","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432723800,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I remind Deputy Dessie Ellis that he will be asked to adjourn the debate at noon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700017#P00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1432723800,"counter":353,"content":"<p>It is a little messy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700017#P00300","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speech","time":1432723800,"counter":354,"content":"<p>Under Standing Orders, Leaders' Questions will be taken at noon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700017#P00400","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1432723800,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I understand.<\/p><p>I object to this process, as we have not been furnished with proper documents.  My party leader made this objection this morning.  It was also agreed that this matter would come before the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications before a vote was taken or a decision made.  The Minister's colleagues and Labour Party Deputies agreed to the issue being discussed at the joint committee.<\/p><p>It is very sad that we have to express our opinions on what is a done deal that nobody outside of IAG and Fine Gael wants.  For one thing, it is utterly pointless and makes a mockery of democratic debate.  The Government has made its decision behind the closed doors in a shrewd media operation which shows blatant disregard for the Oireachtas and its role in dealing with issues of such importance.  No matter what anyone says, the Government will seek to sell its share in Aer Lingus and the weak and cowed Labour Party Members will go along with it.  This is a sham.<\/p><p>Labour Party Deputies really saw the Minister coming, but in reality they knew the Government would sell out and allow this deal.  That is why they raised concerns rather than express opposition.  They hoped they would get a deal which looked better.  To be fair, it does look better than what was previously offered, but it is still not the right thing to do and the Labour Party will be punished by the people for it.  Have they not yet realised that the spin is only working in Fine Gael's favour, while the Labour Party's subservience and silence are destroying it from the inside?  This is the wrong deal for Ireland and Labour Party Members know it, but they do not have the courage to act on that knowledge.  Fine Gael and IAG are as thick as thieves and Labour Party Members having been given the run-around are being trotted out to say how all of their concerns have been allayed.<\/p><p>Aer Lingus is worth infinitely more to Ireland than the &euro;335 million the Government will get for cashing in on the 25% Fianna F&aacute;il left the State with after its calamitous reign.  It ensures secure and consistent connectivity for Ireland, which is vital for any island but particularly a country that has attracted major multinational companies.  A country is only attractive for investment when it boasts the facilities that make doing business easy and secure.  For years Aer Lingus has made Ireland, at the far west of Europe and a vast ocean away from the United States, a place which can be reached without too much trouble or planning.  It also has a reputation as a quality airline, with high customer satisfaction, which promotes a positive image of Ireland across the world.  Irish people have taken and continue to take pride in Aer Lingus.  Thanks to Fine Gael's desire to sell out as many of the State&rsquo;s assets as possible and the Labour Party's pathetic subservience to it, Aer Lingus is facing into an uncertain seven years which very possibly will be its last, certainly as we know it.  It will also be a very uncertain time for the thousands of workers who make their living in Aer Lingus or peripheral to Aer Lingus&rsquo;s operations in Ireland.<\/p><p>The Government claims it has received assurances from IAG that it will not sell the Heathrow Airport slots, which was not a major concern owing to their strategic importance to the company.  It also claims to have received a commitment that the Aer Lingus slots will remain under the company's control for seven years.  On the face of it, that is a stay of execution which should have never been entered into, but behind it there is a major question about whether these assurances can be enforced or fulfilled.  We are talking about the international air travel industry which is subject to considerable oversight in terms of the rules by which companies operate, particularly rules which govern competition.  Do we really believe it is possible for the State in selling 25% of a company to hold a major multinational conglomerate to agreements in our interests for seven years and beyond?  IAG is not a charity which has been set up to provide connectivity and jobs on island nations.  It is a private for-profit operation with only two interests - its bottom line and its shareholders, of which Ireland is not one.  It does not care about the interests of Ireland, its people or the workers who make up the nearly 4,000 employees of Aer Lingus which would represent less than 5% of IAG staff worldwide.<\/p><p>Aer Lingus is a small but successful airline.  It weathered the storms of the downturn in air travel in the early 2000s and the economic collapse at the end of that decade.  It has shown resilience and served the people of the country well since the 1930s.  It has provided connectivity and good jobs.  Under this deal, sooner or later that will be a thing of the past and Aer Lingus, as we know it, will only be a memory.  It has remained such a company, despite privatisation, owing to the State's remaining share which has represented the interests of Ireland until now.<\/p><p>IAG has a track record that shows its interest is not in providing jobs or supporting the countries from which its airlines come.  When Iberia was privatised, it was a good employer.  It became part of IAG in 2011.  Less than one year later it announced that 4,500 jobs would be cut.  That is more than the entire staff of Aer Lingus.  This was done without batting an eyelid and IAG has carried on regardless making huge profits for its shareholders at the expense of the Spanish state which had to help the 4,500 workers to pick up the pieces.  Guarantees that a company will do this or that are only believable on the basis that its shareholders will argue for such a practice.  No one on IAG&rsquo;s board or among its shareholders will be arguing for the interests of Ireland.<\/p><p>I want to quote Mr. Willie Walsh, CEO of IAG, because he has frequently made clear what his intentions are for companies such as Aer Lingus that has vital slots at Heathrow Airport.  In an interview with <i>Flightglobal<\/i>, an industry website, he stated:<blockquote>It&rsquo;s no secret that we&rsquo;ve been interested in bmi, but largely because of its slot position at Heathrow rather than the brand.  Similarly, when I look at Virgin, what I see are slots at Heathrow...<br \/><br \/>Virgin hasn&rsquo;t got an exciting fleet.  What it has got are slots and a network at Heathrow, so if they conclude that what they&rsquo;re selling is, in effect, their slots at Heathrow, then we&rsquo;d be very interested.<\/blockquote>In an interview with <i>The Independent<\/i>last May he stated:<blockquote>Where the UK will lose out is that Heathrow will not be able to service the new, booming destinations in the developing markets of the Far East, Africa and Latin America.  We just won&rsquo;t have the slots at Heathrow.<\/blockquote>In the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>in February he was quoted as saying there would be some job losses if IAG were to buy Aer Lingus.  He has also tried to play down the importance of the Aer Lingus slots, knowing that the issue might cause problems for him and Fine Gael when a deal was being made.  In the same interview he said the high value of slots did not indicate their value in the future, which is rubbish.  As Heathrow Airport is now almost certain not to develop a third runway, slots are more valuable than ever.<\/p><p>The CEO of Aer Lingus who supports the deal and will be handsomely rewarded for his shares failed to play down the value of the Heathrow Airport slots when he admitted that they were worth nearly &euro;500 million alone.  This means that more than one third of the value IAG places on Aer Lingus is based on the slots at Heathrow Airport.<\/p><p>This clearly shows where IAG interests lie if the Government was fooled into thinking his hunger for slots extended only to Virgin.  These slots at Heathrow are crucial to the importance of Aer Lingus to Ireland.  They provide excellent connectivity with one of our main sources of trade, which is one of the major concerns, after job security, people have regarding this sell-off.  The Government will get just over &euro;300 million for its 25% stake, which is less than the value of the Aer Lingus Heathrow slots alone.  If IAG decide to sell Aer Lingus or to wind up the company who knows what will happen to these wafer thin assurances the Government is heralding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700017#P00500","speaker":"1022","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1432724400,"counter":357,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Leaders' Questions","time":1432724400,"counter":358,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700018#Q00250"},{"type":"speech","time":1432724400,"counter":359,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach must accept that his attitude to this House, in terms of the manner in which he has facilitated the debate here today on Aer Lingus, is one of contempt.

The Taoiseach has also withheld documentation from the D&aacute;il on this crucial strategic issue and said he has not read the Nyras report.  Once again, the Taoiseach has dealt with the D&aacute;il in an arrogant and unacceptable way.  He did the same thing, infamously, with the Irish Water issue and with IBRC.<\/p>  <p>  As we all know, Aer Lingus was a State company, built up over decades by Irish workers, taxpayers and citizens.  It is a key, strategic asset for this island nation, not just for the State but for the entire island, and is both profitable and successful.  However, this symbol of pride and national identity has been shamefully sabotaged by the current and the previous Government.  Despite the Taoiseach's protestations, what the Government is doing is finishing off Fianna F&aacute;il's work.<\/p>  <p>  The fundamental issue here is that control over a key national strategic asset is to be handed over, lock, stock and barrel, to a multinational and this company will always put the profits and interests of its shareholders and board members before the interests of the Irish economy, this State or our citizens.  Therefore, any assurances given by IAG about Aer Lingus should be given the same value as the 2011 election promises of Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  Once Aer Lingus is gone, it is gone.

It certainly is that.  It marks a new low in the behaviour of this Government in terms of its arrogance, undemocratic manoeuvring and contempt for this House that it would ram through in a matter of days strategic decisions about the future of an almost 80 year old company that has employed tens of thousands of people and has been key to the strategic development of this country.<\/p>  <p>  I am very conscious that thousands of my colleagues in Aer Lingus in Dublin, Cork and Shannon, and their families, are looking at this debate.  I am conscious of the 15,000 members of the pension scheme who can now draw no conclusion other than that the manoeuvres around that scheme were part of a deal to get this out of the way so the Government could get what it wanted all along.<\/p>  <p>  I want to look at where the impetus for this takeover came from because this is a profitable company, even throughout the years of the economic crisis.  It is a company with a confirmed delivery for nine new long haul aircraft.  It is a company with cash reserves of almost &euro;1 billion.  Let us be clear.  The driver of the IAG bid is not what is in the best interests of the Irish nation, the workers or the passengers.  The driver of the IAG bid is the commercial interests of the British, European and Middle Eastern shareholders who own IAG, and that will be the driver of their involvement if they get hold of it.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach is proposing to give them ownership of that for &euro;1.3 billion.  This is a company with cash reserves of &euro;1 billion and Heathrow slots worth more than &euro;0.5 billion, not to mention the property, the brand and the product.  It is an outrage that we would be sitting here discussing this sale.  The Taoiseach talked about positives.  Many of those positives were already in place.  For the Taoiseach to say that the undoubted negative consequences will not happen is pathetic.<\/p>  <p>  My questions to the Taoiseach are as follows.  How, in God's name, can he come in here and say that the so-called concessions he got can stand up to any scrutiny - his \"B\" share?  He proposes that Aer Lingus would be a captive subsidiary in IAG.  What is to stop it using it for itself or leasing it back to IAG?  It is rubbish.  <\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach said there are guarantees for workers.  The chief executive officer of Aer Lingus, who stands to benefit handsomely from this sale, says he does not foresee any redundancies in the future.  I am sorry but I do not take any comfort from that statement and I do not believe a group of workers, who previously were given what they were told were legally binding letters of comfort which did not stand up, will take any comfort from it either.  Can the Taoiseach explain to us how these guarantees are somehow different?  Crucially, what is the big hurry?  The Government was waiting on this for months.  Is it that the Taoiseach is afraid his Labour backbenchers will not able to withstand the pressure from the workers and the pensioners who are enraged by this sale?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700020#S02400","speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1432725600,"counter":422,"content":"<p>The position is that when the offer came initially it was not acceptable to Government.  There was a good deal of discussion with the companies and the Department, and a move to strengthen what was the original offer.  The Government has considered this very carefully.  It is about the potential to grow the airline, grow connectivity and grow jobs.  That is why the plan that is now set out sees an increase of nearly 2.5 million passengers and 635 new jobs in Aer Lingus.  That will create further employment in a wider economy in terms of pilots, engineers and airline staff, and in the tourism industry as part of the strategy now unfolding nationally to grow tourism by serious amounts in the next ten years.  There will be four new routes to North America by 2020.  The impact of that will be very significant.  The Cork-Paris and Cork-Amsterdam routes will be maintained and promoted.  IAG will pursue those growth opportunities for Aer Lingus services from Cork.  The Shannon-New York and Shannon-Boston routes will be maintained, and IAG plans to grow transatlantic services from Shannon.  One only has to talk to any of the passengers who fly to the United States from either Dublin or Shannon.  We have seen the numbers who have come from other locations around Europe because of the importance and the convenience of pre-clearance.  This holds significant potential for the future.<\/p>  <p>  In connecting from Gatwick with Aer Lingus, Knock Airport will have the opportunity now to connect into the IAG hub, with 60 other routes.  As part of its drive, in terms of the Wild Atlantic Way, that is a real opportunity from a tourism and business perspective.  It is also expected that Aer Lingus's cargo capacity will have increased by 50% by 2020.<\/p>  <p>  There have been three hostile bids in the past in respect of Aer Lingus.  There is nothing to suggest that there would not be others in the future.  The difference is that the Government, on behalf of the people, now has an influence over the connectivity, the sale and the disposal of slots from Heathrow to Ireland in that these will continue with certainty in the time ahead, which was not the case before yesterday.  That is a fundamentally important element of the growth.<\/p>  <p>  The transfer of the share to the Minister in the articles of association and the legally binding guarantee and veto by him on behalf of the people in respect of the slot disposal or slot change is a very important and stronger improvement on what was in place previously.<\/p><p>The pension scheme the Deputy mentioned has been very complex for many years and is not part of this proposal.  I have had contact with people who have been involved in the pension scheme and with the very many Members who were also involved.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has spent a very considerable amount of time during the past 18 months trying to deal with the very complex situation.

I assume the reason he has not done it this time is that he could not be bothered to give us the respect of answering.  The Taoiseach has not addressed a single issue we raised.  Many of the positives he outlined about the airline are already in train and are irrelevant to whether or not IAG takes over.  The question of who will benefit from the business development, profitability and growth is not irrelevant.  We already have an airline that is growing and that takes 1 million passengers from UK regional airports and transits them to the US through Dublin.  That would be a nice business for a Middle Eastern, European or British shareholder who has no particular interest in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach referred to future jobs.  In an airline which had already pre-ordered nine new aircraft, new pilots and cabin crew were inevitable.  The Taoiseach has been silent on the reality that outsourcing and redundancies of ground staff is practically inevitable in this scenario.  Where are the guarantees for the workers?  The Taoiseach has not given any, nor do I expect him to, given that he is a neo-liberal leader of a neo-liberal party.  That what he stands for.  That is his record and fair play to him.  However, there was a time when the people in the Labour Party said they stood for something different.  The cheek of these people saying they would give commitments to airport pensioners, that if this deal went through the pensioners' livelihoods would be protected, that they would put the proceeds in a fund to secure their future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700021#T00200","speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1432726200,"counter":425,"content":"<p>The Labour Party's values have gone out the window.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700021#T00300","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1432726200,"counter":426,"content":"<p>Frankfurt's way or Labour's way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700021#T00400","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1432726200,"counter":427,"content":"<p>Where is the money going in to secure their future now?

There are four outstanding reports from the Constitutional Convention that have yet to be debated in the D&aacute;il.  The Government is in clear breach of the timetable it set for them.  Today we were to have a debate on voting rights, but that matter has been put off.  In March the Taoiseach told me that all of these matters had been completed by the relevant Departments.  Given the overwhelming vote last Friday, including the number of people who had travelled home to vote, will he now move to implement the proposal of the Constitutional Convention that voting rights in presidential elections be extended to citizens living outside the State, including in the North?<\/p>  <p>  While the Taoiseach has probably not heard this, the English Queen in her speech a short time ago confirmed the British Government's plans to bring forward proposals for a British Bill of Rights which would displace the European Convention on Human Rights and repeal the Human Rights Act.  The programme for Government stated the Government was entirely committed to full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  The measure the British Government has noted today as being due to be brought forward will breach the structure of the Agreement.  In addition, the in-out referendum on Britain's membership of the Europeand Union which was also announced today will cause profound difficulties for people living on this island.  Any lessening of human rights law, especially the repeal of the Human Rights Act, will undermine an agreement which is an international treaty and of which the Taoiseach is co-equal guarantor.  I am asking the Taoiseach to make clear the Government's opposition to any repeal of the Human Rights Act when he meets the British Prime Minister next month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700023#V01400","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1432727400,"counter":556,"content":"<p>As I said yesterday, I am due to meet the British Prime Minister before the next European Council meeting.

Were it not so serious for hundreds of thousands of people, the response from the T&aacute;naiste at the time, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, would have been funny.  He told me: &quot;Deputy Doherty need be in no doubt that this Government will act decisively, forcibly and effectively with the banks.&quot;  We all know what has happened since, however.  The banks have ruled and the Government has done their bidding.<\/p><p>My Bill, which my party hopes to debate during our Private Members' time in two weeks, marks a change from the hands-off attitude to one that is on the side of mortgage holders not the banks.  It is two years since I introduced in the House the Interest Rate Approval Bill on the same issue.  My Bill today goes further.  It proposes to introduce for the first time a process whereby the Central Bank can set a maximum cap on the standard variable rate that the covered institutions can charge their customers.  The Minister for Finance will be able to prod the Central Bank to undertake a review which could lead to the rate being set.  He or she will be able to ask for reports on the use of these powers and make regulations as to how the powers can be used.  The Bill allows the Central Bank to come to a decision as to whether to set a cap after considering a range of factors as outlined in section 2.  These factors include among other things the current rate an institution charges, the ECB rate, the viability of the bank and, crucially, the impact of the rate on mortgage holders.<\/p><p>The Bill is designed for where we are today.  Any cap to rates will lapse after 12 months unless it is renewed.  After six months, a bank may lodge an appeal which the Central Bank must consider.  The entire legislation is designed to lapse at the end of 2017.  This is a reasonable approach to dealing with this crisis.  Things cannot go on as normal because the mortgage market in the State is certainly not normal.  The Government would have us believe that its version of asking and begging the banks to lower their rates is paying off.  I ask Members to ask the customers of Bank of Ireland what they think about that.  The banks know the Government.  They know it will not stand up to them.  What is needed is a firm stick.  What is needed is for the law to be amended so that a maximum rate can be applied by the Central Bank after considering the social and economic aspects of any such decision.  Under the Bill, ignoring the Central Bank's direction will be to commit an offence.<\/p><p>We cannot carry on with some mortgage holders being ripped off while their neighbours on tracker mortgages pay the market rate.  We cannot carry on in a situation where the lack of competition is used as an excuse to keep rates artificially high.  The Bill is an extraordinary measure for extraordinary times.  We cannot go on pretending we live in a normal banking environment.  The banking sector is still a major drag on the economy and the banks must start to play their part in creating a fair recovery.  To implement the Bill would be an important push forward and a practical way to help struggling families.  Sinn F&eacute;in will bring the Bill to the floor of the D&aacute;il for debate and vote.  I urge all Deputies, whether Opposition or Government, to support it in the interests of the hundreds of thousands of variable rate mortgage holders being ripped off by their financial institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700025#X00600","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1432728600,"counter":638,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700025#X00700","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1432728600,"counter":639,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700025#X00800","speaker":"1098"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1432728600,"counter":640,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1432728600,"counter":641,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700025#X01000","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1432728600,"counter":642,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700025#X01100","speaker":"959"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1432728600,"counter":643,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1432728600,"counter":644,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 1.15 p.m. and resumed at 2.15 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Debate","time":1432729200,"counter":645,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700026#Y00100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Tax Exemptions","time":1432729200,"counter":646,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700026#Y00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1432729200,"counter":647,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for taking this Topical Issue today regarding the exemption from local property tax for those people afflicted by pyrite in their homes.

The regulations regarding the exemption from the local property tax are set out in the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Pyrite Exemption) Regulations 2013, SI No. 147 of 2013.  This statutory instrument is used by Revenue to either provide the exemption or not and Revenue is following it to the letter, as is required by law.<\/p><p>Revenue is currently issuing letters to homeowners all over Fingal and the rest of Leinster stating that if the homeowners do not provide a certificate detailing core testing of the sub-floor hardcore material and showing the qualifying significant pyrite percentages that the homeowner will not be able to obtain the exemption.  Revenue has provided a timeframe of 28 days to comply.  As the Minister is aware, the cost for core testing of the sub-floor is in the region of &euro;2,500 to &euro;3,000.<br\/><br\/>The Pyrite Resolution Board does not require a core test for acceptance into the national remediation scheme.  It does not require core testing of the sub-floor hardcore material to verify significant pyritic damage.  In the majority of cases a building condition assessment to level 2, in accordance with Irish Standard 398-1:2013 has sufficed.  The strict measurement as required by SI 147 of 2013 to demonstrate significant pyritic damage is not required by the PRB to validate applications for the scheme but is required by the Revenue for exemption purposes.  To have to spend &euro;3,000 to gain an exemption for a far lower amount is nonsensical.  This problem must be resolved.  SI 147 needs to be changed to reflect what is happening in practice.<br\/><br\/>Having examined the text in the statutory instrument it appears a simple edit by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government could resolve the problem quickly.  Page 3 of the document I have handed to the Minister begins:<blockquote>&ldquo;significant pyritic damage&rdquo; in respect of a residential property, means a property which&mdash;<br \/><br \/>(a) has a Damage Condition Rating of 2 or a Damage Condition Rating of 1 (with progression) established on foot of a Building Condition Assessment carried out by a competent person under and in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013, and<br \/><br \/>(b) has sub-floor hardcore material classified, by the appropriate competent persons, as susceptible to significant or limited expansion, established on foot of testing the sub-floor hardcore material.<\/blockquote>Replacing the word &quot;and&quot; at the end of part (a) with &quot;or&quot; would effectively apply the same criteria for &quot;significant pyritic damage&quot; as is applied by the Pyrite Resolution Board for inclusion in the pyrite remediation scheme.<br\/><br\/>Many houses affected by pyrite are in estates where HomeBond previously did core sampling for certification of pyrite levels.  HomeBond stated that it would be cost-prohibitive and wasteful in the extreme to core test each property.  Many homes have a building condition assessment in accordance with I.S. 398, detailing a damage condition rating of 2, and have been accepted by the PRB for inclusion in the pyrite remediation scheme.  They are in the current schedule of works and a contractor is currently on site.  They have not been required to carry out a core test, but because they do not have a core test Revenue is refusing exemption.  Any home that is accepted by the PRB into the scheme for remediation obviously has pyrite and should, as a matter of course, be exempt from local property tax.  The problem is the wording of the statutory instrument.  It needs to be changed urgently.  The simple solution I have presented today will do this.  It can be done almost overnight because it is secondary legislation.  I look forward to a positive response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700026#Y00300","speaker":"1013","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432729500,"counter":649,"content":"<p>The pyrite panel appointed by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government recommended that consideration be given to providing an exemption from local property tax where damage from pyritic heave had been proven by testing.  This was to be proven in accordance with a National Standards Authority of Ireland standard capable of determining if there was reactive pyrite in the sub-floor hardcore materials and if it had been subject to pyritic heave.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Standard 398, titled \"Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material - Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol\" was published on 29 January 2013 by the NSAI in response to the panel's recommendation.  Accordingly, section 10A of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended, provides that an exemption from the charge to local property tax will apply for a temporary period of at least three consecutive years for residential properties that have been certified under the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Pyrite Exemption) Regulations 2013, SI 147 of 2013, made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, as having significant pyritic damage.<\/p>  <p>  The regulations set out the methodology for the assessment of dwellings to establish significant pyritic damage.  These regulations require that homeowners demonstrate significant pyritic damage in accordance with the NSAI standard I.S. 398.  To be eligible for an exemption from local property tax a liable person must have a damage condition rating of 2 or a damage condition rating of 1 with progression, established on foot of a building condition assessment, BCA, carried out by a competent person in accordance with the NSAI standard, and have a sub-floor hardcore material classified by the appropriate competent person or persons as susceptible to significant or limited expansion, established on foot of testing the sub-floor hardcore material.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the building condition assessment is to demonstrate damage and to inform whether sampling and testing of the sub-floor hardcore of the residential property should be undertaken to confirm that such damage arises from pyrite.  The building condition assessment does not involve any invasive internal or external inspections to a residential property and, on its own, cannot be used to state conclusively that reactive pyrite is present in the sub-floor hardcore of the property.<\/p>  <p>  Grievances about the operation of the LPT exemption centre on the cost that must be incurred by a property owner in verifying that his or her property has been damaged by pyrite.<\/p>  <p>  I made a commitment to examine the local property tax and any impacts on LPT liabilities as a result of property price movements.  In this regard, Dr. Don Thornhill is conducting a review to consider and make recommendations in the context of property price developments on what adjustments, if any, might be made to the system to achieve relative stability of LPT payments by liable persons.  Dr. Thornhill chaired the interdepartmental group on the design of a local property tax in 2012.  The review will address a number of other issues concerning the LPT, including the relief from LPT for owners of pyrite-damaged homes and how the anomalous issue that has arisen in this regard can be resolved satisfactorily.  I expect the review by Dr. Thornhill will be completed by summer 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Resolution of the pyrite LPT relief issue may necessitate a change in the relevant provisions of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended, or the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Pyrite Exemption) Regulations.  If it is the case that legislative change is required I will examine with the Revenue Commissioners the possibilities for applying any change on an administrative basis in advance of such legislative changes.

Earlier this year, on 17 February, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, responded to a Topical Issue matter I raised drawing attention to concerns I had over the rolling out of the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP.  I referred to the substantial cut in funding for the programme.  There was a cut of &euro;2 million throughout the country, with a cut of &euro;742,000 in Dublin alone.  I stated my belief that the new regime and the cuts would result in a loss of services and jobs.  I asked the Minister at the time to guarantee there would be no job losses or a loss of service in the most disadvantaged communities in the State.  A commitment to reinstate the money was not forthcoming.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, has good news in this regard.  In February, the Minister stated, \"As the Minister with responsibility for this area, I will not prejudge a tendering process\".  In some ways, I accept that.  He also stated, \"I am confident that the Government will address any issue that arises in the area of service provision to ensure people will receive the services they need\".  He added that once the tendering process was completed, he would \"review the outcome and ensure front-line services delivered through the new programme are protected in so far as possible\".  I am sure the Minister of State, in her response, will reiterate that.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know how much the Minister of State knows about the D12 Disability Mainstream Access Project, DMAP which operates in the Dublin 12 area, an old area of the city characterised by severe disadvantage.  She has probably visited it on many occasions.  DMAP is a community development organisation seeking to increase awareness and understanding of the needs and experience of people with disabilities.  It seeks to help to address the issues of physical and social barriers that preclude access to community facilities for people with a disability and increase the level of social participation of people with a disability.  The Dublin 12 area is an area of severe disadvantage for those with or without a disability.  In fact, one in five people identifies as living with a disability in the area.  This proportion is higher than in other parts of the country.<\/p>  <p>  In the past year alone, 90 people took part in DMAP activities in the area.  A further 250 schoolchildren are engaged in a disability awareness initiative facilitated by DMAP members.  DMAP has worked with service providers, such as the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, WALK, Enable Ireland, Cheeverstown House, Dublin City Council and the local garda&iacute;.  The organisation is regarded by many of the statutory agencies in the area and beyond as one of the models of best practice in supporting people with a disability in the community.<\/p>  <p>  DMAP received funding to the tune of &euro;30,000.  This is not huge.  This money was to run the services, and particularly to help engage a part-time co-ordinator, who helped those with disabilities run the activities for themselves.  However, due to the SICAP proposals and the resulting cut affecting DMAP, the project was forced to lay off the part-time co-ordinator earlier this month.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to announce a reversal of this.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Minister of State accept that the whole SICAP process is now preventing Canal Communities Partnership, the partnership group that covers the Dublin 12 area or the part of the Dublin 12 area in question and which won the tender, from allocating funding to the project?  It now falls to the Minister of State to step in and allocate money directly or allocate to the Canal Communities Partnership additional funding that it can transfer to DMAP.  The initial promise that was made was that these issues would be addressed once the tendering process was completed and once things settle down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700028#AA00400","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1432730100,"counter":655,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  It gives me an opportunity to explain the process.  The proposals outlined in Putting People First &mdash; Action Programme for Effective Local Government seek to position local government \"as the primary vehicle of governance and public service at local level &mdash; leading economic, social and community development, delivering efficient and good value services, and representing citizens and local communities effectively and accountably\".  As part of the programme of reform of local government, local community development committees, LCDCs, have been established in all local authority areas.  These committees, comprising public-private socio-economic interests have responsibility for local and community development programmes on an area basis, including the social inclusion and community activation programme, commonly known as SICAP.  They will develop, co-ordinate and implement a more coherent and integrated approach to local and community development than heretofore, with the aim of reducing duplication and overlap and optimising the use of available resources for the benefit of citizens and communities.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the public spending code, legal advice, good practice internationally and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of services to clients, SICAP was subject to a public procurement process.  Tenderers have now been informed of the outcome of their tenders, and LCDCs have finalised contracts with the winning tenderers.<\/p>  <p>  Rathmines Pembroke Community Partnership provided funding to the project in question under my Department's local and community development programme.

Rathmines Pembroke Community Partnership was unsuccessful in its tender to deliver the SICAP in the canal-Rathmines-Pembroke lot area, and I am advised that, as a result, the company is no longer in a position to continue managing the project referred to.<\/p>  <p>  As SICAP will be overseen and managed by the new LCDCs in each local authority area, the configuration of delivery bodies or delivery arrangements for the Dublin city area in respect of local and community programmes is a matter for the LCDC of Dublin City Council to consider in consultation with relevant stakeholders, commensurate with service needs.

It does not fall under the canal communities partnership which only offers a forum for people with disabilities.  It does not want a talking shop.  It knows what the issues are and was quite successful.  It is talking about a sum of &euro;30,000 to ensure there is inclusion.  The idea behind SICAP, all of the programme partnerships and the original SDPs was to ensure social inclusion.  This is a group of the most marginalised people in society, some of whom were in the Visitors Gallery earlier as they expected this debate to be held earlier.  They are now meeting Deputies from different parties.  The people in the group I am meeting are in wheelchairs and blind or have other disabilities.  They will feel frustrated when they hear that the body implementing the programme will deal with this issue.  In some ways, it is too late.  The person concerned has been laid off, the service is suffering and they have to scale back severely in planning for the future because they do not have other sources of funding.  I hope local politicians and businesses will give them some of the money they need, but funding was available.  They are not seeking a huge pot of money.  They want somebody to represent them and open doors to help them to gain access for themselves and others.  This was a cut to social programmes throughout the country.  The cut in Dublin was &euro;740,000 and it is now beginning to take effect.  Job losses are occurring.  It affects those delivering community services, be it in Ballymun or Whitehall where there have been substantial job losses.  Senior citizens living in Donore have lost one of their workers through no fault of their own but through the fault of some of the partnerships which did not include them in the programme.  Will the Minister of State give a commitment on behalf of the Minister that he will step in and allocate money until the next tender comes up for consideration and the group proves once again that it should have been included in the first tender process by both partnerships that bid for the money?

They have special needs and applied through the Department to the State Examinations Commission for a reader to assist them in reading the examination papers in order that they will be able to answer the questions to the best of their ability.  Many of them suffer from dyslexia and as a result have a difficulty in reading examination papers.  However, they have been refused this special support.  Members will understand what I am talking about.  There is a system in place under the State Examinations Commission to provide readers for students sitting the junior and leaving certificate examinations.  Last week I asked about a case in Portlaoise, to which I will return, in a parliamentary question.  I then asked for the overall numbers involved, which I received in a letter from the State Examinations Commission last night.<\/p>  <p>  The reasonable accommodation provision under the certificate examinations scheme has been designed to assist students with special needs.  It applies to candidates with a physical disability, a visual or hearing impairment or a specific learning difficulty.  The purpose of the scheme is to remove as far as possible the impact of the disability on the student in order that he or she can demonstrate his or her level of attainment.  The provision is very clear.  The reader does not help the student to answer the examination questions.  He or she just reads them to the student who must reply in full himself or herself.  The scheme has also been designed to ensure no candidate with a reader will be given an unfair advantage.  We understand the scheme which is both good and fair.  <\/p>  <p>  Last year 914 students were refused a reader under the scheme.  I can only conclude that the figure is of the same order this year, as there is no reason to think otherwise.  I asked for the figures for each of the past three years to see what was going on.  Last night the State Examinations Commission told me that in 2012, 669 students had been refused a reader.  The figure increased to 894 in 2013, while last year it was 914.  I am sure the figure this year is the same as last year at least.  In a short period of time since 2012 the figure has risen from 669 to 914, an increase of 245 students or 37%.  That did not happen by accident.  It was a deliberate policy on the part of the Government to cut the funding available to cut down on the cost of examinations.  The former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, took the clear decision to cut the number of readers provided.  <\/p>  <p>  The students concerned have passed through the full primary and post-primary education systems.  Because they have special needs, they have been assisted along the way.  In their final examination they need a continuation of the help they have received, but the Government has slammed the door in their faces.  They had the assistance of a reader in their junior certificate examinations.  Does the Minister of State know how they feel having been deprived of the services of a reader at this stage?  They have been reduced to tears and their parents are helpless.  This is cruelty shown to students sitting the leaving certificate examinations.  The Government has stepped up its approach in the past couple of years.  The number of refusals was 600 when it entered into office and is now around 1,000.  It is slamming the door and students are crying and afraid to sit their examinations because they are being deprived of a facility of which they were able to avail in their junior certificate examinations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700029#BB00400","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1432731300,"counter":661,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Fleming for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the position with regard to the State Examinations Commission's scheme of Reasonable Accommodations at the Certificate Examinations, RACE.  I am taking this debate on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy O'Sullivan, who is out of the country today.<\/p>  <p>  The State Examinations Commission, SEC, was established as an independent agency in 2003 and has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations. Students with specific learning difficulties such as dyslexia as well as those with physical conditions are accommodated in the examinations under the SEC's RACE scheme.  However, the existence of a specific learning difficulty does not automatically make a candidate eligible to avail of reasonable accommodations in the certificate examinations.  Even though candidates may have a specific difficulty with reading, writing or spelling, they may not require the provision of any special accommodations provided that they can read the examination papers at the required level and write legibly.<\/p>  <p>  The range of accommodations available to students includes the use of a special examination centre; provision of modified, brailled and enlarged papers for visually impaired students; access to readers, scribes, word-processors, tape or voice recorders for students with physical conditions, dyslexia or other types of specific learning difficulty; and exemptions from components of the examinations such as the oral or aural or the waiver from spelling and grammar in language subjects.  Where candidates have reading difficulties, a reader may be provided.  Some students may apply for and be granted more than one type of accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of the leaving certificate, all applications for reasonable accommodations on grounds of specific learning difficulties are referred to the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, for consideration.  This is not the case with the junior certificate.  Decisions are made at a local level for junior certificate students.  It is only at leaving certificate level that the NEPS becomes involved in the decision making process.<\/p>  <p>  Eligibility thresholds apply to the various types of accommodations which can be made under the scheme and each case is considered on its own merits.  Each application must include information supporting the candidate's request for a particular accommodation, including current school-based testing on ability and attainments in order to inform the psychologist's recommendation under the schemes' criteria.  For example, applications for readers at leaving certificate level must show evidence of a specific learning difficulty and must be accompanied by supporting information which will allow NEPS to make an assessment of the applicant's degree of reading difficulty.  The NEPS assessment of eligibility for the purposes of the RACE scheme is made on the basis of all of the information available and as required, in consultation with the school concerned.  <\/p>  <p>  Appeals against any aspect of the SEC's decision on RACE applications can be made to an appeals committee which is independent of the SEC.  Neither I nor my Department have any role in reviewing decisions on RACE made by the SEC or the independent appeals committee.  Candidates who continue to be dissatisfied with the outcome can appeal further to the Ombudsman or the Ombudsman for Children.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy quoted figures in his question and while I do not have those figures in front of me I do know that 1,700 candidates were provided with access to a reader last year.  The Deputy has argued that there has been an increase in the number of refusals but I do not know if there was a corresponding increase in the number of applications.  Perhaps the Deputy has data on that issue and if so, he should put that data on the record of the House too.  I will seek the data to which the Deputy refers because an increase in the number of refusals could be linked to an increase in the number of applications in general.  I do not know if the percentages have changed in that regard.  All of that being said, it is an independent and rigorous process.  The criteria are set out quite clearly and decisions are made in accordance with a framework of principles which was established by an expert advisory group.  The process is entirely independent.  I agree with the Deputy that negative decisions on RACE applications can cause great distress.  Indeed, I have had constituents come to my office to express concern in that regard.  However, we must make sure that this scheme is fair and equitable to all students who are sitting State examinations.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700030#CC00100","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1432731300,"counter":662,"content":"<p>The letter I received states that the number of applications received in 2012 was 2,495, in 2013 it was 2,572 and in 2014 it was 2,609 while the number of reader approvals was 1826, 1,678 and 1,695, respectively.  There has been a very slight increase in the number of applications, of approximately 100 over the three years, but the number of approvals has dropped and the number of refusals has increased.  To put it simply, two years ago 25% of applications were being refused but last year that rose to 35%.  There has been a significant increase in the number of refusals.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State has really washed his hands with his reply.  The Department in charge of education is saying that when a young person goes to sit the leaving certificate exam decisions on support for that student have nothing to do with the Minister or the Department but are the responsibility of an independent body.  The Minister for Education and Skills is responsible for education and she should take an interest in this matter.  It is not acceptable for the Minister to wash her hands of this situation.  <\/p>  <p>  I raise this issue on behalf of the parents of a young girl in Portlaoise who came to my constituency office because after going through the original assessment process and the entire appeals process, they were notified on 23 April 2015 that the appeals committee had decided that their daughter would not be granted a reader.  That was only a few weeks before the beginning of the leaving certificate.  The girl has been in school since she was four or five and is now 18 years old and about to sit her leaving certificate.  She has had support all along but it is only at the point of her sitting her final exams that support is being withdrawn.  That is barbaric, amoral and cruel and it is not acceptable that the Minister for Education and Skills would wash her hands of such a situation.  <\/p>  <p>  The final paragraph of the letter I received from the SEC on the specific case in question asserts that the SEC is satisfied \"that all due consideration has been given in this case\".  In other words, that is the end of the road for the application.  What is shocking is that the Minister of State has just said that candidates who are dissatisfied with the process can appeal further to the Ombudsman or the Ombudsman for Children.  The girl only got word on her application a month before the leaving certificate is due to begin.  Where is the Minister of State going with his reply?  Does he think the Ombudsman or the Ombudsman for Children can deal with that case in less than a month and overturn that decision?  That is a nonsense reply.  It is a further nonsense that the SEC never informed any of those people who were refused support that they had the right to take their case to the Ombudsman or the Ombudsman for Children.  It never informed me of same in its detailed, three page letter on the case I raised.  Rather, the commission said that all procedures had been exhausted and it was satisfied with the decision.  At the very least, the Department should tell the SEC to notify applicants of their right to appeal decisions to the Ombudsman or the Ombudsman for Children.  The Minister of State and I both know that such an appeal is utterly impractical in the context of the four-week time scale in this particular case.  The damage has already been done for those students who are sitting their leaving certificate this year but I ask the Minister of State to ensure that next year all of those who are entitled to this facility are granted it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700030#CC00200","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1432731300,"counter":663,"content":"<p>It is not nonsense for me to come into the House and outline the process.  I was just telling the truth as it is.  The Deputy might not like it but that is the process.  It would be wrong for any Minister to be able to interfere with a process that is meant to be independent.  This is a State examination, a leaving certificate qualification and we cannot ever be accused of giving an unfair advantage to any candidate.  The process must be independent.  Some Deputies, including myself and Deputy Fleming, might wish sometimes that it was not independent and that we could have some influence over the process but that would be completely wrong.  The process has to be independent, must be able to stand up to scrutiny and ensure that the correct decisions are made.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy's point about applicants not being informed of their right to appeal decisions to the Ombudsman or the Ombudsman for Children is valid.  It is often assumed that people know of that right and perhaps it should be spelled out clearly to them.  I will certainly ensure that is addressed.  I also accept the Deputy's point regarding timelines.  Indeed, some people are still awaiting a final decision.  The timelines are a bit tight and we can certainly look at that before next year.  I have no problem working on that but neither myself nor the Minister has any intention of changing an independent process so that we can have influence over it.  That would be wrong and would not be fair.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy also spoke about the fact that the student in question had supports at junior certificate level.  I wish to clarify that a more rigorous assessment process applies to the leaving certificate as it seeks to recognise the high stakes nature of this examination.  It is the final State examination that is used, in most cases, to determine whether students can progress to further education, higher education or into a career.  At junior certificate level the schools themselves make the decisions and are provided with guidelines by the SEC to help them to determine eligibility.  In general the SEC provides the accommodations as determined by the school.  Accommodations approved for a junior certificate student will not automatically be granted at leaving certificate and this is clearly outlined to schools, candidates and their parents in the RACE documentation.  That said, I accept that very often people do not see the finer details in such documentation, which can cause difficulties.  <\/p>  <p>  I stress again that there is a different system in place for the leaving certificate and it is unfair of Deputy Fleming to try to muddy the waters.  The arrangements for reaching decisions are different at leaving certificate level and the process must be independent.  I cannot stress the latter point enough.  I accept that it can cause great stress and difficulty but the scheme must be applied properly.  The SEC cannot give an unfair advantage to one student over another.  The idea of these supports is to ensure that students are in a position to reach their potential attainment levels and nothing impedes that but they cannot be given an unfair advantage.  That requires a judgment call and I am sure everyone would have a different opinion on such judgments but that is what the experts are there for - to judge who is entitled to supports.  I hope that in every case those who are entitled to support receive it.  <\/p>  <p>  All of that being said, it appears, based on the figures quoted by the Deputy, that the percentages have changed a lot so I will research that data further.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700030#CC00300","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Miscarriages of Justice","time":1432731900,"counter":664,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700031#DD00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1432731900,"counter":665,"content":"<p>I am disappointed the Minister has not shown up to the Chamber for this debate.<\/p>  <p>  As the House will be aware, on 1 April the Department of Justice and Equality released on its website a press statement announcing the Minister&rsquo;s intention to grant a posthumous pardon to Mr. Harry Gleeson, a man executed at the hands of the State on 23 April 1941 for the murder of Mrs. Mary McCarthy, a murder he did not commit.  It has been seen by many as one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in the State.<\/p>  <p>  In August 2013 this case was referred to the Office of the Attorney General and reviewed by Mr. Shane Murphy SC, who produced a report in January.  For some inexplicable reason the Department of Justice and Equality has not released the report to the public.<\/p>  <p>  It seems there has been an attempt by the Department to play down the significance of this case.  Evidence, which has come to light since the execution of Mr. Gleeson, points to deliberate collusion by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na relating to his conviction.  It is one of the key pieces of evidence which makes this conviction wrong and yet has received little or no attention in the press release the Department released on the pardon.<\/p>  <p>  In particular, there was evidence of a fraudulent entry made in a firearms register.  In 1983 a prosecution witness, Mr. Michael Leamy, revealed that on the afternoon the body was discovered and reported by Mr. Gleeson two plain clothes detectives came into the hardware store where Mr. Leamy worked and ordered a fraudulent entry be inserted in the firearms register for the purchase of a particular type of ammunition by Mr. Gleeson&rsquo;s uncle.  This entry has been located and is available to the public to view.<\/p>  <p>  This evidence was submitted to the Department of Justice by Mr. Marcus Bourke, a former parliamentary draftsman, who wrote a book entitled Murder at Marlhill about the case in 1993.  Why has it taken 22 years to issue this pardon?  Why has it been issued now?<\/p>  <p>  In the press statement of 1 April, the Minister made no reference to the work of Mr. Marcus Bourke.  It did not highlight the statement by Mr. Leamy or mention that garda&iacute; approached him on the day the body was found.  The statement suggested merely that the firearms register, which was not produced during the trial despite several requests by the trial judge, \"tended not to support the prosecution&rsquo;s case.\"  That is the only reference in it.<\/p>  <p>  In a separate press release on 31 March, a day before the Harry Gleeson press release, the Minister for Justice and Equality announced that she was releasing the report of a similar case which had been reviewed by a senior counsel into the death of Fr. Niall Molloy.  Why in this case was the report released but in Harry Gleeson&rsquo;s case the report is somehow deemed to represent confidential legal advice to the Attorney General and the Minister?  It is completely incongruous and it does not add up that one report can be deemed worthy of publication and another report not.  Clearly the Department of Justice and Equality wishes to suppress the content of one report.<\/p>  <p>  This case has bemused and concerned people for years.  It goes far beyond a merely unsafe conviction, as the Minister has stated in her press release.  It was a deliberate miscarriage of justice and should be seen as such by the Minister and her Department, and this should be made clear on the public record.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Murphy&rsquo;s report should be released to the public, as it is in the interest of the public to see it.  The Minister for Justice and Equality should certify that this was a miscarriage of justice and make a full and frank apology to the families and all people affected by this case, which has lingered on since 1941.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700031#DD00200","speaker":"1186"},{"type":"speech","time":1432731900,"counter":666,"content":"<p>I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality who regrets she cannot be here because of other official commitments.  I am a Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, however.  The Minister is grateful to the Deputy for raising this important matter.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Minister announced that the Government had decided to advise the President to exercise his right of pardon under Article 13.6 of the Constitution in respect of the conviction in 1941 of Mr. Harry Gleeson for the murder of Mrs. Mary McCarthy.  Concerns had been raised for many years over Mr. Gleeson's conviction.<\/p>  <p>  Most recently, on foot of a submission from the Irish Innocence Project and the Justice for Harry Gleeson group, the Attorney General directed that the case be reviewed by Mr. Shane Murphy SC.  Mr. Murphy concluded that, in his opinion, there were deficiencies in the conviction such as to render it unsafe.  The Attorney General concurred with this assessment and advised that the deficiencies were such as to warrant the Government recommending to the President that he exercise his right of pardon.  The arrangements for this recommendation to be put into effect are being finalised at present.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Murphy outlined a number of factors which led to him forming his opinion and these were set out in detail in the statement the Minister issued when she announced the Government decision on the pardon.  The Minister is aware of suggestions that Mr. Murphy's advice should be published and the Deputy has repeated those suggestions today.  However, the Minister has advised it is not proposed to do so as legal advice is provided to the Minister and the Attorney General.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard the Minister wishes to emphasise that the examination carried out by Mr. Murphy was not intended to be an inquiry designed to establish all of the facts surrounding the conviction of Mr. Gleeson or indeed the murder of Mrs. McCarthy.  The intention in carrying out the examination was focused on determining whether a case had been made for a pardon.  To this end the statement the Minister issued following the Government decision sets out in detail the basis for the conclusion that Mr. Gleeson's conviction was unsafe.  The Minister's statement was prepared with the assistance of Mr. Shane Murphy and it fully and publicly outlined the basis for the Government's decision.<\/p>  <p>  There are no doubt unanswered questions concerning Mrs. McCarthy's murder and the circumstances surrounding Mr. Gleeson's conviction but seeking to come to a determination on these matters at this remove would unfortunately not be warranted or feasible.<\/p>  <p>  In deciding to recommend Mr. Gleeson's pardon the Government is exercising the only available remedy to clear his name in the hope that it will also provide some suitable tribute to his memory.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister emphasises that this is an exceptional course of action, being only the fourth pardon in the history of the State and the first granted posthumously.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister again underlines that it is a matter of the very greatest regret that a man was convicted and executed in circumstances which are now considered to be unsafe.  Equally the Government regrets that this leaves unresolved the murder of Mrs. McCarthy, which deprived her young family of their mother.  The Government has expressed its sympathy with both families and all affected by this crime and the subsequent wrongful conviction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700031#DD00300","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speech","time":1432731900,"counter":667,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and providing remarks on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  However, it is frustrating that I cannot get any satisfaction on the points I raised because the Minister is not here to speak.  I assume she has intimate knowledge of this, which I do not expect the Minister of State, in fairness, to have.<\/p>  <p>  There is one fundamental and reasonable question to which the families concerned and the public at large have a right to have an answer.  Why was it deemed appropriate to publish the report into the Fr. Niall Molloy case but not appropriate to publish the report into the case of Mr. Harry Gleeson?  They are very similar cases both of which I have followed closely.  One report is deemed to be privileged legal advice between Mr. Murphy, and the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice and Equality, but the other is deemed not to be.  That is incongruous and there is no explanation for it other than for one logically to conclude that it is desirable on the part of the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Department to suppress one report and to publish the other, which is of deep concern.<\/p><p>I would like an explanation from the Minister for Justice and Equality as to the reason for the differentiation between the two reports.  To my mind, it is illogical.  I do not expect that the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, will be able to answer my question.  The Minister should be here to respond to that very important point.<\/p> <p> I do not think it is true to say that the only possible solace that could be provided by the Minister for Justice or the Government is a pardon.  I believe certification and acknowledgement that this was a miscarriage of justice would be appropriate, in addition to the pardon.  The reality is that an innocent man lost his life at the hands of the State because of a miscarriage of justice and it should be acknowledged as such.  I realise that this happened in 1941, which is a number of decades ago, but many people suffered, not least the individual at the heart of this matter, Mr. Harry Gleeson.  The State should acknowledge that this was a miscarriage of justice.  I believe that the public has a right to see the contents of Mr. Murphy's report.  It may well be the case that an independent inquiry is required to fully establish the facts behind this case.  It is difficult for Members of this House or, indeed, members of the public to make that adjudication.  We are simply expected to take the word of the Minister or the Government rather than being able to judge for ourselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700031#DD00400","speaker":"1186","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432732500,"counter":669,"content":"<p>I will communicate to the Minister the Deputy's specific request for an explanation as to the reason these cases, if similar - I do not know that they are - have been treated differently.

Further correspondence has been recently received by the Minister and she has asked her officials to examine it and refer it to the Attorney General's office.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister would like to point out that while the relatives in question have not been previously engaged with in regard to this case other relatives who form part of the Harry Gleeson group were in regular contact and they have welcomed the Government decision, as have many of those who campaigned on this case in recent years.

Barrett last night, &quot;We are trying to develop this country, yet we are handing over the national airline to an airline whose track record is not to provide services from Belfast, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham or any other region of the UK to North America&quot;.  What hope has Cork, Shannon or other regional airports in that environment?  We have been able to utilise Aer Lingus to support regional airports and the economies surrounding them.  This will no longer be the case under IAG and these communities will suffer for it.  The chambers of commerce and other bodies from these areas voiced grave concerns over the IAG bid at the Oireachtas committee.<\/p><p>I want now to deal with the plan by this Government to maintain a 1% share in Aer Lingus, which would provide it with certain rights over decisions.  While this appears to be a good way of maintaining the voice of the Irish state at Aer Lingus it is faulty for two reasons.  This proposal is known as a &quot;golden share&quot;, which has been shown to be illegal under international and European laws governing business.  In Britain, the Government retained a &quot;golden share&quot; in BAA, the UK airports authority which operates Heathrow.  This was ruled illegal by European courts in 2003.  It was deemed contradictory to the principle of free circulation of capital within the EU.  The European Court of Justice also ruled Portugal's golden shares in Energias de Portugal as contrary to EU law as it presented an unjustified restriction on free movement of capital.  Spain&rsquo;s golden shares in Telef&oacute;nica, Repsol YPF, Endesa, Argentaria and Tabacalera were also ruled illegal, as were many others.  IAG operating out of Heathrow and controlling former Spanish airline, Iberia, would know all too well the problems associated with golden shares but would see this as the Government&rsquo;s problem.  In a poll by <i>The Irish Times<\/i>the majority of respondents, 54%, stated they were opposed to the sell-off of Aer Lingus.  This 54% was twice that of those who supported the sale.  The people know that the future of Aer Lingus is best placed in Ireland, with the State maintaining its interest and arguing for Ireland's needs.  This deal is also faulty as the real decisions for Aer Lingus will no longer be made at the company but at the IAG board.  <\/p><p>Turning to the issue of the deferred members of the IASS who worked for Aer Lingus, these workers are going to be forced to take a 40% cut to their pension entitlements, facilitated by Government legislation.  During an interview on radio this morning Deputy Costello mentioned this issue and said that he would be seeking money in this regard from the sale even though he well knows that the Minister has ruled this out.  When I put a similar question to Mr. Walsh at the transport committee his response was that the matter was outside of his remit.  The deferred pensioners were left out of the expert panel and out of the conclusion and are now to be left out in the cold by this deal.  The Government also opposed amendments to the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill which would have helped these workers, who have been so unfairly treated.  <\/p><p>This is a cheap sell-off of a vital State asset as an election looms.  Let there be no mistake about it, this is a bad deal for Ireland, Aer Lingus and its workers.  It will usher in seven years of uncertainty and struggle for the State to maintain connectivity.  It will mean seven years of industrial strife and hardship for workers who will be left on the scrap heap, leaving us in seven years time with an island dependent on the crumbs of a major multinational to provide the much-needed connectivity we have come to depend on.<\/p><p>The Labour Party will see the cost of its cowardice when it is too late, just as Fianna F&aacute;il may today see the cost of its agenda in selling off Aer Lingus in the first instance.  It is clear that Aer Lingus had plans to expand its services, create additional jobs and open up new routes.  The so-called guarantees have been welcomed by Deputies John Lyons, Se&aacute;n Kenny and Joe Costello and Ministers of State, Deputy Jed Nash and Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  They have capitulated.<\/p><p>I ask all north side Labour Party Deputies, never mind those in Cork and Shannon or Fine Gael Deputies, with large numbers of Aer Lingus employees in their constituencies, if this deal will do any more than the previous one?  The same principle applies - Aer Lingus is a going concern and profitable, with plans for expansion, leading to the creation of more than the predicted 150 jobs by the end of 2016.  It would rival the so-called 635 net new jobs to be created by 2020, without the loss of the jobs mentioned by the Minister.  At the press conference the other day he said that in the region of 50 jobs would be lost, but he was a little vague and unsure about who would be affected.  This makes it obvious that the Government did not negotiate hard on that issue.<\/p> <p> Job guarantees and promises of no compulsory redundancies are of little consolation to the workforce.  What about the future?  Is it all right that future employees will have less favourable employment conditions and wages?  Will outsourcing take place?  With profits of almost &euro;80 million, excluding some one-off loans that will be repaid, and passenger numbers at an all-time high of almost 12 million, why should we sell a going concern that is delivering?  The Government has admitted that tourism has been one of the good news stories of recent years; why, therefore, would it jeopardise what is working and delivering in the past few hard years?  The Heathrow Airport slots are vital to the maintenance and expansion of activity on this island and to overseas destinations.  <\/p> <p> Why was this deal not placed before the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications for scrutiny, as requested by Deputies in all parties?  How have shareholders benefited from this?  What will senior managers, directors and board members get?  We have not seen details of the remuneration that will be paid to some individuals as a result of this sale.  What will happen to the board of Aer Lingus?  The Minister said it would continue to act independently, but for how long?  Will it last into perpetuity?  I doubt it.  How will having a 1% share allow a Minister to have a veto into perpetuity?  Will the Minister stand up at a board or shareholder meeting seven years down the road and say, \"I am the Minister for Finance; you cannot sell off these slots or cannot do this\"?  Anybody put in that position would end up a laughing stock.  <\/p> <p> Fine Gael's ideology is behind this sale.  Fine Gael supports the idea of monopolies and big business.  Anything the State owns or part owns is bad in its mind.  Aer Lingus survived through the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s and then through some of the most difficult and worst times the country has ever seen.  This is a rich country, although we may not be using our resources in the right way.  Therefore, there is no reason this company should be sold.<\/p> <p> The Minister mentioned three areas in terms of how he gauged this deal.  He mentioned a cyclical airline industry with ups and downs.  Any company must take into account the fact that business can go bad and engineer its finances in order that it can address a problem if or when business is bad.  That is a function of any company.  We can expect cycles in business and this is not the only time we will see issues in an industry that has ups and downs when times are hard.  <\/p> <p> The Minister also mentioned that the European airline industry was fragmented in comparison with that in the United States.  Must we base our judgment on everything the United States does?  There are some brilliant airlines in Europe, but they may not all be linked like those in the United States.  However, that is no way to gauge whether an airline should be sold.<\/p> <p> The Minister mentioned that Aer Lingus was no longer the national flag carrier because we only owned 25% of it.  That is true; I wish we owned the other 75% and were not in our current position.  However, this does not take from the people's vision that it is our airline.  They have said they do not support the sale of Aer Lingus.  The majority do not support its sale, but the Government has not taken this into account.  <\/p> <p> The Minister mentioned setting up a connectivity fund.  He said the moneys would be put into the strategic investment fund and could be used for building or other works on harbours, roads or airports.  Will the funds be put into bus services, the ones the Minister plans to privatise?  Will we see any of this funding?  Will the Minister elaborate on where the funds will go and what they will be used for?<\/p> <p> What will happen if, for some reason, IAG ends up selling parts of the company or merges with other companies?  We are all aware that takeovers can happen.  In such cases, any deal done will go by the wayside.  We have seen this happen in the case of the Government.  We saw it happen in the case of commitments made on bin charges in the case of Dublin City Council, when Fine Gael and Labour Party councillors made a deal promising that waivers would be provided for old age pensioners and others.  That commitment went by the wayside and the service was privatised under Fine Gael and Labour Party councillors.<\/p> <p> Aer Lingus has survived many difficulties, but this deal is a nail in its coffin.  The Minister should be defending the State's assets, not selling them.  No Government should have the right to sell the State's assets.  It should be up to the people to decide and it should be for them to make the decision.  This company has been hard won by the people and the workers.  Many years of hard work have gone into building the company, but it can all change at the whim of the Government.  Every time the Government changes or each time we change from Tweedledum to Tweedledee political parties, power is taken and some company is privatised.  Another Government takes power and privatises another.  That is what has happened in this state in the past while.  This has damaged society enormously.  We have seen this happen in the cutbacks made to local services across the board.  Services are being cut left, right and centre.  The Government has stated it is addressing the housing crisis and social issues, yet we heard from Focus Ireland the other day that 70 new families a month were becoming homeless.  Since the death of Jonathan Corrie and all the talk about what it was going to do, the Government has spun what it is going to do with its &euro;3.8 billion so many times that I have lost count.  Some of the sums announced were totally ridiculous.<\/p> <p> The sale of Aer Lingus is one of the worst things that could happen, as is the selling of State assets that people have worked hard to build.  Aer Lingus belongs to the State, not the Minister or the Government, Fine Gael or the Labour Party, yet the Government has taken the decision to do this and can push the sale through.  However, I am sure it will come back to haunt us because IAG, Mr. Willie Walsh and people like him have no interest in the connectivity of this country.  They have at heart their own interests and those of shareholders, but the people who matter in this country are the ordinary people.  They are the ones who care, but the Government is going against their wishes.  That is how I see it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700032#EE00500","speaker":"1022","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432733700,"counter":675,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies Ruth Coppinger, Shane Ross and Clare Daly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700034#GG00100","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1432733700,"counter":676,"content":"<p>Thank you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700034#GG00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1432733700,"counter":677,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this important debate on the future of Aer Lingus.  The way this issue has been handled so far, and particularly last night, is a disgrace.  I was attending a residents' meeting in Clongriffin, in my constituency, at about 9 o'clock last night when I heard the news.  I then heard about the plan to have the rushed debate at 10.45 this morning.  That shows a complete lack of respect for this House and its procedures but, more importantly, the Irish people.  Rushing this debate is not good enough for anyone, and the Government should know that from past experiences.<\/p><p>People have genuine concerns about this issue, and those concerns must be dealt with.  My concerns arise from having listened to those on all sides of the debate and representing the best interests of the staff, the former pensioners and the people.  When we raise concerns we have to be listened to, and those concerns must be teased out.<\/p><p>My first concern is job losses.  That is a reasonable concern, and we must focus on it.  There are people who work in the aviation sector who said they could see the possibility of 1,200 job losses in the coming years yet the Minister is telling us their will be job gains.  That is a question to be answered.  In terms of history, Iberia Airlines has shed 4,500 jobs since it was taken over by IAG.<\/p><p>The other concern, and I am sick and tired raising it here and sick and tired of the Government not listening, is that we still do not have a resolution to the unjust situation faced by the deferred members of the Aer Lingus pension scheme who are now facing huge cuts to their entitlements, aided by this Government motion.  Those are my three immediate concerns.<\/p><p>We need good inside information on Aer Lingus.  I have got many letters on this issue but I received one this morning from a woman who is a current Aer Lingus worker.  I will read a small section of the letter.  It states:<blockquote>I am an aer lingus worker and am very worried about the security of my job with the sale of our fabulous airline.  Have our government learned nothing after the sale of Irish ferries and eircom.  To me this is a short term gain for long term pain to all employees of aer lingus.  Aer lingus management are set to gain lotto figures with this sale so they are of course pushing this sale.<\/blockquote>That woman is a credible member of the staff and I ask the Minister that, when he is responding, he would address those genuine concerns from members of staff.<\/p><p>There is a lack of informed debate on the reason this proposal is being rushed through the House, with the vote being held tomorrow evening.  There is a lack of respect for the D&aacute;il and the people.  As the Minister knows, Aer Lingus has adapted and proven itself in a competitive market.<\/p><p>I have other concerns regarding how consumers will fare.  Will this prove to be anti-competitive?  The coveted Heathrow slots will be gone.  That is a reality.  Competition has been a friend of Irish travellers for the past number of years.  In 1985, an airline ticket from London to Dublin cost in the region of &pound;569.  Today, one can buy a ticket for &euro;35.  The competition issue has not been addressed in a proper and sensible way.<\/p><p>Aer Lingus has survived tougher times.  Why is now the best time to sell it off?  We must consider the broader picture, outside the economic issue.  The staff issue is a concern also.  We must also ask if this sale is in the national interest.  Is this a hostile takeover by IAG which will bypass the public interest?  How can the Minister say he will have more control when he no longer has any shares than when he owned 25% of shares?  Those are the type of questions people are asking me.<\/p><p>Aer Lingus is a great brand, and we are all very proud of it.  I have many family members and friends who worked in Aer Lingus.  As the Minister knows, Aer Lingus is highly profitable.  We also know that Aer Lingus is vital for tourism, foreign investment and job creation.<\/p><p>In terms of this lack of informed open discussion and the rushed decision, we are not looking at the valuable asset.  There has also been a sneaky attempt by certain sections, both in government and outside Government, and those who will gain financially, to distort public opinion.  I have seen that in the past 12 hours.  We need to wake up, smell the coffee and examine the real issues.<\/p><p>There has been a grave injustice against the IASS pensioners.  Another letter I received this morning was from one of those people in which he stated:<blockquote>So much for the protection of Irish workers but in particular the people who have been robbed of their rightful pension.  We now have uncertainty and hardships to look forward to in our old age.  All politicians who go along with this sale without any reference to our group, the IASS deferred pensioners, should hold [their] head in shame.  In particular the members of the Labour party.  You all disgust me but at least myself along with my extended family and friends who are shocked and dismayed by your treatment of me and my pension are looking forward [to] casting their vote...<\/blockquote>Those are the type of situations we are dealing with.  Those are real stories from pensioners and people who work in Aer Lingus.<\/p><p>Another issue on which all those on the opposite side of the House have ducked and dodged in the past 12 hours is customer service.  Aer Lingus had a fantastic international record and a very valuable asset.  It acted as an ambassador for Ireland.  In 2011, it celebrated its 75th birthday.  It has outlasted companies like Pan Am and TWA.  What a record.  What a group of people, but now the Minister is saying the company is not financially viable.  <\/p><p>The Minister should always learn from history.  He should recall the 1960s when it was decided that the famous Harcourt Street line, which went to Bray, was not economical or fashionable and that it should be closed down.  Today, it is part of the Luas Green line.  Economic arguments were presented at that time against retaining it but they have been exposed as being hollow.<\/p><p>We need to preserve a vital infrastructure.  We should not discard a company like Aer Lingus.  We cannot afford to lose the connectivity Aer Lingus provides, and we cannot afford to lose the potential to create thousands of jobs.  Aer Lingus has served this country well.  Aer Lingus is a profitable company.  Aer Lingus has an excellent brand.  It is time for people to look at the facts and hear the economic arguments I put forward today.  We should put the national interest, the interests of the staff and the pensioners first.  I ask the Minister to respond to the issues I have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700034#GG00300","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1432733700,"counter":678,"content":"<p>Before I begin I wish to echo the words of Deputy McGrath about the deferred pensioners because this is not a footnote.  It is one of the tenets of those of us who support, on the whole, the idea of a free market that it creates more wealth, and some of that wealth must be spent to defend the weak.  It is a very serious point.  A large amount of money will come into the Government's coffers as a result of this sale; I believe the figure is between &euro;333 million and &euro;400 million.  It is not unthinkable and is only justice that the Minister would say that some of that money should go to support those who are the weak now but who were strong in Aer Lingus not very long ago.  It is unthinkable that in the midst of these riches being distributed to the Government we should just say, \"No.  Those who have been impoverished by what has happened to Aer Lingus in recent times, and the pension fund, should be neglected and thrown on the rubbish heap.\"  The Minister has got the money.  He says he will spend it wisely on infrastructure, broadband and items like that but some of it, and I understand it is &euro;40 million or &euro;50 million, could be spared.  I ask the Minister in all sincerity to consider this and give those people who have been weakened by the procedures in Aer Lingus over such a long period their rights and a happy and secure old age.  That is all we ask.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach answered in a derisory way.  He did not answer the arguments but said the Minister had spent a lot of time on it and to let it go.  His speech today was equally disappointing.  What he really said was that the shamrock was being replaced by the fig leaf.  His arguments were very weak and particularly feeble.  He said that we should not worry, the headquarters would remain in Dublin.  It is a meaningless, token gesture.  One could have a headquarters with two men and a dog and we can be sure that is what we will have eventually.  He said it would be registered in Dublin.  That is laughable.  One can have a brass plate and be registered in Dublin, as thousands of investment funds are.  It is meaningless.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach also said we must have more routes to service the multinationals.  If they come, the multinationals will be serviced by the market which will move in to service them as sure as night follows day.  We are not going to create aircraft to bring in multinationals.  The multinationals, when they declare their interest in coming, will immediately create a demand which will be filled by Aer Lingus, as now happens, or other airlines.  We do not need IAG to service the multinationals.  It will happen naturally by way of organic growth.<\/p> <p> The arguments about the slots make me wonder.  I take on board the Minister's point.  He has won a concession, on which I congratulate him.  However, in seven years time the neat distinction between the sale and usage will be made.  While we will have a veto on the sale, if IAG or some other foreign multinational decides what they are used for, there will not be much point in having the rights that go with the sale.  The slots will be used as IAG thinks fit, not as we think fit.  The Minister received a concession on the sale but only for seven years.<\/p> <p> One of the great selling points of the sale is Mr. Willie Walsh, a magnificent Irishman, of whom everybody is proud.  The fact that he, an Irishman whose interests are perceived to lie with Aer Lingus and who was here before, is involved is meant to provide some assurance and seen as an underlying and unwritten little perk, but he will not be there forever.  He may not be there in seven years time.<\/p> <p> The promises of jobs are phantoms.  Let the Minister not tell me that after the takeover has been completed, in four to six months time, if IAG decides the projects which will create the jobs are no longer relevant and profitable, it will go ahead and undertake them.  IAG will not enter into a non-commercial venture to fulfil some clause in the agreement.  It will break the agreement.  That is what rich, capitalist multinationals do, rightly or wrongly.  The Government will be powerless to do anything about it, except to take IAG to the European Court which will take 25 years, by which time it will be a forgotten cause.  I do not believe the Minister has won a significant deal.  I heard him this morning and he interviews very well.  However, he could not answer the question on what would happens if IAG was sold.  I do not know the answer.  However, anybody coming from further afield or some larger group will seek and find a way to break the agreement or abolish and abandon the clauses the Minister anticipates today.<\/p> <p> I do not understand what is happening.  Some presumption is creeping into the lexicon of Fine Gael that biggest is best, that small companies cannot make money and that there are no niche markets.  Aer Lingus is doing extraordinarily well and the heavy lifting has been done.  It is an efficient and profitable company.  It does not aim to fly aircraft from Caracas to Rio de Janeiro or to be a multinational, even on the scale of Ryanair.  Its job is to be profitable and ensure people and cargo can be flown into and out of Ireland.  Since its great downfall approximately a decade ago, it has managed to succeed in doing this magnificently successfully as a small company, with cash in its coffers, profits and people still gainfully employed.  To suggest this is the time to hand it over to a multinational is extraordinary.<\/p> <p> Multinationals get a good deal.  Has the Minister investigated whether this multinational will get up to the same tricks as all of the others and transfer money out in bogus, strange administration charges to get all of the profits out of Ireland and avoid paying tax here?  Has the Minister received an assurance in this regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700034#GG00400","speaker":"953","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432734300,"counter":680,"content":"<p>The manner in which the debate has been organised is disgraceful.  A few hours ago we were handed a speech.  This is an attempt to steam-roll the motion through and push it to a vote tomorrow before workers, their families and the communities which depend on Aer Lingus have a chance to find out about it or, more importantly, object and lobby their Deputies, particularly Labour Party Deputies.  It is an act of treachery by Fine Gael and the Labour Party in selling the last remaining shares in Aer Lingus.  It is yet another broken promise by the Labour Party, the tactics of which seem to be to boycott debates in which it might be held to account in any way, shape or form.  In April 2006, when Fianna F&aacute;il sold 75% of Aer Lingus, Deputy Pat Rabbitte jumped up and down during Leaders' Questions and said: \"The Progressive Democrats has pushed Fianna F&aacute;il so far to the right - it would have been unthinkable even a decade ago that Fianna F&aacute;il would have sold off the national airline in a country that has the strategic requirements of an island nation.\"  Now, the Labour Party has been pushed so far to the right that it is going along with this proposal.<\/p>  <p>  Although we are hearing many fake assurances about jobs and conditions, according to IMPACT, one in four people in Aer Lingus could lose his or her job under the deal if IAG follows the traditional path it has followed so far.  There has not been one word from the Minister about pensions.  Did he receive any assurance about the matter or does he have anything to say about it?  The same assurances were given in 1997 when TEAM Aer Lingus, the maintenance company Aer Lingus used to own, was sold to another multinational giant, SR Technics.  By February 2009, the company had been closed completely, with the loss of 1,300 jobs, and the business moved to Zurich and the Middle East.  The company had been profitable with highly skilled workers, many of whom lived and worked in my constituency.  Why would Aer Lingus be any different in a few years time?  The Taoiseach and the Minister have come away from the CEO of Aer Lingus, not from IAG, with a letter about employment rights and the CEO does not foresee a likelihood of either compulsory redundancies or non-direct employment.  Is the Minister for real?  Is this as good as he gets?  Does he expect people to buy this?  Aer Lingus is already moving to subcontract out and employ non-direct labour on Atlantic routes.  I sent the Minister a letter about the matter and tabled a question on it and he told me to toddle along to Aer Lingus, although the Government had a 25% share in Aer Lingus.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned and the Taoiseach repeated that the Government had better assurances and control over the slots and Aer Lingus than ever before.  It does not.  The Government chose not to exert any control over Aer Lingus.  Its 25% share, combined with the pilots and others, was a very decisive influence, if we had a Government that cared about a national airline, public enterprise and workers' rights.  Selling the last vestiges of control by the public over a strategic asset to a multinational shark is what is going on today.<\/p><p>What else would it do other than cut costs and operate in its own interests?  It will not be acting in the strategic interests of the people of this country.  That is what multinationals do.  The Minister indicated that its preference will be to utilise direct labour, but only where it is efficient and effective to do so, and that it will avoid compulsory redundancies.  It did not rule out compulsory redundancies, however.  There will be redundancies at Aer Lingus, and while they may be voluntary at first they will be compulsory if necessary.  The Minister expects us to think that he has managed to find a way of persuading multinationals to behave differently.  That is amazing given that the record of IAG's previous takeovers suggests the opposite.<br\/><br\/>The Minister also outlined the important contribution that Aer Lingus has made to this country.  He should be seeking to buy more shares in the company in order to renationalise it and to right the wrong Fianna F&aacute;il committed in 2006.  It is the 19th largest indigenous company in this country.  It employs 4,000 people directly and many more indirectly.  Its slots were valued by Deloitte at &euro;925 million and it has net cash reserves of &euro;445 million.  If the Minister could ditch his ideological aversion to public ownership, the taxpayer spends billions of euro attracting this type of company to Ireland and supporting them through IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  This is an indigenous company with a respected brand which contributes to the Exchequer and turns a profit but apparently it must be sold.  The pilots in Aer Lingus have made it clear that IAG needs Aer Lingus rather than it being the other way around.  Aer Lingus has something that other airlines want, namely, the slots in Heathrow Airport.  These slots are invaluable to regional development in Ireland.  Some 25% of business in Shannon and 20% of business in Cork depend on Heathrow.  Control over those slots will be completely lost in seven years time.  This is a small, open economy in a globalised world.  We need a strategic aviation bridge with the rest of the world.  The Government can invest billions of euro of taxpayers' money to prop up failed private banks and developers or to bail out the Quinn Group, Eircom and even a lottery company that is unable to run a successful lottery but it cannot invest in a profitable company like Aer Lingus.  The Minister pretends that the company cannot survive without the deal but he has not outlined the threats that require it to be sold to a shark.  It has survived Ryanair, which it is conveniently forgotten was established with considerable help from Aer Lingus.  It also survived 9\/11 and it has gone on to spawn other companies.<br\/><br\/>The Labour Party thinks it can rush this through the D&aacute;il and present it as a <i>fait accompli<\/i>to the workers and communities of north Dublin, Limerick and Cork in the expectation that people will have forgiven and forgotten by next year's election.  I assure Labour Party Deputies this is just another nail in their coffin.  It will hasten their demise in those aforementioned areas and any attempt to save face will be futile.  Their silence today is deafening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700035#HH00200","speaker":"1195","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432734900,"counter":682,"content":"<p>There is no doubt in my mind that the process under way over the past several months is nothing more than a charade designed to give the illusion that the Government was debating issues and wrestling concessions from IAG, when it had in fact already decided the outcome.  That is not surprising from a Fine Gael point of view.  After all, it was the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, who hand-picked Willie Walsh as chair of the NTMA advisory board, which has responsibility for advising NewEra on the divestment of State assets.  This day is not a surprise, therefore.  It is a vindication of the policies of neoliberalism and privatisation pursued by Fine Gael.  It is an entirely different matter when we examine the record of the Labour Party and what it pretended to stand for when it went to the electorate.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, people all over the country are shocked at what is now happening.  I see myself first and foremost as an Aer Lingus worker.  I am thinking today of the people who built the company.  They got themselves and their children out of bed in the morning to arrive in time for early shifts and to keep the airline afloat.  I am thinking of the pensioners whose retirement income is decimated by the rushed legislation this Government introduced.  Over the last several months, Labour Party Deputies took to the airwaves to say they will make sure the pensioners are protected if the airline is sold.  They promised they would get the money to shore up the living standards of deferred and existing pensioners, some of whom worked and contributed to their pension schemes for 40 years.  They have come up with absolutely nothing, however.<\/p>  <p>  Pride in Aer Lingus is not confined to the workers in the company.  It is an iconic company which is held dear by the travelling public and generations of Irish people.  Not many companies can claim a history of almost 80 years of providing secure, permanent and pensionable employment.  Tens of thousands of people had good jobs in the company at its bases in Dublin, Cork and Shannon.  In the 1980s, Aer Lingus workers paid more taxes than all the farmers in the country.  The company was always a net contributor to the Exchequer.  It supported connectivity and regional development.  It was an important signifier of Ireland as an independent nation, and people valued it as such.<\/p>  <p>  We have been treated to a yarn by the Government that the betrayal put before us today is necessary to secure the airline's future.  That narrative makes me sick because it bears no relationship to reality.  If it was true that Aer Lingus needed somebody to take it over or partner with, surely to God the board and management in which the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport expressed such confidence would have actively sought a partner.  The only reason this deal is on the table is because IAG is acting in the interest of its shareholders, who are resident in Britain, Europe and Qatar.  It is revenue for shareholders that motivates the deal.  The idea that it is in the best interest of Ireland as a small country that cannot survive in the global aviation industry is a joke.  We have been hearing that claim in Aer Lingus for many years.  We heard it after nine-11 and every time a national carrier went to the wall.  We are hearing again today that we should consider the fate of Finnair, Mal&eacute;v and the others.  We are not other airlines, however.  Fine Gael Deputies were speaking about Aer Lingus becoming part of the One World Alliance.  Aer Lingus has a proud tradition of linking up with other airlines but we are also different to other countries because we are the only island nation on the periphery of Europe that does not have a terrestrial link with mainland Europe.<\/p>  <p>  The benefits outlined by the Minister and the Taoiseach in respect of growing the airline and tourism already exist.  The Wild Atlantic Way was supposedly responsible for this previously.  It is ludicrous.  Who owns Aer Lingus is irrelevant from that point of view.  The question is who will benefit from the enormously positive contributions that Aer Lingus makes.  This company has been consistently profitable.  <\/p><p>It is a company that is growing with nine long-haul aircraft booked, and it already has &euro;1 billion in cash reserves.  Therefore, the driver of this sale is not the future of the airline or the public's benefit, but what is in the commercial interests of AIG.  <\/p> <p> The guarantees the Minister talked about are somewhat pathetic.  I would like the Minister to address this B share and the so-called veto he has because it is laughable.  It is unprecedented in terms of world economics and global capitalism.  Given that the Minister will be a captive subsidiary in IAG, how can he guarantee that Aer Lingus will not lease that to IAG, or that IAG would not use it for its own purposes?  I am particularly concerned about the workers, including ground staff.  Allusions to growing staff are just part of an unsubstantiated wish list for future development.  Some of the growth in cabin crew and pilots was there anyway, but the Minister is effectively silent on the decimation of ground crew that will take place.<\/p> <p> The Minister should address the fact that previous so-called legal guarantees and letters of comfort were given to people as assurances that could not be broken, yet they were broken.  The Supreme Court adjudicated that they were broken and the CEO of Aer Lingus at the time, Mr. Willie Walsh, ignored those Supreme Court directives.  Where has the Minister got these magic guarantees that nobody else in the history of humanity has ever got?<\/p> <p> I am delighted that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, has joined us because the appalling lack of Labour Deputies has been quite striking.  I can only ascertain that the reason this is being rammed through is that they want to protect themselves from workers in the communities involved.  I am sorry to disappoint them, but that is not going to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700036#JJ00200","speaker":"1192","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432735500,"counter":684,"content":"<p>I am happy to have the opportunity to address the D&aacute;il regarding what is a positive transaction for Aer Lingus and for Ireland.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, on his concerted efforts over the last number of months.<\/p>  <p>  Today&rsquo;s motion to dispose of the State&rsquo;s minority shareholding in Aer Lingus and the commitments contained within it delivers the best possible outcome for the Irish economy, Aer Lingus, connectivity and jobs.  It is a good outcome for the country.  I also thank the Government steering group which has supported the Minister in his efforts and has also worked to secure the commitments we are discussing today.<\/p>  <p>  I also understand the concerns of employees of Aer Lingus and, in this regard, I note and welcome the commitments from Aer Lingus management to secure high quality jobs today and into the future. <\/p>  <p>  We have come a long way in the last number of years in taking the positive incremental steps necessary to build a strong investment case to recover our financial stability, create jobs and secure economic growth for Ireland.  This has not happened by accident, but through a concerted and deliberate effort led by this Government and supported by the people of Ireland to move our country forward.<\/p>  <p>  In the last number of years we have created an environment of certainty conducive to growth and investment.  We have established certainty around the stability of our financial system; established certainty around our public finances; reaffirmed certainty around our corporate tax position; and reaffirmed certainty that Ireland is a growth-friendly environment for foreign direct investment and local business investment.<\/p>  <p>  Through this transaction we are now establishing certainty around connectivity to and from the island of Ireland for the foreseeable future, including valuable certainty for areas crucial for economic growth across the country and not just in Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  The long-term commitment to connectivity provided by this transaction will de-risk investment into the island of Ireland through guaranteed connectivity to Dublin, Cork, Shannon, Knock and beyond.  Long-term investment decisions, such as foreign direct investment into Ireland, are much easier to make in an environment of certainty.  The level of certainty provided by this transaction, as part of our broader efforts, is supportive of economic growth and will help encourage investment decisions into Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  With this transaction, we are eliminating any potential concerns around long-term reliable air transport to and from Cork, Shannon, Knock and the rest of Ireland through Dublin, further enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness as a destination for investment.  This transaction will give us, for the first time, the ability to provide businesses, consumers, tourists and investors with long-term certainty regarding connectivity for business development and tourism into Cork, Shannon, Knock and more broadly across the island of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  For the first time, the IDA and all of us can point to this certainty with regard to island-wide connectivity in attracting foreign direct investment to, and creating jobs in, the regions.  This significantly enhances the investment case and the resulting potential for job creation.  Securing the future of Aer Lingus and securing the commitments on jobs and connectivity will deliver growth and opportunities across the country.  IAG also recognises the value of, and is committing to protect, the Aer Lingus brand as a visible positive symbol of Ireland.  This growth and IAG&rsquo;s commitments through this transaction will bring significant benefits to Ireland, including increased numbers of passengers, hub traffic, regional connectivity, stop-overs, city breaks, tourists, restaurant dinners served, and hotel beds filled.<\/p>  <p>  I am encouraged that a number of representative groups around the country are seeing this opportunity for themselves in stating their support for this transaction and are demonstrating that confidence in Ireland&rsquo;s potential.  All of the Irish airports are supporting this transaction and see the significant potential benefits and positive opportunity this transaction offers for Ireland and their respective regions.  The tourism industry, represented by Tourism Ireland, ITIC and F&aacute;ilte Ireland, is also supportive of the transaction.  It cites the long-term sustainability this brings to Aer Lingus, as well as the major boost for tourism from North America, continued growth in visitor numbers and revenue for the Irish tourism industry.<\/p>  <p>  The tourism sector is a key source of economic growth and job creation across the country.  The Government has made a major investment in the tourism sector through the reduction of the VAT rate to 9% and the abolition of the air travel tax.  The reaction of the tourism sector to these initiatives over the past four years has been outstanding and overall visitor numbers are up 26% since the low point of 2010.  Thousands of new jobs have been created and I am confident that our dynamic tourism sector will be able to capitalise on today's announcement.<\/p>  <p>  Business groups, including the Irish Exporters' Association and regional chambers of commerce, such as those in Cork and Shannon, have also welcomed the sale citing the improved connectivity it will bring to the region and improved access to export markets supporting Irish economic growth.  It is clear to me that a combination with IAG will contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s economic growth and job creation.  It enhances our position as a natural gateway connecting Europe and North America through additional routes and additional aircraft leading to more direct Aer Lingus jobs; increased passenger numbers travelling through Irish airports and travelling to Irish cities; and, significant indirect job creation through increased airport support services, tourism spend and business investment.  Aer Lingus joining the IAG group will give Irish travellers, tourists, exporters and importers greater access to major traffic flows, which will increase travel connectivity as part of a much larger network and also provide improved access for business interests and for cargo.<\/p>  <p>  I want to spend some time explaining how the commitments which have been described by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, are to be secured, as there has been some discussion and speculation on the strength of these commitments.  These commitments will be secured by providing certain rights to the Minister for Finance through the retention of one share in Aer Lingus which will be re-designated as a B share.  The benefit of these commitments will be conferred on the Minister for Finance as holder of the B share through changes that will be made to the Aer Lingus articles, which will also set out the rights attaching to the B share.<\/p>  <p>  The rights attaching to this B share, as would be enshrined in the Aer Lingus articles, would allow the holder of the B share - that is, the Minister for Finance - to object to any proposed disposal of Aer Lingus&rsquo;s Heathrow slots; any proposed cessation of operation of Aer Lingus&rsquo;s Heathrow slots on certain Irish routes for the five and seven-year periods as previously described; any proposed change of Aer Lingus's company name; any proposed change to the Aer Lingus brand; any proposed change to the Aer Lingus head office location; and, any proposed change to Aer Lingus&rsquo; place of incorporation outside Ireland.  Apart from these rights to object to certain matters, which are the subject of the proposed commitments, the B share would have limited other rights. <\/p><p>For example, the B shareholder will not have rights to receive dividends or to vote at general meetings.<\/p> <p> The Government steering group and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, have secured these commitments following an extended and intensive engagement with IAG.  They have clarified their understanding of IAG&rsquo;s proposal and future plans for Aer Lingus and the commitments offered by IAG on the future ownership and operation of Aer Lingus&rsquo;s Heathrow slots and other matters.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has also engaged with European authorities regarding these commitments and is confident that they are acceptable to the authorities in Europe.<\/p> <p> A new connectivity fund from the potential sale proceeds will be established within and managed on a commercial basis by the Irish Strategic Investment Fund.  The fund will allow for much-needed investment in a range of commercially viable connectivity projects.  The projects should help generate economic impact and competitiveness benefits for Ireland through enhancing our regional connectivity, improving attractiveness and competitiveness in the tourism sector and promoting investment and enhanced opportunities for growth.  For the purposes of the fund, connectivity will be broadly defined.  Therefore, connectivity will be taken to include traditional transport-type projects, such as ports and airports, and access to such assets.  However, it will also take a wider definition of connectivity to include, for example, data connectivity, including broadband and energy connectivity and other related projects.  Under section 46 of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014, I am empowered to bring a resolution to the Houses of the Oireachtas setting out the proposed payment to the Irish Strategic Investment Fund.  I propose to do this in due course.<\/p> <p> The opportunity has presented itself and it is up to us as a nation, confident in our ability to perform at the highest level on the world stage, to take advantage of this opportunity, not through protectionist measures and fear of loss but through confidence in our abilities to attract the tourists, bring in the foreign direct investment, establish the small businesses and create the jobs.

I echo the comments of the Minister for Finance in commending the efforts of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe, and the Government's steering group in bringing the potential deal to the point where the Government is now prepared to seek the approval of the House for it.<\/p><p>The decision taken by the Government yesterday represents an opportunity, not a threat, for Ireland, its regions and particularly for the new people who will be employed at a reinvigorated Aer Lingus.  It will provide security for the existing workforce and, ultimately, the best return for the taxpayer.  There should be no crocodile tears on the other side of the House.  Fianna F&aacute;il privatised Aer Lingus and received terms for 75% of its shareholding that were far less substantive than those negotiated by this Government for the balance of shares now proposed to be sold.  We should not pretend that the decision facing the Government was between the IAG offer or a rosy <i>status quo<\/i>that might endure forever.  Everybody in Aer Lingus knows that jobs and profitability, which are connected, are ultimately determined by the sale of seats.  That is the only constant in the airline business.  The airline business is one of constant change and it was by adopting to the changing market that Aer Lingus evolved from a State airline at a time when only the most advantaged could afford anything but the occasional flight into a successful era of mass air transit in which we now live.<\/p><p>The Government's decision was arrived at following one of the most extensive debates about State assets that has ever taken place here.  This is the fourth time the Irish State has had to consider proposals for the takeover of Aer Lingus since it was originally privatised by the Government of which Deputy Martin was member.  The State's shareholding in Aer Lingus is one of the assets originally included in the State asset disposal programme agreed by the Government in 2012.  However, at that time, the Government made it clear that the shareholding would only be sold when market conditions were right and on terms and at a price that were acceptable to the Government and in the best interests of the Irish people.  Since that time, the Government has rejected a bid from Ryanair to take over Aer Lingus, and in February this year, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport indicated that the information and commitment provided at that time by IAG did not provide the basis on which this Government would be prepared to commit to accept IAG's offer on its shareholding.  This demonstrates that the Government is prepared to refuse to sell its shareholding in Aer Lingus in circumstances where the Government is not convinced this is the right thing to do.<\/p><p>This is now no longer the case.  Since the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport outlined the Government's position on the IAG offer last February, the steering group appointed by the Government and its advisers has continued to engage with IAG on the details of the offer.  The engagement included detailed discussions on future plans for Aer Lingus, its route network, attention and use of all its Heathrow slots and employment in the company.  Crucially, it also took in commitments that IAG was prepared to offer on these matters.  I am pleased to tell the House that these negotiations have been fruitful and the proposed terms of the deal now on offer have been considered and accepted by the Government.  They are now recommended for approval by this House.<\/p><p>I will not repeat the detailed terms of the deal, which have already been outlined by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport who is present beside me.  However, I am satisfied that the deal now on offer is in the best interests of Aer Lingus, its employees, the Irish travelling public, and also the Irish State.  The addition of Aer Lingus to the IAG group will be as a separate and distinct airline, which is important.  Brand Aer Lingus flying the flag will not only be retained but the shamrock will be seen in ever more places because of this deal.  The airline will retain its logo and brand and this process will safeguard the future of Aer Lingus and its employees.  The commitments secured from IAG and which will be enshrined in the articles of association of the company will ensure continued international connectivity for Ireland and ensure the continuation of existing Government aviation policy, which is based on competition between at least two airlines with significant home bases in the Irish market.<\/p><p>I welcome too the commitments offered to the existing workforce in Aer Lingus.  As the chief executive officer has indicated to the Minister, he remains committed to an employer-employee engagement model that has unions and the State's industrial relations apparatus at its heart.  I have no doubt in the capacity of our trade union movement to represent their members effectively in that environment.<\/p><p>Whereas the future plans for the operation of Aer Lingus and the commitments that IAG have offered in that regard were crucial factors in the Government's consideration of the deal on offer, the Government also had to consider the issue of the price being offered for its shares.  We know that the board of Aer Lingus has publicly stated that the financial terms of the proposal are at a level which it is willing to recommend to Aer Lingus shareholders.  The Government's steering group has also considered this issue of price, and it has received detailed valuation advice from its independent financial advisers, appointed specifically to do that job.  The financial advisers have considered a range of different valuation methodologies and their conclusion is that the price on offer of &euro;2.50 cash per share, which values the State's shareholding at &euro;335 million, is a fair price.  The steering group has therefore advised the Government that it considers the price on offer to be acceptable as a fair price for the State's shareholding, and the Government has accepted this view.<\/p><p>It should also be remembered that the original rationale for including Aer Lingus shareholding in the programme for sale of State assets was to realise proceeds that the Government could use to the greatest extent possible to support and sustain economic opportunities, employment and jobs.  I am pleased to say that, in so far as that objective is concerned, the Government has agreed that the proceeds of a sale of the Government's Aer Lingus shareholding are to be made available exclusively for this purpose.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the proceeds arising from the sale of the State's shares in Aer Lingus will be classified under EUROSTAT rules as proceeds from a financial transaction and, as such, the money received will not have any beneficial impact on Ireland's general government balance.  As a result, from a budgetary perspective, the proceeds received will not provide the Government with any capacity for additional direct government expenditure, whether capital or current, without this impacting on our general government balance.  Therefore, the proceeds cannot be used to fund additional direct Exchequer expenditure.  However, the Government has always been determined that the proceeds should be utilised to assist in supporting and sustaining jobs and our recovery.  The Government has therefore agreed that the proceeds received if a sale proceeds are to be used to establish a new fund to be called a \"connectivity fund\" which will be dedicated to enhancing connectivity both within and without the State.  The fund will be structured as a sub-portfolio of the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, and will be managed and controlled by ISIF in the same way as it manages its existing portfolio.  The fund will operate on a commercial basis in order not to have any negative impact on Ireland's GGB.  It will be able to support commercial projects with a connectivity theme.  I refer to both domestic and international connectivity.  For the purposes of the fund \"connectivity\" has been broadly defined.  Therefore, in addition to being available to support traditional transport projects including the development of airports and ports and access to those, the fund will also be open to providing support for projects that involve a wider definition of \"connectivity\".  This will include data connectivity, broadband, fibre optic cables, interconnectors and so on as well as energy connectivity including energy interconnectors.  These wider connectivity requirements are becoming increasingly important as our country's core infrastructure meets the need to improve as the economy grows.  It is particularly important as we are an island nation and ours is an open economy.<\/p> <p> Accepting the deal on offer from IAG is in Ireland's best interests.  The proceeds arising from the transaction if it proceeds will be made available by the Government to enhance connectivity and to support the ongoing main task of the Government of sustaining full employment.  I commend the general principles of the sale to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700038#LL00400","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432736700,"counter":690,"content":"<p>Deputies Dara Calleary and Niall Collins have ten minutes each.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700039#MM00200","speaker":"1012"},{"type":"speech","time":1432736700,"counter":691,"content":"<p>Let us face the fact that this proceeding is not a debate, but rather statements.  We will arrive in here at approximately this time tomorrow and the Government will use its majority.  If it were a debate, we would have a chance to tease through some of the issues that have been raised.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, cited his expert group giving one price while P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh of Aer Arran who knows something about flying a plane says we should be getting &euro;3 per share.  If this was a debate, we would be able to tease that out.  It is extraordinary that the Taoiseach during Leaders' Questions spoke for the Minister, Deputy Howlin, saying neither of them had sight of the Nyras report.  He is the Taoiseach and I presume he is correct as Taoisigh normally are.  The Nyras report was commissioned by IAG and the board of Aer Lingus to look at potential cost savings including redundancies.  On the one hand this process is about job creation, yet the big white elephant with the green shamrock on its tail is the Nyras report.  IAG and Aer Lingus did not commission that report for fun.  They commissioned it with the serious intent of looking at the business model of Aer Lingus and ways the takeover would achieve what it needs to for them.  What it needs to do for them is add to their bottom line in the most extensive way possible.  Fair dues to them, IAG is a publicly quoted company and has a justification to make a return to shareholders.  Aer Lingus will now be part of that culture.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Howlin, is right and the Aer Lingus brand and the shamrock will be in more places across the world.  I hope it will be there in ten years when the guarantees have run out and Willie Walsh has moved on to another job and there is someone in charge of IAG who does not really care about Aer Lingus except about the bottom line.  In fairness to Willie Walsh, he has been very clear in saying this morning that he is in favour of what this brings to IAG.  That is his job.  Somewhere along the line, we are not getting the chance or the opportunity, notwithstanding that a commitment was given that this would come back to the transport committee, for a line by line analysis of any deal.  The committee was to go through everything that was committed to and tease it out.  If the D&aacute;il, which the Taoiseach called \"this premier Chamber\" this morning, meant anything, we would be having that discussion rather than a series of statements.  I say one thing, the Minister says another, it goes around the Chamber and the questions are not actually answered.  Nevertheless, there will be a vote here tomorrow and it will be phenomenally successful for the Government.  Meanwhile, the questions will still be there.<\/p>  <p>  Why is Aer Lingus as close to the Irish people as it is?  It is for many reasons.  It is our national airline, but most importantly, the flying experience for those of us who are lucky enough to have flown with the carrier is always positive.  It is positive on the back of the staff who do not do what other airlines do.  They take an interest in people and are concerned about them.  Aer Lingus has always been there for the country in good times and, especially, in bad.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ring, and I both know that on occasion that involves bringing people home to funerals.  Aer Lingus has always stood in and done it when other airlines would not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700039#MM00300","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speech","time":1432736700,"counter":692,"content":"<p>They robbed them in the early years when there was no competition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700039#MM00400","speaker":"1074"},{"type":"speech","time":1432736700,"counter":693,"content":"<p>They will rob them even more now.

Deputy Martin spoke this morning about the papers that are there for the Taoiseach to see if he took an interest in the agreements.  While we sold it, Labour in particular made commitments around the country on the northside of Dublin and down in Clare and Cork to protect Aer Lingus and would not let this happen.  The Labour Party made a big scene in Killarney in February when it sat on a Sunday and said \"No deal, no deal\".  Suddenly and out of nowhere comes this and it is rammed through before the Government goes home for the weekend.  The ultimate irony of this is that one of the commitments the Labour Party apparently secured is a registered employment agreement as part of the Aer Lingus deal, but the legislation to underpin REAs, which was due to be discussed tomorrow, has been taken off the D&aacute;il schedule to allow this charade of a debate to continue.  The underpinning for an REA which is part of a deal we are supposed to vote on tomorrow is not in place because of the manner in which the Government has introduced this discussion.<\/p>  <p>  I have no doubt about the Minister's good intentions in this.  I acknowledge the work he has put in.  However, that counts for nothing.  The Minister knows that as he is used to big business.  In ten years' time, they will be exposed as counting for nothing because IAG is a publicly quoted company with an eye on the bottom line.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, was right in one thing he said which was that the airline business is massively floating.  It comes up and it comes down and is the first sector to respond in a negative way to a fall in the economy.  That will happen.  There will be a decline in the economic growth that is currently taking place and the first thing to suffer will be Aer Lingus.  The brand may not suffer, but the services will.  While the Minister has the elephant in the room that is the Nyras report, he cannot expect the D&aacute;il, in particular if he believes in the primacy of the Chamber and its ability to ask questions, to approve the deal without responding to it and its recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  There are so many issues we are not getting a chance to look at and tie down.  Various Ministers have spoken about the employment potential while ignoring Nyras and the redundancies that will now happen at Dublin Airport.<\/p><p>They are ignoring the fact that seven planes are on order for Aer Lingus at the moment, which will result in about 500 jobs for crew, regardless of whether this deal goes ahead.  They are ignoring the fact that Aer Lingus has built up a very good business in the transit of regional passengers from across the UK through Dublin on transatlantic flights, because of the ability to get pre-clearance and so forth.  They are ignoring the fact that could grow, if work was put into it, and that in itself would produce additional employment, without any IAG takeover.  They are ignoring the fact that Aer Lingus has record cash reserves and has out-performed many of the components of IAG by being an independent stand-alone airline.  In an analysis of independent airlines, many of the airlines that come within the IAG portfolio have underperformed. <\/p> <p> There has been a lot of talk about regional connectivity.  I will let Deputy Niall Collins speak for the people of Shannon, although they are well able to speak for themselves.  We have one connection out of Ireland West Airport Knock to Gatwick.  I know that connection will continue, because the airport is a commercial airport.  It has to survive commercial realities, but it is a good commercial service and will continue.  We do not have the fear of the State-run airports, which are running out to welcome this deal with huge haste.  I know the airport will continue due to demand for its service and, perhaps, price reductions, as the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, has already outlined.<\/p> <p> The Minister is ten months in office.  I respectfully point out to him that he still has to visit personally Ireland West Airport Knock.

There has been a lot of dishonesty on the Government's part in its presentation of the case to dispose of the 25.1% shareholding.  It keeps getting thrown at this side of the House that we disposed of 75% of the company, which is true.  Quite rightly, we keep pointing out that, as a result of disposing of 75% of the shareholding of the company, we now have a successful company, which is in a strong position and which has grown and gone from strength to strength following that privatisation.  The privatisation allowed the company to decouple from absolute political interference in its day-to-day running.  It allowed the company to restructure, sell and market itself and to grow its market share, which it has done exponentially over the past number of years.  That decision, which Fine Gael and the Labour Party in opposition rejected roundly and called us out on, has now been shown to be a success.  It is now okay to dispose of 100% of the company although it was not okay to dispose of 75% of the company.  There lies the hypocrisy in the Government's position, which it has been offering by way of justification, over the past number of days.<\/p>  <p>  It is ironic that the trade union movement is almost unanimous, to a man and to a woman, right across it, in its opposition to this proposed deal with IAG.  It was also ironic yesterday that the airport companies were cited as being in support of this proposal.  The Government's announcement was made without any reference to this Chamber.  We have only these sham statements today, rather than a proper D&aacute;il debate.  The documentation has not been furnished to us, as Members of the Oireachtas, so that we could have the detail and read ourselves into the minutiae of the deal.  This debate is based on what we are hearing on the news, on the airwaves and in the newspapers.  Airport companies were cited as being in support of this proposal.  These are State-owned.  These are people who work for the Government.  The boards of these airports were appointed by the Government.  All these people have vested interests in the Government because they are an extension of the Government.  Therefore why would they not?  They are compromised in their ability to be critical in this debate.  They cannot come to it from an objective point of view.<\/p>  <p>  The management of the news cycle and the media has been cynical and the public will see through it.  I do not believe a sale of the shareholding in Aer Lingus to IAG and the subsuming of Aer Lingus into the IAG group is the only show in town.  It has been shown that Aer Lingus has been successful in its restructuring.  We can look to other airlines such as EasyJet and Ryanair and how they have grown.  They are similar in size.  Ryanair has grown from a passenger base of 11 million in 2000 to more than 100 million today.  EasyJet carries 60 million passengers.  They have demonstrated how they can do it on their own and by not having to opt in to being part of a larger group.<\/p>  <p>  On the valuation of the company, critical questions need to be answered and this issue needs to be highlighted.  The 24 Heathrow landing slots have been valued at approximately &euro;400 million.  P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, the former Aer Arann CEO, to whom Deputy Calleary referred, has stated that, with a share price of approximately &euro;3, the company would be valued at &euro;1.7 billion.  We are getting in or around &euro;340 million.  There is a discount built into that but no one has addressed why that discount is being factored into the offer this Government will potentially accept.<\/p>  <p>  The takeover deal is anti-competitive.  If there is a trend or a drift towards consolidation and the centralisation to a small number of carriers of service provision to passengers in the airline industry, like in North America where up to four carriers are carrying nearly 80% of the traffic, a monopoly-type situation arises and that is not good.<\/p>  <p>  On connectivity and regional connectivity, a two-tier recovery is afoot in this country.  We have Dublin and the east coast and then we have the regions.  There is no doubt that this will impact ultimately on the regions' competitiveness and connectivity.  I will tell the House why.  We had a situation in Limerick in 2007.  Many of those present will remember it.  The Shannon-Heathrow slot was moved temporarily from Shannon to Belfast.  This was a huge local campaign.  It is ironic that people in this Chamber and beyond who campaigned and called out the Government at the time, and rightly so, to have that slot reinstated and to have the connectivity reinstated, are mute now.  I wonder why.  Why are we not hearing from those people who took a position of strength in opposition?<\/p>  <p>  Connectivity to the Limerick and mid-west regions is essential.  We do not have guarantees.  The Minister will tell us that he has guarantees.  How will those guarantees be called into effect after the term expires?  That is a big known unknown in the future and it is a worry for the region.  What if, for example, the guarantees are reneged upon and there is recourse to the courts?  We will have restoration, but the restoration or the penalty could be financial.  In most instances, it will be financial and not restorative.  The connectivity might not be restored.  Limerick and the mid west region will be left at a disadvantage.  I am sorry to say this, but I do not accept the guarantees are cast iron, despite the Minister's assurances.  The narrative throughout the debate has been that these guarantees on connectivity will be cast iron and legally enforceable.  What if Qatar Airways comes in, as has been widely reported, and commences a takeover of IAG or if IAG decides to sell out to it?<\/p>  <p>  We have seen the situation regarding the M20 motorway from Limerick to Cork which has been shelved under the Minister's stewardship.  I have taken the Minister to task on this issue before and I will take him to task on it again.  We are at a disadvantage in Limerick in terms of it being a region.  This deal with Aer Lingus will ultimately enhance the anti-regional agenda which inhibits balanced regional development by the Government.<\/p><p>We have seen it in terms of the road network - I have already referred to the M20 as well as Shannon Airport.  Now, ultimately, we are looking at a situation where the Government will not have representation at board level whereby, in concert with another small shareholding group, for example, the pilots or other shareholders, they could direct the situation in respect of the use of the slots.  This is putting us at a major disadvantage.<\/p> <p> I put it to the Minister that, ultimately, this is a bad deal.  The situation as demonstrated by Ryanair and EasyJet goes to the heart of it.  Aer Lingus can survive on its own.  It is surviving and flourishing.  It has been a success for this country.  It has demonstrated that much and it can go from strength to strength.  It can go further.<\/p> <p> What we heard this morning in respect of the Nyras report is concerning.  The report, which was commissioned jointly by the boards of Aer Lingus and IAG, was only to be seen by the respective board members.  Thankfully, someone leaked it and we now have the benefit of it.  It is particularly disturbing when we hear that those on the Aer Lingus board - this was offered as part of the debate - are recommending this deal.  Of course they are recommending the deal.  The board members stand to benefit financially by a great deal of money.  That is a fact.  I do not know the exact figure but it is several million euro.  The individual board members stand to gain a great deal out of this and naturally they will recommend it.<\/p> <p> Costs will be 40% higher.  The report identifies job cuts in the following areas: ground handling by 20%, catering by 40%, maintenance by 15%, and cuts in the area of heavy maintenance to eastern Europe.  There will be job cuts and job losses.  IAG has said nothing to us about the creation of new jobs.  A total of 500 jobs has been mentioned, but they are on the way because of increases in the transatlantic routes in any event.  There will be job losses, unfortunately, and nothing in the presentation by the Minister has dealt with that.<\/p> <p> My last point relates to the pensioners.  The fact that there is nothing in the deal for Aer Lingus pensioners is a sad indictment of the situation.  We all know the situation they have endured in terms of the deficit in their pension fund.  The Minister has referred to creating a connectivity fund, but there is nothing going into the pension fund of the men and women who built up Aer Lingus to what it is today, and that is something the Minister needs to revisit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700040#NN01000","speaker":"1057","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432737900,"counter":717,"content":"<p>Next to speak is the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, followed by Deputy Deasy.

I have seen how hard he has worked in the Department in recent months on this issue.  I also compliment and thank the officials within the Department for the work, effort and commitment they have put in with the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  This is a different deal to the deal offered several months ago.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has been a skilful negotiator.  He has done a great job for the country.  I wish to compliment him publicly in the D&aacute;il today.<\/p>  <p>  I believe this is good deal for Ireland, Aer Lingus and the workers.  In the next year we will have 150 new jobs.  In the coming years we will have 635 new jobs.  I listened to Deputy Calleary and he is correct in what he says.  I am a supporter of Aer Lingus and I have always been but I want to go back a little because he reminded me of something.  As a Minister of State I went around this country as well as Britain and America.  I talked to our diaspora there and asked them to come back to Ireland again.  The one common denominator among our diaspora was the sense of how they were ripped off by Aer Lingus, particularly at the most sensitive time, for example, if a mother, father, brother or sister had died in this country.  If they wanted to get a flight out of New York, then, by God, did they pay for the flight out of New York.<\/p>  <p>  I speak as Minister of State with responsibility for tourism.  I assure the House that capacity has increased in recent years.  We have 40% new capacity into this country.  That is why we have more and more visitors coming in.  I offer some figures for today.  Overall trips to Ireland for the first three months of this year have been up by 13.5% on the same three months last year.  A total of 1,778,000 people came into this country to visit us.  The figures from North America were up by 20%.  Visitor figures from mainland Europe were up by 14.7% and visitor figures from the rest of the world increased by 23.6%.  The reason this happened is because we have more carriers, more airlines and more competition in this country.<\/p>  <p>  I remember two years ago when the Shannon Airport debt was taken over by the Government and the Shannon authority handed over the independent running of the airport.  Deputy Calleary will remember that Deputy Dooley and Fianna F&aacute;il sent out a press release to the effect that Knock Airport was the big winner, that Shannon was finished and that we would never see another flight into Shannon.

I hope that as a result of this new deal to be completed in the coming months Knock Airport will gain.  We want more carriers, services and flights into Knock.  In particular, we want more flights into rural Ireland.  I want to see Knock, Shannon and Cork get their fair share of the cake.  I want to see this new company bringing extra flights into Cork, Shannon and Knock airports so that we will have plenty of visitors coming into the regions as well.  We do not want everything coming into Dublin.  As a Minister of State acting in the national interest, I like Dublin and I like to see people coming into Dublin, but we want to bring them into the regions as well.  That is why we have the Wild Atlantic Way and the Ireland's Ancient East and the Lakelands.  I was there yesterday.  Everyone is out working and trying to get people into their area and their country.  That is what we want to see happening.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has worked hard at this deal and it is a good deal for the country.  Secretly, Fianna F&aacute;il and some of the Independents are disappointed that we got such a good deal.  They were hoping there would be no deal  but there is one.  This will secure the future of Aer Lingus.  The company will have its own brand.  We will still have the carriers carrying the slogan of Aer Lingus.  There is no doubt that we will have more capacity and more flights with this company.<\/p>  <p>  Willie Walsh has a connection with the country, he is an Irishman.  I am sure he will wear the green jersey.  I am sure that, at times, if there is a little business that can be put the Irish way he will do that.

He will want to see people employed.  He will want to see a stronger and better Aer Lingus and that is what we are going to have.  It will be stronger and better with more workers and more connecting flights into the country.  Is that not what we have been seeking for the past 20 years?<\/p>  <p>  I know this will work.  We have a good deal.  My ministerial colleague has worked hard with the officials in the Department.  They have done a good deal for Ireland.

If that is the case, part of the &euro;325 million needs to be invested directly into Waterford Airport to finally allow for the proposed runway extension to be funded.  If Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Opposition generally oppose this sale they could, with a capital \"C\", be opposing the potential investment of this money into projects that are badly needed and that need to be completed throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  When it comes to the south east, the economic development or environment remains bad.  It is in bad shape, but improving.  For the first time in years we are seeing an appreciable pick-up in investment from abroad.  The placement of an IDA Ireland regional director in the south east is making a significant difference when it comes to co-ordinating the various components of inward investment.  That is not conjecture, it is reality.<\/p><p>I regard Waterford Regional Airport remaining open as one of the most important factors in any recovery in my constituency.  The airport is operating commercial flights, including a direct flight to London Luton Airport.  All of this has not been easy; in fact, it has been extremely difficult.  In this regard, let me refer to the last Administration.  In the case of the airport, it was a case of spectacular announcements on runway extensions costing tens of millions of euro, but it all came to nothing.  Apart from the motorway, it is fair to say the last Administration left key infrastructure in my constituency, including the airport, in very bad shape.  For me in the past four years, it has been a question of making argument upon argument for OPEX and CAPEX funding to remain at the airport in Waterford, even when there were no commercial flights in operation.  Where does Fianna F&aacute;il stand on Waterford Regional Airport and the money from the sale of Aer Lingus potentially being used to fund infrastructure around the country?  For that matter, where do Sinn F&eacute;in and the rest of the Opposition stand?  Last month, not only did commercial flights begin again but an arbitration case concerning land adjacent to the airport was finally dealt with.  All planning permission and arbitration matters have been resolved.  Everything is ready.  All we need is the money we have been starved of for years.<\/p> <p> One aspect of the so-called regional windfall announced last night and this morning sets off tiny alarm bells.  It now seems as if the distribution of the proceeds from the sale of Aer Lingus will be dealt with in a similar manner to distribution under the strategic investment fund, which fund has not worked very well to date.  Of its &euro;5 billion to &euro;6 billion, just over &euro;100 million has actually been invested.  It has not worked well, which is why the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is reworking its parameters in respect of how it can be better used for investment regionally.  I know about this because I amended the Bill to actually have a reporting requirement for the regional aspects in the annual report.  If the Minister is planning on selling the concept of the sale to the regions, he should come up with something better than the strategic investment fund as a model.  If this means testing state aid rules and the European Commission&rsquo;s stance on ports and airports, so be it.  If the sale advances through the various hurdles ahead and the proceeds in part are dedicated to ensuring regional connectivity, including ports and airports, nobody can ignore it in this House.  Thus far, there has been a rush to condemn and oppose the arrangement for the sake of it.  There have been plenty of anti-capitalist speeches and the like.<\/p> <p> I warn the Government that when it comes to funding key infrastructure in my constituency, we are wary of aspirational policy statements.  We have reason to be wary.  I want to know definitively whether the projects in my constituency will be financed because of the sale, particularly as it pertains to the airport.  It begs the question as to whether the Minister knew that the operation of the strategic investment fund was being completely redrawn.  If he did know this, how will he ensure the proceeds of the sale will definitely go where they are needed?  What is the difference between a &euro;5 billion strategic investment fund that is not working well and a &euro;5.35 billion strategic investment fund that is not working so well?  The Minister needs to explain the difference between the positions two days ago and today and leave the aspirational stuff out of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700041#OO01200","speaker":"1091","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432738500,"counter":729,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate, both as a Deputy representing County Mayo in the west and as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications which facilitated a series of meetings of all stakeholders, including Aer Lingus, its CEO, Mr. Stephen Kavanagh, IAG chief executive, Mr. Willie Walsh, Stobart Air, the unions, the pilots, the chambers of commerce and the representatives of the airport.  I pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, for the way he has intensively thrown himself into this proposal that was put before him and also the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, and all others involved in the Department.  At the beginning I believed there were many risks involved and that considerable clarity and certainty were required. I am glad that all of the hearings of the transport committee gave the public a sense of what was on offer.  In parallel and in order to reach the current phase of the process, considerable analysis was required in the Department under the Minister's direction.  I have come from a place where I may have been a doubting Thomas to one where I am very strongly in support of what we have seen before us in the past 24 hours.  Many of the arguments were teased out and many of the questions answered straightforwardly.  The guarantees, clarity and certainty sought were forthcoming.<\/p>  <p>  Let us consider the issues regarded by everybody in Ireland with emotion.  They include the retention of the Aer Lingus brand, the retention of the headquarters in Dublin and the number of jobs to be created.  There is to be net job growth of 150 by next year and 625 by 2020.  There are to be no forced redundancies or job losses, as such.  There may be a need for some reallocation of roles.  If Aer Lingus, as a very strong, well organised company in recent years, was able to look after this area in a downturn, how much more will it be able to do so in times of growth?<\/p>  <p>  Let us consider the idea of connectivity.  As the regional Member or Member from the west, I note that Dublin, as a hub, will gain a lot from the deal.  That is to be welcomed, but it should not happen at the expense of either Shannon or Cork Airport or Ireland West Airport Knock which is obviously close to my heart and those of the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, and Deputy Michelle Mulherin.  It became very clear at meetings that both Aer Lingus and IAG referred specifically to the existing Aer Lingus connectivity between Gatwick Airport and Shannon Airport.  Over 500,000 passengers have used that route in recent years and 70,000 used it in 2014.  The added strength and selling power of IAG and British Airways will only improve these figures.<\/p>  <p>  Another significant aspect is the potential for tourism.  This has been exploited by the Government.  Both the Minister and the Minister of State, through their capacity for marketing, and the agencies of which they are in charge, including Bord F&aacute;ilte and Tourism Ireland, have been responsible for initiatives such as The Gathering, the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and the abolition of the travel tax.  These are all part of the foundations.  The Aer Lingus deal will build on them and create further growth.<\/p>  <p>  I note Ireland West Airport Knock&rsquo;s welcoming of the proposal announced last night.  It looks forward to working with the new company when this becomes possible.  Historically, there was a transatlantic flight into Knock airport, which is to resume later this summer on a once-off basis.  I understand it is to be an Aer Lingus flight.  The CEO, Mr. Stephen Kavanagh, was directly involved in the matter himself and I hope it will lead to future growth.<\/p><p> Aer Lingus has a strong balance sheet and has done well over the past number of years.  It is a top player as an individual company but when a top player that has been fine tuned and restructured over a number of years enters a bigger team with other top players, if I can use sporting parlance here, it will be in a position to win some trophies as a result of the strength of the team it is joining by way of more market share, more passengers and more routes.  This has also been articulated in the deal.  Under the deal, there will be a veto on selling the slots and a guarantee that the slots will remain where they are for seven years.  I commend the Government on this.  I know that when Willie Walsh appeared before the committee when the matter was being teased out and was asked whether he would increase the guarantee from five to seven, eight or ten years, he said that his second offer was never as good as his first.  I am glad to see that the Minister has convinced him otherwise.  <\/p> <p> I very much welcome what we have seen in the past 24 hours.  We will have far more in addition to what we now have.  I was glad to hear that the value of this deal was tested by the Minister independently of Aer Lingus or anyone else to see whether it was the best possible deal now or better than any deal that might be possible in the future and would future-proof the Aer Lingus brand and protect it from all the volatility that has been seen in the aviation market over the years.  Perhaps I am wrong but the previous Government sold 75% of Aer Lingus for something like &euro;269 million.  I think this is &euro;1 billion plus for 25% of it.  I very much welcome this and the journey on which it has brought the public and people who had concerns.  I am glad to see this finally going ahead and I commend this motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700042#PP00200","speaker":"1073","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432739100,"counter":731,"content":"<p>It is important that as many Deputies as possible speak on this debate because it is very important.  Not only that, it is important that as many Deputies as possible then vote on this.  It will be remembered in a negative way because we are an island nation and are looking to ensure that we will have no control over connectivity with other countries.  Some people might be too young to remember some changes that took place in respect of Ireland's connectivity with Great Britain and Europe.  We had ferry links in the past which served the country very well.  In the 1960s, one of those companies was nationalised.  In 1992, the State sold off B&amp;I Ferries.  I was quite young at the time and felt that it was a bad decision.  I still believe it was a bad decision to sell off a company that allowed us to control ferries to Great Britain in particular.  I remember some of the arguments at the time which were that most people were using aeroplanes, that this was the future transport mode and that we controlled Aer Lingus.  At the time, we did control it and the Heathrow slots.  In 1992, we were guaranteed that Aer Lingus would serve the nation, that it would continue to do so in perpetuity and that it was a highly profitable company that provided dividends to its primary shareholder, namely, the Government, since it was first set up.<\/p>  <p>  We now see the hypocrites who are not in the Chamber and who condemn the selling off of shares in Aer Lingus proposed by the Minister, namely, Fianna F&aacute;il.  It did the damage and set up Aer Lingus for sale.  Aer Lingus is no longer a State company and will definitely not be a State company if the Minister has his way on the vote on the motion tomorrow.  The Minister has set up Aer Lingus to be totally controlled by the market for profit.  Profit is king.  Profitable capitalist companies could not care less about the national interest so the 1% share is meaningless and will be meaningless in the future.  Five, seven or ten years down the line, those slots will be up for sale when and if IAG decides to sell them.  If it decides to move heaven and earth in the future away from Aer Lingus headquarters here, it will be able to do so because it will have directorships and the directorships of IAG, like those of any company, mean that the profit of the company is king.  The onus is on the shareholders.  At least, the Government now has a shareholding that is large enough to have some kind of influence on the board of Aer Lingus.  It will have no influence in the future other than the national legislation under which we in this Chamber try to impose some controls.  That is about it.  There might be controls if the UK decides to stay in the EU rather than extract itself from it if it holds the referendum next year and if IAG continues to headquarter in Great Britain.  Again, we have no control over that.  We had some say in terms of Aer Lingus and its operations in the future.  <\/p>  <p>  We have already seen what happens when an airline is taken over by IAG in terms of job losses.  I know that commitments have been given.  Those commitments are not worth the paper they are written on.  I might be proved wrong in time but I am not willing to take that chance.  I believe we should refuse to allow this airline to be sold off.  I heard the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform who was absolutely comical.  He was cribbing that this was the fourth time he had to deal with a bid to sell Aer Lingus.  The only reason he had to deal with a bid four times is because he said from day one that it was for sale.  If he said from day one that it is a State asset and that it is in our national interest to retain it in public ownership as a public utility, nobody would have been making a bid for it but no, this Government came into power and set out a list of State assets that were to be sold off, some of which have been sold off and some of which have not.  <\/p><p>Some assets were not sold because the Government did not believe it was profitable enough to do so at that stage.  It was not that it was against a sale or that it believed control of these assets should stay in public ownership.  Some public assets or some of the family silver have been sold.  <br\/><br\/>The Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport who spoke earlier on this issue started bellowing about the west.  As I have spent a lot of time and went to school there, I understand a lot of what has happened there in the past 40 or 50 years.  This Government's policy on the west is a continuation of a previous policy, namely, b&aacute;n&uacute; na t&iacute;re or emigration.  It only wants airlines to serve the west in order that people can return as tourists rather than live here.  Shouting and bellowing that something is good does not make it so.  It is either good or bad and, in this case, it is bad.  Once Aer Lingus is gone, it will be gone forever more and unless the Minister starts to buy back shares, he will not have control of it.  <br\/><br\/>This is all about short-sighted gains.  The valuable slots to which the Minister referred are not and will not be protected in perpetuity, never mind the fact that the money the Government will receive for its shareholding is peanuts in comparison to what it should be.  This is not even a good deal from a commercial perspective.  There are real concerns about the future for workers at Aer Lingus, as well as for current and deferred pensioners.  There is a case still to be answered by the Government regarding Aer Lingus pensioners which will now be passed on to a private company.  <br\/><br\/>Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Hancock points out in an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>today that Mr. Willie Walsh will not be with IAG forever.  The Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and many Government backbenchers have referred to the fact that he is Irish.  The Minister of State has suggested he will come back to Ireland one day, but we do not know that for definite.  Even if he does come back, that does not make him the greatest Irish man alive.  There are many Irish men who are at the head of companies who could not care less about Ireland.  Equally, there are many people who are well known in Ireland who have located their moneys and interests abroad.  That is true in the case of some of the most high profile Irish people.  <br\/><br\/>To return to Mr. Hancock's article and the point that Mr. Walsh will not be with IAG forever, as Mr. Hancock points out, &quot;who's to say that his successor will be as enthusiastic about its investment in Aer Lingus?  Especially if IAG hits some turbulence.&quot;  We have all seen in the past 30 years the level of turbulence in the airline industry generally.  Mr. Hancock goes on to say UK airline BMI &quot;withered on the vine under Lufthansa's ownership and Air France off-loaded its Swords-based subsidiary CityJet when it no longer fit its investment criteria.&quot;  We do not know what the future holds and cannot predict it.  All I can predict is that if the Government passes the motion, it will have very little say in Aer Lingus and the future of that airline.  At least for the moment we have some say in what happens in it.  We can protect jobs, look to Aer Lingus to increase its routes and use the slots at Heathrow Airport to our own advantage instead of to that of the Middle East.  This is a bad deal which should be rejected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700043#QQ00200","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432739700,"counter":733,"content":"<p>As outlined previously during my party colleagues' contributions, the Government's decision to sell its share in Aer Lingus is a short-sighted move which will create years of uncertainty and economic difficulties for the State.  It will create uncertainty for the thousands of workers who work for Aer Lingus or who work peripherally to it in Ireland.  A major question mark hangs over the assurances the Government has stated will be given and whether they can be enforced or fulfilled.  Is it realistic to assume that the State, in selling 25% of a company, will be able to hold a major multinational grouping to agreements that are in our interests for seven years thereafter?  I think not.  Rational thinking will tell us where interests lie.  IAG is a private, for-profit operation, the commitment of which is to bottom line profits and its shareholders.  lts track record shows that providing jobs or supporting the countries from which its airlines operate features nowhere in its priorities.  Therefore, it is up to the Government to protect the State's interests.  The money raised from the sale will supposedly be used in a so-called \"connectivity fund\".  The Government is short-selling actual connectivity today to fund notional connectivity in the future.  This is precarious at best.  Regional airports such as Cork Airport have been promised investment, but this does not seem likely to happen.  We do not trust the commitments made by IAG, given its track record; nor do we trust the Government's spin.  <\/p>  <p>  The manner in which the motion is being rushed through the House has instilled no faith in Opposition Members in this process.  Fine Gael Deputies and, more particularly, Labour Party Deputies know that this deal is not wanted by the public or Aer Lingus workers.  Any fair observer can vouch for the importance of Aer Lingus to the economy but particularly to regional airports such as that in Cork city.  IAG does not have a track record of supporting smaller airports.  It is very much focused on a number of major hubs, particularly Heathrow Airport.  We know this to be the case and the entire reason Mr. Willie Walsh is seeking to buy Aer Lingus is to gain control of its Heathrow Airport slots.  He is acutely aware of the value of those slots.  IAG, from its hub, in Heathrow Airport has failed to improve services through British Airways in any other British airport in Scotland, Wales or the north of England.  Aer Lingus has developed nine north Atlantic routes, while British Airways has developed none from Glasgow, Edinburgh, Belfast, Manchester or Birmingham and we may as well add Cork Airport to that list.  The Scottish National Party has argued that British Airways has actually hampered plans for development of new routes from Scotland.  Aer Lingus has had great success in the smaller market served by regional airports.  IAG, on the other hand, has only made a commitment to continue Cork Airport's Paris and Amsterdam routes through Aer Lingus which, without a sell-off, would still be the case.  Cork Airport needs IAG like a hole in the head.  In seven years time, will there be any slot for services from Cork Airport to Heathrow Airport? Mr. Walsh has made it clear that he wants slots for services to Asia and South America.  That is where the profit is and that is what drives IAG, not Ireland's interests and certainly not the interests of regional airports such as Cork Airport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700044#RR00200","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1432739700,"counter":734,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister for holding out for the very best deal in the sale of the State's shareholding in Aer Lingus.  There has been a lot of talk about uncertainty, guarantees into the future and so forth, but the reality is that there were no such guarantees.  The Minister has put us in a much stronger position.  I have no doubt that the deal involving a sum of &euro;355 million and numerous other terms, conditions and restrictions to protect the interests about which everybody was concerned was achieved through the Minister's thorough and tenacious approach.  Furthermore, I have no doubt that Aer Lingus would have been sold a couple of months ago had the decision been left to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The Minister deserves great credit for this.  My own experience with the Department stems specifically from its dealings with Knock Airport over the years.  When I consider its attitude to the airport, I can only describe the airport as a miracle operating on a shoestring.  During the years the Department displayed a bias against it; it favoured the <i>status quo<\/i>and the State airports.  Knock Airport is not a State airport because it was not lucky enough to receive Government support and was spawned in great part with moneys raised by the people.  Therefore, it never fitted the bill as far as the Department was concerned.  Any concession given to it was given begrudgingly.<\/p><p>Everytime there has been a suggestion made regarding Knock Airport, the Department has found a reason not to do, rather than to do.  As well as welcoming the reference to Knock in the commitments under this deal, I also want to focus on the benefits that can flow from the &euro;335 million with the investment of this money into the strategic investment fund which includes a connectivity fund to fund transport projects.  We have a golden opportunity and I am asking the Minister to take the same approach as he did to getting this optimum deal on Aer Lingus and to give a commitment, a statement of intent, that moneys will be ring-fenced towards Ireland West Airport, Knock.  I am saying this because I know there have already been conversations, reports and studies.  There is a case before the European Commission about state funding.<\/p> <p> The Minister's commitment to capital expenditure and operational expenditure is &euro;12 million per year over the next five years.  However, when that &euro;12 million is broken down, &euro;7.5 million is already going to the PSOs to Kerry and Donegal airports, which leaves very little to be divided between Kerry, Donegal, Waterford and Knock.  The whole objective is that Knock would become self-sustaining and not need money from the Government indefinitely.  Why am I singling it out as opposed to other regional airports?  I believe there is a special case as I have mentioned to the Minister previously.  No area is more disadvantaged.  Sometimes when we talk about making a case for the west or wherever, we are accused of being parochial.  When we talk about Dublin or some good-news story, it is all in the national interest.  I would like to talk about where I come from and the significance of Knock Airport and the need to ring-fence money now that we will have money.  I accept that in the past we did not have money.  The Government has been so concerned and consumed with bailing out the country that this could not happen previously.<\/p> <p> We are in a peripheral area.  North west of a line between Louth and Galway, with the exception of Galway, there is no major interurban route.  There are no dual carriageways or motorways north of Galway.  The area has suffered very badly from emigration.  Much of the success from a passenger point of view in Knock is down to many of our emigrants using Knock to come home.  We try to use it for business and all the other add-ons.  However, it needs support and help.  The region can be likened to the Scottish Highlands and islands which receive substantial subsidies from the Scottish Government because of their circumstances, including emigration.  With the exception of Donegal, all the other regional airports I have mentioned are close to the hub of another State airport in Dublin, Cork or Shannon.  So we are talking about a huge region that does not have an international airport other than Knock.<\/p> <p> As I have said, we are not serviced by a motorway.  We have problems because of that lack of connectivity.  We also do not have a high-speed railway connection into the area.  Examining the economic and social markers and indicators for the region shows significant economic and growth disadvantage, which is nothing new.  However, we want to be empowered to be the best we can in the area and Knock is crucial in this.  A package has been put together for Knock but there are many contingencies, as the Minister might agree.  The reality is that this a great-news story from the point of view of growth for Dublin - growth in passengers and the growth of Dublin Airport as a hub.  We have already seen substantial investment in the mid-west, in Shannon.  All of these can be welcomed and be seen to be done in the national interest.  It is time we had a substantial investment in Knock.<\/p> <p> The Dublin Chamber of Commerce rightly welcomed the additional 2.5 million passengers that will come into the Dublin region.  However, when comparing the ratepayers in Dublin with the ratepayers in the west, where I come from, while I have no doubt the Dublin ratepayers are paying substantial rates, they do not have to subsidise their local airport, which is what is happening under the deal with Knock.  The debt of Knock has had to be taken over by the local authorities, which are relying on the commercial rates.  So ratepayers are not only paying their rates, but are also supporting their local airport.<\/p> <p> Knock Airport very much needs a break.  This represents a golden opportunity.  It is not about being parochial.  It is about saying that doing this is empowering a region in very many respects.  It is crucial and pivotal.  Those concerned are seeking only a few years of that support that will put them at a tipping point where it can be self-sustaining.  The Department's traditional approach should be cast aside so we can have a marked change.  Now is the chance to do it.  I am asking for a commitment on Knock Airport.  The Minister's commitment on capital and operational expenditure is in place but there are too many airports vying for that money.  I have made a special case.  I am not taking from any of the regional airports.  None of them has the history of Knock or its strategic importance.  I know they are important to their areas and I would not wish to undermine that in any way.  Where there is a will there is a way and I am asking for that will to be shown today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700044#RR00300","speaker":"1070","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432740300,"counter":736,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the role of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe, on this issue.  He has proven one very important attribute from which some officeholders could learn - it was the engagement and listening process with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications of which I am a member.  Fears and concerns as well as some mistruths that were being spread on the sale or otherwise of Aer Lingus were dealt with in a very constructive way.<\/p>  <p>  We had a couple of days of amateur theatrics by people who arrived at our committee meetings claiming that the world was going to collapse in a heap, which, of course, will not happen.  We even had a visit from representatives of Virgin Atlantic.  I was delighted to see them in Dublin.  I presume they flew in by Aer Lingus or Ryanair because Virgin Atlantic does not service Ireland.  My parting shot to them when they were leaving was that they would be very welcome to meet with the Dublin Airport Authority given that they were so concerned about Ireland's connectivity to the wider world and the damage that was going to be done, and that they were very welcome to try servicing the Irish population from Dublin, Cork, Shannon, Knock, Farranfore or wherever.  To date, as expected, I have not heard anything from Virgin Atlantic to suggest that it will do that.  I do not envisage it launching a flight from here to the Bahamas any time soon.<\/p>  <p>  The sale of Aer Lingus represents a good deal.  I had concerns over my region in the mid-west relating to the five years originally suggested.  I welcome one thing the IAG CEO, Mr. Willie Walsh, said.  He was wrong in something he told the committee.  He said that in his commercial activities up to now, the second deal he offered was never as good as or better than the first.  He was wrong in that because the second deal is better than the first.  I suppose there is a first time for everything and there is a first time for Mr. Willie Walsh to trump his own initial offer.<\/p>  <p>  For the Limerick, north Tipperary and Clare region I represent this is of huge significance.  Unlike what happened when the first 75% of Aer Lingus was sold by the last Administration, there is now certainty about Shannon Airport's connectivity to Heathrow for the next seven years.  If one wanted assurance or otherwise from any non-political source that this is the right thing for the mid-west region from Loop Head down to Mountcollins, all one has to do is read the Shannon Airport statement and the comments of people associated with the airport, who do business with the airport and fly people into and out of it.  They believe this is a good deal.<\/p>  <p>  It does not surprise me that the Opposition would be so opposed to it because every initiative the Government has taken to rebuild the tourism industry has been opposed by Fianna F&aacute;il in particular.  It opposed the jobs initiative, which reduced the VAT rate in the hospitality sector.  Twelve months after opposing it, Fianna F&aacute;il Members were in Buswell's Hotel telling us that we should retain and extend it.  They scoffed at the Wild Atlantic Way and yet some of them now want it extended to cover Mullingar and Longford.  They also scoffed at every other initiative that has been taken.  For instance they had an opportunity to deal with the independence of Shannon Airport but did not take it.  They also had an opportunity to deal with the travel tax issue and instead they hiked it up.<\/p><p>Every initiative taken by the Government to rebuild the tourism sector has been opposed by Fianna F&aacute;il.  Is it any wonder the Fianna F&aacute;il Party lost a Senator this week?  She crystalised what it was to be in Fianna F&aacute;il, namely, opposition for opposition's sake.  When it comes to the party's stance on Aer Lingus, nobody does hypocrisy like Fianna F&aacute;il.  It has a brass neck, given that it was responsible for the sale of 75% of Aer Lingus, in respect of which we received no guarantees with reference to the slots.  When the slots were moved to Belfast, the then MP for West Belfast said it was a great day for Belfast that slots were being moved from Shannon Airport to facilitate the people of Belfast.  Now that he is a Member of this House he is bemoaning the fact that we are receiving a guarantee.  Perhaps he is bemoaning the fact that we are receiving a guarantee that slots will be retained at Shannon Airport and not moved to his home place in Belfast.  Perhaps that is where he would like them to be.  Whatever he does or does not want, I am concerned only about the people who elected me to this House.  Those who did so want me to ensure that, as somebody once said in this House, the rabbits will not be running around the runway at Shannon Airport and they are not.  <\/p> <p> The decision by the Government to give Shannon Airport its independence was opposed by the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il.  I have asked his colleagues from the mid-west to dissociate themselves from the scurrilous attacks he has launched time and again on Shannon Airport, but they will not do so.  There are Deputies from counties Clare and Tipperary and my own county of Limerick who are hiding behind mealy-mouthed statements in terms of Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin's constant attacks on Shannon Airport and its independence.  Since the Government took the initiative to separate Shannon Airport from Dublin Airport, Shannon Airport has literally taken off.  There is now connectivity to Philadelphia and Chicago, while Ryanair's passenger numbers at the airport have increased, as has the number of flights to New York and Boston.  The airport is literally about to take-off, yet the leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, week after week, comes into the House to attack it; for what reason, I do not know.  He has something against the mid-west.  Perhaps it is because Clare or Tipperary beat Cork in hurling or because Limerick have the odd win over it from time to time.  He has a major issue with Shannon Airport being given its independence having been under the cosh of Dublin Airport for 17 years.  It is not too late for some of his back benchers and colleagues in the Seanad to sound him out on this issue and ask him to stop attacking the airport.  It does not behove the Leader of the Opposition party to do so.  <\/p> <p> On the future of Aer Lingus, much bigger airlines such as Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines, KLM, Air France, British Airways, Iberia and so on have formed alliances for one reason and one reason only, namely, to ensure they can survive.  The corollary of this is Sabena, the former Belgian national carrier.  Small carriers are swallowed up.  When it comes to fleet replacement which Aer Lingus will need to do in the not too distant future, there are no cash reserves.  The Opposition continues to state there is loads of money in Aer Lingus and that we should potter along until it runs out, at which point the State might intervene.  The State cannot intervene under EU state aid rules.  The Belgian national carrier, Sabena, a once proud airline and one of the longest serving airlines in the world, evaporated in a puff of smoke.  The same could happen to other airlines in peripheral countries such as Ireland unless there is a realisation that the future of the airline industry across the world lies in consolidation, as I have heard said many times at the transport committee.  It is not globalisation or, to use the catch phrase usually thrown around by Members on the opposite side, \"a neoliberal agenda\" but the commercial reality.  The commercial reality for airlines does not differ from that for other business, be they small or large.  We are in a changing environment and Aer Lingus has changed.  It has changed and become a leaner, more efficient machine.  It is now a proud carrier that can stand on its own two feet and hold its own among the best.  It is also looking to the future and a world in which there will be a lot fewer airlines carrying more passengers into bigger hubs.  <\/p> <p> I take issue with the point made earlier by a Member of the House about the recovery of and the regional imbalance in my region.  The Deputy concerned obviously does not realise 16% of the population of the State reside in my region or that 30% of IDA Ireland jobs are located in it.  Despite the fact that his party was in government for 14 years, it did nothing about the Cork to Limerick road.  Not only has the Government decided that Limerick and Galway need to be connected via a motorway by way of completion of the Gort to Tuam road, it also proposes to prioritise a link with the Port of Foynes, a proposal which Fianna F&aacute;il also opposed in its ports policy.  Fianna F&aacute;il opposed the designation of the Port of Foynes in my constituency as a tier 1 port.  Again, it was opposition for opposition's sake.  That is how Fianna F&aacute;il under Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin does it.  That is the reason the motion before us is being opposed.  Leaving aside the fact that Fianna F&aacute;il was responsible for the sale of 75% of Aer Lingus, in respect of which it obtained no guarantees, that slots were relocated from Shannon Airport to Belfast Airport and have only been returned to Shannon Airport because it is profitable, has good management and an excellent team and Fianna F&aacute;il's lack of an aviation policy for the 17 years it was in government, the motion is being opposed by Fianna F&aacute;il because it is a good idea from the Government.  If that is the way the principal Opposition party is going to behave in this D&aacute;il, is it any wonder some of its members are departing the party faster than one can get a aeroplane off the tarmac at Dublin Airport?<\/p> <p> From my point of view, this is a good deal, for which I commend the Minister for Transport.  In the past couple of months he engaged positively with and listened to the transport committee.  He also spoke and listened to individual Members and sectoral interests, including representatives of the tourism and transport industries, the hotels federation, restaurateurs and so on.  He managed to do something that Mr. Willie Walsh said would not be done, namely, obtain a second deal that was better than the first.  This is a good deal for Ireland, Aer Lingus, the mid-west and my own county of Limerick.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700045#SS00200","speaker":"1058","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432740900,"counter":738,"content":"<p>The next speaking slot is being shared by Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett, Catherine Murphy and Mick Wallace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700046#TT00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1432740900,"counter":739,"content":"<p>The only issue on which I agree with Deputy Patrick O'Donovan and the Government is the stunning and staggering hypocrisy of Fianna F&aacute;il when it comes to this matter.  For Fianna F&aacute;il belatedly to be concerned about the sell-off of Aer Lingus, when it commenced the process when it sold three quarters of it, beggars belief and confirms the verdict of its own departing member in the past week on its political cynicism and opportunism.  On that point, I agree with the Deputy.  Leaving that aside, however, the decision to sell the State's remaining stake in Aer Lingus is an outrageous betrayal and an act of national economic sabotage.  The Government is selling the remaining stake in what is an absolutely vital and irreplaceable national strategic asset and sacrificing it to a multinational company on the altar of neoliberal dogma, which will be deeply regretted.  There is no argument that can be made that would justify the sell-off of Aer Lingus.  If Fianna F&aacute;il is good at opposition for opposition's sake, Fine Gael specialises in privatisation for privatisation's sake.  That is what makes the sale so outrageous, disgraceful and unjustifiable.  <\/p>  <p>  The so-called assurances given by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on the slots, connectivity, jobs and conditions are utterly bogus.  Either he is deliberately deceiving the House and the people on these matters or Mr. Willie Walsh has hoodwinked him.  I am not sure which is the case.  As I said, the assurances are bogus.  The big question for me is why sell Aer Lingus, a company with &euro;1 billion in cash reserves and &euro;1 billion in tangible assets, a company that is making profits and has a growth plan and that is a vital strategic interest for an island nation with no land connections to the European mainland.<\/p><p>Does the Minister understand the notion of strategic asset, that something is important from the national point of view, as against the narrow considerations of a multinational company or commercial entity that thinks only about the bottom line?  A multinational company of any description, managed by anybody, does not give a damn about connectivity, workers' rights or pensioners' rights.  It does not give a damn about the strategic importance of the Heathrow slots to this country.  That is not its business.  Therefore, the idea that these concerns will be protected by a multinational company interested in making money is ridiculous.<\/p> <p> Another issue that has not been pointed out in this debate is the fact that IAG is not even making a profit.  We are selling a profitable Aer Lingus to a company that made a loss last year.  Therefore, the promises of a better and securer future, of more jobs, of growth and so on are entirely speculative and based on nothing but blind hope, particularly when we consider the precarious nature of the international airline industry.  What will happen if AIG goes bang, as is quite possible?  What then and what about our strategic interests?  We have no way to protect and maintain them or to influence the outcome if that happens, as could well happen.<\/p> <p> On the question of the assurances, the golden share is a bogus assurance.  The British Government had a golden share in BAA, but the European courts deemed it illegal and contrary to European law on competition and state aid.  Similarly, the golden shares of the Portuguese Government in Portugal Telecom and Energias de Portugal were both struck down by the European Court of Justice.  The golden share will not stand up.  Therefore, the assurances about the protection of slots and the disposal or use of those slots will not stand up in the face of the law and commercial reality of the international airline industry.  <\/p> <p> The situation is similar in regard to the protection of people's jobs, pay and conditions.  As has already been pointed out, when IAG took over Iberia Airlines, some 4,500 jobs were lost and salaries were cut by between 11% and 18%.  Willie Walsh has a similar history in British Airways in regard to his attitude towards workers rights.  During the strike in 2010, he threatened to bring unqualified scab labour in to scab on cabin crews who were on strike.  While he was in charge of Aer Lingus, thousands of jobs were cut and he introduced and expanded outsourcing in a number of areas.  I do not know if the Minister has responded yet to the revelation about the Nyras report.  Did he know about it or has Willie Walsh hoodwinked him about the real agenda he and IAG have for Aer Lingus?  Either way, the assurances are completely bogus and we are looking at redundancies, more outsourcing and profiteering at the expense of the workers and the pensioners and at the sacrificing of a vital strategic asset of crucial importance to this country.  This sale is a betrayal and even at this stage, the Minister should back away from it.  For the Labour Party to support it is beyond shameful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700046#TT00300","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432741500,"counter":741,"content":"<p>The debacle regarding the scheduling of this debate and the way the media appears to have more information than the D&aacute;il brings me back to the infamous &quot;Prom Night&quot;, when Members were left to rely on information from Twitter about what was going on.  The only difference is that this debate is taking place in daylight.<\/p><p>Look where the rush and lack of information on that debate has led us now, with all the current controversies surrounding IBRC and the issues pre- and post liquidation.  We know now, only through persistent questioning and FOI requests, that there has been a war going on between the Department and the IBRC, yet the Minister came in here that night and specifically went out of his way to imply that the management team in IBRC was outstanding, a statement we now know does not stack up against the evidence.  The rushed way in which this debate is proceeding leads me to worry that in the months or years to come, we will be relying on FOI requests to the Department of Transport in much the same way as I am currently pursuing information from the Department of Finance in an effort to unearth the truth.  I do not believe that is any way to do business.<\/p><p>In another worrying nod to the current IBRC controversy, we now have concerns being raised regarding conflicts of interest of some key advisers on this sale.  I read with interest a report in the business section of the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>on 14 May this year, entitled &quot;Government says no conflict of interest over advice&quot;.  The article reports that one of the key advisers has links to an investment index that placed a bet on the planned sale.  However, again we are being assured there are Chinese walls.  The article stated:<blockquote>The agency confirmed that checks are in place after it emerged that an investment index connected to one of the Government's key advisers on whether to sell Aer Lingus has placed a 'bet' on the planned &euro;1.36 bn takeover of the airline by IAG.<br \/><br \/>The investment banking arm of global financial giant Credit Suisse is one of three firms appointed by Government agency NewERA to advise on whether or not it is in the interests of the State to sell its 25.1pc stake in Aer Lingus.<br \/><br \/>The Irish Independent has learned that an investment index operated by Credit Suisse's separate asset management arm has a position in Aer Lingus shares, hoping to turn a profit on a possible sale of the airline going ahead.<\/blockquote>Therefore, the advisers are beneficiaries.  <\/p><p>Currently, this House is being forced to proceed with a costly review into IBRC deals, a review that is not only costly but inherently conflicted, particularly given the most recent incidence of the special liquidator who has been assigned to conduct the review actually joining Denis O'Brien in his High Court action to injunct into IBRC's business dealings and the unorthodox verbal agreements between senior debtors and the CEO, a very worrying trend.  How can we expect citizens to trust in the Government's handling of this process when time after time, this kind of deal happens.  Then, months or even years later, the truth emerges and the facts emerge about who has benefitted and who has lost out.  Just consider the history of tribunals in this country and the lack of follow-through on them.<\/p><p>In 2006, when discussing the proposed sale by Fianna F&aacute;il of Aer Lingus, Fine Gael's Olivia Mitchell had this to say during the debate:<blockquote>The D&aacute;il has had no input into the nature of the sale.  It's an insult to the D&aacute;il and to the taxpayers who own this company ... it makes it impossible for us to play our role as a watchdog for the public. There is simply no information on which the Opposition or Government backbenchers can make an informed decision.  We are acting on behalf of the real owners of Aer Lingus, the citizens of Ireland.<\/blockquote>Does this not seem eerily familiar to today's proceedings?  These were the words of a Fine Gael Deputy.  All that has changed is that Fine Gael has moved from this side to the other side of the House.<\/p><p>The State stands to get &euro;330 million for selling off our vital stake in Aer Lingus.  It seems a very cheap price.  The Heathrow slots alone are worth more than &euro;900 million.  We are also aware there is at least &euro;540 million cash on the balance sheet of Aer Lingus.  There are also assets in the form of aircraft and fixed assets, not to mention the iconic brand.  These are all significant in regard to the value of the company.  IAG must be delighted with the &euro;330 million sales tag.  What we are witnessing here is the creation of an election slush fund.  I listened to some of this debate in my office and heard people already making pitches for how this money will be spent.<\/p><p>Essentially, we are going to walk away from our national airline.  Meanwhile, we have invested upwards of &euro;1 billion in a quango like Irish Water.  I cannot see the sense in this.  The family treasure trove is being pillaged and will shortly be left empty.  The pension reserve fund has been decimated, CIE looks set to be sold and we had to fight to maintain our forests, which were on the list of assets to be sold off.<\/p><p> The Minister has not made a compelling case.  We do not have the details to evaluate this sale.  Essentially, what we are hearing is more spin rather than us being informed.<\/p> <p> What about the Aer Lingus deferred pensioners?  We know there is a big hole in the pension fund and that pensioners in a particular category were excluded from the process when decisions were being made about how the remaining funds would be used.  Those people had an expectation that their concerns would be addressed and the Minister knows that.  They have made contact with him.  I believe they were even outside his house.  Those hopes are now being dashed.  The assurances about regional airports do not stack up against what the same outfit is doing in more populated regions in the United Kingdom.<\/p> <p> The key question is whether this is a prudent sale for the citizens or is it, for the purchaser, the sale of the century?  I have no way of knowing, and somebody should not have to make a contribution to a debate in this House when they do not know the answer to that question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700047#UU00200","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432742100,"counter":743,"content":"<p>The Minister said this morning that, as a small carrier competing against larger companies in a changing European environment, Aer Lingus faces difficult challenges and risks.

He will be hardly shocked to hear me say that this is a very good deal for IAG, its shareholders and anyone who chooses to invest in it, but it is not such a good deal for the Irish people.

He went on to state: &quot;Aer Lingus has many strengths and that consolidation into a major airline group is not [remotely] necessary to ensure its survival&quot;.

It is a neoliberal, ideological move, which is not based on good business practice.<\/p><p>There seems to be a notion that state is bad and private is good, and that is after the worst economic crisis this country has ever seen where so much of the private sector collapsed.  However, as happened when the banks were not worth dust and we bailed them out, the Irish people paid for their problems and now that they are worth something again it appears we will sell them again.  When something is profitable and other people can make money from it we do not keep it for the State.  We sell it, but when something is no good, the State takes it on.  It does not stack up.<\/p><p>The sale of so much property to foreign investors will create a huge problem in the future.  The example I have given in the House on several occasions is the houses, apartments and sites being bought by American investment funds.  They are not even selling them on.  Many of the developments were brought into NAMA at fire sale prices.  It has sold them on and made a fortune in the process but, very often, it is one investor selling to another, and the taxpayer has been the loser on each occasion.  Those investors have come here and bought huge developments of apartments and houses, which they are renting.  They have now developed a cartel in the rental market that has seen the price of a two bedroom apartment on Dominic Street increase from &euro;1,000 a month to &euro;1,400 a month in two and a half years.  It is little wonder there is a housing crisis.<\/p><p>We boast that this is an even better country in which to do business, but we are eroding workers' rights.  It is a dumbing down process - a race to the bottom.  Why are we becoming the best little country in the world in which to do business?  Alain Supiot explained it very well in the project called Doing Business, a programme of the World Bank that we are so proud to score high in.  This is the programme about which we boast that we are high up the ladder in terms of it.  He states:<blockquote>...[It] is the official guide to countries for corporations and businesses who want to face no censure for ignoring workers rights and pay little or no taxes.  In the Doing Business report, the comparative table of all the labour regulation in the world includes the following indicators: difficulties in hiring; difficulties in extending or reducing working time; difficulties in making a worker redundant; employment rigidity; and the costs of hiring and firing.<\/blockquote>One could not make that up.<\/p><p>A few weeks ago, 6,000 Dunnes Stores workers went on strike because 80% of them are on temporary work or zero hour contract arrangements.  Why is that the case?  Julien Mercille pointed out lately that when Margaret Heffernan took over the company in 1993, 80% of Dunnes Stores workers were full-time.  Today, 80% of them are part-time or are guaranteed only 15 hours a week.<\/p><p>Only last week, Dunnes Stores in Gorey closed its doors.  It had opened a door onto the car park, thereby breaking their lease arrangements.  It created a situation where the customers were coming straight from the car park into its shop, bypassing the 17 other shops in the unit which were losing out dramatically.  Dunnes Stores broke the legal arrangement.  Why?  Because it can, and it put the jobs of 100 workers at risk and put the workers in an insecure position.  Dunnes Stores told the workers that their jobs were secure.  One of the workers asked them if they could have that in writing, and they would not give it to her.  That was interesting.<\/p><p>How long more are we going to bring issues to this level?  It is getting worse.  Workers' conditions are disimproving under this Government.  Things are much different from what they were in the past.  Inequality is rising.  Why is the Government not able to protect workers in that situation?  Why can the likes of Dunnes Stores terrorise the living daylights out of their workers?  Why has it not been pulled up in that regard?  How can it get away with breaking a leasing arrangement, locking its doors and saying it will reopen them when it gets its way?  Why do we not have a mechanism at Government level for dealing with large businesses which treat Irish people like that?  Will the Minister not agree with me?  I would like him to answer that question.  There is something seriously wrong in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700048#VV00200","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1432742100,"counter":744,"content":"<p>The next slot is shared by Deputies Fergus O'Dowd and Brian Walsh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700048#VV00300","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1432742100,"counter":745,"content":"<p>Listening to the contributions of Members on the other side of the House I have to say there is a huge difference in their interpretation or understanding of what is happening here and what the Government is doing.  The most important point is the question of jobs.  Approximately 3,700 people are employed by Aer Lingus.  That is a huge number of employees in any organisation.  The change that is coming in that organisation, if and when this deal is approved by the Oireachtas and goes through, will be profound.  It is a challenge for everybody concerned, but it is a change that guarantees the future of the company and the future of the employees.<\/p>  <p>  We are living in a constantly changing world and aviation, as everybody here knows, can change almost overnight.  The fact that a company like IAG, which is a very significant player in the world and not just in the European market, is the only bidder for Aer Lingus at this stage shows there is a thought out plan in place and that commitments about jobs have been given.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, spelt that out last night and today but I will spell it out again.<\/p><p>It will grow the transatlantic route from an existing nine aircraft with an additional eight, bringing it to 17 in total.  These aircraft will have to be manned by approximately 650 other skilled people, including pilots, cabin crew and service personnel.  A major investment is coming to Aer Lingus, and it will guarantee new jobs on the transatlantic route.  It will be the lifeblood of Dublin.  The companies are committed to increasing the number of passengers by 2.5 million.  This means 2.5 million more people will come into our airports and move on into our country or travel on to the US or further abroad.<\/p> <p> It is a very positive story and it is very impressive to people who are looking at it from my constituency, Louth and Meath East.  Many people in my area work in Aer Lingus or at the airport and are delighted with the fact that new investment is coming in and that there is a new vision for Aer Lingus.  The new vision is being led by an old hand in terms of Aer Lingus.  Willie Walsh was a very dynamic person when he worked in Aer Lingus and, while he may have fallen foul of the political establishment of the day, he was a dynamic leader and has shown true and dynamic leadership in this proposal.  I have every confidence that Aer Lingus will go from strength to strength.<\/p> <p> The connectivity is guaranteed for a minimum of seven years.  The physical schedules of aeroplanes that land and take off in Heathrow with a destination or origin of Ireland will continue.  The summer and winter schedule is guaranteed, which is a major plus.  There is great security in the modern world in terms of the company and the investment it will make.  The aircraft cargo business will grow by 50%.  It is a major opportunity for Ireland, Aer Lingus and the workers.  I do not see it in any negative light whatsoever.  A person who lives in Eurasia, on the far side of the world, and who wants to come to Ireland will be able to fly all the way with one company.  This is a major advantage in connectivity.  People abroad say one of the problems is that there are no direct flights to Ireland and they do not know about Ireland because nobody is pushing it.  When we are a part of that larger company, it will make a major difference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700048#VV00400","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432742700,"counter":747,"content":"<p>When we were here this morning very early to change the Order of Business of the D&aacute;il, the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Martin, bemoaned the fact that this was being rushed through, according to himself.  I examined the record of the D&aacute;il from 2006, when the privatisation of Aer Lingus was approved.  The then Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government, of which Deputy Martin was a member, allocated two hours of time to debate the disposal of 75% of Aer Lingus.  Deputy Martin also mentioned in his contribution this morning that it is very important that the issue be debated by the Oireachtas transport committee, of which I am a member.  It was very comprehensively debated and discussed by the committee.  A large number of witnesses came before the committee to discuss the proposal, the vast majority of whom were very supportive of it.<\/p>  <p>  When Willie Walsh came before the committee, I asked him a question about his opening offer.  I said he had not become the pre-eminent airline executive in the world without being able to negotiate, and I asked him about how he could enhance his opening offer.  He was direct and frank in his response, and said if he made a second offer it tended to be much weaker and that his opening offer was always his best offer.  He said if he had to make a second offer, it was usually much weaker than the original one.  Obviously, he has never had to negotiate with somebody of the calibre of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, given that the second offer he has come back with is greatly enhanced.  It is a much stronger and better offer for Aer Lingus and Ireland Inc.<\/p>  <p>  All along, there has been broad consensus for some time that, in principle at least, the sale of the company had the potential to be good for Ireland and for Aer Lingus.  However, the initial offer was unacceptable and there were legitimate and very considerable concerns relating to, for example, connectivity and job losses.  This weighed very heavily on the debate.  The offer has been strengthened considerably and I am pleased that all the concerns raised have been addressed in the most recent proposal.  The Minister has used the time since the original bid well to secure a better deal for all concerned.  The commitments secured on the Heathrow slots were vital, and the potential for route expansion to North America in particular is vast and could have substantial implications for economic growth and development.  The deal protects 2.5 million additional passengers, more than 600 new jobs and four new North American routes.  We are looking at new dawn for the company in a very competitive environment.  It will be strengthened by the takeover and the sky is the limit for Aer Lingus.  This is happening at the right time for Aer Lingus, which, in its current state, faced a very uncertain future as a stand-alone operation.  It is happening at the right time for the State as the injection of capital and further job creation that will arise from the deal will fuel the momentum we have as the fastest-growing economy in Europe.<\/p>  <p>  Tourism, one of the pillars on which we have built our economic recovery, stands to benefit greatly from the development of Aer Lingus under the auspices of IAG.  I represent the west of Ireland and Galway, where the growth in tourism numbers has contributed greatly to the recovery we are seeing on the ground.  It has been a very important factor in the domestic economy and its recovery.  The commitments that the Ministry has secured for Shannon and Knock airports will have a very positive impact on Galway city, Connemara and the surrounding areas.  One very important aspect of it is the marketing expertise the IAG group has across the globe and Ireland will benefit greatly from that.  Ireland will be promoted in new markets in which we have not had a presence heretofore.  It is a cause for great optimism for the future of the tourism industry.<\/p>  <p>  Last weekend, people across the globe decided that they would like to visit this little country of ours which captured their attention as it asserted its regard for equality and inclusion by popular vote.  Through this deal, they will find more numerous and varied ways of visiting Ireland as the airline expands.  Willie Walsh gave a commitment that he would invest in more long-haul aircraft, which is very positive for the North American market.  I welcome this from a local point of view, given the measures that are there to support the two local airports in the west of Ireland.  It is good for Aer Lingus, which could have faced difficult times.  If there were another downturn in the aviation sector in the future, there was no guarantee that Aer Lingus would have survived.  Its future is secure under this deal.  I commend the Government and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in particular on the work he has done in negotiating this new deal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700049#WW00200","speaker":"1185"},{"type":"speech","time":1432742700,"counter":748,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.<\/p><p>I commend the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the steering group for the work they have done on this issue for several months.  For seven decades Aer Lingus has made a huge contribution to the well-being of the State.  I pay tribute to the management and staff of the company during those years.  The proposed deal with IAG will allow Aer Lingus to open a new chapter of growth and development in the next seven decades.  As an island nation, air access is critical in providing connections to international markets for business and tourism.  The routes served by Aer Lingus are particularly important to the mid-west region.  The access to Heathrow Airport provided through Shannon Airport is a key component of our attractiveness as a region.  The mid-west suffered immensely as a result of the decision by Aer Lingus in 2007 to move the Heathrow Airports slots from Shannon Airport to Belfast airport.  Our loss of connectivity triggered a spiral of decline as companies incurred additional costs in travelling through Cork Airport or Dublin Airport to reach the global hub of Heathrow Airport.  Investment decisions by companies were put on hold and, in many cases, shelved for good.  The long-term commitment to connectivity provided in this deal will give certainty to the business community and potential investors and will remove the uncertainty since the decision was made over an August bank holiday weekend in 2007 to take the slots from Shannon Airport.  Much of the debate that took place in the lead-up to the decision was based on the incorrect assumption that the Government's 25% shareholding gave it control over the airline.  Our experience of the overnight removal of these invaluable slots is living proof that the Government does not have a controlling share.  The deal will provide a seven year guarantee on the continued use of the Shannon Airport-Heathrow Airport slots and a veto on their sale.  I welcome the commitment to maintain and strengthen the Shannon-New York and Shannon-Boston routes, with the option of enhancing the existing British Airways twice daily service via Shannon Airport.  There will also be growth opportunities with IAG's US partner, American Airlines.<\/p> <p> In the context of Shannon Airport, I am encouraged by the supportive reaction of groups and organisations such as IBEC, Chambers of Commerce Ireland, tourism interests, aviation experts and Shannon Group.  I have every confidence in Shannon Group and its chairperson, board and CEO, all of whom have welcomed the deal.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in were badly mistaken when they voted against the establishment of Shannon Airport as an independent entity.  Their scaremongering about jobs being lost and terms and conditions of employment changing has not come to pass.  Shannon Airport has, in fact, returned a profit since the Government decided to establish it as an independent group.  In a similar manner, this landmark deal is being opposed by people such as Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin who has stated he has an issue with Shannon Airport growing by 17% in 2014.<\/p> <p> This is a good deal for Ireland which will boost connectivity, employment and growth, while also underpinning the future of Aer Lingus.  It offers the airline an opportunity to develop and expand its operations to a different level.  The major issue of international connectivity has been addressed, the brand will be maintained and new routes will be developed.  I support the deal and thank the Minister for his efforts in securing it in the best interests of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700049#WW00300","speaker":"975","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432743300,"counter":750,"content":"<p>The Government's handling of the IAG takeover of Aer Lingus is a shambles which will have negative implications for the country.  It is particularly disappointing that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport who is sponsoring this proposal is a northside Minister who should know better.  The matter has been characterised by spin and a complete disregard for accountability, truthfulness and due political process.<\/p>  <p>  Aer Lingus has become a very successful Irish budget airline.  It has served the country well by adapting to changing markets and circumstances and surviving the worst effects of recession in recent years.  It is worth reminding the House of the company's strengths.  It generated revenues of &euro;1.6 billion last year, with an operating profit of &euro;72 million.  It has total assets of &euro;1.8 billion and cash reserves of &euro;545 million, more than any other European airline.  Last year it carried 11 million passengers on its 51 aircraft.  A further nine aircraft are on order and all of the indications are that it could have a bright future as an independent airline.  Its record and flexibility mean that it is ideally suited to serve our air transport needs and its valuable Heathrow Airport slots have ensured easy connections between this country and most parts of the world.  We have been fortunate to enjoy ease of travel thanks to Aer Lingus and these slots.  The airline has also been critical for trade and tourism.  <\/p>  <p>  It is difficult to understand how, as a country heavily dependent on air links, it could possibly be in the national interest to dispose of critical State involvement in the ownership of Aer Lingus and agree to a takeover by IAG, the shareholder interests of which have nothing in common with Ireland's.  The behaviour of the Government, its cheerleaders in elements of the media and insider interests in talking up the deal has created a fog which is reminiscent of the empty promises made at the time of the privatisation of Aer Lingus in 2006 and the flotation of eircom in 1999.  I clearly recall the talk in 2006 about a golden share and the assurance that we would have blocking rights by retaining a 25% shareholding.  The then Government and some commentators conveniently overlooked the fact that the concept of a golden share had already been found to be illegal by the European Court of Justice.  However, when combined with another 5% shareholding or, for example, the pilots' 7% shareholding, the State's 25% shareholding gave us a veto on the disposal of the Heathrow Airport slots.  <\/p>  <p>  Today we were told about a B share.

Where is the explanation of this construct about which nobody heard until now?  What is the legal advice on its standing and where is the analysis to support the claim that it will protect our interests in the Heathrow Airport slots?  We do not have any of this information and the Government is not giving us the opportunity to raise questions about it because the debate will be closed down with a vote tomorrow evening.  The reason for the rush is a political imperative to wrap up the deal before Government backbenchers return to their constituencies and hear the views of their constituents and the anger of Aer Lingus staff.  The most recent opinion polls show that a clear majority of the people oppose the takeover.  The Government will ignore their views at its peril. <\/p><p>The truth is that there is no cogent argument in favour of IAG taking over Aer Lingus.  There is nothing to gain and so much to lose.  It is important that Members, especially Government backbenchers, realise that when they cast their vote tomorrow evening, they are only voting on a two-page document, entitled, The General Principles of the Disposal.  That is what they are voting on and that is all that is at stake.  That document was only laid before the House this morning.  They are not voting on the spin or on assurances given by Mr. Willie Walsh or anyone else.  They are not voting on the Minister's speech or on assurances from party handlers.  They are merely voting on this document.<\/p> <p> Let us look at what is in this document.  Apart from the B share notion, which was never heard of before, the references to employment are extremely vague.  For example, the document refers to the \"strong, expressed preference for Aer Lingus to utilise direct labour wherever efficient and effective\", but what does that mean?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700050#XX00400","speaker":"1178","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432743900,"counter":754,"content":"<p>Dream on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700051#YY00200","speaker":"1190"},{"type":"speech","time":1432743900,"counter":755,"content":"<p>Here is another one: \"It is noted that Aer Lingus' current collective agreements provide flexibility and mobility across its workforce, without unduly restricting other possible approaches\".  That is reassuring.  The document also states \"the company does not foresee a likelihood of compulsory redundancy or non-direct employment\".  Again, that is very reassuring.<\/p>  <p>  It is quite clear that this is very far from any guarantee on jobs.  What is much clearer is what we have heard today, by accident, that major potential cost savings at Aer Lingus have been identified in an analysis commissioned by Aer Lingus.  This was carried out by the international aviation consultancy company Nyras.  The study concludes that the airline should set aggressive but achievable targets for short-haul cost efficiency at a minimum of &euro;60 million or &euro;5 to &euro;6 per seat.  It also recommends what it terms the next steps which identify potential savings.  The breakdown of these possible savings includes ground handling at 20%, catering 25% and maintenance 15%.  The total that could be achieved from these savings was estimated at more than &euro;58 million in the analysis.<\/p>  <p>  There are many unanswered questions.  Why is it that in spite of the protracted negotiations, the Government did not achieve an improved share price?  Why is it that when the official asset position of Aer Lingus is put at &euro;1.8 billion, the offer price is less than &euro;1.4 billion?  That is a critical question to which we all deserve an answer.  Why, for example, is the Government afraid to allow scrutiny of the deal by the Committee on Transport and Communications, as promised?  Why did some backbenchers hold out hope to deferred IASS pensioners who were disgracefully treated?  Why did some backbenchers hold out the hope that the pensioners' shocking treatment would be addressed by the proceeds from this sale, when it is clear that nothing of the sort will happen?<\/p>  <p>  What exactly is the connectivity fund that the Minister talks about and how do we know that it will not become an election slush fund?  I understand that Government backbenchers will be briefed again tonight by Mr. Willie Walsh.  The decision is being taken by Members of this House and it is not acceptable that private briefings are going on.  It is important that Government backbenchers are not again enthralled by Mr. Walsh or by the fact that simply because he is from Dublin he has some kind of loyalty to Irish interests.  Mr. Walsh did a good job in Aer Lingus, but he did so while answering to the shareholders of Aer Lingus.  He is now answering to the shareholders of IAG and their interests are very different to our national interests.<\/p>  <p>  Government backbenchers should not be taken in tonight and tomorrow by the spin they are getting from everybody or the group-think that is going on.  They should get a copy of the Nyras report and have a full briefing on it.  They should find out what is really in store for Aer Lingus staff.  They should also find out about the B share and whether there is any basis in reality for such a construct.  They should not vote blindly, but should listen instead to their constituents and to what staff in Aer Lingus are saying.  They should not act like lemmings.  They have a duty as Members of this House to inform themselves properly and independently, while listening to the views of their voters.  If they do not do so, there will be a heavy price to pay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700051#YY00300","speaker":"1178"},{"type":"speech","time":1432743900,"counter":756,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute briefly to this discussion and to reiterate my stance from January that the sale of the 25.1% Government stake in Aer Lingus is clearly not in Ireland's national interest.  The sale poses an immediate threat to air connectivity from Dublin, Cork, Shannon and Knock airports, despite reassurances that vital slots at Heathrow Airport will remain in place for seven years.  It also threatens the future of 3,900 Aer Lingus workers, especially the 2,100 back office and ground staff, and abandons the 15,000 IASS pensioners who gave their lifetime's work to our national airline and State airports.<\/p>  <p>  The &euro;1.3 billion IAG bid will signal the end of Ireland's historic, independent aviation company dating from the era of Se&aacute;n Lemass who was a great Minister for Industry and Commerce in the 1930s.  We knew this day was coming when this conservative Fine Gael-Labour Party Government agreed with the troika back in 2012 to sell &euro;3 billion of State assets, two thirds of which would go towards paying off the unfair debts that were imposed on this country.  The Labour Party and Fine Gael have since shamefully flogged off our family silver, including Bord G&aacute;is Energy, the national lottery for 20 years and now Aer Lingus.  Bord G&aacute;is was also sold for a song to a British legacy company, Centrica, which is the old British Gas.  Attempts to sell Coillte were narrowly averted by the outrage of our constituents across the country.<\/p>  <p>  It is laughable listening to the brazen, brass-neck hypocrisy of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party pretending to mourn the demise of our national airline.  Fianna F&aacute;il sold 75% our iconic national airline back in 2006 and ensured the company would be privatised.  They then pretended to be fools when Michael O'Leary immediately moved to take over the airline.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have acted hand-in-hand on this matter.<\/p>  <p>  The first question which occurs to everybody at this stage is why this sale is going ahead now.  Aer Lingus has been enjoying considerable success, particularly during the latter part of the Mueller era, as an independently owned national airline.  The 2014 annual report highlights a 9.2% increase in revenue, a 17.8% increase in operating profit and increases of 9.4% and 7.9% in average fare revenue per seat and per passenger respectively.<\/p>  <p>  The number of passengers also increased between 2013 and 2014 up to almost 10 million, while revenue passenger kilometres also increased 8.7% in just one year.  The 2015 first quarter report's interim management statement continues with these positive numbers from the Aer Lingus management and workforce.  Aer Lingus has a net cash amount of over &euro;650 million, which is nearly 30% higher than the 2013 net cash balance.  Why are we selling now when this airline, our airline, is clearly thriving?  The key to the recent success of Aer Lingus has been its short-haul business model and its niche positioning in the middle of the market.  Aer Lingus holds approximately 41% of market share of the Irish short-haul market.  An integral reason for this is the connectivity and importance of the strategic slots at Heathrow Airport.  <\/p>  <p>  Had the Government agreed to the International Consolidated Airlines Group, IAG's, original takeover bid back in January, we would not even have the miserly concessions that the Minister outlined.  I listened carefully to the statement of the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe.  He placed great importance on the seven year guarantee on the Heathrow Airport slots and the ability of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to use this new B share to prevent the disposal of slots and any proposed change in the Aer Lingus board and head office.<\/p><p>There is also reference to ambitious plans to grow passenger numbers by 2.5 million by 2020.<br\/><br\/>How do these supported guarantees tie in with the cost-saving initiatives being planned by Aer Lingus?  Does the Minister know which areas of business or the workforce will be hit?  Almost six months ago, Captain Evan Cullen of the Irish Airline Pilots Association, IALPA, pointed out the dangers especially to back office and maintenance staff numbers from this proposed takeover.  Any duplication of functions already in London and Madrid, for example, will be ruthlessly eliminated by the IAG management and in executive leadership terms, Dublin will become a branch office of this British airline.  What guarantees are there for quieter routes in Cork, Shannon and Knock airports, particularly during the months with lower numbers of tourists visiting?  We are familiar with the takeovers and what happens even to iconic brands.  We have witnessed job losses and closures just recently with the takeover of O<sub>2<\/sub>by 3 and in Dublin Bay North we are wrestling with the consequences of the takeover of Cadbury by 3G-Heinz-Kraft-Mondelez, which could have devastating consequences for the Coolock workforce.<br\/><br\/>I strongly agree with Senator Sean D. Barrett in his opposition to this sale to a European legacy flag carrier airline like BA-IAG.  British Airways was the largest airline in Britain from 1974 until 2008 and it is a founding member of the oneworld airline alliance but it has a chequered history with acquisitions, profitability and industrial relations disputes.  British Airways merged with Iberia to form IAG in 2011 and promptly cut 4,500 jobs, mainly in Iberia.  The redundancies were part of a so-called restructuring process that led to a return to a profit last year.  With Aer Lingus already posting healthy profits, what will a restructuring programme look like for that company?<br\/><br\/>The British Airways main hub is London Heathrow, where it currently owns 40% of available slots, ahead of Aer Lingus and Lufthansa.  It also operates out of London City Airport and it previously had significant operations in Manchester but these were shut down after BA halted the Manchester to New York route.  All BA international flights are now out of London, meaning that passengers from regional UK airports must transfer there.  As Impact recently noted, people must get a double ticket.  BA-IAG has a shocking record in connectivity to the nations and regions of Great Britain, as Senator Sean D. Barrett pointed out in a fine recent article in <i>Phoenix<\/i>.  There are no transatlantic routes from great cities such as Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Belfast, Glasgow and Edinburgh, for example.  BA has also had a very poor record in connecting both parts of Ireland to the United Kingdom in the past.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Stephen Kavanagh, the new chief executive at Aer Lingus, has reportedly confirmed by way of letter the company's commitment to working within registered employment agreements, REAs, and will include staff groups which are not covered by current agreements.  However, the Minister has said that when<b><\/b>restructuring is required, he does not think there will be compulsory redundancies.  Therefore, the Minister clearly accepts there will be significant job losses on foot of this takeover.  IALPA has consistently pointed out that in the long term, the best use of the slots at London Heathrow from Aer Lingus would be to service the London to US market rather than Dublin to London.<br\/><br\/>Mentioned in the Aer Lingus 2014 annual report is the cost optimisation and revenue excellence, CORE, programme that was launched in 2014 and aims to strengthen price competitiveness.  The report states &quot;staff-related efficiency measures were largely deferred in the context of efforts to resolve Irish Airlines Superannuation Scheme, IASS, pension funding difficulties&quot;.  The report also states, &quot;In 2015, Aer Lingus will seek annual cost reductions totalling &euro;40 million under CORE, an increase of &euro;10 million compared with the original target announced in early 2014&quot;.Has the Minister requested any information on how these cost-saving measures will be implemented?  By selling the Government's 25.1% stake in Aer Lingus, he is selling any input we have into protecting the jobs.  According to the Minister's statement, the Government intends to use the proceeds of the sale for a new &quot;connectivity fund&quot; within the Ireland strategic investment fund.  Does the very purpose for these funds not show that connectivity at Cork, Shannon and Knock airports will be damaged by IAG in this takeover?  Surely it would have been fairer to address the deficits in the IASS and ensure that deferred IASS pensioners receive the money that is rightly due to them.<br\/><br\/>Very sadly, I note that Deputy Joe Costello and other Labour Party backbenchers - we must call them the IAG eight - promised at the Labour Party conference that any sale of the 25% stock would be used to resolve the appalling cuts of 60% and more for deferred pensioners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700051#YY00400","speaker":"1190","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432744500,"counter":758,"content":"<p>That is not true.

For example, we will not always have a Marino man - Mr. Walsh - in charge of the BA-Iberia combine.  The ongoing threat posed to IAG, Air France, KLM, Lufthansa and other traditional aviation operators from low-cost operators like Ryanair and easyJet also suggests that Aer Lingus will be swallowed up and disappear when it enters IAG.

It was privatised in 2006 in a scheme that Fianna F&aacute;il, in government, had been working on since before the end of the last century.  Both the parties now in government opposed that process at every stage.  Back then, a minority stake was held onto by the State, with the sole purpose of blocking the sale or transfer of Heathrow Airport slots.  This was the only reason given for holding on to any shares at all but the arrangement cobbled together by the last Government was badly flawed.  Its deal did not give the Government any influence whatever on the actual use of the Heathrow Airport slots and it made no provision for the future of our airports.  There was no protection against the State's shareholding simply being diluted below the magic percentage by new share issues.  On this, as on so many other issues, we inherited a very weak hand when Fianna F&aacute;il retired from the fray.<\/p>  <p>  We can compare then with now.  We have a very good deal that will protect the State's long-term transport interests, guard and grow jobs and boost infrastructural and regional investment.  The State will receive approximately &euro;335 million, which we will ring-fence for investment in transport and other \"connectivity\" projects.  The State's veto is enormously strengthened so that we can, in future, acting unilaterally block any proposed disposal of the Heathrow Airport slots.  The Aer Lingus name, brand and head office are protected, again indefinitely.  The schedules to Heathrow Airport from Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports are protected for seven years.  IAG has a significant growth plan for Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports in the long term.<\/p>  <p>  I will speak briefly about the employment aspects.  When the Government got the IAG offer, we asked for specific information on future employment prospects in Aer Lingus.  The company told us it anticipates that by the end of 2016, approximately 150 net new jobs will be created in Ireland; this takes account of approximately 50 voluntary redundancies, primarily in back-office functions, which would happen on a phased basis through 2016.  The company also told us that by 2020, Aer Lingus could create up to 635 highly skilled jobs, comprising pilots, cabin crew, engineers and other ground staff.  IAG has confirmed that Aer Lingus will remain responsible for employee and industrial relations matters.  In particular, any decision about a registered employment agreement in Aer Lingus will remain the responsibility of Aer Lingus management.  That is the significance of the letter secured by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, from the Aer Lingus chief executive officer yesterday.  The company has confirmed a very strong preference for direct labour and confirmed the preference and practice of avoiding compulsory redundancies.<\/p><p>They agree that registered employment agreements are mutually beneficial and safeguard the interests of employers and workers and they are committed to expansion of the scope of their REAs to include staff groups not covered by the current agreements.  I expect and anticipate further communication from the company directly to me in this regard.<\/p> <p> If there is time in tomorrow's schedule, I hope to move Second Stage of the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill 2015.  The Bill reintroduces a mechanism for the registration of employment agreements at individual enterprise level.  As the House is aware, there has been a gap in our law since May 2013 when the Supreme Court held that the old REA system was invalid.  Of course, there can be no REA unless and until this legislation is passed.  An REA is negotiated between a union and an employer.  It can include provisions on both pay and conditions of employment generally.  Once it is registered, the terms of an REA then become part of the contract of every worker which the agreement covers.  As the effect of an REA is to adapt individual employment contracts, the benefit of an REA will survive any change of ownership.  Under the Transfer of Undertakings Regulations 2003, where a company is transferred to new ownership, the transferor's rights and obligations under employment contracts are automatically transferred to the new owners.  I hope, with the co-operation of the two Houses, that the Bill will pass into law by the summer.<\/p> <p> The important point is that there is of course nothing to prevent employers and workers from starting their negotiations on an employment agreement right now with a view to having it registered as soon as the Bill becomes law.  I encourage and expect them to do so.  With a fair wind behind those talks, they could be concluded and an agreement could be registered before the proposed IAG sale is concluded.  The reintroduction of REAs in a constitutionally robust manner will provide certainty around pay and conditions into the future and promote industrial peace.  The Government is responsible for the legislation that will govern this negotiation process.  We have secured a commitment that the company will engage in talks.  Some people believe we should go further.  They seem to think we could and should actually dictate what is in the final agreement.  I want to be clear about this.  As Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs and as a Labour Party member, I am more than happy to walk the extra mile on behalf of our colleagues in the trade union movement.  Neither I nor any Minister, however, can do the job for them.  We cannot set out what is to be in the REA between Aer Lingus and its unions.  That would not be good for the Government and it would certainly not be good for the unions.  To be fair to the trade unions, I do not believe they want us to take their place at the negotiating table any more than they would want the Government to dictate what goes into the next REA coming down the line for Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  An REA is a voluntary agreement negotiated between a business and its workforce through the relevant unions.  Its content has to be settled between the parties themselves.<\/p> <p> Aer Lingus has made its position clear to me and to colleagues in government.  It is now time for the company to lift up the phone and engage directly with its workers.  From what I have seen and heard, I am satisfied that there will be a new REA to protect employment and conditions of employment at Aer Lingus as a result of the work done by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and my other colleagues.  I am also satisfied that Aer Lingus has fully taken on board our concerns over outsourcing of employment and compulsory redundancies and believe that these concerns will be addressed in full.  This should be done through a meaningful industrial relations process, which I consider should commence immediately.  Therefore, I have no hesitation in supporting the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700052#ZZ01100","speaker":"1067","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432745100,"counter":767,"content":"<p>I will be supporting the motion.  Let us be clear.  This is not about the privatisation of Aer Lingus because the privatisation of Aer Lingus happened a decade ago.  I see Deputy Billy Kelleher in the Chamber who will well remember the debates back in July 2006 when the Fianna F&aacute;il Government introduced a motion in the Houses of the Oireachtas to privatise Aer Lingus.  As such, 75% of the national airline was privatised by Fianna F&aacute;il and this debate is not about a privatisation of the company.  Privatisation happened.  This motion is about how we ensure we get the best deal possible for the company, the workers, the taxpayer and the country as a whole.  That is why when the announcement was made six months ago about the proposed buy-out of the Government's shareholding by IAG, a number of Labour Party Deputies got together to discuss how to get the best possible deal for those four key sectors.  We sat down and came up with a motion that was put to the Labour Party's national conference in February 2015.  I have the wording of the motion in front of me and nowhere does it refer to what Deputy Thomas P. Broughan stated.  I recommend that the Deputy get a copy of the motion before he spouts nonsense about what is in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700053#AAA00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1432745100,"counter":768,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700053#AAA00300","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"speech","time":1432745100,"counter":769,"content":"<p>The motion is very clear.  I will set out the four key areas about which we expressed concern.  We expressed concern about the fact that there was not at that stage an independent valuation of the assets of the company, in particular the Heathrow slots.  We said there needed to be a firm commitment on registered employment agreements.  We said there needed to be better long-term guarantees around connectivity in respect of the Heathrow Airport slots and we said we wanted to see a plan promoted for the regional airports, including Shannon Airport and its connection to Heathrow Airport.  We put the motion to the Labour Party conference and I am delighted to note that we got unanimous approval for it and for getting a better deal for our key areas.  That happened in Killarney.<\/p>  <p>  The question now is whether we have capitulated or actually managed to get a better deal.  If anyone looks at the four areas I have mentioned and takes a reasonably minded view, he or she will say that we have improved the situation in the last four months.  If one takes the first issue of an independent valuation, that has taken place conducted by Credit Suisse.  If it got it wrong, it can be sued.  Credit Suisse looked at the Heathrow slots and come up with an independent valuation.  Members might disagree with what it came up with.  I might disagree, but I am not an expert.  We have indepdendent valuers who have come up with a valuation and we have to go along with that.  We must assume they have done their job properly.  They have said the slots are worth a particular amount and, as such, we can take it that the criterion that a valid valuation be arrived at has been satisfied.  The good news is that the &euro;335 million we raise, which some had thought would go to pay off debt, is going to go to a fund to improve connectivity in transport related projects, broadband projects and energy projects.  That is good news.  It will mean we leverage additional funds in that area.  That box can be ticked.<\/p>  <p>  I do not need to talk about registered employment agreements because the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, has just outlined exactly how he sees them working in relation to the legislation he is bringing in and the role of the company and unions in ensuring agreements deliver in relation to no compulsory redundancies and the protection of pay and conditions.  These are all things unions including IMPACT and SIPTU have written to us to express concerns about.  I will take the Minister of State at his word that they will be protected.  On connectivity and the Heathrow Airport slots, there is a guarantee as stated by the Minister for Finance that was not there before and an extension of the slots to seven years.  That can be seen as a positive improvement over the original bid.  On the plan to promote Cork and Shannon Airports, we have a clear outline of exactly what is intended to be done.  For instance, it is intended to maintain the Cork-Paris and Cork-Amsterdam routes and to pursue growth opportunities with tourism and business interests in the general Munster region.  For Shannon Airport, it is intended to look at strengthening the Aer Lingus flights outbound and at sustaining and enhancing the London City Airport service to New York via Shannon Airport.  There are clear improvements there on how the regional airports will be served.<\/p>  <p>  This has not been a capitulation.  It is clear that there have been improvements over the original offer.  The main thing we are trying to ensure is that the workers and the company are protected.  I am glad to see the brand will remain in Dublin with the continued location of the headquarters here.  That is a call for the Minister for Finance in the future.  There are many positive benefits of the sale and, as a result, I will be supporting the motion.  I will follow progress over the next year and if the unions have concerns at any stage about any slip-ups in relation to REAs or otherwise, we will be on the case.  That is what we are here for.  At this stage, we can allow the matter to proceed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700053#AAA00400","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speech","time":1432745100,"counter":770,"content":"<p>I am probably the Deputy who lives closest to the airport although I am probably not the Deputy with the largest number of Aer Lingus workers in his or her constituency.  However, I have a significant number.<\/p><p>Whether I like it, the position for Aer Lingus before the deal was proposed was that its future could not be predicted.<\/p><p>There was strong evidence that, if this bid was not accepted, there could be in the near future a bid with unforeseen consequences such as a hostile takeover, to use bidding and takeover terminology.<\/p> <p> Many of us have a sentimental attachment to the brand of the national airline, although technically it is not the national airline as it was privatised by the then Fianna F&aacute;il Government in 2006, yet the people have a 25% shareholding in it.  Unfortunately, that 25% shareholding, as we all know, can do diddly squat in protecting the future of Aer Lingus.  Those who have spoken before me and who will vote \"No\" tomorrow are being hypocritical.  They will sit on the sidelines to see where the wind blows on this issue, rather than make a real and mature decision which could create a viable airline, which is how we would all like to see Aer Lingus. <\/p> <p> Many of the Deputies within my party were not happy with the original proposal in December as it offered no guarantees on connectivity, jobs or other airports such as Cork, Shannon and Knock airports.  The current bid and proposal is much more positive than the original.  I am genuinely satisfied that it offers for the first time a viable future for the Aer Lingus brand which we all know so well and to which we have an innate attachment.  It offers the possibility of survival into the future as part of a much larger conglomeration and with increased access to other airports and services.  The net result is that people's jobs will be safe and that their working conditions will remain the same, as the CEO, Mr. Stephen Kavanagh, stated today and yesterday.  <\/p> <p> In the past 15 years of restructuring Aer Lingus has been made profitable again.  I must acknowledge that the workers, through the sacrifices they have made, have played a huge part in making it profitable.  During the 15 years of restructuring the company never introduced compulsory redundancies; it has always relied on voluntary redundancies.  This same process will apply in the future.  I was delighted to hear Mr. Kavanagh say Aer Lingus's preference was to use direct labour - its own staff - and that it did not have a preference, in any way whatsoever, for outsourcing.  <\/p> <p> At the end of the day, it would be nice not to have this conversation, but that would not be the mature thing to do.  We could all pretend the problem might go away.  The reality is that Aer Lingus's future with a 25% State share must be discussed.  It would not be mature to pretend we do not need to make a decision on the issue.  Standing idly by is not an option.  Voting \"No\" in the hope a better option will come along is also not an option.  This is the best option before the D&aacute;il and it offers the best opportunity for Aer Lingus to survive into the future.  <\/p> <p> I heard someone on radio this morning make a good point, although I would not agree with the particular gentleman on everything.  He said that for a company to survive, it needed to have relevance and dependency.  This proposal will increase Aer Lingus's dependency and relevance as an airline throughout not only Europe and the north Atlantic but also beyond.  It gives opportunities for Aer Lingus to become better than what it is, yet at the same time maintain all of the things to which we aspire for it in terms of its brand, the Heathrow Airport slots and connectivity, the indefinite veto on their sale and, ultimately, the protection of the rights of every single staff member in the company, please God, into the future.  I will be supporting this deal because we cannot say \"No\" to it.  We cannot pretend that there is a better option in town.  It may be too late to do so.  <\/p> <p> There is one last thing I wish to say.  When the debate is finished, the conversation on what happened to some of the IAS deferred pensioners which was morally wrong must be taken up.  With the Labour Party Members and some Fine Gael Members who fought for strengthened conditions, I, for one, will be following up on the issue to ensure we can in some way put right at least some of the wrong done to some of the deferred pensioners.  This is not the day, however, to discuss that matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700053#AAA00500","speaker":"1023","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432745700,"counter":772,"content":"<p>The next speaking slot will be shared by Deputies Colm Keaveney and Billy Kelleher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700054#BBB00200","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1432745700,"counter":773,"content":"<p>I am sharing my time with Deputy Billy Kelleher.  <\/p><p>I woke up quite early this morning, as I do in Dublin, and the headline on the website of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>was &quot;Coalition to sign off on offer to Aer Lingus&quot;.  However, the sub-headline in the printed edition of the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>read, &quot;The Labour Party has capitulated to Fine Gael demands and accepted an ... offer for the State's share in Aer Lingus from ... IAG&quot;.  We had been told there was a gang of seven Labour Party Deputies who would valiantly hold out until the last, but today they professed themselves satisfied with a so-called new, improved, better package - a better offer.  They are happy with the facilities being offered in the sale of the remaining stakeholding in Aer Lingus.<\/p><p>The main concerns identified by the gang of seven were outlined at the Labour Party's conference this year.  I want to highlight their concerns because there was a skirting around the issue by Deputy Dominic Hannigan with respect to the detail of what the gang of seven had voted on.The first was, &quot;That the bid fails to reflect the true value of Aer Lingus and, therefore, an independent valuation of the assets of the company is required, in particular, a valuation of the 23 Heathrow slots&quot;.  I congratulate Aer Lingus and the Government for successfully managing in seven months not to increase the offer.  Despite the fact that we are in the midst of an alleged economic recovery, the Government has not managed in its negotiations in seven months to increase in the interests of the State the value of Aer Lingus.<\/p><p>The second aspect was, &quot;The need for a firm commitment in the form of Registered Employment Agreements....&quot;.  I note the Minister's own words that we do not have legislative infrastructure in this country for an REA.  I back the dedication, commitment and, above all, actions of Ms Patricia King of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions this morning who categorically said this was a bad deal for workers.  It is a bad deal because the Government is not in position to guarantee protection for the conditions and rights of existing workers at Aer Lingus.  <\/p><p>The motion concluded as follows: &quot;The need to articulate a plan which would promote Shannon and Cork airports, taking into account their ... business models and impact on their individual operations&quot;.  The same gang now claim that they are no longer concerned.  They are now satisfied and willing to support the disposal of a State asset in Aer Lingus and, shamefully, will do so tomorrow.  It is clear that the negotiations at the Cabinet are on the following lines.  The Labour Party will support Fine Gael in terms of the disposal of Aer Lingus, while Fine Gael will back the Labour Party on the need for a registered employment agreement.  I want to quote what Deputy Brendan Ryan, a Deputy for whom we all have a universal fondness and respect, said at the Labour Party conference:<blockquote>We oppose the recent deal not out of political self-interest, but because it is a bad deal ... We have not heard any valid reason, for example, why IAG cannot purchase the other 75% of the company and work in partnership with the Irish State.  <\/blockquote>He went on to say that being a stakeholder in Aer Lingus, the Government was a guardian of the people's interests and that it needed to act in their best interests and the State.<\/p><p>He said the best way the party could judge every single item in the deal was on its own merits.  He also said the party needed to oppose the deal and Fine Gael in government on it.  He further said: \"There may be a deal at some point in the future which will meet all our concerns and copperfasten our connectivity and the terms and conditions of workers' employment.\"<\/p> <p> As the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport today in the Chamber guaranteed the Oireachtas that there would not be redundancies in Aer Lingus, Mr. Willie Walsh was holding a press conference and saying there would be redundancies.  That is his plan.  He will fire hundreds of workers.  At the same time we had a Minister saying there were guarantees and another that we did not have the legislative framework to protect conditions of employment.  I agree with the comments made by Deputy Michael McNamara in March.  He said there was no negativity in holding up a commitment to support workers at Aer Lingus and that he was keen to see increased value.  In particular, he was keen to see the regional framework in place and support for the regions in the context of connectivity.  He also said: \"One of the values of the shareholding is that Aer Lingus cannot be broken up into its constituent parts and sold off.\"  I doubt if there is anyone remaining in the Labour Party who honestly believes the focus of Mr. Walsh is not to break up the company as quickly and promptly as possible, accelerate redundancies and ensure only core elements of Aer Lingus will remain.  Tonight the Minister of State may as well say goodbye to security, catering and auxiliary services in Aer Lingus.  That is what we will be voting on in the coming 48 hours.  If any Member has a shred of honesty towards the people, he or she should put his or her hands on his or her heart and say it is absolutely an untruth that jobs will not be lost.  They will be.  That is the stated intention of the chief executive.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport said in the House today that there would be no redundancies.  At the same time, however, the interested party's chief executive said there would be.  How does that tally?<\/p> <p> I am confused about the deal that has been announced.  While the gang of seven might be satisfied, the monetary value of what was on the table seven months ago and what is on it today begs the question of why are we selling.  What is the urgent need to sell a State asset of such significance?  There has been some rhetoric in the House today to the effect that Fianna F&aacute;il sold 75% of the company.  However, the Government will sell 100% of 25%.  Fully 100% of Aer Lingus will be disposed of by the Government.  Let that be its legacy, the legacy of those who have not had the courtesy to come to the House to protect the terms and conditions of workers in Aer Lingus.<\/p> <p> Let us consider the spin and how the Government is selling the deal to the people.  Some 50 years of dividends will be flushed away.  The methodology by which the Government has calculated the value of Aer Lingus will be drawn into question in years to come.  We talk about a banking inquiry, but there will be an inquiry into the disposal of Aer Lingus.  There is no justification for disposing it in the context of the capacity of the country to stand on its own feet.  We are &euro;2 billion ahead of the tax profile.  Why would we dispose of a brand for which we, as a country, have fought?  The dedication and commitment of ordinary people helped to provide a brand, but tomorrow it will be given to British Airways and we will not have something that we can call our own.  Something is going on that simply does not add up.  It does not stand up economically.  It does not stand up today and it did not stand up seven months ago.  The Government's logic on the Heathrow Airport slots simply does not add up.  It is selling a significant entity for which the people of the country fought tooth and nail in bad times.  What is the logic of disposing of this asset?  Perhaps it is ideological and the Government has listened to some focus group suggesting the Tory element of the Government will secure one or two extra points in next Sunday's RED C poll.

I have listened to the debate and looked at the previous proposal made when IAG first pounced on Aer Lingus.  I have looked at the proposals made today inasmuch as I can and find that there is no difference.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, comes from the west.  He knows full well that if he took a heifer to the fair in January, took her back again because he did not get a good enough price and then took her back again last week and was offered the same price, it is he who is the fool.  That is what has happened in this case.  The Government pretended for seven months that it was holding out for a better deal, but there has been no improvement in any aspect of it.  There has been an improvement in the spin, the public relations and the softening up exercise of the various organisations throughout the country that have come out to welcome the proposal.  However, when we strip it all back, there is nothing in this for many people.  Most important, there is nothing in it for the people because we are selling our remaining stake in the national carrier, our national brand.  We are selling it to the private sector and throwing it to the wolves.<\/p>  <p>  Let us be very clear.  If IAG really loves Aer Lingus so much, what would be wrong with buying 75% of it and working with the State to improve and enhance the airline?  If the genuine interest of IAG was to expand, grow and develop and the Heathrow Airports slots were not of significance in enhancing IAG access to Heathrow Airport, as opposed to enhancing access from Ireland to Heathrow Airport, why not buy the 75% stake and let the rest of the shares remain with the State?  It is simply the case that IAG wants to have 100% control.  British Airways does not have the best history when it comes to takeovers.  It has been predatory and stripped assets.  It has undermined the airlines it has bought and taken out the best parts.<\/p><p>The history is evident.  There is no logical reason Mr. Walsh and IAG could not purchase the 75% and work with the State with the 25%.  Are the public interest directors on the board obstructive?  Have they caused great difficulties in the context of the development of Aer Lingus to date?  They have not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700055#CCC02000","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432746900,"counter":793,"content":"<p>It is booming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700056#DDD00200","speaker":"1188"},{"type":"speech","time":1432746900,"counter":794,"content":"<p>When one examines the statistics, one sees that Aer Lingus carried 11.1 million passengers in 2014.  I remind the Minister of State, as he keeps reminding us, that we have gone through a very difficult recession, both nationally and internationally.  It was one of the worst among OECD countries, yet Aer Lingus increased passenger numbers.  In recent years, its passenger number has increased remarkably and it outperformed IAG, with a 19% increase in the passenger number since 2007.  Since that year, it has almost increased its passenger number by one fifth.  This was during one of the most difficult international recessions.  It has outperformed all its rivals.  The company is working and competing against one of the most aggressive airlines in the world, Ryanair.  Despite the competition with Ryanair, both companies grow.  We are now told, however, that unless we sell the 25% stake, Aer Lingus will fall over, shrink as a company and not be able to perform in the international market.  That is patently not the case because all the evidence to date shows quite clearly that the company is able to survive and grow.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy John Lyons said that the option in front of the House was the best and only one.  Let us be very clear: there are two options in front of the House tonight, one being to sell and the other being not to sell.  Nobody is hamstrung in this House by having only one option with regard to the sale of the 25% stake in Aer Lingus.  There are two options and the deal can be rejected.<\/p>  <p>  Let us be very honest with ourselves.  We have been criticised over the fact that 75% of the company was sold in 2006.  The reason for relinquishing Government ownership in 2006 was to remove the operational management of the company from the vagaries of everyday politics.  We all know that when politics is completely involved in the running of any company, it creates its own inherent difficulties as there are competing interests.  The interests are not always those of the company.  Sometimes politicians are known to put their own interests before those of a company or even the national interest.  They do, and they are doing it again here tonight.<\/p>  <p>  The remaining strategic share was to ensure that Aer Lingus would remain as an operational entity and not be acquired by a rival in an anti-competitive manoeuvre or be stripped of its assets for short-term balance-sheet gain.  What is happening?  The proceeds of the sale are to go into the strategic investment fund.  In the next number of months, this will effectively be an election slush fund.  We know what will happen.  The money will be in the strategic investment fund and the roll-out of promises will occur.  Broadband to every house, investment in connectivity, and investment in ports and roads will be promised.  We will have it all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700056#DDD00300","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1432746900,"counter":795,"content":"<p>Would the Deputy be against it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700056#DDD00400","speaker":"1074"},{"type":"speech","time":1432746900,"counter":796,"content":"<p>All will be announced on this side of the election and the Government will say it has the money to carry out the investment, but it will not acknowledge the fact that the money will have been obtained by selling a State asset.<\/p>  <p>  Aer Lingus has been successful.

The disingenuousness of Fianna F&aacute;il knows no bounds.  A man stands up in the D&aacute;il and talks about selling 100% of Aer Lingus.  It was sold into private hands by Fianna F&aacute;il, let there be no doubt about it.<\/p>  <p>  The deal that the Government has done is a good deal, for Dublin and Ireland.  It will provide a boost to jobs and tourism while securing the future of Aer Lingus.  This is something that did not bother the two gentlemen who are now leaving the Chamber.<\/p>  <p>  This deal secures in perpetuity a veto on the sale of the Heathrow Airport slots.  This was not achieved by Fianna F&aacute;il either.  Today, the State has no control over the airports that use the Heathrow slots.  This deal guarantees that Aer Lingus will continue to operate its current daily winter and summer scheduled flights, based on current frequencies, between Heathrow Airport and Dublin Airport, Heathrow Airport and Cork Airport and Heathrow Airport and Shannon Airport for at least seven years.  In addition, the slots currently operated from Belfast airport to Heathrow Airport will continue to be used at airports on the island of Ireland for the next five years.<\/p>  <p>  This deal secures the future of Aer Lingus. There will be significant job creation.  Eight new wide-bodied jets will be added to the Aer Lingus fleet.  By next summer, two new transatlantic routes will serve Dublin Airport.  By 2020, this will increase to four new transatlantic routes.  This ensures more jobs in Aer Lingus and in Dublin Airport.  It will deliver up to 2.4 million additional passengers, providing a boost to the tourism industry throughout the island.  In the coming year, an additional 150 jobs are expected in Aer Lingus.  This is 200 jobs in all when one considers the 50 that may have to go.  The figure is to rise to 635 by 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The use of lAG's network will enable Ireland to become an important hub for European traffic across the Atlantic.  IAG has confirmed that the existing employment rights of Aer Lingus employees will be fully safeguarded.<\/p><p>All registered employee arrangements will be re-registered.  This is a great tribute to the patience, skill and negotiating ability of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  <\/p> <p> Aer Lingus is a great company.  I am proud that Aer Lingus is one of the oldest airlines in the world still operating today.  The decision to establish Aer Lingus was more than just the setting up of an airline.  It was an expression to the rest of the world of the determination of a fledgling nation to take its place among the countries of the world.  Its success over the decades is a source of national pride.  This deal respects this unique heritage of Aer Lingus.  <\/p> <p> Aer Lingus will remain an Irish company.  It will maintain its head office in Ireland.  Its flights will continue to operate under the \"Aer Lingus\" brand name.  Aer Lingus will keep the affection of many Irish people throughout the world.  The world in 2015 is unrecognisable from the world of 1936, the year Aer Lingus first took flight.  Nowhere is this more true than in the world of aviation.  Today, Aer Lingus faces difficult challenges and risks.  Across Europe, many state airlines have failed.  Cyprus Airways, Malev and Hungarian Airways have all gone the way of the dodo.  Finnair and the Portuguese airline, TAP, are the only other examples of national, small independent airlines competing against larger rivals.  Aer Lingus had already been privatised by Fianna F&aacute;il.  That aeroplane has long flown.  We need to find a way to use the remaining quarter of Aer Lingus that we own to put the company on the best possible path to secure its future.  This deal does just that.   <\/p> <p> Some Members of the Opposition are suggesting doing nothing is an option without consequences.  Let us be clear - it is not an option.  Aer Lingus has already been privatised.  The State only has a minority shareholding.  There is nothing to prevent a hostile takeover of Aer Lingus.  A hostile takeover will not have the interests of the airline, its employees or the country at heart.  A hostile takeover would be free to move the Heathrow slots away from Irish routes overnight.  A hostile takeover would not be obliged to respect registered employee arrangements.  A hostile takeover would not provide assurances that Aer Lingus will grow and employ more people in the future<\/p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il has spoken here tonight and I must say that it is galling to hear those who privatised Aer Lingus criticise this deal.  They surrendered State control of the airline and of the slots in Heathrow Airport a long time ago.  When they privatised the company, they failed to secure the assurances that we have now received.  They failed to control the use of slots at Heathrow Airport.  They left themselves powerless to act when Aer Lingus decided to switch the use of these slots from Shannon Airport to Belfast airport.  Fianna F&aacute;il's attack on this deal is old-style cynical politics at its worst.  They are attacking this deal for the sake of attacking it.  They are hoping to mislead the public in a desperate attempt to win back a handful of votes at the next election.  This cynical approach to politics has served this country so poorly in the past.  Where is responsible opposition?  Where is Fianna F&aacute;il's sense of national pride?  I do not see a single Member of the Opposition in this Chamber - people who would stand over there and display some passion for this company that is such an integral part of our nation.  Not one of these individuals is to be seen.  Where is their national pride and where is their desire to put the country ahead of their party?  Have they learned nothing?  After the painful recession that we are now emerging from, the public expect better from politicians.  This is the type of behaviour that makes the public switch off from politics.  <\/p> <p> It is the exact opposite of what we experienced over the past few weeks.  In every constituency in the country, people who never even voted before were knocking on doors campaigning for their rights or for the rights of others.  The Irish abroad sacrificed their annual leave and their savings to travel to the polling booth from all parts of the world.  The decisive result provided a new optimism in what politics can achieve.  A minority were made equal by a majority through persuasion and sharing stories.  That is the power of politics.  Fianna F&aacute;il may not have noticed this.  It may have been oblivious to it.  After barely lifting a finger to participate in that process, it is now reverting to type and is engaging in the type of politics that disillusions young people to the point where they do not even to register to vote.  Is it any wonder that the public have turned their backs on Fianna F&aacute;il and that its own members are turning their backs on Fianna F&aacute;il?   Is it any wonder that one of its brightest young leading lights has turned her back on Fianna F&aacute;il?<\/p> <p> Let me emphasise again why this is a good deal for Aer Lingus and for Ireland.  It strengthens the competitive position of Aer Lingus, reduces risk to the company and provides it with an opportunity within a larger group to grow and face the challenges in a changing aviation environment.  It gives greater certainty around our connectivity to Heathrow.  It strengthens the guarantees we have around the disposal of Heathrow slots and provides new guarantees around slot utilisation for at least seven years that we do not have today.  It promotes Ireland's wider connectivity and can bring growth to our airports.  It is anticipated this move will bring benefits to both Aer Lingus's long haul and short haul networks within the IAG group.  There will be a focus on sustaining and growing routes from Dublin, Cork, Shannon and Knock airports.  It will create employment.  It is envisaged that by the end of 2016, a new net 150 jobs will have been created in Aer Lingus, rising to a new net total of 635 jobs by 2020.  It protects the Aer Lingus brand and keeps its head office in Ireland.  <\/p> <p> Before I sit down to allow Deputy Pat Breen to speak, there are many great and brave people in our country who can compete on the world stage and many of them are in Aer Lingus.  Aer Lingus need have no fear.  Its ability, innovation and entrepreneurship will see it well into the future and will ensure our future connectivity to the rest of the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700056#DDD02900","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432747500,"counter":821,"content":"<p>The empty Opposition benches speak volumes.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The Government's decision to recommend the sale of the State's 25.1% stake in Aer Lingus to IAG brings an end to the uncertainty that has been there since December regarding the future of the company, which is very welcome.  The initial offer was grounded because it did not satisfy concerns about jobs, connectivity and the Heathrow slots and I compliment the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport who has been here for most of the day.  He played hardball on this issue and as a result, he secured significant concessions in a deal which is in the best interests of the future of Aer Lingus, connectivity to our regions and for the travelling public.  We all remember the IAG chairman's comments when he addressed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communication earlier this year when he said he did not do \"second bids\"; therefore, the Minister's achievement in securing these concessions is all the more remarkable given the backdrop of Mr. Willie Walsh's comments.<\/p>  <p>  Both Government and Opposition Deputies have said that everybody in this country has a deep affinity with Aer Lingus and that is understandable given its long tradition as the driver of air services into this country.  However, Aer Lingus is now a small player in the global aviation industry where mergers, strategic alliances and consolidation are now the norm.  We have seen this in the mergers of Air France and KLM and Lufthansa and Austrian Airlines along with mergers in the United States.  The aviation industry is very volatile and must adapt to the changing environment on a regular basis.  If I said to somebody ten years ago that we would have 25 direct services per week to Abu Dhabi and Dubai, they might have laughed at me.  We now have those services and they are very successful.  Aer Lingus is a small airline that moves around ten million passengers per year.  Ryanair moves 100 million passengers per year so the merger with IAG will be good for Aer Lingus and will provide the airline with greater growth opportunities than it would not have as a stand-alone airline.  At the same time, it will retain its branding, a brand which has a strong international reputation.<\/p>  <p>  I am particularly pleased that the issues I raised about Shannon Airport, about which everyone in the mid-west region was concerned, have been addressed and are enshrined in this deal.<\/p><p>I listened to members of Fianna F&aacute;il criticise the deal earlier.  That party sold 75% of the company and retained the 25.1% shareholding, but it had received no guarantees whatsoever concerning the Heathrow Airport slots.  As we know, Aer Lingus moved the slots from Shannon Airport to Belfast airport in 2007.  When I questioned the then Minister for Transport about this, he told me that the State did not have the power to overrule management decisions on business matters.  We have learned a lot since, which is why I am delighted that the Minister fought hard to have legally binding guarantees written into the articles of association from the outset.  For the very first time we have secured a deal which guarantees the current level of Heathrow Airport services for the next seven years and effectively gives us a veto over any possible future disposal of the Heathrow Airport slots.  Deputy Billy Kelleher and his colleagues failed to acknowledge the reality that if Aer Lingus was to decide to move a service from Shannon, Cork and Dublin airports, there would be nothing we could do to prevent it from doing so.  Now, however, we will have security as we move forward.<\/p> <p> The Shannon-Heathrow route is very profitable and extremely important in the context of foreign direct investment.  There has been a lot of foreign direct investment in the mid-west region, including 70 US multinationals which employ over 10,000 people.  Connectivity to both Heathrow Airport and the United States is extremely important.  An indication of the opportunity for further growth on the route is the recent announcement that Aer Lingus is increasing capacity on the route by 25,000 seats this winter, representing an increase of 20% or an additional 65,000 passengers in a full year.  If the route was not profitable, Aer Lingus would not be increasing capacity on it.  <\/p> <p> On the potential disposal of Heathrow Airport slots in the future, it is very significant that the Government has secured a guarantee by way of the retention of a golden share which will be controlled by the Minister for Finance, effectively giving him a veto.  I have listened to criticisms inside and outside the House to the effect that this is not possible but it is.  The Government has fought hard for this concession and despite the reservations expressed, I have no doubt that it will be copperfastened by the European Commission.  It is hugely significant that the Government, as a golden shareholder in a private company, has secured this concession.  This guarantee is exceptional in the aviation world and the Minister is to be commended for negotiating it.  <\/p> <p> The big concerns in my region centred on Heathrow Airport connectivity and the disposal of the Heathrow Airport slots, but these concerns have now been addressed comprehensively.  I have listened to some Opposition Deputies questioning the commitments on Heathrow Airport connectivity, but the proof is in the response from the chairperson of the Shannon Airport Authority, Ms Rose Hynes, who said any IAG deal would open a new era, not just for Aer Lingus but also Shannon Airport.  This is the airport authority which has transformed Shannon Airport and turned it into a successful enterprise.  The airport was a shambles under the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Administration when passenger numbers were falling.  The authority is to be commended for the 17% increase in passenger numbers it has secured this year and the continuing growth in business at the airport.  That is proof of the Government's commitment to Shannon Airport.  <\/p> <p> We have nothing to fear from change and the proposed change will be for the good.  Shannon Airport is looking forward to a new era in aviation and will be in a position to exploit new growth opportunities which arise.  Aer Lingus has committed to enhancing the transatlantic services to Boston and New York and will replace the current 757 aircraft with the wide-bodied 767 aircraft on the Boston route, for example, thereby increasing capacity considerably.  It is also considering the expansion of its twice daily service from London City Airport to JFK Airport, which has been very successful.  This would benefit the business community across the west of Ireland.<\/p> <p> IAG is also examining growth opportunities with tourism and business interests in the mid-west region which are being pursued with its US partner, American Airlines.  I have spoken before about the importance of the oneworld alliance   American Airlines has returned to Shannon Airport and will schedule 114 additional flights to Philadelphia which is a fantastic hub airport.  Given that American Airlines is lAG's partner, Shannon Airport is ideally placed to exploit growth opportunities which may arise from this partnership.  In addition, it also has pre-clearance facilities and an uncongested airport supported by an excellent hotel and bed and breakfast sector.  Even though Dublin Airport will be the hub in this deal, there are opportunities for Shannon Airport, too.  Hotels in Dublin are congested and almost at full capacity, but there is spare hotel capacity in the mid-west region.  There will also be opportunities for Shannon Airport to further expand transatlantic services down the road.  The sale of the State's shareholding will realise &euro;335 million and I very much hope the proposed connectivity fund will stimulate connectivity to Ireland because as an island nation connectivity is extremely important to us.  I hope some of the connectivity fund will be used to push transatlantic services into Shannon Airport. <\/p> <p> On the future of Aer Lingus employees, I would not be signing up to the agreement if I thought that it would negatively affect the jobs of the workers, particularly those at Shannon Airport who have given so much time and commitment to the company.  I certainly would not want their jobs to be jeopardised.  I am happy that the Minister has secured commitments from Aer Lingus that the workers' concerns will be dealt with through the expansion of registered employment agreements and I expect Aer Lingus to live up to its commitment, as it has done previously, that there will be no outsourcing of employment.<\/p> <p> Various Opposition Deputies have taken to their feet in the House today to criticise the deal.  That is not surprising, given that some elements of the Opposition oppose everything.  Fianna F&aacute;il has no policy whatsoever, other than to oppose the Government for the sake of it.  That has been proved here today by its arguments about Aer Lingus.  It left Shannon Airport in limbo for seven years and is not looking to the future now either.  It is not positive and its members do not see the potential for change and growth in the deal.  I have received numerous calls from constituents who are complimenting the Government on securing these guarantees, particularly the commitment on the Heathrow Airport slots.  I will be supporting the deal and commend the Minister for the work he has done on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700057#EEE00200","speaker":"974","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432748100,"counter":823,"content":"<p>I am not shocked, but I am deeply saddened that the Government has decided and will force through its decision by weight of numbers to sell the State's stake in what has always been to so many, me included, the national airline.  Shame on Fine Gael but even greater shame on the Labour Party for this.  We are told the Government decided to sell our Aer Lingus shareholding because the offer included improved connectivity to and from Ireland.  I urge the Minister to spell out the improvements and guarantees and the timeframe involved.  We are told the Government decided to sell our Aer Lingus shareholding because the offer included real benefits for the economy generally and would have a positive impact on aviation jobs in Ireland.  I challenge the Minister to spell out what the real benefits are and their long-term prospects for the economy and to explain to those who will lose their jobs in the company - a fate which is awaiting dozens of Aer Lingus employees, as acknowledged by the Minister earlier today - how this proposition represents a positive impact on their jobs in the aviation sector in Ireland.  The Minister tell us that employment rights will be fully safeguarded.  What about the right to keep one's job and continue to work in the employment of one's choice?  <\/p>  <p>  The offer, according to the Minister, is consistent with the Government's aviation policy.<\/p><p>I am reminded of the children's rhyme in which reference is made to any so-called Government aviation policy - fly away Enda, fly away Joan and please do not bother to come back either of you.<\/p> <p> The Minister tells us that Aer Lingus's current position is that it does not envisage compulsory redundancies or non-direct employment into the future.  This is clever language that guarantees absolutely nothing.  The current position referred to is the position today.  A reference to not envisaging and not foreseeing is easily overcome by, \"We could not see these changed circumstances back then.  The situation has changed and so too must our response.\"  Time will tell and we will see.<\/p> <p> Aer Lingus has a proud record of service to the people of Ireland.  Care, comfort and courtesy are all traits of the Aer Lingus brand and its cabin crew staff who have always impressed me in their dealings with passengers, whether on short or long-haul flights.  I use the opportunity to congratulate and thank them.  This acknowledgment is no more than they deserve.<\/p> <p> I also acknowledge and express equally deserved thanks and congratulations to members of Aer Lingus senior management who have acted with compassion and understanding in circumstances of real difficulty for Irish families dealing with a crisis overseas.  I am conscious of one such intervention recently that merits our collective appreciation.  That, too, is deserved recognition.<\/p> <p> Aer Lingus has been and still is for so many loyal customers, including for me when I have had the chance and opportunity to travel overseas, seen as our airline, Ireland's airline, our flag carrier at home and internationally.  Irish people abroad, whether on holiday or having relocated for work purposes, believe they are already back home when they board an Aer Lingus flight from any overseas airport, even before it departs.  The sense and the shared feeling is, \"Ah, we're home.\"<\/p> <p> We are an island people whose Government is willing to sell off a critical part of our transport infrastructure and give away control over our access to and from all of the important destinations and markets with which we have historical and newly built relations.  It is with great regret that I am participating in the debate.  I had hoped better counsel would have prevailed and that the Cabinet would not have approved selling our shares in Aer Lingus yesterday.  This is not just a sell-off; it is a sell-out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700058#FFF00200","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432748700,"counter":825,"content":"<p>We should all probably all declare our interest in Aer Lingus.  The majority of Members in this House travel with Aer Lingus.  If we had a choice, that is the airline with which we would travel.  Increasingly across the country people adopt that position.<\/p>  <p>  I know people who have worked for Aer Lingus during the years.  They have had good employment.  There have been difficulties in relations between management and staff in the company, but it is still a successful airline.<\/p>  <p>  I also know many Aer Lingus pensioners and have heard many of their stories about the shortfall in the pension fund.  I also knew TEAM Aer Lingus staff, many of whom were given letters of comfort about job security.  As we know to our cost, these letters turned out not to be worth the paper on which they were written.<\/p>  <p>  In my previous spell in this House one of my many jobs was as spokesperson on transport.  At the time there was considerable difficulty within Aer Lingus and the then Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government was discussing selling it.  Ten years ago, on Tuesday, 24 May 2005, I tabled a motion on Aer Lingus.  It may be for historians to read, but many of the things included in Sinn F&eacute;in's motion at the time are still relevant.  It recognised the enormous contribution to the economy made by the national airline, Aer Lingus, since its establishment; commended the workforce in Aer Lingus, as we have all done tonight, for building up the company over many years as one of the foremost airlines globally and for their major contribution in returning the company to record profitability since 2001; and noted that State funds, through the National Pensions Reserve Fund, were at the time being invested in aviation companies throughout the world, while the Government refused to invest State funds in Aer Lingus.<\/p>  <p>  The Government tabled an amendment stating these were matters for the board having regard to its statutory remit and that the Government did not have an input into them.  The amendment welcomed \"the Government&rsquo;s recent decision in principle on the sale of a majority shareholding in Aer Lingus to provide the funds needed by the company\".  The narrative now is that it was sold to bring the company into the 21st century and to make it more profitable and accessible.  The amendment also welcomed \"the Government's decision to maintain a significant minority stake in the airline to protect the State&rsquo;s key strategic interests\".  The debate at the time was about whether that stake was sufficient.  Many of us argue that it was a strategic mistake.<\/p>  <p>  I note what Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said about the importance of Aer Lingus.  One of the debates at the time was about a simple thing that was so important to families.  When someone dies abroad, there is the difficulty of getting the remains of a loved one flown back to Ireland.  That was a major concern at the time and people were talking about how it would happen in the future.  I have not heard that matter raised in this debate.  It will certainly be a concern of people in the future.  We all know about cases in which, unlike other airlines, Aer Lingus went the extra mile.  I would be as critical as many about changes we have seen in how Aer Lingus deals with customers and so on.  However, compared with other airlines that operate in the State, its connectivity with passengers is excellent.<\/p>  <p>  My motion in 2005 deplored \"the decision of the Government to sell the majority stake in Aer Lingus held by the State on behalf of the Irish people, thus leaving the company and the workforce open to exploitation by private commercial interests who will profit from the decades of investment by the Irish taxpayer in building up Aer Lingus and from the sacrifices of the workforce who saved the company in recent years\".  It also called on the Government to retain Aer Lingus in State ownership; invest in Aer Lingus; and safeguard the employment, pay and conditions of all Aer Lingus workers.  If we are really honest, we have to say the sale of Aer Lingus is a cheap, quick fire sale that will generate huge profits for a multinational conglomerate that will do well out of it.<\/p><p>It is certainly not motivated by the needs of the workers and definitely not in the short-term interests or benefit of the people.  The Minister has outlined his view on the matter.  The sale of Aer Lingus will conceivably cost jobs, but, again, there are no guarantees in that regard.  As stated by other speakers and in my humble opinion, jobs will definitely be lost and this sell-off will damage Ireland's connectivity and development.  This profitable and growing company which has key landing slots in an important airport is being sold for &euro;350 million, far below what it is worth, a matter on which other speakers have also commented.  We are now being told by the Government that revenue from the sale will be spent to increase connectivity to Ireland.  To be clear, we are selling off a key component of Ireland's connectivity to invest in its connectivity.  Perhaps I am being simplistic in that regard, but that is how it appears to me.  We have been told that the Heathrow Airport slots and that thousands of Aer Lingus jobs are safe for seven years.  We are asked to believe this stay of execution will hold for seven years, but I do not believe there is any guarantee that will happen.  To inject an air of honesty into the debate, I do not believe anybody can guarantee the jobs will be retained.<\/p> <p> I heard on radio today that a Labour Party Member, Deputy Michael McNamara, wanted to read the details of the proposal.  That is the right approach.  We all want to hear exactly what is contained in the proposal.  We know that IMPACT has still not received any correspondence from Aer Lingus on issues raised by it with the company in relation to its members.  Not only do Members of the House want to know the details of the proposal, so, too, do the trade unions.  <\/p> <p> If IAG decides to sell Aer Lingus or wrap up the company, what will happen to these wafer thin assurances that the Government and many back benchers claim are key assurances?  As I said, I opposed the original 75% sell-off of Aer Lingus, in respect of which I moved a motion in 2005.  Fianna F&aacute;il has some neck to pretend that it cares about Aer Lingus when it set in train the sale of that key shareholding in the company.  During the debate on the aforementioned motion I argued that a limited sell-off of shares would lead to full privatisation in the future, which is what is happening.  I will leave it to historians to work out.  While the Labour Party supported Sinn F&eacute;in on the issue at the time, because it is part of the Government it now feels a need to back it on this matter.  <\/p> <p> The belief is that revenue from the sale will be used to generate spending and a goodwill factor among the electorate.  I am sure the Minister will say the opposite.  The track record of the IAG indicates that its interests do not lie in providing jobs or supporting countries in which it purchases airlines.  Many speakers have commented on that issue also.  It was also stated in the House that following the takeover by IAG of Iberia in 2011, 4,500 jobs were lost, a huge number of jobs which is more than the entire staff of Aer Lingus.  Does anybody seriously believe the IAG board or its shareholders will be arguing in the interests of Ireland or its people?  That is the stuff of fairytales.  Members on this side of the House are regularly accused of all sorts of things but to suggest any of these people will care about what is happening in Ireland which is only a small cog in what they dream of as regards overall profits is a fairytale.<\/p> <p> What is the position on the deferred members of the Irish airlines superannuation scheme, IASS, who worked for Aer Lingus?  These workers are to be forced to take a 40% reduction in their pension entitlements by way of Government legislation.  What hope they do have of a fair resolution of their issues?  Perhaps the Minister might say whether some of the revenue derived from the sale could be used to meet the shortfall in that scheme in recognition of the hard work, commitment and sacrifices of the workers who built the company?  I do not know if that it is possible, but I am sure the proposal would have cross-party support.  <\/p> <p> Aer Lingus brings secure and consistent connectivity to Ireland that is vital to any island but particularly a country that relies heavily on foreign direct investment.  For years Aer Lingus has made Ireland an attractive destination.  Often, the first connection people have with Ireland is when they board an Aer Lingus flight.  The airline's reputation for quality promotes a positive image of Ireland across the world.  Irish people are proud of Aer Lingus, as I am sure all Members of the House are.  It is not possible to bottle the Aer Lingus brand, but it is worth its weight in gold.  The personal touch in the approach of Aer Lingus staff is the first indication visitors from the United States get of the welcome they will receive when coming to Ireland.  This sell-off will change the dynamic in that regard.  <\/p> <p> This is a bad deal for Ireland, as will become evident in the years to come.  I have referred to the motion I tabled in 2005 and what was happening at the time.  There have been huge changes in this country since.  Some believe this is a sell-out rather than a sell-off of Aer Lingus.  The motion will be passed by the House.  I genuinely hope the Minister's predictions of what is to happen will come true.  I am the doubting Thomas, the negative back bencher and so on, but I genuinely hope it will be a success.  While I am not in favour of the sale, I am sure it will go ahead.  I take the opportunity to wish the staff and company well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700059#GGG00200","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432749300,"counter":827,"content":"<p>The next speaking slot is being shared by Deputies Joe O'Reilly and Joe Costello.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700060#HHH00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1432749900,"counter":828,"content":"<p>I have three concerns I would like to highlight during this debate.  Like many of my colleagues, my first concern is the general, economic and social well-being of our country into the future so that our people will have the best possible standard of living, the best possible employment and the best opportunity for a good quality of life.  My second concern, which was addressed by the previous two speakers, is the maintenance of the fundamental character of Aer Lingus, its brand name, our pride in it and its role as a marketing tool for Ireland.  My third concern is very important.  I represent the same constituency as Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  There are many people in my constituency who commute to work in Dublin Airport.  I know of a few people from my town of Bailieborough who travel to Dublin Airport to work.  This would be a feature across south Monaghan, Cavan and so on.  I am deeply concerned about the security of their jobs and those of the people from across Cavan-Monaghan who commute alongside them to work at Dublin Airport.  These are my three concerns regarding this matter.<\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that some 4,000 people are employed by Aer Lingus and that aviation supports 26,000 jobs directly in this country and some 16,000 jobs in the supply chain.  Tourism, which is significantly linked with the industry and is intricately linked with this debate, employs 180,000 people here.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has had a departmental steering group and advisers engaged in discussion with IAG over a number of weeks and months on the issues of employment creation and retention and I applaud him on the extraordinary, skilful and professional manner in which he has dealt with the issues throughout this time.  He has kept the national interest to the fore at all times and has bargained toughly and consistently and scrutinised every sub-clause in every proposal from IAG.  We are very lucky to have had someone with his skills to do that.  The process has continued over weeks and he has done well.<\/p>  <p>  Today, I asked the Minister and a senior official of Aer Lingus on behalf of my Cavan-Monaghan constituents how we will fare in regard to job retention, new jobs, standards, salaries, working conditions and agreements etc.  I was assured by the Minister, and I accept his assurance totally as it is part of the agreement, that 200 new direct jobs will be created before the end of 2016 in Aer Lingus as a consequence of the deal, expanded business and new destinations.  Some 50 jobs will be lost, however, in the process, in back office areas.  However, the 50 jobs lost will be absorbed by voluntary restructuring, redeployment and ongoing voluntary severance, which suits certain people at a particular juncture in their lives.  Jobs will come from investment in the Aer Lingus fleet and route expansion.  Up to 2020, some 635 jobs will be created.  Some 470 of these will be pilot and cabin crew, 165 will be engineers and the remainder ground staff.  As a result of increased connectivity, more flights and activity, a greater volume of business coming through the airports and the increase in destinations, the volume of tourism and all that goes with it will also increase.<\/p>  <p>  An important part of the agreement that will, hopefully, be agreed by the D&aacute;il is the safeguarding of the current rights of employees.  I was delighted to receive assurance from the Minister on this.  Not only will new jobs be created and existing jobs be maintained, the rights of employees will be safeguarded.  IAG will re-register existing employment agreements and these will have legal standing.  This reassurance is critical.<\/p>  <p>  The buzzword in this debate is \"connectivity\".  We are all concerned that Ireland will not lose any outward or inward flights or business and that we will have access to other countries and markets.  It is essential that Aer Lingus remains a competitor for the well developed airline, Ryanair.  In the context of connectivity, Heathrow is the most significant destination airport from Dublin.  The destination for some 8% of seats is Heathrow, some 3% and 2% go to Paris and Amsterdam respectively.  Some 20% of seats from Cork and some 25% from Shannon go to Heathrow.  Heathrow delivers a comprehensive service of long haul flights across the globe, with flights to 180 destinations in 85 countries provided by 82 airlines.  Therefore, the slots, access, entry and continuation of flights from Ireland to Heathrow are of vital national interest.<\/p>  <p>  Under the terms of the agreement, the Minister for Finance, in consultation with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, will ultimately have a veto on the sale of the slots.  The sale of the slots cannot legally arise for seven years.  This veto is critical.  I believe that we will see such an improvement of business as a result of more global marketing and a more enhanced trading position that the sale of the slots will not arise.  We will have such a volume of business that we will have significant use for the slots and Aer Lingus.  Nonetheless, it is important for us and the workers that we have the legal guarantee.<\/p>  <p>  All Aer Lingus current winter and summer daily schedule frequencies will be maintained for seven years and all of Aer Lingus's flights to and from Heathrow from other Irish airports will continue for the first five years.  In other words, airports around the country will be protected for five years.  It is worth noting that these are guarantees we do not have currently.  These are critical enhancements.  Other enhancements are the expanded number of jobs, this guarantee and a better tourism product.  For the 2016 summer season, two new transatlantic destinations in North America will be added to the Aer Lingus schedule.  By 2020, four new transatlantic routes delivering 2.4 million more passengers will be in existence.  Therefore, we will have the sales and marketing potential of the larger IAG group.  This rationalisation is a pattern throughout the aviation industry across Europe and the list of exceptions to this kind of merger would be a short one.  Those airlines operating alone are not very successful.  We need access to global markets for long-term success.<\/p>  <p>  In his contribution this morning and in previous internal party communications, the Minister referred to the fact that he had to avoid a situation where there might be a disadvantageous or aggressive takeover in future that would not be in our interests and needed to protect the airline against an adverse situation that might arise later.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like an assurance from the Minister when he responds on this debate regarding the moneys earned from the sale.  He mentioned using the proceeds for connectivity.  I hope he can assure me that some of these moneys might be used to ensure we can get broadband delivered to areas such as Cavan and Monaghan and rural areas across the country where it is not currently viable to deliver it.  I would like to hear the Minister say the moneys accruing from this sale will deliver this connectivity.  Following his assurance to me on the delivery and retention of jobs, the promise of the delivery of broadband connectivity would be most reassuring, particularly in an area like mine which is effectively a commuter area as a result of the newly developed motorways.<\/p>  <p>  All in all, this is the best call for the country and will serve the country's interest best.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700061#JJJ00100","speaker":"971"},{"type":"speech","time":1432749900,"counter":829,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire.

It appeared to be a predatory bid - a straightforward takeover of the company without protections for the workforce that had made Aer Lingus such a proud, successful international brand.  There was no consideration given to the crucial Heathrow slots and the connectivity that was the lifeblood of Aer Lingus.  There was no commitment to ensuring the future viability of the regional hubs in Shannon and Cork.  Indeed, the valuation of the shares was sloppy and unprofessional and was later improved substantially to reflect a truer value for the company.<br\/><br\/>Aer Lingus was seen by IAG as simply another company that could be bought and sold through the shareholders, and with the company's directors on board there was little or no consideration for the Irish national interest.  The main thrust of the takeover bid was to acquire the 25.1% golden share held by the Irish Government so that henceforth there would be no State involvement in the company.  It was expected that once the State's shareholding was acquired, the other main shareholder, Ryanair, with 30% of the shares, would fall into line and sell its shares too.  It was a stark scenario, and it posed a major threat to the national interest.  Thankfully, the Government said &quot;No&quot;.<br\/><br\/>A group of eight Labour TDs, mainly from the north side of Dublin, were so concerned that we banded together against the takeover bid.  We did not go shouting and roaring, as some sectors of this House do at every problem that raises its head.  Instead, we took a leaf from the book of James Connolly and James Larkin: we organised.  We made our opposition to the deal very clear.  We consulted widely with the trade union movement and other stakeholders.  We drew up a motion that incorporated our concerns and that needed to be addressed before the sale of the 25.1% State shareholding could be considered.  That motion included the concerns of the trade union movement.  It was put to the Labour Party national conference in February 2015 and, passed unanimously by the delegates, it became Labour policy.<br\/><br\/>I wish to put the motion on the record of the House as some Members have referred to it, many inaccurately.  It is as follows:<blockquote>Conference welcomes the Government&rsquo;s decision to reject the terms of the present bid from International Airlines Group (IAG) for the takeover of Aer Lingus and,<br \/><br \/>Recognising that:<br \/><br \/>1. Aer Lingus was formed in 1936 and has established itself as a proud flag carrier for our nation through its 79 year history and remains a potent Irish brand today<br \/><br \/>2. The Labour Party has always strived to act in the best interests of Aer Lingus throughout its history, in particular opposing the privatisation of the company in 2006 by Fianna F&aacute;il<br \/><br \/>Acknowledging that:<br \/><br \/>1.Aer Lingus has demonstrated a robustness and resilience in surviving the worst crisis in the history of the aviation industry after the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001<br \/><br \/>2.Aer Lingus has also survived the worst crisis in the history of the Irish economy in 2008<br \/><br \/>3.Aer Lingus has established a unique pre-clearance transatlantic hub at Dublin and Shannon airports <br \/><br \/>4.Aer Lingus has achieved in 2014 record high levels of revenue and traveller numbers, which are forecast to continue to grow solidly<br \/><br \/>5.Aer Lingus is now a very healthy company which is in a strong position to further its own growth plan<br \/><br \/>Recognising, in particular, the special role played by workers, who had to go through multiple restructuring programmes, in ensuring the company&rsquo;s survival and continuing strong growth<br \/><br \/>Conference therefore calls on;<br \/><br \/>The Government to reject the IAG bid for the state&rsquo;s shares in Aer Lingus and any further takeover bid that does not clearly address the following:<br \/><br \/>1.The serious concerns that the bid fails to reflect the true value of Aer Lingus and, therefore, an independent valuation of the assets of the company is required.  In particular, a valuation of the 23 Heathrow slots.<br \/><br \/>2.The need for a firm commitment in the form of Registered Employment Agreements precluding the outsourcing of jobs and\/or compulsory redundancies to protect Aer Lingus workers' employment and conditions of employment.<br \/><br \/>3.Meaningful, reliable and long term guarantees around connectivity and the &quot;Heathrow Slots&quot;.<br \/><br \/>4.The need to articulate a plan which would promote Shannon and Cork airports, taking into account their distinct business models and impact on their individual regions.<\/blockquote>These four requirements have been addressed in the new deal that has been negotiated by the Minister and proposed to this House.<br\/><br\/>In regard to the valuation of the company, an independent valuation has now been carried out by external financial and legal advisers.<br\/><br\/>In regard to employment, IAG has agreed that a registered employment agreement will be introduced into Aer Lingus as provided for under the framework enshrined in the Industrial Relations Bill 2015 to protect the terms and conditions of Aer Lingus employees and, as the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, said earlier in the House, those negotiations can start immediately.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, Aer Lingus is committed to there being no compulsory redundancies, agreed to extend the application of registered employment agreements, REAs, to new sectors of the workforce, and committed to extending the scope of the REAs.  A vital new platform for industrial negotiations in this country has been established not just for Aer Lingus but for the entirety of the trade union movement.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the key Heathrow slots, the proposed deal will strengthen enormously the Government control over the disposal of Heathrow slots.  At present, the Government's 25.1% shareholding cannot by itself prevent the Heathrow slots being sold.  The proposed deal will give the Government unilateral power to block the disposal of the Heathrow slots for an unlimited period, a veto that will guarantee crucial connectivity into the future for this island nation.  Likewise, there is a veto on the removal of the name Aer Lingus, the removal of the brand and the removal of the headquarters in Dublin.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the promotion of Cork and Shannon airports, IAG has outlined plans to sustain existing services and to grow Cork and Shannon.<br\/><br\/>We must remind the House that Fianna F&aacute;il privatised Aer Lingus in 2006 by selling off 75% of the shareholding.  At any time there could be a hostile takeover of the company through acquisition of that 75% shareholding, with the Government not in a position to lift a finger.  That genie cannot now be put back in the bottle.<br\/><br\/>None of the Fianna F&aacute;il Members in 2006 that are in the House today ever spoke a word when the debate was taking place.  They never said a word about the shameful sale.  Not one of them said a word about guarantees.  Not one of them said a word about Heathrow slots.  They said nothing about the connectivity that they are so worried about now.  Not a single attempt was made to protect the workers when the sale took place.  Now Fianna F&aacute;il's crocodile tears are flooding into this Chamber.<br\/><br\/>I listened yesterday to Deputy Adams, the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in, state categorically in this Chamber that 1,200 jobs would be lost in Aer Lingus due to compulsory redundancies.  That was his statement, and it is on the record of the House.  I am afraid that honourable Member is something of a stranger to the truth.  I am also afraid that the two Opposition parties are like the emperor; they have no clothes.<br\/><br\/>I commend this deal to the House.  It is an incredible deal considering the situation at the outset and the situation that had to be addressed.  I compliment the Minister on a job well done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700061#JJJ00200","speaker":"1006","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432750500,"counter":831,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Joan Collins.

Aer Lingus was a successful, profitable State enterprise established in 1936, and an important symbol of the independence of this island nation.  The decision to part privatise Aer Lingus was a purely ideological one taken by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats, and rightly denounced as such by the Labour Party at the time.<\/p>  <p>  I heard somebody say earlier that in 2006, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party allowed two hours for the debate.  Are we supposed to thank the Government for giving us six hours or eight hours?  We are not talking about the time for the debate; we are talking about what the Government is doing.  Despite that, Aer Lingus today is a successful and profitable company employing 4,000 people directly and as many again indirectly.<\/p>  <p>  This decision has major consequences for jobs.  The verbal guarantee on jobs, that the company does not foresee any future redundancies or job losses, is not worth the paper on which it is written.<\/p>  <p>  In 1990, Aer Lingus's 2,000 workers seconded to TEAM Aer Lingus were given letters of comfort.  Those guarantees were not just from Aer Lingus but also from the Government and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The ink was not even dry on them when those 2,000 workers were transferred to a new employer without their knowledge.<\/p>  <p>  While there will be an increase in the number of pilots and air crew, which the company had already planned - the Government is rehashing the same jobs - they will be offset by job losses among ground crew, catering, check-in and maintenance staff.<\/p><p>Heavy maintenance will be outsourced.  Job losses will be inevitable as IAG seeks to rationalise the workforce.  Many of us have received e-mails from Aer Lingus workers.  A woman who has worked there for a long time e-mailed to say:<blockquote>I am an Aer Lingus worker.  I am very worried about the security of my job with the sale of our fabulous airline.  Have our Government learnt nothing after the sale of Irish Ferries and eircom?  To me this is a short term gain for long term pain to all employees and to Aer Lingus.  Aer Lingus management are set to gain lotto figures with this sale, so they are, of course, pushing this sale.  You have one vote on this, guys.  We have one vote for the rest of our lives.<\/blockquote>That was just one of the many e-mails I have received already about this.  This is why the Government is trying to railroad this in before the weekend and the D&aacute;il break, to try to take the pressure off them.<br\/><br\/>There are serious questions about the &euro;1.3 billion valuation of Aer Lingus in this deal.  How can a company with &euro;1 billion in cash, Heathrow slots worth at least &euro;500 million, a fleet of modern aircraft including large transatlantic aircraft, a valuable brand and a brilliant safety record be sold for &euro;1.3 billion.  It is incredible that the Government is settling for such a figure.  I will quote another e-mail I received from a man who has been an Aer Lingus employees for 42 years and six months:<blockquote>So much for the protection of Irish workers, but in particular the people who have been robbed of their rightful pensions.  We now have certainly the hardships to look forward to in our old age.  All politicians who go along with this sale without any reference to our group, the IASS Deferred Pensioners, should hold their heads in shame.<\/blockquote>These e-mails are very important, given that they come from the people who are affected by a sale of Aer Lingus.  Another e-mail stated:<blockquote>As you will all be aware, Joe Costello, TD, stated publicly on the Pat Kenny show that deferred pensioners would be factored into any sale of Aer Lingus agreed by the Government.  The Labour Party so-called Aer Lingus seven have not even been able to deal with that.<\/blockquote>There are 5,000 deferred pensioners and 5,000 current pensioners.  Deferred pensioners have been treated disgracefully.  Workers with more than 40 years service have seen their pension entitlements reduced by up to 50%.  One deferred pensioner who wrote to me has had his pension cut from &euro;12,000 per year - hardly a fortune - down to &euro;6,000 - a pittance.  At the very least, the Labour Party Deputies who make promises on these issues should have insisted that money from the deal be set aside to alleviate the problems faced by the deferred pensioners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700062#KKK00300","speaker":"1193","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432751100,"counter":834,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700063#LLL00200","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1432751100,"counter":835,"content":"<p>Once again, the Labour Party has shown its unwillingness and inability to do what it promised to do in government, namely, to protect working people.

Like the banks and other major multinational companies, its shareholders will come before the needs of a nation or the workers.  We have seen this across the board.  Their interests are not the national interests or the workers' interests but the shareholders' interests.  The Minister rightly said that Fianna F&aacute;il paved the way.  The Minister has put the nail in the coffin.  He has carried through the full privatisation of Aer Lingus, our national State airline.  As with the implementation of the austerity measures to which Fianna F&aacute;il had committed, the Government took the baton and ran with it, despite having said differently.<\/p><p>This is part of the sale of our State assets, a deal made with the troika whereby &euro;3 billion is supposed to be raised from the sale of State assets, two thirds of which is to be used to pay the bank debt.

Again, the Government is extending the inevitable for another five to six years, or possibly seven years, if we even get that from it.  In the meantime, there is no guarantee that IAG will not be taken over or that conditions will not change and employees again face job losses or redundancies.<\/p><p>I appeal to the Government to step back and give itself time to re-examine this.

The Government assumed power in 2011 amidst a self-proclaimed democratic revolution.  Its programme for Government listed the many reforms it would implement to create what is called &quot;a fairer and more equal Ireland&quot;.  One such reform was D&aacute;il reform, which set out, in its own words, to &quot;deal with the problem of legislation being shunted through at high speed&quot;.  The manner in which this motion is being bulldozed through the D&aacute;il makes a mockery of those reforms and, more seriously, is an abuse of the democratic process and the Government's power.  The Government has made a concerted effort to keep members of the Opposition in the dark over the details of the motion while ensuring the media and everybody else were fully briefed.  This is an unprecedented level of arrogance from the Government and is grossly disrespectful to Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann who have been elected by the people.  It smacks of a Government which is rapidly trying to clear the decks before the next general election.<\/p><p>Deputy Costello's contribution a few minutes ago highlighted the other reason for the rush through the House, namely, to protect windy Labour Party Deputies across north Dublin, who gave commitments and promises to deferred pensioners and Aer Lingus workers that they would oppose this deal.  Like many in the House, I received an e-mail late last night from one of those deferred pensioners and it is worth noting the first few sentences of it, as follows:<blockquote>As you will be aware, Joe Costello TD stated publicly on the Pat Kenny show that deferred pensioners should be factored into any sale of Aer Lingus agreed by the Government.  This outcome is one that would save deferred pensioners such as myself from an old age of poverty and I urge and plead with all right-thinking TDs in a position of responsibility and power, especially Labour Party TDs, to support Joe in his public stance on this matter.<\/blockquote>That says it all.  The level of cynicism from the magnificent seven Labour Deputies of north Dublin is shocking.  The proposed sale of the shares is bad for jobs, Aer Lingus workers and Ireland's connectivity and economic development.<\/p><p>Last month <i>The Irish Times<\/i>reported that it contacted a number of Ministers who said that selling Aer Lingus to IAG would make commercial sense and was in the long-term interest of the airline.  This is an example of everything that is wrong with this Government and the motion before us.  The Government should not see its role as fighting for the commercial interests of a company instead of the best interests of the Irish people.  IAG is a multinational corporation which is seeking to expand its commercial interests.  If it succeeds in this takeover bid with the assistance of the Government, it will be at the cost of the Irish people.<br\/><br\/>The sale of Aer Lingus to IAG would make it a very small part of a huge multinational corporation for which shareholder value, or profit in other words, is the dominant concern.  IAG has no regard for the best interest of the Irish people, whether they are customers and employees of Aer Lingus or those whose livelihoods depend on business and tourism.  The winners in this takeover will be the executive and senior members of Aer Lingus management, some of whom will receive multi-million euro payouts, IAG shareholders and Ryanair.  The Government is attempting to steamroll its short-sighted decision through the House because it is deaf to the protests of workers, unions and the general public, who are the real shareholders.  If this sale proceeds, the interest of IAG shareholders will always trump the needs of the Irish economy, the travelling public and Aer Lingus workers.  The State should retain a majority shareholding, at the least, in Aer Lingus because it is a strategically important company for this island economy.  The idea that State ownership is bad and private good has been proven false.<br\/><br\/>Since it was established in 1936, Aer Lingus has developed into one of the best performing state-owned airlines in Europe, with a powerful international brand, key routes and great staff.  It provides a more reliable service than low cost airlines and is a profit making player on transatlantic routes.  It has cash reserves of more than &euro;1 billion and its Heathrow slots have been valued by Deloitte at more than &euro;500 million.  It is also an adept regional independent player in a world dominated by big airlines.  In 2014 it carried 10 million passengers on its 50 aircraft and enjoyed a turnover of &euro;1.6 billion.  It is no wonder that IAG shareholders want to get their hands on it.  Currently Aer Lingus employs approximately 3,900 people, not counting the many thousands employed in downstream industries.  IMPACT estimates that a takeover by IAG could put up to 1,200 jobs at risk because the new parent company would be likely to seek substantial cuts to justify its investment.  One of the primary cost cutting measures will come from a reduction in staff numbers.  Following its takeover by IAG, Iberia announced 4,500 job losses.  A secret report prepared for Aer Lingus by Nyras suggests potentially significant job losses, including cuts of 20% to ground handling staff, 40% to catering staff, 15% to maintenance staff and 25% to heavy maintenance staff.<br\/><br\/>Far from selling its shareholding in Aer Lingus, the Government should make the strategic decision to purchase a majority shareholding.  It will be able to do so when Ryanair divests itself of its shareholding.  This would allow Ireland to retain a major indigenous company and continue to expand its air bridge with the rest of the world.  The ideological hostility to state ownership is outdated and wrong.  The tentative assurances given by Aer Lingus and IAG are not sufficient to address workers' concerns about compulsory redundancies and the outsourcing of jobs.  Aer Lingus workers, who have made a huge contribution to the company's success, will rightly ask why a legal guarantee be offered in some areas but not in regard to their conditions of employment, including compulsory redundancies and outsourcing of jobs.  This sale and the offer by IAG must be seen for what it is, a sell-out and a money-grab at the expense of the Irish people and the workers of Aer Lingus.  It is part of a continuing campaign by this Government and its predecessors to sell off the hard won assets of this country under the heading of liberalisation.  The Government has capitulated to the troika's demand to sell every State asset that can be sold.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Costello's contribution was the height of cynicism.  It is worth noting the position of the two major trade unions in Aer Lingus.  SIPTU has stated it will vigorously oppose the Government's plan to sell off its 25% shareholding in Aer Lingus due to the failure of the company to provide a commitment to workers that it will not impose compulsory redundancies or outsource jobs.  IMPACT has stated that the proposed takeover of Aer Lingus is bad for jobs, workers and economic development.  Staff at the company have genuine concerns about compulsory redundancies if the deal is completed, as well as further erosion of terms and conditions of employment due to the inevitable restructuring of the company.  The commitments that the magnificent seven Labour Party Deputies gave to the deferred pensioners and workers have come to nothing.  I oppose the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700063#LLL00400","speaker":"960","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432751700,"counter":838,"content":"<p>I thank the board of Aer Lingus and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport for the considerable work they have done on this matter since the original offer was made.  That offer was not acceptable to the vast majority of people, including the Cabinet and myself.  The revised offer brings certainty to a situation in which the airline was relying on a number of aging aircraft on its transatlantic routes.  Eight Airbus A330 aircraft are due to be retired and the airline had ordered a number of new aircraft, the Airbus A350, but it had to delay its purchase of the aircraft because of a lack of funds.  This highlights a particular issue for Aer Lingus as a small operator in the international scene in terms of sustaining itself as a company employing more than 3,500 people.  It currently owns 48 aircraft and leases another three but it has to enlarge and improve its fleet if it is to expand and remain on a sustainable footing.  It is not in a position to do that at present.<\/p>  <p>  By joining a conglomeration of airlines under IAG, it will have the financial backing to expand.  This morning we heard that IAG will invest &euro;1.5 billion in Aer Lingus.<\/p><p>That is clearly welcome and it will allow them to expand not only on the routes they have suggested - four new transatlantic routes, two of which will be started up next year and the other two by 2018 - but also growth in employment levels.  The current employment figure from last year is 3,766 and I understand that an additional 630 will be taken on over the next five years.  That is a beneficial part of this arrangement.  Not only have we seen investment in the fleet, but also in the size of the airline's employees.  There has also been an increase in the number of destinations that Irish customers can avail of.  In addition to direct flights from Dublin, as part of the IAG group, cheaper flights will no doubt be offered to passengers who are continuing their journeys to other places, particularly in Africa and the Far East which are growing destinations for Irish customers.<\/p> <p> I still have concerns about the terms and conditions of existing employees, a great many of whom are in my constituency and dotted elsewhere around Dublin.  I have received the 36 page document but have not yet had time to read it.  The business case for the disposal of the shareholding of this private company is warranted.  In addition to the value placed upon it, the strategic investment fund will give the Government an opportunity to invest in critical infrastructure in and around the airports, which I assume is the plan for that fund.<\/p> <p> The international airline industry is a fragile one.  A bit like our economy, it is on a high at the moment and is doing reasonably well but it is fragile.  A number of industry experts have spoken about this matter in the last 24 hours and I was listening to some of them on radio programmes this morning.  They stated that the reality of a small airline like Aer Lingus is that there are international issues, including the ash cloud, military events or terrorist incidents, which can cause massive problems for airlines.<\/p> <p> We saw a number of such firms go out of existence following the September 2001 attacks in the United States.  They included Swissair and Malev.  They were flag carriers, as is Aer Lingus.  No doubt they were considered to be strategic assets in their countries of origin.  Aer Lingus is an asset to all of us.  Like most Irish people, we are loyal to that brand with the shamrock, but it is not a State asset.  It is a plc and was sold in 2006.  The realisation of the value of the State's 25.1% share was inevitable.  It was only a matter of time before a suitable firm purchased the company with a view to improving its service to the Irish people and its connectivity across the world.  IAG has made clear its ambition to do that.<\/p> <p> I assume and hope that the loyalty Irish customers have to Aer Lingus will continue on that basis.  If Members will pardon the pun, the sky is the limit in terms of where the company can go and how its workforce can continue to grow.<\/p> <p> The previous speaker raised the issue of Iberia, which is an interesting one.  First and foremost, Iberia was a state-owned company when it was sold.  Back in the day when Aer Lingus was State-owned, the pension fund was used as an exiting tool to encourage people to leave.  Iberia, however, was purchased and not downsized but its staff were because it had too many employees.  It was in a crisis scenario, but Aer Lingus is not.  Aer Lingus is a lean, profitable airline serving 48 destinations, with an additional transatlantic route starting this summer to Washington.  As part of this proposal, we will also see the four transatlantic routes.  From my perspective that is a positive thing.<\/p> <p> Dublin Airport has grown over the last few years since the beginning of the crisis.  The numbers are now getting back to an encouraging level concerning the availability of jobs both on and off the airport campus in recent months.  I know of three firms in the airport that are providing services to airlines that are currently enlarging their staff.<\/p> <p> If one looks at the ratio of employees to aircraft, the effect of new routes on ground staff, and the eight new aircraft that have been promised as part of the takeover, it is very positive.  However, I do have some slight concerns about the employment terms and conditions of existing personnel.  They have contracts which are being adhered to, as has been stated, in line with the proposed takeover, and there is an increased number of employees.<\/p> <p> At the same time, as a private company Aer Lingus is susceptible to market forces.  If, for instance, the international aviation industry was to nosedive and face difficulties following an event that caused airlines to be grounded for a period, Aer Lingus would be the first firm to feel such an impact.  However, as a cog in a much larger organisation it would not feel the impact as quickly, which is positive for employees both in Dublin and the regional airports.<\/p> <p> The sale of the State's 25.1% shareholding in Aer Lingus will result in &euro;330 million plus another &euro;6 million which is due in a dividend.  That sort of money can readily be used for investment in infrastructure around the airport.  We have seen investment in Dublin and Shannon airports in recent years.  It would be welcome to see that money targeting airport infrastructure the public uses daily, including roads.<\/p> <p> As regards the &euro;330 million the State will gain from the sale if it goes through, I will selfishly mention my constituency and the Minister's in terms of the north Dublin transport corridor.  I will take the opportunity to plug that because &euro;330 million would go a long way towards an investment directly serving Dublin airport and Swords.  It is a critical piece of infrastructure for the northside of Dublin, hopefully linking into the existing Luas network which serves Dublin and the rail network which serves the country at large.<\/p> <p> If that is what the Minister has in mind, such connectivity will certainly be of great benefit to everyone who uses Dublin airport from time to time or travels through Dublin to other locations, for example, on the northern rail line.  Such an amount of money would be welcome for infrastructural and connectivity investment, particularly in Fingal where Dublin airport is located.<\/p> <p> As regards the Heathrow slots, I do not want to go over the same ground that has already been covered by every speaker who has contributed to the debate today.  Those slots have a value of approximately &euro;300 million.  They are of critical importance to this island nation which does an enormous amount of trade with our partners in the UK and the rest of Europe.  Those slots have been guaranteed as part of this deal.  It was a guarantee we did not have up to the point of that offer yesterday.<\/p> <p> The only example we can give is the decision of the Aer Lingus board to relocate its services from Shannon and move them to Belfast.<\/p><p>That did not work out in the end but with the State's 25.1% shareholding, we were powerless to do anything about it.  My perspective on the Heathrow slots is that we were powerless to do anything about the movement of slots but we have now been given a guarantee that nothing will happen to them and they will remain attached to Dublin Airport.  That would be a very significant gesture on the part of IAG.  It did not need to do it and it could have taken over the company in a hostile manner.  It could have taken over the vast majority of the shares - perhaps even the balance of 74.9% - and done whatever it wanted.  The company did not need to give guarantees in the proposed business model but it gave the commitments, one would assume, because of an element of loyalty that Mr. Willie Walsh has for Aer Lingus, having run it for a number of years beforehand.  It also presents opportunities to make a profit for shareholders and the citizens of Ireland, who will utilise the airline and the rest of the group in getting around the world.  That must be borne in mind in this discussion.<\/p> <p> Individuals mentioned the \"paltry\" sum of approximately &euro;300 million.  I do not believe it is paltry, as it would pay for half of the north Dublin transport corridor or a large number of services in and around our airports across the country.  That is not even mentioning the guarantee of an increase in jobs over a five years, which is a significant investment.  We should bear in mind that if these individuals happened to be on the unemployment line now, the State could save in the region of &euro;20,000 per individual per annum if they could be taken from the unemployment line into Aer Lingus.  It is a very significant figure for the State to bear in mind.<\/p> <p> The brand and headquarters, etc., are being retained and 2.4 million passengers will be delivered to Dublin either in transit or as direct customers to our shores for tourism purposes.  There were fantastic results published today by Tourism Ireland relating to growth; there was a 25% figure for Spain, a 15% figure for the UK and a 20% figure for mainland Europe.  These are really significant and terrific figures and each one of those travellers would no doubt bring in excess of &euro;1,000.  I am sure it would be more than that but I do not have that figure to hand.  The investment that such people bring to our shores really helps us to keep up employment and continue growing our economy in a sustainable fashion.<\/p> <p> There was mention of a report from Nyras.  I have not seen the report but I have helpfully printed the Fianna F&aacute;il press release, for which I thank Deputy Fleming.  The statements from Aer Lingus are quite telling in its view of the report, which is an industry standard.  It is not an unusual report to have done on behalf of an airline.  It has no bearing in the context of the IAG offer and Aer Lingus has stated that this type of exercise is part of the normal course of business in the highly competitive international airline sector.  The company argues that it is highly misleading to suggest that there would be reductions in employment within the airline as a result.  We have heard from the commissioners of that report that it was a marking or comparative exercise on the international competition to Aer Lingus.  From that perspective, I do not believe for a moment that this in some way undermines the IAG offer.  I am positive, given the commitments received by the State, and some of which will be written into the constitution of Aer Lingus and legally binding agreements provided to the Minister, that the guarantees will be upheld.<\/p> <p> On the jobs issue, if the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, took to the plinth tomorrow morning and announced 635 new jobs, I am fairly sure members of the Opposition would welcome it, particularly if they were around the airport in the constituencies of Dublin North-West, Dublin Central-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700064#MMM00200","speaker":"1014","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432752900,"counter":841,"content":"<p>Dublin Bay North.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700066#OOO00200","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1432752900,"counter":842,"content":"<p>-----or Dublin Bay North.  It is a positive that we have had such a commitment given to us.  Of course, it will be subject to the market conditions in the next five years but 150 net new jobs by next year would amount to significant growth within the airline, given that it has 3,766 employees now.  Back office staff will be lost as part of this takeover and it is regrettable that as part of this, there will be some function within the airline that would be duplicated across the group.  There were commitments given today by IAG at its press conference that some functions within the firm will remain, as is the case with its other group airlines.  Some administrative functions remain in existing organisations.  Ultimately, a result of 150 net jobs is what it is, and I am sure it would not be impossible for individuals to apply for the positions if they already work within the airline, given the experience they could bring.<\/p>  <p>  I am cautious about the approach of IAG but I welcome the ability to sustain employment in the airline and expand the Aer Lingus network and routes so as to provide additional destinations for the Irish customer base.  The airline is currently serving 70 destinations, and that number will increase significantly as a result of this propose takeover.  I reiterate my thanks to the Minister for bringing all of this to us.  I am sure dealing with IAG and the board of Aer Lingus has taken a considerable amount of his time over the past number of months since the first offer was made.

That is the reason it is a target for this hostile takeover bid.  The airline is growing and the question is why it should be sold or even for sale.  It should not be for sale and the hostile takeover bid should have been rebuffed.<\/p>  <p>  Lest we forget, this is an Irish-owned and controlled company.  The Irish taxpayer owns 25%, the employees and pilots own approximately 5% and an Irish company, Ryanair, owns 30%.

The Minister is making out that we are only selling a little bit but his actions will mean part of the Irish-owned share will be sold.  The partnership involving Ryanair and other private investors was working well, so it should not be sold.  The guarantees that have been mentioned by the Minister cannot and will not hold because there is no legal mechanism to enforce them.  When Aer Lingus is sold, it is sold.  Has the Minister got that?  He should not give us waffle about guarantees, as when it is sold, it is sold.

I listened with absolute horror one morning on my way to the Houses to a mother on KFM radio station who described a heartless incident where her dead baby was brought to her in a tin box with a cloth over it.  She had queried during her pregnancy if everything was all right, but when her baby was born it had catastrophic deformities.  Those assurances made it much more difficult to come to terms with the baby's death.  The families involved need to know the truth and must be facilitated to know it and we must stop codding ourselves about maternity services.  Dr. Rhona Mahony has said that in the past decade Holles Street Hospital had seen a sharp increase in activity without the corresponding increase in staff.  I just use it as an example.  Writing in the hospital's clinical report for 2013, she highlighted severe shortages of consultants and midwives at the hospital.  She said the UK had three to four times the number of consultants in obstetrics compared to Ireland and went on to say the hospital was overexposed in terms of the volume and complexity of cases.  She said doctors and midwives found themselves in an extremely challenging environment.  She pointed out that complications could be unpredictable and severe.<\/p>  <p>  We already know through an article written by Nicola Anderson that Irish women spend on average just two days in hospital after giving birth, which is approximately half the time most other European women spend in a maternity unit.  More and more, their experience resembles a conveyor belt.  As women in Ireland on average give birth later, we are far more likely to see complications.  I talked recently to an obstetrician who told me how terrified they all are of litigation.  They have that spectre hanging over them, which influences every decision they make.  We must pay attention to what is happening now.  It is getting to a point where we could see a repeat of this.  It will be a resources issue then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700067#PPP00700","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speech","time":1432753500,"counter":855,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak on this very important debate on the Midland Regional Hospital in Portlaoise.  Before I go into the details of the debate, it is important to recognise that it is families that are involved here.  It is babies, mothers, fathers and extended families.  I extend my deepest sympathy to all the parents and families of babies who died at that hospital and note the terrible way they were treated by the HSE after their loss.  My heart goes out to them, but they need more than sympathy.  They need our practical support.  Concealing information should never be an option.  We must always improve our game to ensure we comply with best international medical practice.<\/p>  <p>  I deplore the decisions of Ministers and the Department of Health not to allow the Midland Regional Hospital to be funded as a model 3 hospital.  HIQA found that services at the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, were not governed, resourced or equipped to provide the level of care expected of a model 3 hospital.  That is the bottom line.  The Minister must wake up, fund the services and stop hanging around.  Like Beaumont Hospital in my own constituency, this hospital needs our support.  At Beaumont Hospital, they need 80 to 100 beds to be opened to end the crisis in accident and emergency.  Last week, I met the management and staff of Beaumont Hospital who are doing an excellent job against the odds.  They showed us their frontline services and the accident and emergency unit where people were on trolleys and chairs.  Not one of our two local Ministers bothered to attend that day, which was a total disgrace.<\/p>  <p>  Tonight, we need to do three practical things on the motion.  Patient safety must be put first and the Midland Regional Hospital must be properly resourced.  Further improvements must be made in the governance structure of the Midland Regional Hospital.

After tragic situations occurred due to a lack of resources or a failure to have adequate patient safety, it appears that staff, under pressure from management, tried to cover up matters and prevent people from expressing any complaint about what had happened to them.  It is horrendous.  It is particularly worrying that frontline staff in Portlaoise had been making complaints consistently about the lack of patient safety, lack of resources and so on, but these were ignored.  We then had tragedies occur followed by attempts to cover them up.  One must ask what the hell is going on in Portlaoise, because side by side with this situation we find the matter, about which I did not get to ask this morning, which is the discovery in the Tusla office in the town of hundreds of unidentified child protection files on neglected and abused children.  The figure has now risen to 1,200 and a report that was supposed to come back on what happened with these files has not come back so we do not know exactly what is going on.  It looks like an absolutely disastrous situation in Portlaoise and one wonders if this is being replicated elsewhere in the system.

I recognise the commitment of the families in seeking answers and justice on behalf of their children and other families.  They have fought tirelessly against a health system that would not listen and which would not act.  The treatment they received after their already traumatic experiences was abominable and it is only thanks to their perseverance that we may be on the road to a more accountable and safe health service.  I welcome that the motion is a call for action from the Government and a demand that it addresses the serious inadequacies in our health system once and for all and holds itself and its agencies directly accountable to the families who suffered gravely from this neglect.<\/p>  <p>  I also take the opportunity this evening to discuss the ongoing problem of access to antenatal health services in my own county, Donegal, particularly with the closure of the Dungloe antenatal clinic.  The clinic has been closed since November 2014 due to a consultant going on sick leave.  The post has not been filled since and access to antenatal services has been confined to Letterkenny Hospital.  The clinic's catchment stretches from Fintown to Dunfanaghy and the wider Rosses area and includes offshore islands such as Arranmore.  Patients have had to travel to Letterkenny to avail of antenatal services as a result of the closure.  This is taking place in a constituency in which public transport is poor to non-existent and the journey to Letterkenny can take three to four hours.  It is even more difficult for rural communities to adapt to sudden changes like this.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise the hard work of GAN, the campaign group on the issue, which has fought very hard to have the antenatal clinic reinstated in Dungloe.  The group feels there is a very real lack of urgency on the issue and a lack of understanding about the health needs of people in rural Donegal.  The usual picture is emerging for families attempting to face a large bureaucratic institution, the HSE, with long stretches of time spent waiting to hear back from it or to receive any correspondence.  Protest after protest has been organised to generate a response and, eventually, meetings have taken place with the HSE from which little action or positive news has resulted.  While there is a review pending to determine if services will be reinstated, families are still no closer to getting anywhere.<\/p><p>These families continue to seek a solution to this ongoing issue and feel not much has been done.

First of all, we offer our condolences to the parents who have lost their babies, be it in Portlaoise hospital or any other hospital around the country.  It is a harrowing time when something goes wrong for the parents.  Down my part of the country in Ballinasloe, this issue has come into the limelight as well.  When we do an inquiry into all of this and find out what is going wrong, we need to be upfront with parents, explain everything and be transparent and ensure that we rectify the issue and put in the resources.<\/p>  <p>  There is one other thing we need to do for expectant mothers in all of these different hospitals.  We need to ensure that we put out the word that a lot of children are born in this country and for many there are no problems.  People should not be frightened.

However, we need to make sure that whatever resources are required are put in to these hospitals for the children of the future that will be born in them.<\/p>  <p>  There is one other thing I wish to say about the general health services and I have a request for the Minister of State.  We have a major problem in Roscommon and east Galway in respect of mental health services.  Money is being sent back to the Minister of State's Department.  I am not laying the blame at her table.  However, I spent three hours one night trying to get a person who was going to commit suicide into a hospital.  That person had to be driven to Dublin.  Senior people in the west of Ireland, in the area of Roscommon and east Galway, are basically giving the two fingers to the ordinary people.  What is going on is intolerable.  There are parts of the country, not far from there, where there is a very good mental health service.  Will the Minister of State look into this issue as well?  What is going on in our area cannot go on any longer.  I was promised a meeting with those people and got an e-mail saying they could not meet us.  They never recognised us after that point.

Resources make a difference, but for years we have failed to take on board issues around governance, how we manage our health service and how we deliver our health services.  All too often, I have sat in this House for the past 12 years and watched as hundreds of millions were poured into our health services, but nothing was ever done to tackle the clear problems in terms of how we delivered health services and how they were managed.<\/p>  <p>  This applies not just to health staff such as doctors and nurses.  It applies, in particular, to management as well.  There are issues around how we are training young doctors.  We have loads of young doctors but we are missing out completely in how we manage our postgraduate training of doctors.  Therefore, many of them are leaving this country in their droves.  We have issues around how we manage risk in our health services.  All too often, when there is a crisis like this, and we are hearing it in the House again tonight, people look for a lynching rather than accept that these sort of things happen.  We need to have a proper culture in respect of how we manage these matters. <\/p>  <p>  In the airline industry, a person can make a mistake and no one looks to fire that person from the job.  The industry wants the person to come clean on it and to talk about it in order to ensure that the same mistakes are not repeated in some other airline and planes do not keep falling out of the sky until someone cops on to what is going on.  We do not have that culture in this country.  We have a culture of blaming people too quickly.  We need to change radically the way we approach these things.  <\/p>  <p>  There are big issues around the way teams work in our hospitals.  Sometimes they just do not function at all and there is little communication in what should be a streamlined service, but that is not happening.  One of the best results I have seen coming out of this report so far is the Minister saying he will link Portlaoise hospital with the Coombe hospital.  This is the first time someone is saying we need to streamline how we deliver services.  Deputy Kelleher is now in the Chamber, but when I was here first, the report published by Fianna F&aacute;il was the Hanly report.  The Hanly report was very much about closing down these types of services, taking out what they described as small hospitals and having super hospitals, possibly based in Dublin, Cork and Galway. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700068#QQQ00500","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1432754100,"counter":863,"content":"<p>That is not true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700068#QQQ00600","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1432754100,"counter":864,"content":"<p>Unfortunately that sort of thinking stayed in the HSE for more than a decade, but it was not an overt policy.  Therefore, hospitals such as Portlaoise hospital were being starved of funding but no one quite knew what was the management policy that was being implemented.  It was, therefore, only a matter of time before a crisis like this was going to happen.  This is a much more proper approach to health services.  We are linking hospitals such as Portlaoise hospital with tertiary teaching hospitals such as the Coombe hospital.  We are hoping the high standards of training and governance in a hospital such as the Coombe hospital will come back down to a hospital such as Portlaoise hospital and we can continue to provide the type of care that mothers need in Portlaoise, that is close to their doors and safe and dependable for expectant mothers.<\/p>  <p>  This needs to be done not just in maternity services.  This needs to be done in paediatric services and surgical services.  To some degree, it has happened over the past number of years in surgical services as a result of how we have managed the cancer treatment services.  The new cancer treatment programme rationalised where a person could have surgery for major cancers down to eight centres.  Some people feel this should still be reduced to five centres.  This means that a lot of major surgery was concentrated into large centres, where people were directly referred from their small hospital for major surgery but other minor procedures were safely and carefully done in the smaller hospitals.  This made the smaller hospitals viable.  <\/p>  <p>  I am sure Deputy Fitzmaurice realises that there has been a lot of aggravation about Roscommon hospital, but the first people who reported the safety issues at Roscommon hospital were the consultants there.  They stated clearly that it was unsafe to practise medicine at Roscommon General Hospital at the time.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700068#QQQ00700","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1432754100,"counter":865,"content":"<p>Because they were not given the resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700068#QQQ00800","speaker":"1198"},{"type":"speech","time":1432754100,"counter":866,"content":"<p>That is where Deputy Fitzmaurice is wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700068#QQQ00900","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1432754100,"counter":867,"content":"<p>Please allow Deputy Twomey to speak uninterrupted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700068#QQQ01000","speaker":"1099"},{"type":"speech","time":1432754100,"counter":868,"content":"<p>It is not always about resources.

Deputy Twomey is right.  It is not all about resources.  The Portlaoise case shows that human decency and compassion was lacking at one level and accountability was lacking at another level.  Tonight we stand here to remember the families and to pay tribute to them for their bravery and courage.  It is extraordinary that we are still here despite the fact that we are spending billions on our health service.  At that most difficult time of when a parent loses a child, they should be treated with compassion by the hospital, Health Service Executive and staff.  Thankfully, in the majority of cases, it happens, but on the occasion it does not happen, it is unacceptable and its legacy is to be found in the report by HIQA.<\/p>  <p>  This is a tome of a report and it is shameful.  It is regrettable that we speak about this tonight, because if one was to look at the report, and I challenge Deputy Fitzmaurice who preaches about good and new politics, to look at the report, on page 57, which states: \"A good safety culture is certainly an important foundation of a safe organisation and is founded on the individual attitudes and values of everyone in the organisation.\"<\/p><p>However, a strong safety culture did not exist in Portlaoise.  This is not necessarily about resources, it is about management, accountability and the delivery of a service by us, as people.  It is clear that at times this was not available or was not being operated by the persons involved.<\/p> <p> Equally, I am pleased that the Joint Committee on Health and Children met officials from HIQA and the HSE and, more important, provided an opportunity for the strong and courageous families to come in, speak and engage with the committee, of which I am privileged to be a member.  If we listen to what HIQA said to the committee and its independent view on what happened and if we explore the recommendations made by the authority, then we will see that what occurred should never be repeated.<\/p> <p> The independent report was commissioned in the interests of what our health system should be about: the patients and their families, past, present and future.  Their concerns and the concerns of the families as well as the safety of the patients must be paramount.  We must ensure that risks are minimised and compassion guaranteed when families are faced with the most difficult of circumstances.  If one were to listen to the account of HIQA one would suggest that patient safety was not treated as a priority.  That is a significant concern.  It must not simply be a concern, we must ensure it is a priority.<\/p> <p> The HIQA report raised number of fundamental issues around governance, accountability, hospital standards, resources and how we allocate money.  I am pleased that the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, have been unequivocal in saying that the recommendations must be implemented in full.  If we are to get anything out of this report, it should be to have the eight recommendations implemented to enable us to monitor our health system in a clear and cogent way.  Equally, we must put in place a mechanism to monitor the implementation of recommendations in the HIQA investigation reports.<\/p> <p> Prior to the investigation by HIQA and the publication of its report the previous Minister put in place a series of reforms, along with the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, to ensure that we would never be back here again.  These included putting new management in place.  As Deputy Twomey said, the hospital in Portlaoise is part of the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.  Clinical governance is to be addressed by a memorandum of understanding between the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital and the HSE to provide the first managed clinical maternity network within the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.  The Government is committed to securing and further developing the role of Midland Hospital, Portlaoise, something that was ignored in the past even though the constituency had a former Minister for Health, Taoiseach and Minister for Finance.<\/p> <p> This is about people.  It is about ensuring that we learn from the past and put in place a maternity service that is going to have women and the babies that are born at the centre of what we do.  If we do anything in terms of improving governance, integration and leadership, we will see reform and a standardisation of care across all maternity hospitals.  That is why we owe a debt of gratitude to the families, a debt that must be repaid by implementing in full the recommendations.  The focus must be about putting things right such that we can ensure patient safety will never be compromised and is a priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700068#QQQ03000","speaker":"989","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432754700,"counter":889,"content":"<p>Last Tuesday the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children heard the experiences of two families whose babies died in Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise.  I believe we owe them a great debt.  They described how they courageously fought against a system for many years which was supposed to support them and care about them and their experiences as well as learn by those experiences to ensure that no other family would go through what they went through.  The recent HIQA report into the investigation of the quality, safety and procedures in Midland Regional Hospital demonstrates what happens when the health service fails patients.  In this instance, not only are we seeing the evidence of a failure in terms of clinical services provided but also a deep failure in the lack of support and answers provided to patients, a lack of clear and consistent policies in respect of how patients can make a complaint and ensure that they will be heard, and that actions will arise from their complaints.<\/p><p>This morning an investigation by the Ombudsman, Peter Tyndall, found that people are afraid to complain about the care and treatment they receive in hospitals because they are concerned about the repercussions for themselves and their loved ones.  The investigation also found that people do not complain because they do not believe it will make any difference.  The Ombudsman's report, Learning to Get Better, was published today.  He carried out the investigation because he was concerned that his office was not receiving the amount of complaints that the health care system should be generating.  The recommendations he made this morning are similar to the recommendations made by HIQA some weeks ago arising from its investigation into Portlaoise.<\/p><p>I believe this moment holds the possibility of real change in our health service and with it the safety and quality that will restore the trust of the people.  The recommendation by HIQA to establish an independent safety advocacy service is a starting point.  This agency must above all be truly independent of the HSE and must have a direct reporting relationship to the Minister for Health.  It is essential that this agency is set up in an honest, inclusive and transparent way to enable trust to be restored for patients and the public.  Failure to do so will cause irreparable damage.  Currently, Ireland has a fragmented poorly co-ordinated <i>ad hoc<\/i>public health care advocacy service, one that often sees those advocating for change being funded by the HSE and, therefore, controlled by them.  This practice cannot continue.  Advocacy must be funded differently if we are to ensure that patients have an accessible and equitable advocacy service.<\/p><p>The people need the integrated agencies currently representing patients and the public to leverage a stronger organised voice and streamline their work with the Government's plans.  We need an agency that will provide a unified voice for patients, carers, family members and the public and to engage in dialogue with our health services.  We need an agency that provides a single easy-access point for public concerns and complaints about the public health service, one that will ensure transparency, restore public trust and educate our stakeholders to achieve safe, high-quality health care for everyone in Ireland.<\/p><p>Feedback is the best way to learn if we are doing things well.  However, in Ireland we see feedback, specifically, complaints, as a negative for some reason.  We do not see the value of learning from it or the value in learning from an adverse event because it can prevent another tragedy occurring.  The last independent patient survey of experiences in the Irish health services highlighted that almost four in ten patients did not feel encouraged to voice their opinion about the services they received.  Over six in ten were unaware of how to complain.  Many who wanted to make a complaint failed to do so because the system is not set up in a way that makes it easy to provide feedback.  The Ombudsman report from today bears that out.<\/p><p>Litigation is often the route forced on patients and family members.  Often they simply want answers, assurances that it will not happen again, someone to take responsibility or, sometimes, simply for those responsible in the service to say sorry.  Patients should not have to go to court or to the media to get these answers.  There are other ways that we can promote trust, including by ensuring that patients have clearly-defined rights to services, the right to choose the hospital they attend, the right to seek a second opinion and the right to access their own records.  We say that patients have these entitlements in Ireland but often the choice of hospital attended is decided by someone other than the patient.  If a patient seeks a second opinion in this country she is often made to feel intimidated or viewed as an awkward patient.  Despite evidence showing that working collaboratively with patients at the point of writing patient records has so many benefits, patients generally only have access to their records if they make a formal request.  We have a habit of talking the talk in Ireland, but open disclosure is an example of where we do not walk the walk.<\/p><p>The many HIQA reports to date are a clear indication that the HSE is not functioning for the benefit of patients or the organisation's staff.  It is time for the silos to come down, for egos to be left at home and to put the patients truly at the centre of care rather than simply pay them lip service.  I believe it is the very least we owe the parents whose babies died on our watch and who explained their stories and experiences so eloquently last Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700069#RRR00200","speaker":"1075"},{"type":"speech","time":1432754700,"counter":890,"content":"<p>Last week, I had the privilege of hearing in the Joint Committee on Health and Children from the families who lost their precious innocent babies at the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise.  We have had many different groups present at the health committee but last Tuesday was probably the most harrowing day we ever had.  As a mother, my heart went out to them.  I can only imagine the trauma and pain that they went through and continue to go through.<\/p><p>At the same time, I understand there can be human error and that things happen that should not.  However, I got the feeling last Thursday that nobody wanted to blame anyone in particular.  One parent, Mr. Mark Molloy, said to us that when he was asked to present to the committee, the first question he asked was what would happen next.  That is my question to the Minister of State tonight.  What will be done to ensure such tragedies never happen again so parents such as Amy Delahunt, the Delahunt family and the Molloys will not have to sit before our health committee and plead with us to do something to fix our maternity units.<\/p> <p> I fully understand that, as with any job, things happen and go wrong, but staff and management should be able to put up their hands and acknowledge the mistakes that have been made.  We need an open disclosure policy.  We should not drag parents and patients through the courts.  Parents told us last week that they have to use the freedom of information regime to get answers.  These families have been treated appallingly.  What is really sad is that there are many other families who have been treated just as badly.<\/p> <p> What were the people on the management committees in the hospital in Portlaoise doing?  Blame can be attributed but change must be implemented.  We cannot stand here and lament the awful tragedies without making real change to ensure they never happen again.  When a woman goes into hospital to have a baby, she is so vulnerable and expects the best service.  She needs that service.  Many of the staff serving or working in the hospital are all well paid; this is not voluntary work.  We really need to do something, not state platitudes.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700069#RRR00300","speaker":"1004","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432755300,"counter":892,"content":"<p>What has happened in Portlaoise hospital is unacceptable and beyond belief.  I read the HIQA report in full with a heavy heart.  It shocked and upset me and even made me really angry.  How on earth was this allowed to happen?  The HSE not only failed parents who lost their new babies due to negligence and mismanagement but caused great trauma and sadness for families, which they will bear for the rest of their lives.  Their strength and courage during this whole process is to be applauded.  Speaking out to highlight what happened to them has resulted in the publication of the report and the putting in place of proper procedures.  However, it will still be very difficult for parents to have faith in the maternity hospital in Portlaoise, but faith we must give them.<\/p>  <p>  This damning HIQA report pulls no punches.  It shows that some staff at the hospital dealt with parents immediately after the death of their babies without a shred of humanity or dignity, or even respect.  Parents received no explanations; they were denied the truth of what actually happened to them and their babies.  What should have been a very happy time turned into a nightmare.  Those people who were supposedly working in the care profession at the hospital did very little at times to help.<\/p>  <p>  The most shocking point of all is this did not happen just once but time and again, yet nobody did anything.  There was a complete failure to act on the part of staff.  It is difficult to comprehend that this could happen in any hospital.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has stated parents were treated in an appalling manner after the death of their babies.  He also said he is ashamed of how patients were treated in Portlaoise hospital.  I share his sentiments but I know he is committed to improving standards and developing better maternity services.  He has made it his priority to have the planned national maternity strategy published by the end of this year.  A proposed patient advocacy service, independent from the HSE, is also a priority for him.<\/p>  <p>  A steering group is to be established to oversee the implementation of eight recommendations set out by HIQA its report.  Changes have begun to be made at the hospital.  For some, this is happening too late, but change is needed and must result in better, safer, more reliable maternity services in Portlaoise and throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  Sometimes in life we are faced with many different crosses, not always of our making.  At times, it can be hard to make sense of them.  Our hearts go out to all those parents who lost babies in Portlaoise hospital.  The courage they have shown by opening the door on their tragic loss has made it possible for the parents of the future not to suffer the same sadness.  They are the heroes of this report.  They have had to fight long and hard over many years to get answers, not only for themselves but especially for others.<\/p>  <p>  I have read many reports as a Member of this House, one more tragic than the next.  As a member of the health committee, I have listened to people's stories about the health services that have failed them.  I have been moved by the raw emotion of the young and old telling their stories.  On reading the HIQA report, I ask myself how one human being could treat another as described.  It is imperative that all of us in this House treat one another with dignity, respect and compassion.  It should be the same outside.<\/p>  <p>  Tonight across the country, doctors, nurses, health care workers and staff in hospitals are saving lives, healing people and caring for the dying, often under tremendous pressure.  Most of them treat their patients with humanity.  It is said that where there is a loss there is a new beginning.  The parents in question deserve a new beginning.  The hospital in Portlaoise deserves a new beginning also.  The Government must support the parents and the staff of the health service.  Most of all, we must support one another in making sure we have a health service that is the envy not only of our little country but also of the rest of Europe and the rest of the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700070#SSS00200","speaker":"1029"},{"type":"speech","time":1432755300,"counter":893,"content":"<p>I commend Deputy Billy Kelleher on tabling this motion.  It is important and gives us an opportunity to discuss a very serious matter.  I extend sympathy to the families who lost babies at Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise.  I deplore the manner in which the families were treated by the HSE in the aftermath of their loss.  There was certainly a lack of decency and compassion for the families.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE must act swiftly to implement the recommendations of the HIQA investigation into services at Portlaoise hospital.  I am not one to expect a Minister to micro-manage every hospital but I believe the current Minister should outline practical policies and fight for a good budget.  I was heartened to hear that Mr. Tony O'Brien, the director general of the HSE, commented that he would be negotiating a good budget.  He talked about conducting business in a different way and about taking a much more robust approach.  That is important because we are talking about a level 3 hospital for which sufficient resources are not available.<\/p>  <p>  If we really believe in the importance of the patient and patient safety, we should have a patient safety authority established.  This has been long promised.  It is important to have HIQA incorporated into any new structure.  There has been talk of a patient safety agency or patient advocacy agency.  Irrespective of which, we are told it will not be in the service plan.  If, as we all agree, patient safety is important, we must reflect on the fact that it will be another year before we have a body that will deal with it.<\/p>  <p>  We have an opportunity for public consultation.  I would like to see public consultation on the provision of maternity services right across the country.  The west-north hospital group has ongoing reviews.  These are important because they afford an opportunity to determine the conditions in the maternity units.<\/p><p>We are waiting for the review of maternity units at Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe which is an excellent hospital and one I know well, Castlebar, Sligo Letterkenny and Galway.  University College Hospital, Galway is a level 4 hospital and a centre of excellence.  However, many members of staff talk about the workload, while constituents talk about the extent of the inadequacies in the public health care system because of the shortage of staff.  I refer, in particular, to the stroke unit at University College Hospital, Galway where there is difficulty with the level of nursing care because of the shortage of staff.  The Minister of State knows that nursing staff in the psychiatric unit in the hospital have threatened industrial action.  This is a level 4 hospital and it is certainly time resources were also made available there.  <\/p> <p> Both the Midland Regional Hospital and Portiuncula Hospital serve the midlands.  Portiuncula Hospital also serves the west and the mid-west.  Some of the challenges in it are similar to those faced by the Midland Regional Hospital, particularly the issue of resources, replacing staff, the need for extra staff and buildings.   I can tell the Minister of State that the last official opening of a building I attended in Portiuncula Hospital was when Mary Harney as Minister for Health opened a special baby care unit.  The hospital has made submissions for buildings and I hope they will be looked on favourably by the HSE and the Department.  I know that there are other concerns about the recommendations in respect of maternity services in other locations such as Tralee, Cavan, Clonmel, Kilkenny, Monaghan, Wexford, Portlaoise and Drogheda.  That is why public consultation is important.  We need to have that process completed before any action is taken.  The HSE should outline the real agenda in the health service.  I have seen reports that reviews are being carried out at 19 maternity units across the country in order to provide assurance that the recommendations made in a number of recent high profile reports are being fully implemented.  This is the important point.  We know that corrective measures to address quality of care issues should be implemented, but it is important that implementation is ongoing.  Similarly, I have also seen reports that additional training has been provided for all maternity staff and additional senior supervision has been provided for for both medical and midwifery staff.  However, I have not seen any reports stating extra staff will be provided, particularly in areas in which there are significant pressures.  <\/p> <p> I would like to have a full debate on the infrastructure of maternity services, particularly the infrastructure we need to meet the needs of the country in the coming years.  In particular, I would like to have a discussion about the greater role community midwifery services could play and the urgent need for greater numbers of consultant obstetricians.  If we had obstetricians who led services as a priority in maternity hospitals, we would be doing a very good day's work.  We know that there are proposals in Dublin to relocate maternity hospitals to more suitable locations, but let us also look at the people who live outside Dublin because we must provide high quality health and maternity services for them.  If we ensure current maternity services are protected, we will be doing a good job, but we should enhance rather than downgrade them.  It is a very important issue around the country, as the Minister knows.  I hope we can investigate those areas that are doing well and provide the investment needed to support them.  It is true to say we have very good staff in hospitals who work very hard, but there are huge pressures, as the Minister knows.  This is the area in which I would like to see him lay down his overall policy and, in conjunction with the HSE, fight for a good budget in order that the resources required can be made available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700070#SSS00400","speaker":"1040","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432755900,"counter":895,"content":"<p>I join my colleagues in supporting the motion brought forward by Deputy Billy Kelleher.  We have heard the testimony of the parents who, unfortunately, suffered one of the most difficult things any family or person has to suffer, namely, the loss of a young child.  We must sympathise with them and also pay credit to the families concerned for continuing to push to get answers.  That is what has led us here and to HIQA's investigation which finally delivered some of the answers.  I hope we can see the lessons learned and ensure other families will not have to experience similar things in the future.  It is important that we recognise the work of &quot;Prime Time&quot; in working with the families through its investigation unit and bringing this issue to public attention.<\/p><p>The families who lost children and their testimony and bravery are at the centre of this debate.  That bravery was displayed at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  It is important that we keep this at the centre of the debate and use it as our inspiration to ensure the very clear mistakes made in the handling of this issue and how it was allowed to develop will be addressed and that the Midland Regional Hospital will be properly resourced in order that it can have a safe maternity unit.  It is also important that lessons are learned about how we provide health services, particularly maternity services, throughout the rest of the country.  <\/p><p>Last week Mark and R&oacute;is&iacute;n Molloy, the parents of Mark who died on 24 January 2012, moments after delivery at the Midland Regional Hospital in Portlaoise, spoke to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  The Minister knows that they recounted how in the past three and a half years they had fought very hard against continuous opposition to get the answer to a very simple question: how did it happen and how did their young boy die?  They had to use the Freedom of Information Act to receive additional information to get answers.  Despite being informed by the hospital obstetric and midwifery management team that the death of a healthy baby during childbirth was extremely rare, it became apparent to them very early on that they were not the only family whose healthy child had died in these circumstances at the hands of the maternity unit at the Midland Regional Hospital and nationally.  Mark and R&oacute;is&iacute;n detailed a litany of correspondence and meetings during which they had worked to get the full story about the death of their baby.  It is important to read some of their testimony here to reflect this.  Mark told the committee: <blockquote>The HSE was aware at local, regional and national level that this was an unsafe unit.  Members saw from the schedule that I went through that we had been screaming about this for 18 months through meetings and so on but the HSE did nothing about it.  The HIQA report reflected a dysfunctionality in various management levels, particularly regionally.  We met various people who seemed almost unaware of the HSE's policies and procedures in the investigation of an adverse event such as our baby's death.  They genuinely seemed not to know how to handle this investigation in accordance with their procedures.<\/blockquote>R&oacute;is&iacute;n Molloy told the committee:<blockquote>It is important to note that we met officials at every level, to whom we believed we were bringing new information in regard to what was happening at each level below.  We met management, who told us there were no policies or procedures in place which allowed for an investigation into Mark's death.  Our response to that was, &quot;Oh my God&quot; because we knew that was not true.  We then raised at regional level local management's opinion in regard to its carrying out an investigation into Mark's death.  We knew fairly soon into the process that people were only paying lip-service to us.<\/blockquote><\/p><p>That was the experience of Mark and R&oacute;is&iacute;n Molloy and unfortunately that was not an isolated experience.  Indeed, Mark informed the committee that at a meeting with the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar in Portlaoise \"there were 120 people in the room.  Person after person told stories of their baby's death or cerebral palsy injury or horrific injuries that mothers were left with. This is not a figures game but the figure is far in excess of five baby deaths\".  People spoke of incidents as far back as 1986.  <\/p> <p> Our heart goes out to them tonight but we must look at how this situation came about.  The Government cannot ignore the fact that the designation of Portlaoise as a level three unit without ensuring that the resources were in place so that it could operate to that standard was important in the context of the service at Portlaoise being unsafe.  There is a lesson here in terms of how the Government has been dealing with our health service in general.  The Government has a key role to play because it provides the resources to the HSE to enable it to carry out its functions.  However, it cannot force the HSE to implement a service plan which the executive regularly indicates it cannot provide without the necessary resources and then absolve itself, at a political level, of responsibility for services on the hospital floor being unsafe.  <\/p> <p> It is essential that the HIQA report recommendations are implemented.  It is also key that we do not see a media-management approach adopted with regard to our health service when horror stories are revealed or even in the face of the day-to-day stories of excessively long waiting lists for treatment which Deputies deal with every day.  We need to see real change and real investment in our health services because that is what is required.  I welcome the fact that the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar met the parents and heard their stories himself.  His approach, at a human level, is an improvement on that of his predecessor, Deputy Reilly.  That said, however, we are not seeing anything change within our health services or in what people are experiencing on the ground.  It is long past time for improvements in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700071#TTT00200","speaker":"999","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432756500,"counter":897,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate tonight and compliment my party colleague Deputy Kelleher on tabling the motion before us.  I wish to start by offering my deepest sympathies to the families who have suffered the loss of a loved one.  It is appalling that not only did they have to suffer that loss but they also had to deal with an unforgivable manner on the part of the HSE.  The loss of a child was bad enough but was exacerbated by the fact that they had to fight tooth and nail to get the truth from the HSE.  We have to remember that the HSE is an arm of the State.  Not only did it fail in the context of the delivery of these children but it added insult to injury by the manner in which it dealt with their parents.  There was a complete lack of compassion, respect or understanding.  Were it not for the determination and drive of these parents, assisted by RTE, we might not have been any wiser this evening.<\/p>  <p>  A report into a child's death in 2008 acknowledged that there was a failure to recognise that the baby was in distress during labour and that staff went on to administer the wrong drugs.  The recommendations made on foot of that report to improve safety were never implemented.  That lack of implementation had devastating consequences for families who came after, up to and including the loss of life.  Previous speakers have singled out Mark and R&oacute;is&iacute;n Molloy for the manner in which they pursued their baby's case vigorously over the last few years.  They shared their harrowing experiences with us in the D&aacute;il and with the wider public in the interest of ensuring that similar events never happen again.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government must acknowledge that wrong was done and must ensure that all maternity services are adequately resourced and fit for purpose.  It is simply not good enough to designate a maternity unit as a grade three service if adequate resources are not provided for that unit.  That is neither practicable nor safe.  I do not want to get political because this is not an issue for political point making but how could the Government stand over the scenario in Portlaoise hospital?  How could it say that it was a model three hospital when the resources were not in place to justify that status?  Why did that happen?  Was it for political reasons?  Was it done as a result of the fallout from events at Roscommon hospital?  <\/p>  <p>  A review of all of our maternity services must be carried out now to ensure that expectant mothers can have the confidence that when they present to a maternity hospital, wherever it is located, they will get a premium level of service.  Furthermore, as well as political accountability, we must also see accountability at a senior level within the HSE because senior staff of the executive were aware, every step of the way, of what was going on in the hospital at Portlaoise.  With that accountability should come responsibility and consequences for those who did not act in the interests of patient safety.  Unfortunately, the only people for whom there have been consequences to date are the families who lost their loved ones and that is simply not good enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700072#UUU00200","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1432756500,"counter":898,"content":"<p>I compliment Deputy Kelleher on tabling the motion and giving us an opportunity to debate the issues, particularly with regard to the maternity services in Portlaoise.  It is important at the outset to extend our sincerest sympathy to the families who lost children in such terrible circumstances.  When we all watched the \"Prime Time\" investigation into the deaths of four babies over a six year period at the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, we were horrified.  That programme highlighted, in no small way, the problems that beset the hospital in Portlaoise.  It highlighted the need for change, decisive action, extra staff and also the need to deal with the issues that had arisen over a number of years.  It pointed out very clearly that the hospital and the HSE had failed to implement recommendations arising from previous investigations which may have saved the babies' lives.<\/p><p>The programme also stated that neither the hospital nor the HSE informed the bereaved families that an investigation had taken place in their case or that a report had been produced until many years later.<\/p> <p> One mother only found out about the investigation and report five years after her baby had died.  In a statement, the HSE and the hospital have apologised and accept responsibility for what happened.  They have promised to act on certain recommendations, particularly the recommendations HIQA proposed to deal with the problems at the hospital at Portlaoise.<\/p> <p> Last week we heard a compelling account from Mark and R&oacute;is&iacute;n Molloy, parents of Mark, who died on 24 January 2012, of the problems they faced over a long period of time in trying to get answers or any type of information on what happened to their child.  They now know, at this very late stage, of the situation at the time.  However, they were put through the hoops at a very difficult time.  This is a family that was grieving and had to endure the sad loss of a child.  Every roadblock possible was put in their way preventing them from getting information on the reasons their child had died.  Mark and R&oacute;is&iacute;n Molloy had a litany of correspondence and meetings during which they tried to get the full story but always found it very difficult and did not find the answers they wanted.<\/p> <p> I compliment the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, on attending the meeting in Portlaoise.  He listened to the families in a room of 120 people.  He must have been very concerned over the stories of the difficulties the families had faced.  I am sure the Minister will act on what he has heard to ensure such a situation does not recur.  It is important that he would do that.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and he will ensure that the difficulties these families faced in the past will not be repeated.<\/p> <p> It is important to implement HIQA's recommendations as quickly as possible.  It produced a shocking report, which exposes the chronically weak levels of oversight and inaction by the HSE nationally, regionally and locally.  It failed to deliver safe clinical services and put patients' lives at risk.  What is worse is that management was well aware of the risks posed by these unsafe practices but failed to take any decisive action to rectify the situation.  HSE bosses allowed Portlaoise hospital to continue to operate on a 24\/7 basis despite a series of safety and quality of care issues which were never acted upon.  They also failed to resource the hospital sufficiently and to ensure that the governance arrangements in place could safely deliver services to patients.<\/p> <p> The Government and the HSE in many ways ignored alarm bells about the safety risks which were being highlighted at the hospital and patients suffered as a result.  It is disgraceful that the HSE failed in its duty to exercise any meaningful oversight of services despite repeated warnings.  Patients across the midlands have every right to feel angry and concerned at the findings in the HIQA report.  However, we are where we are and it is now important that the HIQA report be acted on as quickly as possible.  The Minister should work in conjunction with the hospital in Portlaoise to deal with the problems and risks in order to ensure that adequate staff are in place in future to deal with such issues.<\/p> <p> It is important to highlight that expectant women will not find this situation in every hospital.  We have some maternity hospitals that are providing an excellent service.  It is generally agreed that Wexford maternity hospital is the best and safest place for births in the country.  At one stage it was suggested that Wexford maternity hospital would close and that Waterford would become a centre of excellence for the south east.  Cross-party political pressure resisted this and we now have a state-of-the-art maternity hospital at Wexford General Hospital.  It is one of the safest places for births in the country.<\/p> <p> There is considerable talk about reviewing the maternity services and perhaps closing down some of the hospitals.  The people of Wexford, Wicklow and the south east region in general are very happy to have a maternity hospital based in Wexford.  We have a population of 140,000 with Wicklow not far behind.  That hospital is servicing the needs of expectant mothers and families in that area.<\/p> <p> It is increasingly clear that our national maternity infrastructure is under strain and needs serious review and investment.  We need a proper debate and Deputy Kelleher's motion tonight has started the debate.  It is important that this debate continues on whether the existing infrastructure is sufficient to meet the needs of the country over coming years.  This debate needs to include a discussion about what greater role community midwifery can play, the urgent need for greater numbers of consultant obstetricians and what level of investment in the physical infrastructure is actually needed.<\/p> <p> Ireland has one of the lowest ratios of obstetricians to patients in the OECD and there is a need for investment in maternity and neonatal services across the country as a matter of urgency.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, in October's budget will have money made available to ensure that the problems in Portlaoise and Galway are never repeated.  Adequate money needs to be made available to provide the services.<\/p> <p> The provision of accessible, safe and high-quality obstetrician-led maternity services to all mothers and babies, regardless of where they live must be a core objective of public health policy.  We need to bear that in mind with the budget in October.  Rather than downgrade services we should focus on attracting the necessary number of qualified consultant obstetricians to facilitate an accessible, safe, high-quality maternity service to all existing maternity centres nationally and to promote obstetrics as a career option among our medical professionals in order to achieve this and in order to overcome the challenges that our obligations under the working time directive present.<\/p> <p> This is the first of many debates on this issue in coming months.  It is important to make the funds and staff available to ensure we do not have a repeat of what happened in Portlaoise.  I accept we will always have human error and difficulties in that area.<\/p> <p> As the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is on duty, the Ceann Comhairle might allow me a minute to say that the Waterford child and adolescent mental health services have suspended taking new referrals for the foreseeable future.  This will seriously affect the services in the south east generally, including in my county.  The Minister of State might not be aware of this because there was only a news flash this evening about it.  It seems that the HSE has failed or refused to appoint a permanent psychiatric consultant to deal with such issues.  When the Minister of State arrives in her office tomorrow she might check out the situation and have the problem dealt with or otherwise the young people in the south east will suffer greatly because of a lack of service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700072#UUU00300","speaker":"1096","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432757100,"counter":900,"content":"<p>I reassure the Deputy that I was not waiting for a news flash; I have already started dealing with the issue.  It is not a failure; it is simply an inability to find a suitable person.  CAMHS consultants are quite rare, as Deputy Kelleher and I know from the Cork situation.  However, we have already started on that.  I always try to be ahead of the posse.<\/p><p>I am deeply saddened that our health service failed so many families in Portlaoise.  As Minister of State, I stand with the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, in insisting that our services be improved.  Along with many of the speakers yesterday evening and tonight, I recognise the courage and tenacity of the families who came forward to share their stories.  They must have been very difficult stories to tell.  I do not believe there is anybody here who is a parent who does not recognise the hurt of losing a long awaited and wanted baby.  <br\/><br\/>This time, the opportunity will not be missed.  Last night, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, outlined the measures we are taking on the HIQA Portlaoise report.  I do not propose to repeat all of those tonight.  However, I applaud the Minister for his swift action to ensure that the families get the services they need on the ground.  We need to minimise, in so far as we can, the difficulties that some of the families continue to endure.<br\/><br\/>At a national level, our priority must be excellent, safe care with a view to achieving the best possible outcomes.  Patient safety must be at the core of everything we do and we must work tirelessly to embed a patient safety culture throughout our health service.  The lack of compassion in care in the hospital was a clear and disturbing feature of the report.  This must, and will be, addressed without delay.  Just as patients need medical and nursing staff for their clinical abilities they need them to show that they care and support them.  I find it difficult to understand how we got to where we are.  How did the health service lose its capacity to care?  I do not subscribe to the view that a lack of resources was the issue.  <br\/><br\/>Last night, it was claimed that alarm bells sounded about Portlaoise in 2006 and 2011.  I am not in a position to comment on the action or inaction of the previous Government but I can contextualise funding requests in 2011. At that time the country was in the middle of a financial crisis and funding shortfalls were identified across the board.  Many clinicians came looking to the Minister and the Department for funding, claiming their specialty had the greatest need.  The reality is that real clinical leadership is demonstrated by working to mitigate any risk within available resources and using the mechanisms within the HSE to seek the additional funding required.  The HSE then has the responsibility to consider competing demands and to prioritise funding requests accordingly.<br\/><br\/>Whether Portlaoise hospital was a model 2 or 3 hospital is a smokescreen.  The categorisation of hospitals was, if anything, a bit simplistic.  In any event, with the move to hospital groups, hospital models are now obsolete.  Within the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group, there is a very bright future for Portlaoise hospital.  There are bound to be service changes as we move to provide services across the Dublin midlands group.  What people need are safe services, and thus they will travel to the hospital where that service is best provided.  It is clear that we need to ensure that services in Portlaoise that are not viable are discontinued, and that viable and safe services are resourced, but we must do this in a planned and ordered way.  We must also listen better to the voice of the patient.  <br\/><br\/>The Ombudsman today published, Learning to Get Better,<i><\/i>which investigated how public hospitals handle patient complaints.  This report and the HIQA Portlaoise report show that the health service has not been responsive enough to patients who have had bad experiences.  The HSE's complaints management and resolution processes need improvement, in particular about learning from complaints.<br\/><br\/>I wish to reassure the House that we will do everything in our power to ensure that the recommendations of the HIQA report are implemented without delay.  We owe that to all the families who bravely came forward in an effort to ensure that no more families would endure the pain that they experienced.  Several speakers tonight asked what has been done in the interim.  While I do not propose to list all that has been done it is important to mention that 16 additional midwives have been recruited, including shift leaders in delivery.  A director of midwifery, which I believe is essential in any maternity service, has been seconded to Portlaoise from the Coombe.  A training needs analysis was also undertaken and a training plan has been developed with Athlone Institute of Technology.  Some 100% of midwifery staff have attended CGT training.  Guidelines are in place and the type of governance that is necessary to ensure a safe delivery of care is also being put in place.<br\/><br\/>Having just read again Deputy Kelleher's motion and the Government's counter-motion, I see very little between us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700073#VVV00200","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432757700,"counter":902,"content":"<p>I welcome the contributions from all sides of the House.  I read the Minister's speech again this morning, in which he mentioned that we should not play politics with this issue.  I certainly was very reluctant to go down the political route without first having listened to the testimonies of the families and read the indepth reports of the CMO and HIQA but I would be failing in my duties if I did not bring this matter to the floor of the D&aacute;il to ensure we had a proper discourse and debate on the issue of our maternity services in Portlaoise and, to say the very least, the appalling failure of systems and, perhaps, of individuals as well.<\/p><p>Many of the families, including Amy Delahunt, Ollie Kelly and Mark and R&oacute;is&iacute;n Molloy, told us of their experiences.  Last week, I asked R&oacute;is&iacute;n Molloy at the health committee about treatment by the HSE and if it had changed.  Her response was: &quot;We were treated with complete disdain.  They hated us.&quot;  I wrote down those words as she expressed them, which were a damning indictment of individuals within the system.  I am always reluctant to point the finger at individuals but we cannot always hide behind systems failures.  Staff, particularly those in senior management posts, must share in responsibility.  This is not about witch-hunting or scapegoating.  That is certainly not the motivation of the families.  I have met with the Molloys, Ollie Kelly and Amy Delahunt and I have spoken to others as well.  They are not interested in witch-hunting.  What they want is an element of accountability for the purpose of ensuring that this does not happen again.  Unfortunately, it has happened again in the context of HSE local management and administrators and regional management and administrators and so on informing families that this was a once-off and that it had not happened before and would not happen again.  The unfortunate reality is that it was happening all too often in the context of Portlaoise hospital.  <\/p><p>If we are to learn anything from this very tragic saga it is that we need to have a system in place that can access information, collate it and ensure that people who failed in their duties or ability to manage are identified early.  Within any system, a weak individual will weaken the entire system.  This, unfortunately, in my view, is the case in the context of the HIQA report, throughout which is highlighted the failure in governance across Portlaoise hospital, including at regional and national management level.  The HIQA report states on page 135:<blockquote>During this investigation, the Authority found that Portlaoise Hospital and the Health Service Executive (HSE) at local, regional and national level were aware for many years of numerous patient safety risks in the hospital but failed to act decisively to reduce these risks. <\/blockquote>It continues to elaborate on that failure.  Without sanction and the ability of individuals to hide behind systems failure we will consistently have systems failure.  I am not interested in any junior clerical officer being identified as at fault.  What we need is some degree of accountability at all levels.  When people are remunerated in management positions with that responsibility comes an onus to carry out that responsibility and if it is not carried out sanction must follow.  This must be done, and not only in the context of the health services but the higher echelons of our public service and, in particular, our Civil Service.  Where people are remunerated according to their responsibilities and they shirk or fail in their duties sanction must be brought to bear.<\/p><p>Until such time as we see that change in attitude, with people at senior level being held accountable, we will not change the system because, regardless of what we think, the motivation to change will not be present and the herd mentality will prevail.  We talk about groupthink, but we know where it got us.  We had groupthink in this Chamber, the Central Bank and many other places and know where we ended up.  Groupthink or group protection in these areas could cause huge difficulties.<\/p> <p> When we read the report on Portlaoise hospital and listen to the contributions from some sides of the House, it is clear that those contributing have not read the full report if they say this is not about resources.  It is about resources.  On page 135 of the report a failure to act decisively to reduce risks in the context of management is reported.  On page 138 it speaks about general hospital services and states diagnostic imaging services were significantly underresourced and that the hospital did not have a strong clinical governance structure.  Another point made is that the intensive care unit infrastructure was unfit for purpose.  This, again, is a resource issue.  Also, the report states general medical services in the hospital were not resourced or structured to effectively implement the recommendations of the HSE's acute medicine programme.  Many pages of the document refer to the fact that the hospital was under-resourced.<\/p> <p> At the heart of this issue also is the fact that the small hospitals framework, on foot of the Mallow and Ennis hospital reports, made recommendations that were applied in Portlaoise hospital.  We cannot pretend or deny that inside this House, or somewhere else, a decision was made to exempt or remove Portlaoise hospital from the small hospitals framework, which effectively pointed out that there were deficiencies in these hospitals and that they would not have the capacity or the clinical governance structures in place or the throughput of patients to ensure safe practice in all areas.  Clearly, there were difficulties.  The report states the hospital was not structured to provide safe surgery, \"as there are insufficient, acute and elective surgical presentations to ensure surgeons maintain the necessary competence and expertise\".  This is the reason Portlaoise hospital was mentioned in the original small hospitals framework because it did not have the required throughput of patients, yet a decision was made somewhere-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700074#WWW00200","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1432758300,"counter":904,"content":"<p>The framework is based on resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700075#XXX00200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1432758300,"counter":905,"content":"<p>Yes, but somewhere along the line the decision was made to take Portlaoise hospital out of the small hospital framework, even though it had been included for that specific reason.  Four year later we find that HIQA's report makes the very same recommendation made previously in the context of the Mallow and Ennis hospitals reports which fed into the small hospitals framework.  The Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, said last night that the concept of level 2 and level 3 hospitals was an outdated assessment of what a hospital was.  That may well be the case now, but at the time that concept was the benchmark in terms of the number of clinical presentations, the number of procedures carried out and the competence and expertise that could be maintained within a hospital facility because of the numbers of patients presenting.  All of this was known when the issue of moving Portlaoise hospital out of the small hospitals framework and exempting it arose.  Let us be clear that it was exempted from the framework with political fanfare and that there was significant backslapping at committees and in this Chamber.  However, when we read the report, we see that the difficulty was that the hospital was not being resourced as a level 3 hospital.  That is stated clearly in the report.  In the context of resourcing alone, the hospital should not have been maintained at level 3 because of the difficulties in it.  The HSE lacked a clear strategy or vision for the hospital.  It was regarded by the HSE as a model 3 hospital, one that could provide acute services for patients presenting with all manner of injuries and illnesses, including life support.  However, HIQA's investigation found that it was not being funded, equipped or resourced to provide this range of services.  The authority's investigation found a number of examples of how the hospital was not being resourced to safely provide services at the level that would be expected of a model 3 hospital.  This led to unacceptable ongoing risks for patients attending the hospital, on which I elaborated previously.  These reasons, the backslapping and the accolades attributed to some people for maintaining Portlaoise hospital as a level 3 hospital make it clear that it was all a pretence from start to finish.  There was no maintenance of level 3 hospital services.  There was this pretence by senior hospital management and the HSE and at political level, but we find there were unsafe practices on a continual basis which knowingly happened in Portlaoise, in the general hospital as well as maternity services, and that nothing was done about it.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State made reference to this issue in her contribution and I raised it last night.   Dr. Chris Fitzpatrick, a former master of maternity services in the Coombe hospital, went to the Minister for Health in December 2011 and highlighted the problems in Portlaoise and Mullingar hospitals and begged for assistance and support.  I have not seen the report on that matter, but I know that it is available.  I know that every effort was made by the then master of the Coombe hospital to ensure something was done.  He pointed out that we needed to do something in both hospitals.  That happened in December 2011 and the following week Dr. Fitzpatrick went to the CEO of the HSE and repeated the same message but nothing happened.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to find out and intend to find out by way of an FOI request what effort was made to relay this information to the front line and promise to do something at that level.  People have referred to red flags, but as he families, many others and I have said in the context of the health committee's investigations into this issue and HIQA's report, it was no longer a matter of red flags.  Alarm bells had been ringing everywhere for a number of years, but there was a complete failure to react at every level.  Mr. O'Brien almost tried to absolve the HSE by virtue of the fact that Portlaoise hospital had been exempted from the small hospitals framework.  He mentioned this quite intentionally.  I asked him on a number of occasions when the HSE could respond to the policy direction of the Government and state it could not implement the policy because it would lead to unsafe practices.  He said he could not do this, that the HSE was obliged to implement the stated policy.  However, it was obliged to pretend that it was a policy that could deliver a safe service.  Every one of us here who has read the report, every one who has gathered information or who has been in contact with the Department of Health, the previous and current Ministers for Health, the previous CEO of the HSE and the current director general of the HSE knows that they were all informed that there was a chronic problem with basic patient safety in Portlaoise, in the general hospital and maternity services.  <\/p>  <p>  We owe a lot to the families who have suffered so much.  The least we should do is be honest about the fact that we did know about what was hapening but did nothing about it.  We must implement the recommendations made in HIQA's report.  They must be implemented expeditiously to ensure there is safe practice.  We owe it to all expectant women, now and in the future, to ensure maternity services are put on guard in terms of patient safety and to ensure that the maternity review that has been announced will be fully supported.  We must ensure the recommendations it will bring forward will be executed.  We cannot allow a situation where there is even the slightest doubt that maternity services are not up to the highest international standards possible.<\/p>  <p>  We have a continual debate in the Chamber about the pretence that there are realistic budgets.  The Minister told us last December that he had achieved a realistic budget, but that budget is already a busted flush.  We may as well accept now at the end of May that it is completely off target and out of kilter with what is happening in the health service.<\/p><p>The pretence that we will not have a huge budget deficit at the end of the year may as well be stopped tonight.  We should accept that we have to reprioritise and refocus investment in health because the Minister has other problems besides patient safety.  There are patients lying on trolleys, and more than 11,000 people in Waterford have been waiting to see a consultant on an outpatient basis for over a year.  There are huge problems in the system, and at the same time we have to reprioritise patient safety.  I ask the Minister of State to go back to the Minister for Health and the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and tell them that it cannot be done with what she has been given because it is not a realistic budget.  I commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700075#XXX00300","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"vote","time":1432758900,"counter":907,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 73; N\u00edl, 40.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Emmet Stagg and Paul Kehoe; N\u00edl, Deputies Billy Kelleher and Sean Fleming.<\/p><p>Amendment declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700076#YYY00200","aye":["1062","974","1079","989","1029","1030","975","1092","1031","1041","1087","1099","1006","991","986","1091","1046","968","1075","1011","1103","957","1078","1085","1068","951","1051","1076","995","1106","1089","1097","1033","1012","1098","1021","1110","990","982","1023","996","1180","1194","1000","997","1082","977","1038","1004","1070","985","1034","1067","1056","1045","1060","1058","1069","971","1081","964","966","947","1074","1013","1048","961","978","1095","948","950","1185","1024"],"nay":["1066","1199","1003","1096","1071","1193","1057","1083","1101","1037","959","1047","1198","1100","1050","1108","1094","960","1049","1188","983","1040","998","999","1008","993","981","992","1183","987","1052","969","1044","1054","1028","1001","953","970","1102","1065"]},{"type":"vote","time":1432758900,"counter":908,"content":"<p>Question put: \"That the motion, as amended, be agreed to.\"<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 73; N\u00edl, 40.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Emmet Stagg and Paul Kehoe; N\u00edl, Deputies Billy Kelleher and Sean Fleming.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015052700076#YYY00400","aye":["1062","974","1079","989","1029","1030","975","1092","1031","1041","1087","1099","1006","991","986","1091","1046","968","1075","1011","1103","957","1078","1085","1068","951","1051","1076","995","1106","1089","1097","1033","1012","1098","1021","1110","990","982","1023","996","1180","1194","1000","997","1082","977","1038","1004","1070","985","1034","1067","1056","1045","1060","1058","1069","971","1081","964","966","947","1074","1013","1048","961","978","1095","948","950","1185","1024"],"nay":["1066","1199","1003","1096","1071","1193","1057","1083","1101","1037","959","1047","1198","1100","1050","1108","1094","960","1049","1188","983","1040","998","999","1008","993","981","992","1183","987","1052","969","1044","1054","1028","1001","953","970","1102","1065"]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1432758900,"counter":909,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 10.55 p.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Thursday, 28 May 2015.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
