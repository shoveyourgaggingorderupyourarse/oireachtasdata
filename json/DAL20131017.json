However, reality is dawning more quickly than could have been foreseen.  For example, people are reading today about the nefarious consequences of the cap on tax relief for those with private health insurance.  Premiums will increase immediately.  This is happening at a time when thousands of people are leaving the system every month and will be at the expense of the already overburdened public health system.  The decision to snatch back 135,000 medical cards from people who need them is also getting attention.<\/p><p>  In his programme for Government the T&aacute;naiste stated he would maintain social welfare rates.  However, in the past three budgets substantial cuts have taken place, including to child benefit, maternity benefit, the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance and the respite care grant.  The redundancy rebate has been abolished; the household benefits package has been slashed, while the supplementary welfare budget has been reduced substantially.  In this budget a measure has been introduced to pauperise the young unemployed.  Is this not a cut to the core social welfare rate?  One of the T&aacute;naiste's colleagues stated the object of this change was to stop the young from watching flat screen television seven days a week.  However, just before its website crashed, Labour Youth described this decision as &quot;regressive, counter productive and fundamentally unjust&quot;.  With whom does the T&aacute;naiste agree?  Does he agree with his colleague who says it is to stop people watching flat screen television seven days a week or with the youth wing of his party which describes this change as regressive, counter productive and fundamentally unjust?  It is not a cut to the core rate of jobseeker's allowance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700003#A00200","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1382002200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>This budget takes us out of the bailout programme.  When we think back to where we started from and the worries people had about whether the State would be able to continue making social welfare payments and the extent to which it would continue to be able to make old age payments, pay secondary benefits and so on, being able to get out of the bailout programme without cutting basic social welfare rates or the old age pension and while maintaining most of the benefits available to pensioners and people on social welfare is quite an achievement.  When people look at the budget, the question that must be asked is not whether this cut or change should have been made.  The choice is between what we have done and what Fianna F&aacute;il would have done.  The four year plan published by Fianna F&aacute;il prior to the last general election included a figure of &euro;17.9 billion for social spending in 2014.  The Government will spend &euro;19.6 billion on social protection measures next year.  In other words, if Fianna F&aacute;il was still in power, some &euro;1.7 billion extra would be removed from the social protection budget.  I have a question for Deputy Willie O'Dea who is his party's spokesperson on social protection.  What measures would he take and what additional cuts would he make in the Social Welfare Bill to get the extra &euro;1.7 billion?  If we look, for example, at what we have done in the budget, &euro;1.7 billion would represent approximately eight times the total of the various changes made in this year's budget.  Therefore, it is not for Fianna F&aacute;il to get up and raise this or that issue, but to tell the people what additional measures it would take.  What additional cuts would it make to pension, social welfare protection and various secondary benefits to reach the figure of &euro;1.7 billion extra in cuts that it stated it would implement in 2014?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700003#A00300","speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1382002200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1382002200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The Labour Party is getting excited.

The Labour Party claims protecting social welfare is one of its main achievements and is one of its main reasons for being in government.  This week this promise has been broken again.  Hiding behind the deplorable record of Fianna F&aacute;il really is no defence.  The jobseeker's allowance payment for young people has been cut, as has invalidity pension.  These are core social welfare payments and they have been cut so the Government has broken its promise.  When Fianna F&aacute;il first cut jobseekers for those under 25 in 2009 the response of the Labour Party was to state the cut was offensive and intended to promote emigration, and the party, justifiably at the time, accused Fianna F&aacute;il of putting the squeeze on young people and making them pay for the recession.

He boasts about &euro;14 million for a youth guarantee and says nothing about the &euro;32 million the Government is axing from social welfare payments to young people.  The Government announced yesterday a pyrite remediation scheme of &euro;10 million as if it were a great leap forward, when it announced the same scheme this time last year - although it was then &euro;50 million - as a first step in dealing with the tens of thousands of houses in that category.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, had the neck to tell us here on Tuesday that past budgets during this Government's term have been progressive.  He told us that nobody is ideologically attached to austerity.  If they are not ideologically attached to austerity, what is it, then?  A coincidence?

This House has two key functions; these are to hold the Government to account and enact and amend legislation.  We must improve the way in which we do both of these.  The way we do our business is based on a set of ideas and systems that have evolved since the 19th century, and that process of evolution must take another step forward.  Parliament is different from other work places, and the work done by Deputies extends well beyond the formal sitting times for this House.  Nevertheless, the D&aacute;il can no longer work in a way that is so far removed from the experience of fellow citizens.  We must change the way we work and show a more timely capacity to hold the Executive to account and make our legislative process more inclusive and timely.  We need not only to listen to other voices but show that we are listening.<\/p><p>  Over the past decade the amount of resources available to individual Deputies has been significant increased.  The staff compliment in the research and library facilities has improved enormously compared to when I was first elected to the D&aacute;il in 1989.  Our structures and systems have not been reformed at the same pace.  The changes being proposed today will require deeper and more considered engagement in the legislative process.  Committees are not a platform for party political speeches and soundbite opportunities, and they require considered effort and engagement if they are to work effectively.<\/p><p>  The measures we are introducing to this House are building on reforms already introduced over the past two years, such as an additional slot for Leaders' Questions on a Thursday, Topical Issue debates, Friday sittings to allow Deputies from both the Opposition and Government benches to introduce Bills and a reduction by nine in the number of Oireachtas committees.  Today's proposed changes to Standing Orders will significantly enhance scrutiny of legislation, spending and policy, as well as the capacity of Deputies to hold the Government to account.  It will also open the legislative process to new voices and ideas.<\/p><p>  For example, in future all non-emergency legislation will be required to be sent to the relevant Oireachtas committee for examination, debate and consideration with the input of relevant experts, if there is a wish to do so.  We have seen how this process was used to positive effect, particularly when it comes to public confidence in the law making process, with the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Bill earlier this year.  I know from ministerial colleagues that they have often found this type of scrutiny of legislation before proceeding to drafting to be particularly useful, as it can catch anomalies or unintended consequences early, hence reducing the need for late amendments.  It can also help in introducing new, previously unconsidered angles or ideas.<\/p><p>  Another positive change to how we do business will be a significant role for Oireachtas committees in fiscal accountability.  With the budget now in October, for the first time Oireachtas committees can consider departmental Estimates before any money is spent and not, as was previously the case, only after the fact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700010#H09300","speaker":"951"},{"type":"speech","time":1382006100,"counter":407,"content":"<p>The budget debate is guillotined, as well as the debate on the social welfare Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700010#H09400","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1382006100,"counter":408,"content":"<p>The new D&aacute;il schedule will also extend sitting times, allowing for an increase in the time for debate, and the D&aacute;il will sit every second Friday to consider legislation put forward by Deputies and committee reports.

That is why this Government has introduced legislation to restore the Freedom of Information Act, whistleblower measures and the regulation of lobbying, as well as cutting political donations and effectively banning corporate donations.

The leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party did not even contribute to that debate, which indicated his interest in D&aacute;il reform after being appointed leader of Fianna F&aacute;il.  No parliament is perfect and the process of parliamentary reform is always ongoing.  For many Deputies in the Chamber elected before 2011, like me, the changes introduced to date by this Government have significantly enhanced their role.  Deputies can now draft their own legislation and have it debated in the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>They can engage in a pre-legislative review in committee, approach the Ceann Comhairle if they are unhappy with the answer to a parliamentary question and raise Topical Issues.  These are just the first steps in the D&aacute;il reform process.<\/p><p> The programme for Government outlines an ambitious agenda for Oireachtas reform to be introduced on a phased basis over the lifetime of the Government.  The number of D&aacute;il sitting days has been increased significantly by reducing the length of D&aacute;il recesses. The first phase of D&aacute;il reforms introduced in the summer of 2011 included an additional Leaders' Questions session on Thursdays; Topical Issue debates which replaced the Adjournment debate; Friday sittings to allow Deputies to introduce their own Bills; and a restructuring of the Oireachtas committee system by reducing the number of committees from 25 to 16 and providing for a system of pre-legislative review.  In the summer of 2012 further reforms to the Oireachtas committee system streamlined the structure and allowed an additional focus on areas such as job creation and agriculture.  These new Standing Orders are the next phase of the D&aacute;il reform programme.  <\/p><p> I refer to more public involvement in law-making.  A pre-legislative stage before an Oireachtas committee will be a requirement for all non-emergency legislation. This will allow Deputies to consult experts, civic society groups and other citizens on proposed legislation before it is drafted.  A Minister who does not bring a Bill to a committee for a pre-legislative stage will have to explain the reason to the D&aacute;il.  There will be an annual outline to the D&aacute;il of Government priorities.  The Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste will address the D&aacute;il setting out the Government's annual priorities.  Each Minister will also address the D&aacute;il setting out his or her Department's plans for the future.  Oireachtas committees will have a greater role in the budgetary process. Committees can review the Stability Programme update and report to Departments before the budget.  For the first time they can consider budget proposals and the Estimates before any money is spent.<\/p><p> There are measures to improve the legislative process.  The new D&aacute;il schedule will increase the length of daily sittings and the time available to debate legislation.  The drafting and enactment process will be modernised.  These steps will result in a reduction in the use of the guillotine.  The D&aacute;il will sit every second Friday to debate Private Members' Bills and committee reports.  This will allow more Deputies to have their Bills debated in the D&aacute;il and give a greater profile to committee reports.  The Minister or a Minister of State from the relevant Department will respond to Topical Issue debates.  Where this does not happen, the Deputy can either defer the debate until a Minister from that Department is available, when it will be given priority, or have it taken on the day allocated.  For D&aacute;il questions, the Deputy tabling an oral question must be in the Chamber when the matter is reached.  The Deputy will be given a brief period to outline the question before the Minister replies.  Opposition spokespersons will no longer nominate questions in the name of other Deputies but will have additional questions in their own name.<\/p><p><b><\/b>In legislative debates in the Chamber on First Stage the proposer of a Private Members' Bill will have five minutes to outline the purpose of the Bill.  On Second Stage the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the committee which considered the Bill at pre-legislative stage shall have a speaking slot to report to the D&aacute;il.  At the end of the Second Stage debate 45 minutes will be allowed for concluding remarks by Deputies who have previously spoken, as chosen by the Ceann Comhairle.  In a post-legislative review process a Minister will report to the relevant Oireachtas committee within 12 months of a Bill's enactment in order to review the Act. <\/p><p> D&aacute;il reform is an ongoing process and work has already started on the next phase.  I look forward to working on it with the members of the sub-committee on D&aacute;il reform.  Each Member of the House has an interest in this area and I am happy to consider any suggestion for D&aacute;il reform from any individual Deputy, party or group.  It is in all our interests and those of the people we serve to have a modern reformed D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700010#H10000","speaker":"1098","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382006700,"counter":415,"content":"<p>These Standing Orders are a facade.

There is no need for that behaviour next week, no need to guillotine the debate on the Social Welfare Bill.  As it will not take effect until next year, there should be plenty of time for a pre-legislative phase.  However, the Government will not entertain this because there are too many difficult issues to be dealt with.  It wants to get rid of the budget debate and the Social Welfare Bill as quickly as it possibly can to shut down dissent and keep its backbenchers under control.  That is why next Tuesday the D&aacute;il will be asked to guillotine the debate on the Social Welfare Bill on the following Thursday and Friday, without allowing amendments such as any relating to the abolition of household benefits and pensioners' telephone charges to be vote on.  If the Government was sincere about D&aacute;il reform, it would not put proposals before the Whips outlining how it wishes to order the business of the House next week.  That gives the lie to the proposition contained within these amendments to Standing Orders.  They will not result in real reform of how we, as legislators, perform in this House, in particular how we hold the Government to account.<\/p><p>  It is now 12 days since the people saw through the Government's attempt to abolish the Seanad, but the Government still refuses to listen.  The reason that vote was lost was that people did not believe it was about real reform.  They saw through the bluster, the focus groups and the sound bites and said all of that did not represent real reform.  This is more about the optics of reform.  This is about busyness, not business being done more effectively and efficiently.  The promised democratic revolution is not happening.  These Standing Orders are a whimper in a D&aacute;il that will sit more hours but do less.<\/p><p>  If one takes the list of claimed achievements in reform that the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste continue to expound, one will not find one significant change in how Ireland is governed.  There has been no ceding of power from the Executive to Parliament in the past two and a half years.  That is a fundamental fact.  There has been tinkering at the edges.  Today's alleged package of reform is about such tinkering.  The introduction of a new D&aacute;il sitting day on which no votes will be allowed and no legislation will emerge does amount to a change, but to present these proposals as transformative reforms is transparently ridiculous.  The Topical Issues debate was intended to allow Ministers to come to the House and debate, but even the Government's own Whip has noted that their lack of co-operation is &quot;shambolic&quot;.  That is how effective that reform has been.  The amendments before us will end up the same way, which is why we oppose them.  They miss the point that more radical reform is required.  <\/p><p>  There was no consultation.  Deputy Joanna Tuffy summed up that much.  Backbenchers have no say in this.  I am the leader of an Opposition party with 19 seats, but five minutes is all I have been allocated to discuss the issue of D&aacute;il reform.  It is an absolute joke.  I do not know how Government representatives can come to the Chamber and pretend this is radical reform when its own backbenchers are not allowed to speak on how this House operates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700011#J01600","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1382006700,"counter":430,"content":"<p>The Deputy has not offered even one suggestion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700011#J01700","speaker":"1098"},{"type":"speech","time":1382006700,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I have.

That might be because the Government has such a huge majority and it might even be for benign reasons such as that it is not even thinking about the way it treats the Opposition.  One example of its attitude is the way the proposals are being rushed through.  Another is the way the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste heckle Sinn F&eacute;in representatives.  That was very evident when Teachta&iacute; Mary Lou McDonald and Pearse Doherty outlined Sinn F&eacute;in's response to the shameful budget proposals.

We published proposals for political reform.  I do not know how the Labour Party works, but our group discussed all of our proposals.  We set out what we thought was required and presented it to the Chief Whip, the Taoiseach and the other Opposition parties for consideration.  We also submitted a specific procedural response to the Government's proposals, outlining how the existing D&aacute;il sitting days might be used more effectively.  The proposals included operational and procedural changes.<\/p><p>  Teachta Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh will address our amendments in greater detail, but I will deal with the principles underpinning the proposals.  Reform is required, even if there had not been the huge scandals we saw in recent years but because this system was inherited from the British and, as the T&aacute;naiste acknowledged, has been largely untouched ever since.  Citizens, commentators, political representatives - most people - want to see reform from the bottom up in order that citizens have a sense of ownership of how they are governed.  We are the messengers of the people who send us here.  In a real republic we should be accountable to them, not just at election time but in a real sense every day of the week.<\/p><p>  Since the Government came to power, &uacute;dar&aacute;s has been emasculated.  Local government structures have been disemboweled.  We have seen a complete mess of the Seanad reform propositions, including making a complete hames of the Seanad abolition campaign.  The Constitutional Convention has not been given proper authority.  A big point is that not one element of the Good Friday Agreement has been incorporated in any of the institutions or agencies of the State.  All of these measures which are about protection, equality and transparency, which work and are lauded worldwide have not been inculcated into the workings of the State.<\/p><p>  I question whether there has been proper consultation with staff - the ushers and administrative staff - on the introduction of the new measures.  If possible, I would like a response to this question.  Another concern is whether the proposed changes will increase further and reinforce the unacceptable gender imbalance.  Has any thought been given to a reduction in the number of Deputies?  We were promised a debate on the North, for which I had asked.  We propose that a dedicated week long D&aacute;il sitting on the North be scheduled on a regular basis, on a similar basis to the arrangements made for EU week.  There are many ideas within the Sinn F&eacute;in team and the Government must listen to what we say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700012#K06700","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1382007300,"counter":505,"content":"<p>We have a list of changes to Standing Orders that are hardly earth shattering.  In fact, it is an extension of the superficial changes that, in reality, change very little.  The changes were announced by the Government in advance of the autumn session of the D&aacute;il, yet Article 28.4 of the Constitution makes it very clear that the Government shall be responsible to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Deputy Joanna Tuffy is correct; it is not the D&aacute;il that is making the announcements, it is the Government.  Article 15.10 states each House of the Oireachtas shall - not may - make its own rules and Standing Orders, with the power to attach penalties for their infringement and shall have the power to ensure freedom of debate.  In that regard, reference has already been made to equality.  This and previous Governments have commandeered the role of the D&aacute;il.  It is a power grab; one that has been ongoing for a very long time.<\/p><p>If there are to be fundamental changes to the way in which we do business and if we are to learn from mistakes, we must realise that democracy needs checks and balances.  This was envisaged by the drafters of the Constitution and the people who approved it, yet there is nothing in the Government's reform programme that addresses this.  More democracy is needed, not less, yet there is a greater concentration of power at the centre.<\/p><p> There is a proposal to increase the number of hours and sitting days but sitting on the second Friday of each month will not be meaningful.  We propose that there should be one Friday sitting with votes rather than two half days so as to be meaningful.  The reform proposals move around times, such as the time for ministerial questions.  We believe the new time proposed will make Question Time less effective, not more effective.  Some changes have been made regarding Topical Issues.  The Government says it wants greater diversity and to encourage women or people with young families to enter politics, yet it is providing for a sitting day on Wednesday from 9.30 a.m. to 9.30 p.m.  This kind of development really flies in the face of the kinds of developments that should be occurring.  Sittings should be over five days and there should be a more normal arrangement.<\/p><p> What would a functioning D&aacute;il look like?  It would have checks and balances.  What went wrong at the time of the crash was related to the concentration of power in a very small number of people.  We are told the committees are where the work will happen.  There is much talk about the committee system but committees are not terribly well attended, despite what it said.  This is because it is impossible to be in two places at the one time.  There are fault lines associated with committees.  Since one is not allowed advice at the pre-legislative stage, one is often told on sending one's document to the Government that the Attorney General says one's proposal will not work.  The fault line must be addressed.  I have been saying that for some time now.<\/p><p> Nowhere in the Constitution are political parties referred to.  Article 40 confers the right to form associations and unions.  It states laws regulating the manner in which the right to form associations and unions and the right to free assembly may be exercised shall contain no political, religious or class discrimination.  Some of the rules in the Standing Orders are quite discriminatory.  Equal recognition is not afforded to various groups in the D&aacute;il by comparison with political parties.  My saying this might be inconvenient for those who are institutionalised in the political party system but the reality is that the mandate was given by the people and it should be respected.<\/p><p> This morning, we could not even stand up and object to the time that was being allowed under Standing Orders despite the fact that my group has 16 Members, which is more than Sinn F&eacute;in.  We could not stand up and make a point on the Standing Orders and the ordering of business because we do not constitute a political party.  For months on end, we have on the Order Paper a motion suggesting this needs to be addressed.  However, there is no commitment to address even that.  It flies in the face of how the Constitution sets out how we should do our business.<\/p><p> Most members of the Technical Group, including me, will be opposing the changes to Standing Orders because they are superficial, will cost a lot more and not deliver anything meaningful in return for the investment of time.  Essentially, they do not go to the heart of what is needed.  If we are to have radical reform and a democratic revolution, it is about time that we recognised the aspects of that revolution that are more than about ticking boxes, which is what is occurring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700012#K06800","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382007900,"counter":507,"content":"<p>It is good that we are having a debate on how to change our way of doing business to become more efficient, transparent and accountable.  As everybody in the House, except Deputy Adams, knows, this was discussed at length over a long period by the D&aacute;il reform committee.  It was discussed by the Parliamentary Labour Party at our think-in in Carton House.  I thank Deputy Tuffy for her very positive contribution at that meeting.<\/p><p>  I do not propose to address the detail of this tranche of reforms or earlier reforms that have been put in place as it has been adequately covered; suffice it to say that the transformation since I was first elected some 25 years ago has been very marked.  Twenty-five years ago, Government backbenchers were to be seen and heard only under instruction.  Now Government backbenchers raise matters through Question Time, the Order of Business and Topical Issues as regularly as the Opposition.  That is a very positive development in holding the Executive to account.  Backbenchers can no longer be regarded simply as cannon fodder.<\/p><p>  This is a democratic Assembly elected by the citizens of this democratic Republic.  I, for one, am very proud to have been chosen to be a Member.  Our job is to make law and hold the Government to account.  With regard to holding the Executive to account, a large part of our sitting time is actually devoted to that objective.  As stated, it is not only the Opposition Deputies who do this but also the Government backbenchers.  During a normal working day in the Chamber, the Government is made accountable by use of Private Members' time, Leaders' Questions, questions to the Taoiseach and Ministers, Topical Issues, the Order of Business and debates on legislation and motions.  The space for legislating is restricted but the new extended sitting hours and days, outlined in the motion, will provide some balance in this regard.<\/p><p>  On legislation, it is a reality in all democracies that the government proposes the vast majority of legislative measures.  There will be enhanced opportunities under the proposals before us to extend the time and space for the consideration of legislative proposals by backbenchers and Opposition spokespersons.  Regardless of who introduces legislation, the Members of the House debate it, parse it, amend it and either support or oppose it.  Making law is a complex matter.  First, a policy to be made law has to be decided.  Heads of the Bill are then prepared and sent to the Government.  There is then pre-legislative consultation.  The Bill then proceeds to full drafting and is sent to all Departments for their observations.  It is then subject to final Cabinet approval.  It then passes through five separate Stages in the D&aacute;il and Seanad and it is then sent to the President, who can sign it or refer it to the Supreme Court.  There will now be a post-enactment report to the relevant committee.  This is part of the new procedure proposed today.<\/p><p>  There are, rightly, severe checks and balances and that is how it should be, as the lives and welfare of citizens who elected us are affected.  They deserve no less.  I do not foresee any significant change to the procedure, which has been tried and tested over time.<\/p><p>  The biggest issue to be resolved is the time to be provided for the passage of a Bill through its various Stages.  It is not possible to allow debate to continue indefinitely but it is necessary to ensure that all aspects of a Bill are scrutinised and debated.  Where the legislation is urgent or required to be law by a set date, agreement should be reached on the maximum time available and how this can be applied so no section is passed without debate or scrutiny.  We do this already through the Financial Resolutions arising from the budget so we do not have to reinvent the wheel to do so.  The proposal, if accepted, would remove the possibility of political play-acting, whereby all the time available is spent debating the Title of a Bill, for example, resulting in the Government being accused of bulldozing the Bill through the House.  I urge all sides in the House to examine this aspect of our legislative activity to ensure legislation passed is properly debated and scrutinised.<\/p><p>  There have been rather frantic calls in recent times for what has been described as &quot;far-reaching reform&quot;.  I have heard no substantial proposals from either the Opposition or the commentators who made the demands.  The only constant demand is for a free-for-all that would lead to the regular defeat of the Government.  The reality is that the Government in power has in Parliament majority support without which it would not be the Government.<\/p><p>  The Whip system is described by the commentators in question as dictatorial and curbing freedom of expression and action.  I have been a Whip for many years and the only power I have is that vested in me by Labour Party parliamentarians, my colleagues.  The Labour Party meets once per week and makes decisions on how it will vote on various issues.  This is usually by consensus, but sometimes a position is arrived at by majority decision.  All members of the group who have accepted the decision are expected to vote accordingly, as would be the case in any organisation.  If anybody does not accept the decision of the group, he or she is free to act contrary to the group's wishes, and some have done so.<\/p><p>A great deal has been done since I first came to the D&aacute;il to make the working of this House more effective but there is still room for further action on the various proposals from all sides.  As has been said in another context, a lot has been done but there is more to do.

I am a Whip and there is a Whips' meeting every week during which we consult with people and try to reach an agreement.  We listen to the views of others at those meetings.  I was taken aback to see the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputy Martin, come in here, give his rant and then get up and walk out, without listening to people's views in this Chamber.  He was very concerned about this motion but then off he went.  It is ridiculous.<\/p><p>  The Chief Whip, Deputy Kehoe, should be complimented on the D&aacute;il reform packages he has actually implemented.  The key functions of this Parliament are to hold the Government to account and to enact legislation.  Many reform measures have been introduced, the first round of which were implemented within four months of this Government's coming into office.  The Government has brought in a range of measures to make this Parliament work better.  D&aacute;il reform involves everyone in Parliament and everyone has a say.  The Fine Gael Party debates reform proposals and listens to the different views.  The Ceann Comhairle put forward proposals which were considered by the Government.  Indeed, every party has put forward proposals which were listened to by this Government.  This is an ongoing process.  <\/p><p>  If one examines what has already been delivered by the Chief Whip, one will see that we are sitting for longer in this House - 33% longer, in fact.  There was a time when this D&aacute;il rose in June and did not resume until the last day of September.  That is no longer happening.  We are sitting longer now.  The measures introduced by Deputy Kehoe make the Government more accountable.  For example, on Thursday the T&aacute;naiste comes into the House for Leader's Questions, which did not happen before.  That makes the Government more accountable.  It gives members of the Opposition an opportunity to raise the relevant issues of the day.  The Topical Issue debate now takes place in the middle of the day and Members can raise relevant issues, with the topics selected for debate by the Ceann Comhairle.  <\/p><p>  We need to reach an agreement on where we go from here.  Basically, I see Deputy Martin coming in here every week and ranting about D&aacute;il reform, but I do not see the practical measures he wants to see introduced.  There is now an opportunity for backbenchers to present legislation for debate in this House and the Government parties have, in some cases, accepted that legislation.  That did not happen previously under Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments.  It simply did not happen.  That represents significant progress.<\/p><p>  The proposals on the pre-legislative process, whereby civic society and interested parties are given a say on proposed legislation, represent major reform.  I attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications yesterday, attended by various stakeholders in Shannon Airport.  The CEO of the airport, the Clare county manager and representatives of the Chamber of Commerce were given an opportunity to give their views on a Bill specific to Shannon.  They were very grateful for that opportunity.  That represents a major change and in fairness, Deputy Kehoe should be applauded for that and members of the Opposition should support it.<\/p><p>  I attend Whips' meetings and what is said in this Chamber is very different to what is said at those meetings.  It does not add up.  For Deputy Martin to come into this Chamber and rant about reform while not putting forward proposals of his own is ridiculous.  When the debate proper started, he just walked out.  He did not listen at all, which is shocking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700014#M00200","speaker":"975"},{"type":"speech","time":1382008500,"counter":510,"content":"<p>When we started this process two and a half years ago there was genuine enthusiasm among all the Whips.  There was a willingness to work together to try to achieve the sort of reform that we considered necessary.  Many of us were approaching this in the context of the intention, expressed by the Government parties during the election campaign, to effect a democratic revolution.  It has been admitted by Deputy Kehoe and indeed by Deputy Stagg, who has been around for a lot longer than most of us, that perhaps for the first time we had unanimity in terms of working towards reform.  However, while I do not blame Deputy Kehoe, who is only responding to his political masters, what we now have is a level of disenchantment across the board because the scale of reform that was envisaged has not been achieved.  Fianna F&aacute;il published a document on reform last July and my party Leader gave it to the Taoiseach last week or the week before.  In terms of the anxieties and concerns of my party leader, one of those derives from the fact that both he and Deputy Adams were given very explicit commitments by the Taoiseach that in advance of the publication and implementation of a package of reforms, he would sit down with the party leaders and have a meaningful discussion with them.  That did not happen.  When we met the Taoiseach a week or two ago, I asked him what was going to happen on this particular package and he said the Government would be proceeding with it and that he would not be having the discussion with party leaders to which he had committed.  That gives rise to justifiable anger and frustration on the part of my party leader, Deputy Adams and others.<\/p><p>  I have never said that there are no positive proposals in this package of reforms.  However, as Deputy Martin has said, the reforms fall so far short of what was possible and what was promised as to be disenchanting and disillusioning.  The Friday debate has been referred to by some Members.  It is, on the one hand, exciting that backbenchers are being given the opportunity to bring forward legislation, but how meaningful is any of that unless some of the legislation is actually enacted?  Otherwise, it is nothing more than a talking shop.  The reality is that in two and a half years none of the Bills discussed on a Friday has been written into law, and there is no prospect of any future Bills that will be discussed being enacted either.  Reference was also made to the pre-legislative debate, which is a very good initiative, and I commend Deputy Kehoe on that.  However, it has always been possible for Oireachtas committees to conduct pre-legislative discussions and consultations.  It is good that the Government is formalising the process and we support that.  However, as my party leader quite rightly pointed out, on the one hand the Government is promising pre-legislative discussion but on the other hand, next week we will debate one of the most important Bills that the D&aacute;il will consider between now and Christmas, the social welfare Bill, but there has not been any pre-legislative discussion on that.  That legislation, as Deputy Martin pointed out, will be rammed through the House next week.  That is completely at variance with the sense coming from Government of what it wants to do.<\/p><p>  Deputy Carey has expressed his annoyance at the departure of Deputy Martin, who has gone to fulfil another commitment, but we were here on Tuesday last for the budget debate, and I can assure Deputy Carey that I was pretty annoyed when I saw the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform get up and leave the Chamber while the budgetary debate was still under way.<\/p><p>It was more important for the two Ministers to leave the Chamber to start the spinning outside.  In the past the one Minister would have stayed in the Chamber for the entire budget debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700014#M00300","speaker":"1054","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382009100,"counter":512,"content":"<p>That was never the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700015#N00200","speaker":"1098"},{"type":"speech","time":1382009100,"counter":513,"content":"<p>Yes, it was.

I am one of the longer serving Whips in the House.  In that time I have tried to engage positively with and come to consensual agreement on any package any Government has introduced to make the workings of the House better, make it more accountable and reflective of society.  I have acknowledged the changes made in the last round of D&aacute;il reforms as being positive.  This package also has some positive elements, which I accept.<\/p><p>  It must be remembered we are Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la, messengers from our constituencies.  We have a dual role as legislators, as well as working with our constituents and their representative organisations.  We must be careful to ensure we do not burden Deputies with unrealistic timeframes.  Some of the pressure coming from the media is aimed at trying to get us to sit here from 9 a.m. to midnight.  Even if we were to do this, it would not suit some on the outside.  We need to ensure we fulfil both of our duties.  These roles were confirmed for us recently at the Constitutional Convention when its citizen members agreed that Deputies had a role to reflect and work with them.  This is being eroded somewhat by these proposals.<\/p><p>  Behind some of the proposals I have made, I recognise there is a need to make the D&aacute;il, political institutions and the Government more effective, accountable and transparent, while making it more workable for Members.  I gave a draft copy of my reform proposals to the Chief Whip before being fully passed by my party to ensure he would row back on some of his proposals before they were put to the House.  The sitting time every second Friday could be contained in the existing working week by extending the Tuesday sitting to cover the morning period.  This would save not only money for the Houses but also provide more time for Members to spend in their constituencies.  That proposal is contained in my amendment.  Deputy Gerry Adams spoke earlier about having a sitting week devoted to dealing exclusively with proposals under the Good Friday Agreement that have not yet been implemented.  It seems, however, that the Government wants to give over another two weeks to discuss EU matters.<\/p><p>  The D&aacute;il reform committee endorsed the first package of reforms some time ago.  This package, however, was put to the committee as a <i>fait accompli<\/i>.  No consensus was reached on it and it will be put to the House today without a proper discussion with Members or the staff.  These changes are expected to take effect in two weeks time.  That is a significant change in how this House works.  The implications for human resources have not been fully worked out and it could lead to chaos.  In my amendment I suggest these reforms should have a longer lead-in time and be introduced in January.  This would give us a way to restructure our constituency arrangements, our offices in Leinster House and for the staff to change their lives around it.  <\/p><p>  Some of my proposals are positive.  I have gone as far as accepting that speaking times should be reduced to allow more Members the opportunity to speak.  I have suggested limits be placed on speaking time on Report Stage in order that we do not have, as Deputy emmet Stagg referred to, a discussion on the Title taking up much of the time for the debate.  However, the Government has rejected these proposals that I have been making since 2002.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700015#N01000","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1382009100,"counter":519,"content":"<p>The Deputy is way over time and now speaking against himself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700015#N01300","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1382009100,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I objected to the timeframe for this debate.

As a woman, I am always conscious of my rights because I live in a democracy when so many women and girls across the world do not.  I agree that we need greater efficiency in our parliamentary democracy and the programme for Government set out certain reforms in this regard.  However, decreasing the number of Deputies and constituencies without addressing the work of Members is only window-dressing.  Increasing the number of sitting hours and days is not going to bring about greater efficiency, unless one tackles the source of inefficiencies in the first place.<\/p><p>  It was seen as a reform to increase the size of the parliamentary committees and widen their agendas.  However, as we all know, narrower agendas and smaller committees work much better.  It will be interesting to see how this new plan for strategic, sectoral and thematic committees will work.  I can imagine the pressure on the four strategic committees and in the vying for a place on them.  I hope it will be done fairly.<\/p><p>  It has been proposed to increase the time available for debates and the standard sitting week which will, accordingly, reduce the number of occasions on which the guillotine will be used.  I know we cannot talk forever on a particular topic, but there still has been an increase in the use of the guillotine.  We do not have proper engagement with Ministers except on Topical Issues.  How can a system under which a Minister stands up with a prepared script for 20 minutes and who cannot be interrupted be seen as efficient or offering interaction?  The system is also weighted against the Independents.<\/p><p>Whether the D&aacute;il, the Oireachtas and the powers that be like it or not, there are 19 independent Deputies, 16 of whom are allied to the Technical Group.  Standing Orders must keep up with the democratic will of the people.  I do not know where we come in the pecking order but it is very far down, if we are there at all on some stages.  Why can the clock not be used during Leaders' Questions to ensure everybody has an equal amount of time?  Standing Orders are there to enable and assist parliamentary democracy to work efficiently, effectively and fairly.  The language in Standing Orders is archaic and convoluted.  Could we not have it in simple sentences, each with a subject, predicate and object?<\/p><p> I have no problem sitting every second Friday provided it is productive and does not descend into what parliamentary debate currently is, namely, vicious slagging matches.  This morning was a perfect example of that.  We are talking about greater engagement with civil society in the pre-legislative stage.  We are denying civil society the opportunity to come in and use the audio-visual room.  I cannot understand where that is coming from.  I was with a disability group yesterday.  They cannot come in here and meet their Deputies, in a place that is wheelchair accessible and free of charge.

I will warmly support the pre-legislative changes when they come in next January.  That is the real, substantive change that has been proposed.

We all say we want D&aacute;il reform, we are passionate about it.  We work very hard to get in here and when we are here, so we want the D&aacute;il to work.

It is 50 minutes of us standing up, talking for two minutes and then sitting down.

He is just four years old and like all children of his age he is friendly and smart.  He is also hugely courageous and profoundly deaf.  I mention Billy because his was the first cochlear implant case I raised here.  I could also talk about Alex, Anna, Ben, Ellie, Grace, Fionn or many others.  Billy was one of several children whose parents asked to meet me in January and they are an amazing group of mothers and fathers.  They are committed, dedicated, imaginative, unstinting and tireless in their determination to get the very best for their children.  They will travel anywhere, meet anyone, and present a compelling account of their experience and of their hopes and demands for their p&aacute;ist&iacute;.  Their web site is clever and informative.  I logged on again last night and listened to Emeli Sand&eacute; sing her evocative \"Read all about it\" in which there is the line, \"You've spent a life time stuck in silence\" and watched the video as children and parents tell their story.  All of us in the D&aacute;il, from all parties and none, who have met the children and their parents have been moved and motivated by their courage and example.<\/p><p>  I commend the Happy New Ear campaign and I welcome the parents and some of the children to the Gallery today.  I first met the parents and some of the children in my office in Dundalk in February.  Later a group of parents came to the D&aacute;il to make a presentation to a cross-party group of Deputies.  Since then they have lobbied politicians, doctors, HSE officials, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children and the Minister for Health on the issue.    This is an issue of fundamental rights.  All of these children were born with profound hearing loss, but medical science has provided a means by which many of them can hear.  We have the cure for many of these children.  It means providing a surgically implanted electronic device, called a cochlear implant, which provides a sense of sound to a person who is profoundly deaf.  The operation is difficult, and especially so for children who may have to undergo several procedures requiring a general anaesthetic.<\/p><p>  In this State the health policy for the past 17 years has dictated that a patient receive only one cochlear implant.  This means the children who go through the operation have hearing in only one ear.  As one of the mothers said to me a long time ago, it is like giving a blind child sight in only one eye.  This is despite the fact that international best practice dictates children receive bilateral implants.  In the North, in England and throughout the European Union a child will receive two implants.  This is also what the HSE now recommends.  Ag an pointe seo, t&aacute; s&eacute; measta go bhfuil timpeall 200 p&aacute;isti a d'fh&eacute;adfadh bunt&aacute;iste a bhaint as na hionchlann&aacute;in cochla d&aacute;thaobhach.  T&aacute; an c&oacute;ir leighis is fearr tuillte ag na p&aacute;isti seo.<\/p><p>  It is a fact that children who go through life with hearing in only one ear face serious hurdles.  There are better educational outcomes if a child can hear with both ears.  It allows them to determine where sounds come from, which is vital in a noisy environment such as the D&aacute;il Chamber, a playground, a football or hurling pitch, a shopping centre or a cr&egrave;che.  They have a sense of confidence if they can hear the voice of their mother or father.  It also gives these children the ability to communicate with others and make friends with other children and not be socially isolated.<\/p><p>  The overall amount of additional money required to provide this service is approximately &euro;12.8 million per year.  As we have discussed, all of this would not have to be provided upfront.  As capacity to perform the operations builds the funding can be provided incrementally.  It is not a prohibitive amount.  It is the children's right but it also makes economic sense for citizens to live independent lives.  The implementation of minimal international best practice would have a huge lifelong positive impact on the lives of these children and their families.  D&aacute; gcuirfe&aacute; an dea-chleachtas idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta seo i bhfeidhm, bheadh impleachta&iacute; thar a bheith dearfach aige ar saol na bp&aacute;ist&iacute; seo.<\/p><p>  Young Billy, who I mentioned at the beginning of these remarks, and whose mother Deanna is with us today in the Gallery, went through an operation last April to replace his faulty implant.  Before the operation I raised his case on Leaders' Questions.  I sent word to the Taoiseach quietly in advance so he would not be bounced on this important issue.  I gave him a note on it.  He was sympathetic and promised to raise the cochlear implant issue with the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.  I also suggested that when Billy was getting his faulty implant fixed a second implant could be fitted.  Again, the Taoiseach was sympathetic.  I spoke to the Taoiseach again at least twice privately and in detail.  I also spoke to the Minister, Deputy Reilly.  I wrote to the two of them and briefed them fully on the general issue of these profoundly deaf children's needs and their right to have bilateral implants.  I followed this up in a persistent and consistent but low-key way.<\/p><p>  Despite the sympathy and positive responses, Billy went on to have his operation but no second implant.  This was an opportunity missed.  The operation would have cost &euro;18,000 and this would have been taxpayers' money well spent, but it was refused by the Government.  The Government had plenty of notice on the issue.  With respect to the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, I cannot help but compare the Government's stinginess in Billy's case with its generosity with public moneys when it comes to giving a digout to those in financial and banking institutions.  When Billy had his operation he could say only one word, and interestingly enough that word was &quot;No&quot;.  Billy now has 16 words and has discovered the magic of music.<\/p><p>However, the fault in the implant and the lack of a second implant means he was unable to begin school in September and he will not begin until next September.  He will also need a special needs assistant and ongoing speech and language therapy.<\/p><p> It just does not make sense.  Why do this when we have the means to sort it out?  This would be the case even if the child did nothing but enjoy music.  Leaving aside his potential and all of the possibilities for his life, surely that is something very compelling.<\/p><p> This was Billy's fifth general anaesthetic, which is a traumatic and potentially dangerous experience for such a young child.  When his implant failed, he was plunged back into a world of silence.  Imagine that, even as an adult, a person is forced back into silence for six weeks.  How does one explain that to a baby?<\/p><p> In these circumstances, it would have made sense for the HSE to agree to provide the resources needed to insert the second bilateral cochlear implant as the surgeon was replacing the faulty one.  If Billy Cairns, or Anna Murphy from Westmeath, who faced a similar problem, had had two implants, they would not have lost all sound for that period and they would not have been left to learn to listen and to understand all over again.  No child should have to go through this.  As I said earlier, this is not hugely expensive but it would make such a huge difference to these children.  In fact, it would probably save the State in the long term because, if they end up profoundly deaf, the State would have to spend more money providing care for them throughout their lives.  It would also make a huge difference to their making a positive contribution to society.<\/p><p> In working with the parents in this campaign, I have met medical professionals who are a wonderful, inspiring example of what public service is about.  One of them is Dr. Laura Viani, the ENT surgeon who first established the cochlear implant programme in Beaumont Hospital.  She has been a tireless campaigner, with the parents, in seeking to ensure this service is provided for those who need it on the basis of clinical need rather than ability to pay.  Sin rud an t&aacute;bhachtach - on the basis of clinical need rather than ability to pay.  She could have set up a private practice but such is her inspirational sense of duty and commitment that she has given decades of dedicated and selfless public service on behalf of these children who are profoundly deaf.  I would like to welcome her to the D&aacute;il and to thank her publicly on behalf of all Teachta&iacute; for the great work she has done and the great work we hope we can help her to do in the time ahead.<\/p><p> In July, Dr. Viani came to Leinster House to make a presentation to a cross-party group of Teachta&iacute; and Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute;, and impressed on all of us the benefits of introducing this programme.  She showed several videos of children reacting with amazement and joy as their implants are turned on for the first time - the Minister of State should see those videos.  Several parents also briefed us that day and warned of the huge stress their children suffered when the single cochlear implants broke and they were returned to a silent world.<\/p><p> N&iacute; seirbh&iacute;s seo a f&eacute;idir le na p&aacute;ist&iacute; seo fanacht ar.  T&aacute; s&eacute; uathu l&aacute;ithreach.  As I said to the Minister of State privately, I was very disappointed with the Government's amendment to the Sinn F&eacute;in motion.  Of course, I am happy the cochlear implant programme has provided devices for 700 patients, which is good.  However, where is the sense of simply noting recommendations made by the National Audiology Review Group?  That is not the same as implementing the recommendations.<\/p><p> The first meeting of the Oireachtas all-party group on cochlear implants was held in May.  It was very well attended, with 17 Teachta&iacute; and Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; from all the parties and Independents there, and with apologies from some who were otherwise engaged.  Every Teachta and Seanad&oacute;ir I have spoken to on this issue, or who has been lobbied by the Happy New Ear campaign, says they believe these children should have bilateral cochlear implants.  The campaign is non-party political and, indeed, as an issue, it should be above party politics.  These children cannot hear because they are profoundly deaf.  The Government does not have that disability.  The Government does not hear thus far because it will not listen.  I still have the hope that the Government will listen and that the HSE service plan will include the business plan from Beaumont Hospital, which has been with the Government for a considerable time.  The parents had a hope that the business plan would have been in some way included in Tuesday's budget.  In working with them, I tried to ensure they did not build up a false hope, but they had that hope.  Perhaps the reason they did is because of the positive way the Minister for Health spoke when they raised the issue with him.  Of course, it did not come up in the budget and it is now awaiting clearance for the political go-ahead.<\/p><p> Our motion is very clear and unambiguous whereas the Government's amendment is a fudge.  There is no action plan, no commitment to introduce the bilateral cochlear implant programme, no commitment to include this programme in the 2014 HSE estimates process and no timeframe for implementation of the HSE-Beaumont business plan.  What the parents want to hear and have certainty on is a clear commitment from Government to a time-framed implementation for simultaneous bilateral cochlear implementation.  It is a simple &quot;Yes&quot;.  Forget about the amendment.  The Government is either going to do it or it is not.  If it is going to do it, why put everybody through this with such a silly amendment?<\/p><p> It is over to the Minister.  The Government needs to act.  The children and their parents are in a race against time to ensure - this is a crucial point - the children have the operation before they are too old for it to be effective.  The reality is that unless these implants are connected in the early years of a child's life, by the age of seven or eight the operation will be ineffective as the nerves will have died off.  After that, children born and raised in silence may never speak, something which will adversely impact on them for the rest of their lives.<\/p><p> The Proclamation is very clear and pledges to cherish all the children of the nation equally, and to guarantee &quot;equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens''.  These young citizens have already faced great adversity in their short lives.  They deserve the same rights and opportunities as every other child and every other citizen in the State.  The Proclamation does not say we will cherish all the children of the nation equally, except the ones who are profoundly deaf, except the ones who have disabilities or except the ones who come from poor backgrounds.  It says &quot;all&quot; of them.  These p&aacute;ist&iacute; have the right to hear, the right to be heard and the right to have a voice.  The Government can deliver all of this at relatively little expense.<\/p><p> The Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members' motion calls on the Government to ensure that the proposed business plan by the HSE and Beaumont Hospital to introduce a bilateral cochlear implant programme is contained in Budget 2014 and is part of the 2014 HSE estimates process.  I commend that to the Minister and ask Members to oppose the Government amendment and support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700018#Q00400","speaker":"1066","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382011200,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I was asked to speak on this Private Members' motion and, to be honest, I did not know what to say because how does anyone explain to parents of profoundly deaf children that it is Government policy that, for the sake of &euro;18,000, the provision of a second cochlear implant is not going to happen.  I tried to imagine what it would be like to be plunged into a world of silence because I have not experienced that, as none of us in the Chamber have experienced it.  It is very hard to understand what those children have to go through on a daily basis.  If the Chair will bear with me, I want to try to give some example of what those children have to endure because of a lack of funding or a lack of political will and commitment to provide the funds which could make a huge difference to people's lives.<\/p><p>I will do so by saying nothing for the next two minutes so there will be some understanding of what those children must endure.<\/p><p>   That was two minutes of silence.  Unless there is a change in policy, a commitment is given and the funding of &euro;12.8 million is provided, which is not much in the bigger scheme of things, the awkward silence of those two minutes in this Chamber is representative of the lifetime of silence for those children.  I plead with the Minister, on a human level, to do the right thing and provide the funding to give every child the opportunity to listen and hear, a gift we in this Chamber enjoy every day.

It is something we rarely consider and something we even curse at times in these days of constant din.  Dublin is a noisy city and Leinster House is a noisy place with the constant chatter, the whirr of air vents, the clinking of radiators and so forth.  We try to drown much of this out and to ignore the noise of daily living - the busses passing the window, car horns, sirens and the crash and bang of works going on around us.  Those of us with the gift of hearing take for granted the wonders it provides every day.  We deal with so much background noise and intrusion that we too often fail to consider how lucky we are to be able to hear the voices of our loved ones every day, the splendour of music from voice and instrument and the lyrical use of language in daily conversation.  It is impossible to describe just how much life is enriched by our ability to hear everything from a baby's cry to the grandest flourishes of Beethoven.<\/p><p>  It is rare that we are given the potential to bestow such an amazing gift on a person.  It is impossible for me to understand how it must really feel to go from a world of silence to a world of music, voices, clatter, bangs and cries of passion, anger and joy.  It must in some way be a rebirth.  Anybody who doubts this or believes me to be verging on hyperbole should go to their office and search &quot;cochlear implant&quot; on YouTube and watch one of the many videos of children experiencing the beauty of music or hearing their mother's voice for the first time.  There is wonder on their faces and tears for their families, joyous in the knowledge that life has just become richer and more profound for their loved one.  They have awoken to a world of sound.  We can be dulled by the fullness of our senses, by the daily assault on them by the excess in this modern world.  It brings to mind Patrick Kavanagh's poem &quot;Advent&quot;, which speaks of the &quot;...newness that was in every stale thing ... When we looked at it as children: the spirit-shocking&quot;.  The gift of hearing is just that, a gift that will bring a newness to the world of these children which will enrich their lives forever.<\/p><p> This gift must be provided now for a generation of children, or their window of opportunity will be lost.  That is why we raise this in the motion before the House.  I commend the work of Happy New Ear, the group of families who have spearheaded a campaign to give their children and future children the gift of hearing.  Their work is most valuable.  They have done a great deal to bring the beauty of sound to their children's lives, and it is now our turn to help them.  This is a realisable goal.  The money required is relatively small and it is a positive investment in our young, the next generation of Irish people.  The cost is just &euro;12.58.<\/p><p>  At present, children in Ireland receive only one cochlear implant, but international best practice recommends two.  In many ways, this is a very mean practice in penny pinching.  We have recognised that children should get cochlear implants, but not that we should bother to do it right.  If it is worth doing, it is worth doing correctly.  We know it is worth doing so, logically, two cochlear implants for each child is exactly what should happen.  The cost of a single implant is between &euro;18,000 and &euro;20,000.  Provision of only one implant limits a child's ability to distinguish where noises are coming from and his or her ability to hear in busy or noisy places.  It is a start, but to really benefit a child two implants are required.  They require the two implants sooner rather than later.  There is only a limited period when the implants will be possible, due to the death of nerves in the ear which are needed for implantation.  This is a race against time and every day we delay in changing policy to entitle children to two implants is a day closer to the time when the window closes and their hearing will be irreparably limited.<\/p><p>  Current policy is that we must help these children, but only a little.  That is not good enough and too many children have been already failed as their window for full hearing has closed.  Two implants also allow for limited hearing when one implant malfunctions.  At present, children with one implant in need of repairs are thrown back into silence and are doomed to experience this temporary silence intermittently throughout their lives.<\/p><p>  In July, Sinn F&eacute;in hosted a briefing by Happy New Ear and Dr. Laura Viani, who is the surgeon with the cochlear implant programme in Beaumont Hospital.  The parents met the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, on Tuesday and they spoke to the Oireachtas committee on health.  Dr Viani warned that unless these implants are connected in the early years, by the age of seven or eight years the operation will be ineffective.  After that, children born and raised in silence never speak and that is a huge difficulty which adversely impacts on the rest of their lives.  She explained that international best practice calls for bilateral implants to be provided.  This significantly improves their quality of life.  For the child it is a &quot;journey out of silence.&quot;  Dr. Viani posed the question, &quot;If you are told you need glasses would it make sense to give you only one lens?&quot;  It is so with the children who need bilateral cochlear implants.<\/p><p>  It is detrimental for the child to go through the trauma of the three-hour operation for only one implant.<\/p><p>Two of the parents warned of the stress to their children when their single cochlear implants broke and they were returned to a silent world.  This caused the children huge distress.  This is not just an issue of doing the right thing by these children.  If looked at coldly, it is an economic issue.  Like many health issues, the cost of not addressing it far outweighs the cost of meeting it head-on and investing in a solution.  Children who are deaf require greater educational support and special care packages and often suffer serious psychiatric and depression problems later.  They also have difficulty getting work.  With cochlear implants, they can make a positive contribution to society and find it easier to get employment.  The issue is now on the agenda of the Government thanks to the efforts of the parents.  As political representatives, our responsibility is to support their efforts and to do all we can to ensure the Government takes the right decision in the upcoming period.<\/p><p> In the Sinn F&eacute;in pre-budget submission we showed how bilateral cochlear implants could be paid for before considering the more long-term saving the State would make in the care and support needed for children who are deaf as they grow up and enter adulthood.  We know the Government has no interest in introducing fair tax-and-spend models as represented by our budget.  We know it likes to go for the soft targets and cut from those who have nothing to give, but its members should listen in respect of this issue at the very least.  A sum of &euro;12 million could and should have been found.  This is too important an issue for too many children and their families.  When we have a solution to a terrible problem in our grasp, when we know it is possible, when we know it can be done and all we need is the political will of those in power, it is harder to take when it is not done.  I am not in the habit of applauding this Government but if it can meet this demand then that is the only reaction I could give.  This is such a simple case of the right thing to do not being done.  Here is the opportunity; the Minister should do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700020#S00200","speaker":"1022","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382012400,"counter":564,"content":"<p>I find it hard to believe that we are arguing for this.  Perhaps I am na&iuml;ve, but I thought this was a no-brainer and that the Government would stand up in the House on Tuesday and announce it had made funding available for bilateral cochlear implants.  Alas, that was not the case.  I am proud to stand in solidarity with these kids and their families and friends.  Our party is committed to ensuring that the Government makes funding available as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  A year ago, when Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, and I were at the Disability Federation of Ireland pre-budget event, I called for a threshold of decency on disability supports.  That is a promise from members of every political party and none and a political consensus that they will not cut supports for disability.  Unfortunately, we have not signed up to the threshold of decency idea.  In a real republic all citizens are equal, but not here.  These profoundly deaf children are not equal, despite the fact that we can change this relatively easily.  Last year, we were struck by the bravery of citizens with profound disabilities in protesting outside Leinster House at the cuts made by the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly.  The courage and dignity of those who braved the elements to make their stand shone a light on the reality for them, their carers and their families.  Despite the promises of both the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste in the final pre-election leaders' debate last year, the Government has proceeded to enforce cut after cut on those with disabilities in this State, their families and their carers.  Their broken promises on disability are the cruellest of all.<\/p><p>  In Ireland, profoundly deaf children receive only one cochlear implant.  This is the same as providing a child with glasses with only one lens.  It is wrong, cruel and unacceptable.  These children have a limited time window for the implants to be successful; dragging our heels is simply not an option.  The cost is a measly &euro;12.58 million in the context of the overall budget and the impact it will have.  It is unthinkable that the Government cannot do it, as it is a small price to pay to give children the opportunity to hear.<\/p><p>  I attended a briefing in the AV room prior to the recess with the Happy New Ear group and Dr. Laura Viani, the surgeon with the cochlear implant programme in Beaumont Hospital.  I was really touched by the plight of these children and their parents.  It is simply outrageous to consider that Ireland's vulnerable children and children in need being ignored due to budget restraints.  The importance of early intervention for these children is immense.  The younger they are treated, the more chance they have of catching up with their peers and continuing life through mainstream education without a requirement for special needs schooling.  By delaying treatment, the Government is increasing the risk that these children will develop additional needs, which will result in a greater cost to the State.  This is a matter we can do something about.  We can give these children the gift of hearing for relatively little expense.  Why can the Government not commit to this?  These children deserve to live their lives as their friends do.<\/p><p>  I watched the famous debate in which the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste, the presumptive Government at the time, were asked about their number one priority.  In terms of social justice, they said the number one priority was disability support.  There were promises in the programme for Government and the national disability implementation plan.  The Disability Federation of Ireland stated:<blockquote>The disability movement has been hit hard by harsh outcomes [...], the social infrastructure that exists to support them has been decimated and the initiatives announced today do too little to reverse that.  Yet again there has been no commitment from Government to support people with disabilities and their families.<\/blockquote>That is the verdict of the Disability Federation of Ireland on the budget.  The Minister of State sat at the debate last year and was offered the opportunity to examine the threshold of decency.  This is about decency.  It is indecent not to provide just over &euro;12 million so that the children involved can have the opportunity to live their lives to their full potential.  We cannot address many disabilities and there are many in respect of which we can only provide support for carers or try to alleviate or ameliorate the impact.  In contrast, this is one we can fundamentally address.<\/p><p>  I cannot understand it.  The Minister of State and I canvas at election time.  In my years in public life, I have never met a voter who said that he or she did not want me to deliver on disability support but wanted me to protect the wealthy and ensure there was no wealth tax for the very wealthy in society.  No voter ever asked me to protect the wealthy or to ensure a child who needed a second cochlear implant would not get it.<\/p><p>  I never claimed that our party had a monopoly on decency.  Deputies and Senators of all political perspectives in this House are thoroughly decent people who have given their lives to public service.  What the Government is doing and the policies it is pursuing are indecent.  The Minister of State can attend Disability Federation of Ireland events, give a spiel, make commitments in the programme for Government, put in place plans and table amendments to this straightforward and simple Private Members' motion, referring to a new review group and a new clinical care programme, but these political promises will be broken.  Who wants it to happen?<\/p><p>  Not so long ago, the Minister of State insisted that she had to vote down equality budgeting, even though it is Labour Party policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700021#T00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1382012400,"counter":565,"content":"<p>It was a disaster and the Deputy knows it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700021#T00300","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1382012400,"counter":566,"content":"<p>Why do we need equality budgeting?  We need it because of the spectacle today, where parents, who are heroes, are in the Gallery advocating for their children.  Every parent and every carer for a disabled person is a hero, but we have failed them in politics because we make promises and then they are broken.<\/p><p>Equality budgeting solves that because it ensures that every single budget measure, intervention or new policy from a Department is subject to an equality impact assessment, and the vulnerable who are failed repeatedly by politics are protected by legislation.  That is why it is so vital to bring in equality budgeting and protect those who are most vulnerable in society.<\/p><p> The Minister of State is aware that this is wrong.  She will make a speech and tell us that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, is conducting a review and they will have a programme and do their best subject to budgetary constraints.  Is that what she entered politics for?  When she was a much younger woman, with all the progressive ideals that she had at that time, and the equality and fairness for which she stood, did she ever imagine she would find herself in the seat opposite right now having to defend the indefensible?  At some point, one must search inside one's self and ask, &quot;How can I stand against equality budgeting?&quot;  How can she allow the wealthiest in Irish society to have another celebration?  The champagne bottles were probably popping all around Ireland to celebrate because they had been let off the hook again.<\/p><p> That is how one frees up resources.  We have shown the Minister of State how she can free up &euro;1.4 billion by asking the very wealthy in Irish society to contribute, yet all we need here is &euro;12 million - she can work out the percentage.  It is about choices.<\/p><p> The Minister of State can choose to defend the vulnerable in Irish society.  She can choose to protect those who need our support, who have nobody else to protect them and who are failed repeatedly by politics and promises, or she can merely blame it on somebody else.  There is no hiding place on this one.  There is no big bad troika.  There is no big bad Fine Gael.  This is a choice.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, puts her head down after all her years in politics, puts her head on the pillow and looks back, she will see this was not her greatest moment.<\/p><p> Deputy Lynch should turn this around.  She has the power.  She is in government.  She has a strong bloc of TDs and Senators.  She has significant power.  She can change this.  She has two more years for her legacy.  I appeal to her to go back to her roots to find Kathleen Lynch, the younger woman who started this journey, and stand up for the rights of those here.  If she can do so I will be a happy man but, more importantly, there are a great many across this State who will celebrate with me.  I wish her good luck with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700021#T00400","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382013000,"counter":568,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<blockquote>To delete all words after &quot;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&quot; and substitute the following:&quot;- recognises that the 2011 report of the National Audiology Review Group, published by the Health Service Executive (HSE) in 2011, provides the blueprint for the planning, development and delivery of HSE audiology services, including cochlear implantation;<br \/><br \/>- welcomes the establishment of the National Clinical Care Programme for Audiology which is overseeing the implementation of that report's recommendations;<br \/><br \/>- notes the recommendation in the report of the National Audiology Review Group regarding universal newborn hearing screening and welcomes the fact that Universal Newborn Hearing Screening is now in place in three out of four regions in the HSE, with roll-out under way in the fourth region;<br \/><br \/>- notes that since the cochlear implant programme commenced in 1995 in Beaumont Hospital, over 700 patients have received cochlear implants and welcomes the fact that the hospital carried out ninety cochlear implants in 2012 (42 children and 48 adults);<br \/><br \/>- recognises that the report of the National Audiology Review Group also included a recommendation in regard to funding for simultaneous bilateral cochlear implantation for children;<br \/><br \/>- notes that initial estimates of the additional resources required for the further development of the service are being examined in relation to the model of care and costings;<br \/><br \/>- recognises that within the serious resource constraints imposed by the current budgetary and fiscal conditions, the Minister for Health is committed to prioritising quality, safe care for all patients, including children requiring cochlear implants;<br \/><br \/>- further notes this Government's commitment to the new children's hospital in the Programme for Government;<br \/><br \/>- commends the Minister for Health on the establishment of the Children's Hospital Group to oversee the integration of three existing paediatric acute services in advance of the new hospital being built; and<br \/><br \/>- welcomes the establishment of the National Clinical Programme in Paediatrics and Neonatology and the work it is undertaking to develop a model of care for Irish paediatrics to ensure that children get the right care, at the right time, by the right team and in the right place.&quot;<\/blockquote>  I thank Deputy Mac Lochlainn.  I will tell him what I will do when I eventually put my head down and I am no longer involved in politics.  I will be able to pat myself on the back and say, &quot;Whatever I did, I did not do it purely to gain political advantage for myself.&quot;<\/p><p>  We have an enormously difficult budget.  Let us be honest about it.  It will be a real struggle this year to deliver the types of service we need in terms of what we have available.  That all stems from one event, the bank guarantee voted on at 2 o'clock in the morning here, when Members were tired and when the Labour Party pleaded with Sinn F&eacute;in not to vote for it.  We were told by Sinn F&eacute;in's spokesperson that it was a courageous move and to vote for it.  The bank guarantee is what has us here.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn may not like to hear that, but it is a fact.<\/p><p>  The other point I keep hearing about, in particular, from Deputy Mac Lochlainn, is the new politics.  However, when I try to practise new politics - I am fairly open about politics and, like the Deputy, do not go in for the party political type at all - Deputy Mac Lochlainn, as he did at the Disability Federation of Ireland event - immediately jumps up and down saying, &quot;U-turn, U-turn.&quot;  It is not a U-turn; it is being open to change.<\/p><p>  We need to get back to the issue at hand, which is about ensuring that young children and their parents have a better shot at life.  That is all we ever need and all we ever want, really, for any of our children.<\/p><p>  I compliment Happy New Ear.  I really do compliment them.  I have met them and they are an impressive group of people.  I believe they have an argument that is unanswerable.  It is an incredible argument.  Who, as a parent, would not want it?  God knows, each and every one of us who has a child would want that.<\/p><p>  The process that needs to take place - I spoke to Deputy Adams in advance of this - was never going to be announced in the budget.  That is not how it happens.  It needs to be developed and argued in the service plan, and that is what will happen.  It is not has if it has not got traction up to this point.  The HSE made a priority bid, in terms of both the budget and the service plan process, to the Department of Health in September and had it as a priority issue.  I spoke to the Minister for Health before he left the Chamber this morning and said that this was an issue that we had to deal with, and he said it was one of his priorities.  We are in there negotiating the service plan to get the best possible result.  I am not convinced we will please everyone, but we are in there to get the best possible results.  Technology has given these children the opportunity not to be dependent on the State.  As someone with responsibility for disabilities, I embrace that because that is something we are trying to do right across the system.<\/p><p>  Screening of newborns will ensure that difficulties are picked up at a much earlier age.  Approximately 94 cases per year are being diagnosed now.  If we insist on newborn screening and we have the technology and the ability - I am not certain about the funding, which I am not promising and which I did not promise to the group when I met them because I, unlike others, for the information of Deputy Martin Ferris, do not promise what I cannot deliver-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700022#U00200","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1382013000,"counter":569,"content":"<p>The Minister of State's party did.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700022#U00300","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speech","time":1382013000,"counter":570,"content":"<p>I do not promise what I cannot deliver.  What I am saying is that if we have the technology and if all we need is the money, we will argue that.<\/p><p>  As Deputy Adams correctly stated, because it was a conversation we were having, this does not need the &euro;12 million up front.  We will have to build a team.  That team has to be put in place because it will require additional resources but also manpower.  However, we have an expert in the field, a consultant in ear, nose and throat medicine, ENT.  I am glad to say the consultant is a woman, an extremely impressive woman.  Therefore, we are doing our best.<\/p><p>  It is not something we dismiss, but it is something that must be part of the process.  We cannot say, until we come out the other end of that process, whether we will be able to do it entirely.  It would be my fervent hope that we can and it is something for which we will be arguing strongly.<\/p><p>  For those who are less familiar with bilateral cochlear implants, it is important to explain what a cochlear implant is.  I definitely do not need to explain it to the parents in the Gallery.  It is a highly sophisticated device which provides access to sound for those with severe to profound hearing loss.  The surgically implanted device, as was explained to me, when coupled to an external processor, can provide access to speech and everyday sounds to aid or improve communication abilities.  It is not only about listening to music, although I acknowledge the joy of that.  It is not only about that; it is also a safety issue, as parents need to be able to stop their children from running onto the street or doing something that is a danger to them.<\/p><p>  The routine practice in Ireland so far has been to implant one side only.  The selection of the ear to implant depends on clinical factors.  However, it is now considered best practice worldwide that children should have bilateral implants.  I am aware that in Britain, the 2009 National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines advocated that it was best practice that all children should have bilateral simultaneous implants.<\/p><p>  I will tell Deputy Mac Lochlainn about the national review, because it is important.  The parents contributed, as did the ENT consultant and all of the experts.  Whatever we do in this Government, it cannot be similar to what previous Governments did, as it must be evidence-based.  These aspects are important.  That view was supported by the national review of audiology services which was carried out by the HSE.  The aim of the review was to examine the services provided to children and adults nationwide and to formulate a national plan for the services - just as we are doing in mental health, where we are clearly not there yet and where significant investment is needed.  It should not depend on one's postcode whether one's child gets this service, and that is why national clinical programmes are important.  The report of the review was published by the HSE in 2011 and provides the blueprint for the planning, development and delivery of HSE audiology services.<\/p><p>I want to particularly note that the audiology review group found considerable evidence of patient and parent satisfaction with the National Cochlear Implant Centre at Beaumont.  I commend the excellent people involved in the cochlear implant programme.  The audiology review report recommended continued ring-fenced support for the cochlear implant programme but at levels which allow for simultaneous bilateral implantation for children.  It also supported the proposal to locate the national paediatric cochlear implant service within the new children's hospital.  It recommended that the paediatric cochlear implant team should be integrated with the paediatric audiology service at the new children's hospital.  In this context, I would note that while Beaumont Hospital is the national centre, currently, surgical provision for the under-sixes takes place at Temple Street.  Since the report of the audiology review group was published, the HSE has established a national clinical care programme for audiology which is overseeing the implementation of its recommendations.  A new national clinical lead was appointed earlier this year and four assistant leads are to be appointed shortly.  Under the auspices of the clinical programme, progress is being made in the modernisation of audiology services in Ireland.  A total of &euro;3.7 million was made available in 2011 to begin the implementation of the recommendations and an additional &euro;1.9 million was made available in 2013.<\/p><p> One of the main recommendations in the report includes the national roll-out of a universal newborn hearing screening programme.  This is a key priority to ensure that all babies have their hearing screened shortly after birth.  I greatly welcome the fact that universal newborn hearing screening is in place in HSE south, HSE Dublin-mid Leinster and HSE Dublin north east.  HSE west is in the final stages of going live,  with only Limerick hospital remaining to go live before the end of the year.  From April 2011 to the end of July 2013, 62,000 babies have been screened and 94 cases of permanent childhood hearing impairment have been identified.  If it is being identified at this very early age then the natural next step must be to deal with the issue when it can be dealt with.  I am no great expert in this area.  I only know what the parents and the consultant told me.  However, it is the case that some children will not be able to benefit from this programme.  The numbers are not overwhelming.  The diagnosed figures are not overwhelming.  The Government has managed to achieve certain things, albeit with very scarce resources, which should have been done when the country was awash with money.  It is a matter of us all co-operating and ensuring that we do the right thing.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700022#U00400","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382013600,"counter":572,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700023#V00200","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1382013600,"counter":573,"content":"<p>Five front-line audiology staff are currently being recruited to support the newborn hearing screening programme.  There will be a further recruitment process later in 2013 for two to three additional posts.  In addition, ten students who received the MSc in audiology with HSE sponsorship have been offered appointments.  We are building up the team.  Another key recommendation was the establishment of a bone anchored hearing aid programme or BAHA.  It recommended ring-fenced support for the programme which has now commenced in six hospital sites.  In addition, recognising the importance of accurate and timely waiting list and activity information for audiology services, the programme has recently developed a waiting list and validation procedure to be implemented nationally.  It is a case of ensuring that those who need the help get it and that we are dealing with the right cohort of people.  I am very pleased with the progress to date in implementing the recommendations of the HSE review, with the universal newborn hearing screening programme being a particular success.  The business case for bilateral cochlear implantation was put together by Beaumont Hospital and the HSE in 2013.  The HSE has been working closely with Beaumont Hospital to progress plans for bilateral cochlear implantation.  The business plan is a tool to be used in the programme.  Such a programme will involve the assessment, fitting and post-operative follow-up of simultaneous cochlear implants.  The business case outlines estimated resource requirements for the introduction of simultaneous bilateral cochlear implantation.  The business case also addresses how sequential second implants could be provided to the cohort of children who have received one implant and who are assessed as suitable for a second.  It sets out a number of options for how sequential implantation may be managed.  The consultant ENT surgeon made a very strong case in this regard and he emphasised that the team must be built up.  This is a complex development and the HSE has engaged with many stakeholders in the proposal development.  It has also engaged the support and advice of two UK experts in the development of the business case.<\/p><p>  The introduction of a bilateral cochlear implant programme clearly has cost implications.  Estimated costs have been developed and these are now being examined closely and are subject to further review.  The resources required for the introduction of bilateral cochlear implantation will have to be considered in the context of the health Estimate for next year which was announced on Tuesday.  In developing its national service plan on the basis of Tuesday's budget, the HSE will have to consider the exact type and quantum of services to be provided.  This must be done in the context of the over-riding priority of the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly - which I share - for quality and patient safety.  Quality, safe care for children means that wherever our children live, and whatever their diagnosis, the health care they receive must be of a consistent quality and standard.  A clinical programme is under development.  This is a priority issue which will be dealt with in the service plan.<\/p><p>  I think this motion would have been more effectively tabled once the service plan was published.  I am someone who does not practise party politics to a great extent, much to the disdain of my party colleagues from time to time.  We need to see what can be done in the context of the Estimates and the service plan.  This is a particularly difficult year.  It is not the case that the Government is unsympathetic but as my sister-in-law says, &quot;What pocket does that go into?&quot;  Sympathy is all well and good.  I assure the House that the Minister and I regard this issue as a priority and we are fighting our corner on it.

A sensible approach in the House will progress important social issues such as this which are truly above politics and which merit addressing in the most sincere and proper way.<\/p><p>  Two to four persons in every thousand of the population have permanent childhood hearing impairment.  This is a high number of individuals.

It is also a matter that could have an impact on any of us in this House.<\/p><p> Conventional wisdom and the accepted best advice are that a bilateral cochlear implant is the way to proceed in a case of permanent hearing impairment in a young child; therefore, we should move to achieve this as quickly as possible.  That should be made clear at the outset and I am firmly of that view; therefore, it is only a question of deciding on the methodology to be used and allocating funding.  It is worth indicating the services that are provided free.  There is free screening, assessment, investigation and treatment, while devices are provided.  Speech and language therapy is also provided and there are visiting teachers from the deaf services.  It is only proper that these services are in place.  Since 1995 in Beaumont Hospital there have been 700 cochlear implants, of which 90 were carried out in 2012.  Of these, 42 were provided for children and 48 for adults.<\/p><p> An important document was alluded to by the Minister of State and we cannot progress without referencing it, despite Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn's remarks.  It must be our benchmark and reference point.  I refer to the 2011 report of the national audiology review group.  It provides a blueprint and makes the following main recommendations.  It argues that there should be universal screening for newborns.  This is place in three HSE areas and the service will be rolled out in the fourth.  The continuation and development of the programme are very significant achievements by the Administration.  Some &euro;3.7 million was made available in 2011 to begin implementation of the review group's recommendations, while &euro;1.9 million was made available in 2013.  These are tangible achievements and although it may be unpleasant to reference it, the investment is happening at a time when we are-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700023#V00500","speaker":"971","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382014200,"counter":577,"content":"<p>Writing down Denis O'Brien's loans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700024#W00200","speaker":"1084"},{"type":"speech","time":1382014200,"counter":578,"content":"<p>-----spending &euro;1 billion a month more than is being made and our overall borrowing figure relative to national wealth is in a perilous position.  In that context, these achievements and this level of investment - &euro;3.7 million in 2011 and &euro;1.9 million in 2013 - are not insignificant.  They suggest prioritisation of people who need this service, which is only right.  As the Minister of State indicated, there are ten students being sponsored by the HSE to pursue in the United Kingdom a master's degree in audiology and they will shortly be assigned to work here, which will greatly augment the service available.  A procurement exercise for the purchase of hearing aids, fitting systems and audiological assessment equipment has been completed, which is also important.<\/p><p>  The 2011 audiology review recommends continued ring-fenced support for the cochlear implant programme but at levels which would allow for simultaneous bilateral implantation for children.  In other words, it is accepted that this is the way to go.  We do not have a dedicated programme and the Minister of State has indicated it is being developed in the context of the national service plan and will be in place shortly.  However, some bilateral implantations have occurred for patients, mainly young children with certain medical conditions such as meningitis and blindness.  They have already had bilateral cochlear implants, meaning there is a precedent, but we must broaden the process.<\/p><p>  There are two aspects to developing the programme.  There is simultaneous cochlear implantation for new cases, with the provision, where clinically appropriate, of bilateral cochlear implants at the same time.  Even to a lay person, the process of doing both ears in one surgical procedure makes sense and I support it as both logical and humane.  The other option involves a sequential process, where people have already had a cochlear implant and must be reassessed before getting a second.  That would also have to be part of the programme.<\/p><p>  A business case for bilateral implants was developed with Beaumont Hospital and the HSE developed it in liaison with the hospital.  Such a programme would involve assessment, fitting and post-operative follow-up of simultaneous cochlear implants.  The business case also addresses how sequential second implants could be provided for the cohort of children who have received one implant and are assessed as suitable for a second.  This is a complex development and the HSE has engaged with many stakeholders.  It has also sought the support and advice of two UK experts in the development of the business case which outlines estimated requirements for the introduction of simultaneous bilateral cochlear implantation and sets out a number of options for how sequential implantation may be managed.  The programme will involve additional staff, equipment and capital works and be contingent on additional funding.  Estimates for the full cost of introducing a bilateral cochlear implantation programme for children are &euro;2.38 million.  This figure encompasses extra staff and non-pay costs.  The cost of providing a second implant for children who already have one is &euro;3.5 million to &euro;10.2 million.  The Minister of State committed to working to achieve this and finding the money somewhere.  Everything about the Government's record to date in this area follows on from this.  I am personally very committed to the cause and urge both the Minister and the Minister of State to work together to get the programme in place as an absolute priority.<\/p><p>  I join in the congratulations to and lauding of the Happy New Ear lobby group, although I have not met its members because I was away when they were in Leinster House meeting people.  We should stand in awe of such individuals and have nothing but respect for them as face this issue every day.  I am privileged to be a parent and have a background in primary teaching and both of these aspects give me an acute appreciation of how important this issue is.  I am unequivocally in favour of the bilateral cochlear implants issue being progressed and the work being done by the Government to achieve this objective.  I commend the Minister and hope he will keep up the pressure.  I appeal to Sinn F&eacute;in to be true to the cause it advocates by accepting the <i>bona fides<\/i> of the Government and accepting our position.  We must work together to achieve quick implementation of this programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700024#W00300","speaker":"971"},{"type":"speech","time":1382014200,"counter":579,"content":"<p>A cochlear implant is a highly sophisticated device which provides access to sound for people with severe to profound hearing loss.  The surgical implant device, when coupled with an external processor, can provide access to speech and everyday sound to aid or improve communication ability.  Beaumont Hospital is the centre for the delivery of Ireland's national cochlear implant programme, but surgical procedures for patients under six are carried out at the Children's University Hospital at Temple Street.  Since the programme commenced 17 years ago, more than 700 patients have received cochlear implants.<\/p><p>There are two aspects to the introduction of a bilateral cochlear implant programme.  Simultaneous cochlear implantation is the provision of clinically appropriate bilateral cochlear implants at the same time as a single surgical procedure.  Sequential cochlear implantation is the provision of bilateral implants separately, over a period of time.  With the introduction of a bilateral cochlear implantation programme, children who have already received one implant under the national cochlear implant programme will need to be assessed for candidacy for a potential second implant, and be provided with information about the advantages and disadvantages of a second implant.  The full-year cost of introducing simultaneous bilateral cochlear implantation for children has been estimated at &euro;2.38 million.  This estimate encompasses estimated additional staffing needs and additional non-pay costs.  In addition, there would be some capital costs associated with the expansion or enhancement of infrastructure, initially estimated at &euro;1 million.<\/p><p> There are a number of possible options with regard to the implementation of sequential bilateral cochlear implants for the cohort of children who already have one implant.  The cost of providing a second implant in this cohort is estimated to vary from &euro;3.5 million to &euro;10.2 million over the period of implantation, depending on the option chosen.  It is also important to note that it is not possible to be definitive about the level of uptake of a second sequential implant among this cohort.<\/p><p> A national clinical care programme for audiology has been put in place under the clinical strategy and programmes directorate.  A new national clinical head commenced in March 2013 and a panel of successful candidates was created to fill four new assistant head posts.<\/p><p> Permanent childhood hearing loss occurs at a rate of two to four per 1,000.  Children are entitled to HSE audiology services free of charge, including screening, investigation, treatment, rehabilitation and devices, speech and language therapy and referral of children with a hearing loss to a visiting teacher of the deaf services under the Department of Education and Skills.  In April 2011 the HSE national audiology review group published a report that identified some inconsistencies and shortcomings in audiology services throughout the country, including access issues, poor information, inadequate staffing levels, poor infrastructure and unacceptable waiting times.  It made recommendations for addressing these issues.  Audiology services require restructuring to place audiologists into fewer teams with larger clinical mass in order to deliver better clinical governance and efficient care pathways.  Some work has been initiated in this area, with &euro;3.7 million being made available in 2011 to begin implementation of the recommendations of the review group.  An additional &euro;1.9 million was made available in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700024#W00400","speaker":"1068","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382014800,"counter":581,"content":"<p>The Deputy must conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700025#X00200","speaker":"1021"},{"type":"speech","time":1382014800,"counter":582,"content":"<p>Universal newborn hearing screening, UNHS, is in place in the HSE south, Dublin mid-Leinster and Dublin north east regions.

This issue has been discussed in the House on a number of occasions and we will be glad to support the motion.  The health committee is considering the issue simultaneously and some of the Members who will contribute are attending the committee.  It will be worth people's while to stay for the full debate.<\/p><p>  The ongoing Happy New Ear campaign has continued for a very simple reason.  Empirical evidence exists to show that if they have a bilateral cochlear implant affected children can reach a fuller potential; that is why parents are campaigning on this issue.  The longer it takes to implement the programme to be put in place in Beaumont Hospital, the more children there will be who will not be able to reach their full potential.  The key issue is time.  We must ensure there is a rapid move to address the situation of children who have been given a single cochlear implant, especially those who are reaching the time when a sequential cochlear implant will no longer be beneficial.  Time is of the essence.  Whatever resources are made available, I urge that there be an acknowledgement that an assessment of those who immediately need such an implant must be done so that we do not allow them to slip into a life in which they are not able to hear as well as they might if they had received the second cochlear implant in good time.  For all these reasons, this is an urgent issue.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, announced last week that a proposal was being developed by the HSE in conjunction with Beaumont Hospital to roll out this plan.  Capital funding is required, along with funding for extra staff and resources, to put the plan in place.  I would be slow to congratulate or condemn anybody in this regard, but the reason the motion was tabled is that it is urgent.  As we speak, the HSE is drafting its national service plan for 2014.  If this programme is not included in that plan within the coming weeks, we will be back in this Chamber again next year and a cohort of children will not have been given the opportunity to reach and maximise their full potential.  We talk about cherishing children equally, about universal entitlement and about ensuring that those who are vulnerable are supported.  Here is a cohort of people for whom we could do a very great deal with small resources in the overall context of the benefit this procedure would have on their quality of life for the rest of their lives.  Time is significant and this is very important.<\/p><p>  Some 200 children would benefit from such a programme.  Their parents have campaigned in a dignified manner throughout.  They are the ones who know full well that evidence exists, nationally and internationally, to show that those children who receive simultaneous cochlear implants develop more quickly and to a fuller potential than those who receive a single implant.  Beaumont Hospital has done tremendous work and its new consultant in this area is promoting this plan.  We in this House must be honest, however, and point out that good sentiments, support and nice words must be aided with finance.  Things are scarce and it is a difficult time, but we cannot deny these children the fundamental right to which they are entitled.  We must urgently press for action.<\/p><p>  The Sinn F&eacute;in motion proposed by Deputy Adams is exceptionally timely.  We met the group Happy New Ear in an all-party approach and have been in contact with the HSE.  I raised the matter in a Topical Issue debate in June.  The business plan is to be submitted to the national service plan of the HSE, but that has to happen in the coming weeks.  That is the reason this motion must be supported on all sides of the House and why there must be a meaningful input on the part of the Department and the HSE in terms of resourcing the plan.  I urge the Minister to take this on board.  I know there has been strong commitment verbally, with tacit support on the Government side for the programme, but it is critical that we do not deny and delay further the implementation of a bilateral cochlear implant programme.  We must then immediately start to provide sequential implants, as there are children coming to the age at which it will no longer be of benefit to them to have a second implant - it will be too late for them when they reach the age of five, six or seven years.  It must be terrible for parents to watch time slip away and see their child not being able to develop to his or her fullest potential as he or she is entitled to under every basic tenet of decency we advocate in this House when we talk about giving everybody the opportunity to develop their full potential.<\/p><p>  I commend and endorse the motion.  We were very glad to support it when Deputy Adams asked us to put our names to it.  That is an unusual departure, but as a political party we were delighted to do this.  I urge the Government to come forward quickly with a commitment to write this programme into the service plan for 2013.  When we met the parents involved and the Happy New Ear people they were very understanding about the financial difficulties for the Government.<\/p><p>The group accepted that nothing could be done in 2013 because the service plan had already been drafted and that it must wait until 2014.  The members of the group were willing to wait until 2014, knowing that the longer they wait the less impact the implants would have on some children.  That is an indication of the dignified approach of the group on the issue.  Such dignity should be reciprocated with a financial commitment to ensure that at the very least those who are coming to a certain stage in their childhood development would get a second cochlear implant to allow them to reach their full potential.  I commend the motion and urge the Government to insist that next year&rsquo;s service plan make provision for bilateral cochlear implants and the full roll-out of the Beaumont audiology service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700025#X00700","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382015400,"counter":587,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this extremely important debate on what is, as my colleague has just outlined, such a time sensitive issue.  I am happy to support the motion and I compliment Sinn F&eacute;in on introducing it and ensuring there is a cross-party debate.  I compliment the families involved in the Happy New Ear campaign who have ensured this item has been kept on the political agenda.  The issue came to my attention last year while out knocking on doors in Mullingar.  I met Lorraine Murphy of the Happy New Ear campaign who explained articulately to me the issue that affects her daughter and many other children in the country.  She said that in April the implant her four year old daughter Anna had received two years previously failed and she was left in silence for five weeks, during which she was confused, frustrated and upset.  If she had had two implants she would have had a backup.  More important, there was a chance that following the re-implant she would have to learn her sounds from scratch again.  The family did not know until after the operation whether that would be the case.  The possibility was that every word Anna had learned to understand after many hours of work could be lost following the failure of the implant, which caused great anxiety and worry to the family.  Luckily, that was not the case and Anna quickly remembered all her sounds.  There would not have been any need for such concern if two implants had been inserted on day one.<\/p><p>  The families are to be commended.  They lobbied Deputies across all political parties and, at my request, appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  To be fair to the Minister, he met with a delegation, at which point he gave hope that the issue would be addressed as part of budget 2014 and included in the service plan.  My colleague, Deputy Kelleher, outlined how understanding the group has been.  It acknowledged that the Minister could not deal with the issue midway through 2013.  I am at a loss to understand why the Government has tabled an amendment to the Private Members' motion, instead of accepting it, making the resources available and outlining a clear and definitive timeframe for the implementation of a new cochlear implant policy.  All international evidence suggests that children who are profoundly deaf have a considerable advantage if they receive two cochlear implants instead of one.<\/p><p>  I wish to read into the record the benefits of bilateral implants as outlined in research carried out by St. Louis Children's Hospital, one of the premier children's hospitals in the world.<blockquote>Listening with two ears: This is an important listening mode which makes it easier for speech from both sides of the head to be heard and processed by the brain.<br \/><br \/>Hearing in noise: Hearing with two ears allows us the remarkable ability to &#8220;tune in&#8221; to someone we are trying to hear and understand when we are surrounded by background noise, which is usually the sound of other people talking!<br \/><br \/>Localization: Hearing with two ears is essential for humans and animals in identifying the direction of sounds.  The ability to localize sounds has obvious safety implications for a child or adult in that he\/she could hear someone calling out a warning or being able to tell from which direction a car is coming while crossing the street.<br \/><br \/>Binaural hearing offers more natural, balanced sound and can improve the &#8220;ease of listening&#8221; in the same way that vision in both eyes eases and improves the ability to see.  When there is hearing only in one ear, there are many challenging situations that can be frustrating. This frustration often leads to eventual social isolation, resulting in a poorer quality of life.  Research study subjects using bilateral hearing aids typically report sound to be clearer, fuller, more natural, and more balanced.<\/blockquote>  I accept that the times are economically difficult and targets must be achieved.  Speakers on the Government side of the House blame my party for the financial constraints while in the same breath they talk about new politics and working together to bring about positive and favourable solutions for the people who gave them the honour of representing them in this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700026#Y00200","speaker":"1065"},{"type":"speech","time":1382015400,"counter":588,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700026#Y00300","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1382015400,"counter":589,"content":"<p>The past three budgets were regressive and targeted the sick, the vulnerable, those less well-off and those who were disproportionately unable to take any hits.

Such a proposal was once advocated by the Labour Party.  If the Government had introduced a lid levy on the off-licence trade it would have yielded &euro;150 million in one year.

They cannot do it without resources.  The sum of &euro;18 million which is required to ensure the introduction of bilateral cochlear implants should be forthcoming from the Government in order to give the children that are affected the best start in life.  That would reduce the need for special needs assistants and ensure the children could reach their full potential.

I recognise that their drive has resulted in our providing time to discuss the issue today.  It is not the first time that the members of the group are in the House.  They met with the HSE in March and May.  They worked out a plan along with Beaumont Hospital so that they would be ready for this year&rsquo;s budget.

Now that that brilliant day has come for many people who suffer from deafness, the Government seems to think it is bad and some sort of burden.

If one examines the details, one cannot sit on the fence.  I urge the Government to consider the motion seriously and support the families in question.<\/p><p>  International best practice in treating children who are profoundly deaf is to provide bilateral cochlear implants.  Children in the State who are profoundly deaf are provided with only one implant.  The absence of a second implant creates problems for the children in discerning speech in noisy environments.  It is a race against time because the nerves to which implants are connected become more redundant every day and eventually die if they are not used.  Unless implants are connected in the earlier years - that is, at the age of seven or eight years - it is accepted that the operation will be ineffective.  That is the reality for the children concerned and their families.<\/p><p>  For me, the provision of cochlear implants is a human rights issue.  As said by a number of my colleagues, the estimated cost is in the region of &euro;12.8 million.  How dare the Government moan in the House about &euro;12.8 million when it spent &euro;14 million some Fridays ago on a referendum that nobody was really behind.  The Government spent &euro;14 million and now it cannot find &euro;12.8 million.<\/p><p>  The sterling work being done on this issue in Beaumont Hospital in my constituency is very important.  Today I call on the Government to ensure the proposed business plan by the HSE and Beaumont Hospital to introduce a bilateral cochlear implant programme is contained in the budget for 2014 and part of the HSE Estimates process for 2014.

The clinic is the same as that used for the children in question.  The adult is a lone parent with a child with special needs.  The kind of response that applies is very similar, irrespective of whether a child or an adult is involved.  Those responsible for the national cochlear implant programme wrote to me stating:<blockquote>The team understands and appreciates the significant difficulties those with bilateral profound hearing loss have, especially with limited access to speech using high powered hearing aids and little to no lip-reading skills [which clearly children will not have] ... Unfortunately, this is a very common thread among those currently under assessment for a cochlear implant.  Ideally, the CI team would like to limit the time from initial clinic assessment to cochlear implant surgery in order to provide rapid quality service to those people on this programme.  However, given current constraints, including finances, theatre time, testing facilities, and staffing levels, the team is not able to achieve this goal.  As this is a strictly publicly funded service we work within the means available to deliver a multidisciplinary service as best we can to those under assessment and the 700+ currently implanted CI users who are under this programme's care.<\/blockquote>The letter states the hospital is very sympathetic which, of course, it is, but it must be provided with the opportunity to be more than sympathetic.

The 2009 NICE guideline for best practice, in line with international best practice, was to provide a profoundly deaf child with two cochlear implants.  It is hard to see why this is not happening, especially when there is a time limit on when a cochlear implant can be successful.<\/p><p>The benefits to those children receiving two implants are well researched and documented.  On a practical level, if a child has one implant but there is a problem with it and it has to be taken out, the consequences for the child are very severe in that he or she is left totally deaf for that time.  Simultaneous implantation is the most efficient way forward, with both ears implanted in one surgical procedure.  It is also cost effective to do so.  Research indicates that bilaterally implanted children catch up with their hearing peers in terms of speech, language and communication skills much faster than unilaterally implanted children.  They also do not need the same level of speech and language support and resource teaching as those children with only one implant.<\/p><p> The introduction and roll out of the national neonatal hearing screening programme means that deaf children are presenting earlier, which is a huge step forward.  Providing two cochlear implants to these children would finish that work.  I listened to the Minister this morning talking about the bank guarantee and what we have to pay.  It is completely immoral and unethical for her to say that this is a Government priority and &euro;12 million for deaf children is not.

In the clip, the boy's mother is holding him as his ear implant is activated and when she says hello to him, he flashes his mother a huge smile.  To watch both the child's and the mother's reaction as he hears sound for the first time is truly humbling.  That clip was recorded in 2008 and has been viewed by millions of people all over the world.  It is such a wonderful example of medical science to see it in action.  I urge all Government Deputies today to go back to their offices, turn on their computers, watch that clip and then come back and make a decision as to how they will vote on this motion.<\/p><p>  The current long waiting time for cochlear implantation means that Irish children and their parents are missing out on something that many of us take for granted - speaking time.  These children suffered a random natural injury that puts limitations on their lives but medical science came up with a solution.  It is horrifying that the State places more emphasis on bailing out bankers and bondholders than it does on giving hearing back to Irish children.<\/p><p>  Hearing impairment has a significant impact on language development.  Scientists have pointed out that there is a sensitive period during which language develops.  This period should coincide with the implantation of two cochlear implants to maximise a child's ability to acquire language.  This was brought to the attention of the House a few months ago by the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in, Deputy Adams.  At that time, the Taoiseach made all sorts of complimentary remarks about Beaumont Hospital.  He spoke about how sad it was that this was happening and how something should be done about it.  Deputy Flanagan spoke about people who are blind but if we found a cure for blindness, would we seriously say to people, &quot;We have a cure but we will only put the sight back in one eye?&quot;  It is outrageous.  What the Government is doing is appalling and it is very offensive to the families of children who are affected by this condition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700028#AA00200","speaker":"1094"},{"type":"speech","time":1382016600,"counter":601,"content":"<p>A lot of valid points have been made and I compliment the movers of this motion.

They must understand that it should not always be about showing the white flag and licking up to the troika.  We must look after the personal needs of a small number of children.  We must give them the chance and an equal opportunity to live their lives to the full.  They must be given these implants soon because there is only a certain amount of time during which implantation is successful.  The fact that the State is currently only providing one implant to these children is shameful.  This will cost &euro;12 million but the Government wasted &euro;14 million on a pet project, an ego-trip for the Taoiseach.  I urge the Taoiseach to come off his high horse, eat some humble pie, listen to the people and show some humanity and common decency.

I first became aware of the need for bilateral cochlear implants for severely or profoundly deaf children, particularly those under five, when a parent in Offaly contacted me last March.  She invited me to meet the newly-formed Happy New Ear lobby group, which I was delighted to do and we discussed the issues involved.  Since then I have been in regular contact with the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, and on all occasions have received very positive responses from them.  Indeed, they met the group on several occasions this year, most recently in July.  I wish to acknowledge the work done by the Happy New Ear group in assisting HSE personnel in the development and planning of the business case proposal to introduce a bilateral cochlear implant programme in Ireland.  I know as a parent that when one has a child with special needs, one's focus is totally on that child.  For the parents of these children to be able to come together as a group is commendable and I congratulate them for their efforts.<\/p><p>  While I know there is naturally a degree of impatience, tremendous progress has been made this year.  The group must also be acknowledged for the work it has done in enlightening us all.  When one has a family that does not have these needs, one's focus is in a totally different direction.  The work the group has done in enlightening us all must be commended.<\/p><p>  In 2009, the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended simultaneous bilateral cochlear implantation for children.  The institute was clear in defining the urgency and essential nature of this surgery.  It is well known that the surgery is most successful when carried out on children under five because the brain interprets sound more effectively in the first few years of life.  There is worldwide evidence showing that the surgery is most suitable and effective for children who are born deaf or whose hearing has deteriorated to the level of being profoundly or severely deaf.  As with all surgery, there are risks but the outcomes are marvellous.  For example, children's listening skills improve for many years, their speech and language development is greatly improved and most important of all, the sense of isolation that those who have hearing difficulties experience is greatly reduced.  The children are able to hear for the first time and live with the benefits of that, which all of us who have been blessed with hearing can appreciate.  We can only imagine how restricted life is for those with hearing problems.<\/p><p>  Since the national audiology review group reported in 2011, there is now a clear blueprint for the delivery of all audiology services, including cochlear implantation.  The group's report has a recommendation for funding simultaneous bilateral cochlear implantation for children.  I am glad to note that the national clinical care programme for audiology has been established and that newborn hearing screening is now in place in all but one HSE region.  The roll out of the screening programme will be completed this year.  Currently recruitment of audiology staff is taking place, which I welcome.  I also welcome the fact that the HSE has sponsored ten students to pursue a master's degree in audiology in the UK.  The lack of specialists in this field was highlighted by Ms Laura Viani, the ENT surgeon and head of the department of audiology at Beaumont Hospital at a presentation I attended recently.  She made the point that this is not something that has only been highlighted this year.  In fact, she has been campaigning for this for many years and finally, this year, attention is being paid to it.  <\/p><p>  It is important to note that the HSE's audiology services are free of charge.  However, there were shortcomings in the service and the Happy New Ear group has worked closely with the HSE to improve the service.  It has made recommendations on restructuring the service and these will definitely result in a better service for patients.  One of the most welcome developments in the ongoing efforts of the Department and the HSE is the signing of the memorandum of understanding between DeafHear, HSE audiology, HSE speech and language therapy, Beaumont cochlear implant team and the visiting teacher service so that a much more cohesive service can be provided to those children who need it.<\/p><p>Up to six hospitals, including Tullamore hospital, have commenced the bone anchoring hearing aid programme for both adult and paediatric cases.<\/p><p> The Government&rsquo;s commitment to children is clearly outlined by the fact that for the first time ever there is a full-time Minister for Children and Youth Affairs at Cabinet.  The new children&rsquo;s hospital is a priority for the Government with &euro;450 million in funding allocated from the Exchequer and &euro;200 million coming from the sale of the national lottery.  The sooner we see progress in its construction, the better.<\/p><p> I hate when one has to make a business case for a service that is a profound need for people.  Unfortunately, in these times one has to count every euro and cent.  I am hopeful the business case, developed with the HSE in conjunction with Beaumont Hospital, the many stakeholders such as the Happy New Ear group and the UK experts in this field, will provide us with a plan for ensuring delivery of this service.<\/p><p> It is difficult when one hears terms such as &ldquo;resource constraints&rdquo; and &ldquo;unhealthy budgetary and fiscal conditions&rdquo;.  However, I urge the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to prioritise this matter.  For many years it was not seen as a priority, as evidenced by Dr Laura Viani.  There is now a commitment to help the parents and the wonderful children who deserve our support, however.  I hope the efforts of the Ministers, the Happy New Ear group and the marvellous parents will bear fruition to allow our services in this area catch up with other countries and give young people an opportunity to have this operation at an early and sensitive stage for their benefit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700028#AA00500","speaker":"1099","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382017200,"counter":604,"content":"<p>Earlier, I was struck by the openness and frankness of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, in dealing with this issue.

In Britain, the authorities recommend simultaneous bilateral cochlear implants as the best option for children.  For those with one implant already, however, it is recommended they should have an additional implant only if it is considered to be of sufficient benefit to the recipient.  It is advised a full and frank discussion should take place between the recipient and their parents or carers.  This would initiate a programme of a pre-assessment, operation and fitting, and post-operative care.  It also would outline how secondary implants could be provided to the children who have had one implant already and have already been assessed.<\/p><p>  The proposal the HSE is following outlines the estimated requirements for the introduction of a simultaneous bilateral cochlear implantation programme and sets out how the sequential implantation may be managed.  This proposal will involve the recruitment of extra staff, the purchasing of equipment and further building works and will be dependent on additional funding being made available.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, stated earlier she is making this her priority.

I recall that one parent in the group told me that having the two implants had profoundly transformed her daughter&rsquo;s life for the better.  It is indisputable that this service has to be introduced.  There has been delay upon delay in introducing the service, going back to the time when we were told the country was rich.  It is a source of frustration for some of the parents whose children did not get the service at that time, as well as adults.  However, the HSE has put down a blueprint for the provision of a proper and full bilateral cochlear implantation service.<\/p><p>These people and their families deserve nothing less than that.<\/p><p> I do not want to go over issues to which speakers on both sides of the House have referred.  The argument is conclusive.  I referred to the review the HSE published in 2011.  The Department allocated &euro;3.7 million for the service in 2011 and &euro;2 million this year.

It is for all of us, but we on the Government side will take seriously our responsibility to advance this and put in place a service that meets these families' needs.  It must be done and I will support the advancement of such a service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700029#BB01200","speaker":"1038","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382017800,"counter":616,"content":"<p>This time last year I had no idea what bilateral cochlear implants were.  Now, 12 months on, I have no excuse.  I know exactly what they are, what is involved in getting them and what they mean to the many children who, sadly, have heretofore been denied the prospect of obtaining the ability to hear like most of the rest of us.  This challenge was first brought to my attention by the local media in Drogheda, after which I contacted the Connor family, who will not mind being mentioned.  Earlier in the debate Deputy Adams referenced a number of people he had been in contact with.  The Connor family have a son, Alex, who, like hundreds of other children across the country, needs the kinds of intervention that are in this motion and the amendment.<\/p><p>  As the House will be aware, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, hosted a very constructive meeting with the Happy New Ear group officials and experts in audiology services in her office last May.  It was clear to me from that meeting that Deputy Lynch and her officials have a very real awareness and understanding of the requirements of the children involved.  We have reached a stage at which that awareness and understanding must be translated into real and concrete action.  All international medical evidence points to bilateral cochlear implants being best practice in terms of patient outcome and, ultimately, long-term costs and efficiency in the health service.  That important point should not be lost on the many people who see the cost of everything and the value of nothing.<\/p><p>  For the patient, bilateral implants offer a vastly improved experience in hearing quality, not just range and volume but also the ability to discern and filter different sounds.  We all take spatial awareness for granted when we cross a road or hear someone call our name.  That is very severely limited if only one implant is used.  The effect was described to me as being like the loss of perceived depth when one loses an eye.  On the medical front, the active nerve endings needed for cochlear implants will die if not stimulated during cortical development, leaving possible future technology futile.  It is not always possible to select the better ear for the implant.  We should never depend on guesswork, no matter how informed it might be.<\/p><p>  One of the most compelling arguments for bilateral implants is the possibility of device failure.  The impact of that was described to us in earlier presentations by the excellent Happy New Ear group.  This technology produces seemingly miraculous results, but technology sometimes fails.  We all know that.  When members of the campaign group visited the D&aacute;il some months ago one of the parents told us a very compelling and emotive story.  Her child had been happily playing with the type of noisy toy beloved of all children and seemingly designed to drive parents mad.  The child said the toy was broken, holding it up in the expectation all children have that mammies and daddies can fix everything.  The toy was not broken.  It continued to whistle, buzz and shriek as these toys do.  The implant was broken and the small child, with no understanding or explanation, had been plunged back into a world of silence.<\/p><p>  There are some things mammies and daddies cannot fix.  There are many things only we in this House, and in this Administration, can fix.  The system as it pertains to these children is not working and we have the power to fix it.  It is so very important for the children concerned, their parents and the Happy New Ear group that the HSE national services plan to be developed over the next few weeks reflects the excellent, very strong and robust case made by the experts and families in recent months.  I congratulate the families on the level of engagement they have had with public representatives across the political spectrum, the impact they have had on HSE and Department of Health officials and the Ministers, Deputies Reilly and Kathleen Lynch, who will do their utmost to ensure the things we in this House want to see happening are made happen in the HSE's national service plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700030#CC00200","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"speech","time":1382017800,"counter":617,"content":"<p>The key issue is that this is a race against time.  We should have that focus when we make decisions.  It is the difference between a child retaining his or her hearing and losing it.  We must act on that.  It is unacceptable for families to leave this debate unsure what will happen.  I listened to the speech of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and there are some positive things in it for the families.  She talked about a model of care for paediatrics nationally.  She also talked about the objective of the right child, the right place and the right time.  Is anybody going to tell the families in the Gallery that their child is not the right child, that they do not live in the right place, that this country is not the right place for them or that it is not the right time?  The time is now.  We need to make this decision.<\/p><p>  Speakers have said this technology is life-changing for these children, so what is the argument against it?  The argument is that it will cost &euro;18,000 to &euro;20,000.  The money for this is in the Irish economy.  Does it mean we have to tax somebody else who has the money?  Why can we not do that?  It is about choices.  Society disables, and that is what is happening here.  Some people said this was being turned into a political issue.  Politics and politicians have failed these 200 families.  There is a responsibility on all of us in the House to move this forward.  The point of today's motion is to try to move it across the line.  It is a political issue and must be tackled by politicians in here.<\/p><p>  We have heard the argument that the provision of only one implant limits a child's ability to distinguish where noises are coming from and to hear in busy or noisy places such as shopping centres and classrooms.  That is key.<\/p><p>Hearing is a vital sense for all, but we continue to work against best international practice and limit many children's ability to reach their full potential and communicate with others.  This is what the argument is about.  This is the right thing to do and would be good for the child and society.  It would create conditions that would allow children to reach their full potential.  No matter what people say, there is no argument against this.  The old argument is made that it cannot be done at this time, that we must wait another while or that the Government will look at the issue or that a move might be made on it next year.  That is not good enough for these families.  It is unfair to put people through this situation.  I believe this is an issue that can be sorted out by politicians.  If Members are as concerned as they say they are, we can move forward on it.<\/p><p> Many years ago, during my first term as a Member of the House, I had responsibility as spokesperson on a number of portfolios.  I recall being invited to attend an annual general meeting of the Irish Deaf Society in the Aisling hotel in Dublin.  I attended that meeting and was told I was the first Deputy who had ever turned up to an annual general meeting of the society.  I do not know if that is true, but it is what I was told.  I was shocked to hear that no politician had ever officially turned up to its annual general meeting.  The people in the Irish Deaf Society have found their voice now and the families here representing their children have gathered together on this campaign.  It is not acceptable for people to come in and vote against this motion.  This is the right thing to do.  People need to look into their hearts and decide what is the right thing to do.<\/p><p> Speakers have talked about their motivations.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, spoke about what motivated her involvement in politics.  This is an issue that should motivate all of us.  If we cannot make a decision on this today, we must work collectively and come up a solution that will give some ray of hope to these families and their children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700030#CC00300","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382018400,"counter":619,"content":"<p>I would like to comment on the response of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to the opening remarks from Sinn F&eacute;in.  Her departure from her prepared speech was encouraging and showed a certain amount of emotion and feeling.  This was far different from her prepared speech, which was probably written by a faceless civil servant, lacked emotion and contained statistics and so forth.  I welcome the fact that she departed from it and that she has indicated a commitment down the road on this issue, although we will argue that is not good enough.<\/p><p>  As others have pointed out in this debate, the current practice in this State of implanting just one implant, for those fortunate to be approved for treatment, is out of step with what is regarded as best practice in other countries.  The medical evidence is that this does not fully address the hearing problems of the children concerned.  It has been found that the provision of only one implant limits a child's ability to distinguish where noises come from.  It also fails to address fully their lack of ability to distinguish other voices in busy or noisy places like shopping centres and classrooms.  This is similar to the experience of many adults who have hearing difficulties and is obviously not a solution to the problem, which clearly requires that the children concerned are given two implants rather than one.<\/p><p>  For those who receive just one implant, the sort of problems I have described regarding their ability to distinguish voices adds considerably to the difficulties that school-going children experience in a classroom setting.  If children cannot hear what is going on in a classroom and are unable to hear what a teacher is saying, it will severely impact on their ability to keep up with what is being taught and may lead to educational disadvantage that will persist throughout their schooling.  It will also potentially hamper their communication with other pupils and, therefore, have a detrimental impact on their social as well as educational development if they are unable to fully participate in social interaction with their fellow pupils.  Of course, this would also have an impact on any children with this issue who may wish to participate in sport, as the failure to fully address the problem through the provision of bilateral implants will affect their ability to hear what is going on within a sporting context.<\/p><p>  The testimony of the families of the children concerned makes their plight apparent.  On their Facebook page, parents describe their joy and indeed gratitude over their child having received one implant.  Some of them describe it as their children's first step into the world of hearing and recognise the huge difference an implant makes to the child's life.  However, they also describe their frustration at the problems encountered by the same children because they only have one implant, who therefore still exhibit some confusion in their day to day activities.  Their condition, while undoubtedly improved, is not unlike the situation and frustrations encountered by adults who are starting to experience hearing difficulties. <\/p><p>  In September 1961, my mother, who was in her mid 30s then, woke up one morning totally deaf.  This was during the harvest season and she worked that day and the next without any treatment.  Eventually, she ended up in Limerick Regional Hospital and after treatment she regained partial hearing with the help of a hearing aid.  What I remember most after that time is the frustration experienced by my mother in trying to pick up what was being said by other people because she had so little hearing.  I also remember the frustration experienced by myself, my brother and our family in trying to communicate with her and, sometimes, the lack of tolerance towards my mother in that regard.  That was a long time ago, but ironically I wear two hearing aids today.  I hope people show me more tolerance than was forthcoming at that time.<\/p><p>  A recurring analogy employed by the parents is that addressing the problem through one implant is like addressing blindness by providing one eye.  It may be argued by some that the number of children who are affected by this issue is small and, therefore, it is not something that ought to be prioritised.  Currently within the State there are in the region of 200 children in this situation.  They would benefit greatly from the introduction of a bilateral cochlear implant programme.  Because the number of children concerned is small, the cost of ensuring that they all receive bilateral cochlear implants would be relatively small.  It would represent only a drop in the ocean in terms of the overall health budget.  However, it would be money well spent in addressing the plight of the children concerned and the difficulties faced by those children and their families.<\/p><p>  There is an onus on all elected representatives to do the right thing and what we think is best.  If we can make life more tolerable for the parents, families and friends of unfortunate children born into this situation by making money available from a budget, this will make a huge difference to their lives.  These implants can ensure they develop social interaction skills, give them the opportunity to have a full education and enable them to have a life of communication by sound with their families, friends and everybody else.  If we only do this and nothing else, we will be doing a good job as elected representatives.  The onus of responsibility lies with all of us, but in particular with the Government.  While I accept the sincerity of the Minister of State regarding the plight of these children, there is an onus of responsibility on her and the Government to ensure we address the issue collectively.  <\/p><p>  I urge everybody to support the principle and the merits of this motion because we on this side of the House are trying to make life better for unfortunate children who have not had a chance.  We can give them that chance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700031#DD00200","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speech","time":1382018400,"counter":620,"content":"<p>While I am happy to be here and welcome the families of deaf children to the House today, I do not know why we are still here dealing with this, because it is an issue that should have been sorted out years ago.  I confess, to my shame, that it was only when I attended a briefing hosted by Deputy Adams here in July that I got an insight into cochlear implantation and the case being made for children to be given bilateral implants.  I did not realise that children were refused a double implant and were only given one.<\/p><p>The briefing was given by Dr. Laura Viani, who is the surgeon with the cochlear implant programme in Beaumont Hospital.  She is the person who performs the operation that gives hearing to the children concerned.  One could see the esteem in which she is held, and the gratitude expressed for the treatment received by the children was apparent from the fact that many of the parents of children in need of bilateral cochlear implants also attended the briefing.  These are the parents pressing the Government to introduce a programme to ensure their children receive bilateral implants.  This is considered to be a Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members' motion, but it is not; it is that of the parents and families.  I trust the Minister will listen to the debate and, more importantly, pay heed to the genuine case being made in support of bilateral cochlear implants for the 200 children concerned.  It is not a number that would sway a marginal constituency.  To date, the Minister has indicated that he supports the creation of such a programme at Beaumont Hospital, as has the HSE, but he continues to point to resource constraints.  Yesterday, when I spoke briefly on the budget, I stated that this was unacceptable when it comes to the health needs of the most vulnerable in society.<\/p><p> One of the most striking points made by Dr. Viani was about the need to perform the procedure when the children are young enough to take advantage of it.  She pointed out that if it was not performed before the child had reached the age of eight the operation would not work.  After this age, children who have lived all their lives in silence will never learn how to speak.  We do not have the luxury of time.  One can state with regard to most issues that we will examine them next year, and that is fine, but we do not have the luxury of time on this.  If it is deferred for a year children will not be able to hear or speak.<\/p><p> Dr. Viani also stressed the need for two implants rather than one, and compared the provision of single implants to providing glasses with only one lens.  With regard to funding, she claimed that because of the high costs associated with a lifetime of support to a person who cannot hear, a cost-benefit analysis would fall in favour of providing double implants.  The medical evidence in support of bilateral cochlear implants is clear.  An expert in the area, Dr. Litovsky, wrote a paper which provided evidence not only of benefits in the form of enhanced hearing, particularly in noisy environments, but also social and personal developmental benefits to the individuals who have had this treatment.  Dr. Viani also referred to the greatly enhanced language learning capacity of people who have been provided with bilateral rather than individual implants.  She even claims that understanding what is being said and memory retention are enhanced because less effort must go into actually taking in what is being said, as opposed to comprehending and processing what is being said.<\/p><p> On a human level, the most significant evidence is the fact the vast majority of bilateral implant users report substantial improvements in the quality of their everyday life.  They may sound like small things to us, but they include being able to hold a proper conversation; taking part in work; being able to hear what is happening at meetings; being able to distinguish separate conversations in noisy locations, such as the D&aacute;il often is; and being better and more safely able to drive.  There is a compelling case in favour of providing the children in need of this procedure with the means to ensure they have a proper quality of life, and money ought not be an issue.<\/p><p> Yesterday when speaking on the budget I stated that I recognised that most people in political parties were decent and honourable and had come into politics for all the right reasons - to help those whom we represent.  There really is only one honourable thing the Government can do with this motion.  There is only one decent thing Government backbenchers can do with the motion.  I do not care who claims the credit for it.  Give the credit to the parents of the children who need the procedure and do not give the credit to Sinn F&eacute;in, but do the right thing.  We can immeasurably improve the quality of life of deaf children and their families if we immediately authorise the fitting of bilateral implants instead of the current mean-spirited and uncaring practice of fitting one.  I ask Deputies to imagine it were their child or grandchild.  Would they consider it decent that he or she should go from hearing to deafness because of the failure of a single implant?  What a prospect.  None of us would want it for our children or grandchildren.  Would we consider it decent that our children or grandchildren could not listen to and enjoy beautiful music?  We would not.  I ask all Deputies to do the right thing.  If we cannot and will not do the right thing now, we have lost more than economic sovereignty; we have lost our soul, our compassion and our decency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700031#DD00300","speaker":"1083","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382019000,"counter":622,"content":"<p>I welcome the parents from the Happy New Ear campaign in the Visitors' Gallery, the medics at Beaumont Hospital and, particularly, the irrepressible and legendary Dr. Viani, who not only does her medical work but has been so much a part of the campaign.<\/p><p>  This is not a party political issue and it should not be a political issue at all.  The fact that Sinn F&eacute;in has introduced the motion is a detail.  What people need to focus on is the content of the motion.  It makes three statements which are uncontested.  It recognises that bilateral cochlear implants are the best approach for a deaf child.  It is the necessary intervention to give hearing to children who are deaf.  It also states, which has not been contested in the D&aacute;il, that because of the development of the auditory nerve there is a window of opportunity to make the intervention for small children and this window closes at approximately the age of eight.  It also states that the costs envisaged in giving second cochlear implants to approximately 200 children are modest.  In recent days we have spoken about hundreds of millions and billions of euros.  Decisions on sums of money of this magnitude have been debated in the D&aacute;il and decisions have been proposed.  In the case of these children, we are looking at a potential spend of approximately &euro;12 million or perhaps &euro;13 million, and even the Minister has conceded that all of these moneys do not have to be found up-front.<\/p><p>  We find ourselves in a very bizarre situation in which the Government and the Opposition - Independents, Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party - all recognise that the children need bilateral implants, that a clock is ticking for them, and that the costs involved are modest.  Anybody with an ounce of common sense would look in and wonder why a debate is even under way on the matter.  Why does it take a D&aacute;il debate for an uncontested matter to be sorted out?<\/p><p>I am disturbed by the term &quot;business case&quot;, which has featured in the discussions today.  I appreciate absolutely that, in the spending of any taxpayers' money, there has to be a plan and accountability, and there cannot be waste.  However, I am greatly troubled that we have to make a business case for the health of our children.  It bothers me, and it would really anger me, if I were the mother of a deaf child, to hear that a business case had to be presented, picked over and approved to allow for my child what is a fundamental health intervention and a fundamental right, namely, the right to hear.<\/p><p> I am not a medical expert but I am a mother.  I remember, when my second child was born, that at one stage there was some query about the quality of his hearing.  Subsequently everything was fine for my son, but I remember the kind of panic we had at the time in bringing our new child home, and the worry that there might be some difficulty with the child's hearing.  It is worthwhile for all of us to put ourselves in the shoes of parents who bring their new babies home in the knowledge or to discover that the child has profound hearing issues and deafness.  Today's debate is not about politics; it is about decency and humanity.  It is not about looking for gratitude from children or their parents; it is about doing what we are elected to do.  To my way of thinking, if we cannot pass a motion on which all of us in this D&aacute;il agree, and which will provide such a transformation in the lives of hundreds of children, I wonder why we are here.<\/p><p> The Minister, Deputy Reilly, has a very big budget to manage.  He has to make big savings and in some cases big cuts, he tells us, but this is a modest sum of money.  I do not believe for a second that the Minister wants the 200 children who could avail of this second implant to go without that.  I have no doubt that Members in government have their frustrations from time to time, and I have no doubt that some of us on the other side of the House are very often the source of those frustrations.  However, what they on the other side have that we do not have is the ability to finally take the decision and to give the instruction to the system to do the right thing.  I envy them that.  I can tell them, if it were my call or the call of any of my colleagues, financial constraints or not, budgetary concerns or not - dare I say it, health overspend or not - the &euro;12 million needed for capital expenditure, resourcing and staffing to make sure these children get their second implants would be found, whether we have to beg or borrow.  I recommend that to the Minister.  I say to him and his colleague, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, that whatever other priorities or concerns emerge, they must not let the opportunity of the HSE service plan go without an allocation to put things right, in as much as we can put them right for these hundreds of children.<\/p><p> I know many Members have had correspondence from parents.  I received correspondence yesterday from a mother, who wrote:<blockquote>My daughter is just three.  She has her implant a year and it has been amazing to go through all the firsts - hearing her say &quot;Mama&quot;, &quot;Dada&quot; and learn to understand what we say to her. ... A cochlear implant truly is a miracle of modern technology.  We are so grateful for it.  A second implant would give our daughter better quality sound, localisation, better hearing, so she can appreciate music, and focus on sound in noisy situations and block out the background noise.<\/blockquote>We need to block out the background noise.  We need to forget about party politics.  We need to forget about politics entirely and focus on this group of children.  I urge the Minister to do the right thing.  If he does not do it, I am absolutely certain that the parents in the Visitors' Gallery are not going anywhere, because, like any parent, they will stand their ground and fight to get what their children so richly deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700032#EE00200","speaker":"1008","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382019600,"counter":624,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak about the very valuable work that is under way in audiology services and the national cochlear implant programme.  I am aware that since the cochlear implant programme commenced at Beaumont Hospital, more than 700 patients have received cochlear implants.  I also know that the programme does much more than provide surgical services.  It also provides an assessment service to potential candidates and a rehabilitative service to those who are actually implanted.<\/p><p>  While the programme has provided single implants to date, it is now considered best practice worldwide that children should have bilateral cochlear implants, and I do not believe there is any disagreement about that.  I was very pleased to meet with the group Happy New Ear in July of this year and again today, and to hear from them at first hand about this issue.  I know that Happy New Ear also met with the national clinical care programme in audiology on two occasions this year, as well as with my colleague the, Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who spoke earlier.<\/p><p>  As the Minister of State has already outlined, the HSE, with Beaumont Hospital, has developed a proposal to introduce a bilateral cochlear implant programme in Ireland.  I welcome the fact that, in developing this proposal, the HSE had input from Happy New Ear and other stakeholders.  It is also very important to note that the proposal drew on the input of two UK experts who were engaged to advise on how to make progress on this complex development.  A bilateral cochlear implant programme will involve the assessment, fitting and post-operative follow-up of simultaneous cochlear implants.  The proposal also outlines a number of options for a sequential programme - that is, the provision of second implants to children who have already received one implant and who are assessed as being suitable for a second.<\/p><p>  The introduction of a bilateral cochlear implant programme - both simultaneous and sequential - will obviously be dependent on the availability of additional funding.  As people will be aware, yesterday's budget saw the announcement of the Health Estimates.  Once again, 2014 will be a very challenging year for the health service.  I am pleased to have been able to prioritise children's health care with the commencement of free GP care for children aged five years and younger.  I believe this measure will ensure better medical outcomes for children and more treatment taking place in the community rather than in hospitals.  I also want to note that my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, reconfirmed the Government's commitment to make up to &euro;200 million available from the sale of the national lottery licence for the new children's hospital.  This capital project is an absolute priority for me and for the Government.  The new building is one side of the equation; the services for children, and the people who deliver them, make up the other.  That is why I have established a children's hospital group, the board of which includes members from both within and outside paediatric health care, which brings new and different perspectives and insights from outside the world of health care to join with the expertise and experience of those from within that world.  I very much welcome the fact that the three paediatric hospitals themselves are committed to coming together and that work is under way on integrating services across the three hospitals.<\/p><p>  As I conclude, I must reiterate there is no question but that the 2014 budget for the health sector represents the greatest challenge the health sector has ever faced.  Full details will be worked out, worked through and set out in the HSE's national service plan, which must be submitted to me in early November.<\/p><p>Knowing the challenges ahead, it is important to be clear that the resources needed for the introduction of a bilateral cochlear implant programme, and indeed any service development, must be considered in the context of the service plan and in the context of my over-riding priorities of quality and, in particular, patient safety.<\/p><p> In conclusion, much as the Deputies opposite might wish to stand in my shoes today, the choices we have had to make in this budget have not been easy.  Some of them have been very hard and some of them have resulted in things such as the prescription charge, which is not the direction in which I believe our health service should be going.  However, our country is in the hands of others as regards our finances, so we are anxious to exit this bailout and get our financial sovereignty back.  I must make choices about this very sensitive issue, which is a priority for me, and other matters such as screening for diabetic retinopathy, which can cause irreversible blindness if not detected early.  There are no easy choices, but this issue will be one of my top priorities.  I look forward to the opportunity of having that priority expressed in the national service plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700033#FF00200","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1382020200,"counter":626,"content":"<p>I listened carefully to the Minister's contribution on this issue.  The fact is that children in the State who receive cochlear implants only receive one, and will still only receive one after the Minister's comments today, rather than the two which the Minister admitted is best practice in other countries.<\/p><p>  The provision of cochlear implants for children is an issue of fundamental rights.  Children not only have the right to be heard but also the right to hear.  It is a race against time as the auditory nerves to which the implants are connected become more redundant every day and will eventually die if they are not being used.  According to Dr. Viani, the surgeon with the cochlear implant programme in Beaumont Hospital, unless these implants are connected in the early years, by the age of seven or eight years the operation will be ineffective.  After that, children born and raised in silence will never speak, and that is a huge difficulty that has an adverse impact on the rest of their lives.<\/p><p>  The cost of a single implant is between &euro;18,000 and &euro;20,000.  The provision of only one implant limits a child's ability to distinguish where noises are coming from and limits their ability to hear in busy or noisy places such as shopping centres, classrooms and urban environments.<\/p><p>  We wish to ensure that all children fully participate in our society.  This motion is about ensuring that these 200 children can do that.  Children who are deaf require greater educational support and special care packages and often suffer serious psychiatric problems and depression later.  They also have difficulty getting work.  With cochlear implants they can make a positive contribution to society and find it easier to get employment and fully participate in society.  There is not only a moral argument for this, but also an economic argument.  Obviously, it should be the least important one, but there is an economic argument for ensuring these children have two implants.  Having only one implant can seriously limit their ability to reach their full potential and to communicate with others.  For the sake of &euro;18,000 per child we could have 200 more fully engaged, active and participating citizens.<\/p><p>  I know money must be found somewhere.  If we reduced the salaries of those with the highest incomes at the top of the public sector and the health services, we might find money to provide these implants.  There are 200 children who would benefit from this.  Some of their parents have formed a campaign group, some of whose members are in the Visitors' Gallery, to ensure this programme is established as a matter of urgency.  I applaud and commend them on their Happy New Ear campaign and for continuing to raise and keep this issue on the political agenda on behalf of their children.  Somebody must speak up for their children.<\/p><p>  The Government has the solution.  The problem is that as the child grows the nerves to which the implant should be connected die if they are not being used.  The hope of a further implant is lost.  However, this is an issue that can be resolved.  The solution exists and is best practice in other states in the developed world.  The amount of money involved is relatively small, even in these straitened times.  If the political will exists, we should be able to do this.<\/p><p>  I will leave the last word to one of the parents.<blockquote>Please meet our little boy Alex.  He is three years old and profoundly deaf.  On the third of October 2012 he was blessed to have a cochlear implant in Beaumont hospital under the great care of Dr. Laura Viani and Dr. Walsh.  Since that day we are on a long journey to help him listen and distinguish sounds.  His whole little life he has struggled with life due to not hearing.  Now he has begun to hear but only one cochlear implant is just not enough.  He finds it hard to locate where sounds are coming from and every day we see his confusion when he hears something and cannot work out where it is.  There is a solution to this.  Bilateral implantation is proven to minimise these problems and all over Europe and the USA it is standard practice to implant both ears, but not in Ireland.  Funding has not been made available.  It seems ridiculous because if someone was blind and they could operate to fix it, would they only do one eye?<\/blockquote>Those are the words of Amie and Roger Connor talking about their child, Alex.<\/p><p>  I appeal to the Minister to do the right thing.  Allow these children to develop and grow to become full members of society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700034#GG00200","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1382020200,"counter":627,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le gach Teachta a ghlac p&aacute;irt sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht t&aacute;bhachtach seo.

I believe this is an issue on which there is agreement.  The outstanding matter is whether there is the political will to do it now.  We must all come together on that and ensure the decision is made to do it now.  I especially acknowledge and thank the Happy New Ear campaign and the parents of children requiring bilateral cochlear implants who have joined us in the Visitors' Gallery for this debate.  I wish they had not been obliged to be here again today and that we did not have to address again this very important issue.<\/p><p>  We hope this debate and sincere appeal to the Government will mark a very significant step towards the early and full achievement of these families' goal, which is the gift of hearing for their children and for countless other children who will require bilateral cochlear implants in Ireland in the future.  Many complex and complicated issues come before the D&aacute;il each week, none more so than the budget that was announced on Tuesday.  However, this is a very straightforward and simple issue.  It is not complicated or complex.  There are no conflicting arguments about the benefits of bilateral cochlear implants, and the Minister has acknowledged that.  Children need this operation and they need it now.  This is the emphasis of my closing appeal to the Minister.  Unquestionably, this decision must be taken now.<\/p><p>  I regret that the Minister for Health did not accept the motion but chose to amend it.  I will deal now with that amendment.  The first part restates the current position regarding audiology and quite rightly commends the work being done in Beaumont Hospital on cochlear implants for both children and adults.  The last part of the Minister&rsquo;s amendment is apparently irrelevant as it talks about the new national children&rsquo;s hospital and the national clinical programme in paediatrics and neonatology.  I say &quot;apparently irrelevant&quot; on purpose, because I have a serious concern at the presence of those points in the amendment, points which the Minister repeated in his short contribution a few moments ago.<\/p><p>I hope it is not being suggested by him in a subtextual way that the provision of bilateral cochlear implants for children might have to await the completion of the new national children's hospital, as that would be totally unacceptable.  The substance of his amendment recognises that the report of the national audiology review group recommended bilateral implants.  It notes that initial estimates of the additional resources required are being examined with regard to the model of care required and the costings.  That, unfortunately, is as far as the Minister goes in his amendment.  It is most regrettable that it does not fully recognise the vital importance of bilateral cochlear implants.  He should at least have recognised the worry, concern and anguish of parents who see that the clock is ticking and that if these operations are not made available as soon as possible, it may be too late for their children to benefit from them. <\/p><p> I want to summarise the case we have made and put it to the Minister and the Government.  Thanks to the Happy New Ear campaign, it is now widely known that children in the State who receive cochlear implants receive one, rather than two, implants.  The provision of two implants is accepted as best practice internationally.  The case is best made by the parents of these children and I want to read the testimony from a parent.  The child concerned is now slightly older than she was when the parent wrote to me: <blockquote>Our beautiful daughter Taylor Beth is now two and half years old.  She has the biggest green eyes you have ever seen and can tell you in a blink exactly what she wants!  It's just as well she can do this as Taylor can't speak yet.  She was born profoundly deaf and due to a late diagnosis, 19 months had passed without her hearing a sound.  She began using sign language shortly after her diagnosis and to date has just short of 200 signs.  Even though she hasn't found her voice yet, this is one little lady who can still put you in your place!<br \/><br \/> Thankfully Taylor was given the gift of hearing in November 2012 and since then has come on leaps and bounds.  In these two short months she has started babbling like any hearing baby would start off and has finally turned to her name!!  It truly is a miracle.  There is a downside however...<br \/><br \/> Our daughter is exhausted in the evenings as her little brain has had to work so hard to process all the sound coming in through just one ear.  With the aid of a second implant this wouldn't be the case.  Why should our children miss out on their childhood because they are too exhausted to go and play after school?  Or not know in which direction that phone is ringing - all because there isn't enough funding.  These are simple little things to us but to her and the other children this could be life changing. <br \/><br \/> Please share our story and help us in the fight to gain bilateral implants for our little ones. We were all given two ears to hear - give these children what is rightfully theirs.<\/blockquote>None of us could put it more profoundly and with more certainty than a parent who is reaching out to us to offer the essential help to the child.  It has been estimated that the cost of a single implant is between &euro;18,000 and &euro;20,000.  The estimated annual cost of putting this programme in place for all the children who need it is &euro;12.8 million.  Approximately 200 children would benefit from the immediate introduction of a bilateral cochlear implant programme.  The core problem is that, as the child grows, the nerves to which the implant should be connected die if they are not being used and the hope of a further implant is lost.  However, this anguish for parents and children can be avoided.  This is an issue that can be resolved.  There is a solution which is best practice in other states.  The amount of money involved is relatively small, even in these straitened times.  All that is required is the political will, with which the money can be found. <\/p><p> At a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children this morning I asked the Minister to provide for bilateral cochlear implants in the 2014 HSE national service plan.  He said he had made it one of his priorities, just as he said so again here, but he went on to cite scarce resources.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, did the same during this debate.  The Minister makes the same delaying excuses, but I must call it as I see it.  His are delaying excuses and unacceptable, as he knows.<\/p><p> In a letter to Deputy Gerry Adams in July 2013 the Minister sounded a much more positive note and stated the proposal for the development of a bilateral cochlear implant programme at Beaumont Hospital would be submitted as part of the HSE Estimates process.  I regret to note that the tone from him and the Minister of State today was less positive than in his letter in July.  Trying to read between the lines of the speeches made today, I sincerely hope it is not the case that this plan was submitted as part of the pre-budget Estimates process but rejected at that stage.  Is this a battle the Minister fought but which has since been put back?  Even if that is the case, he can succeed if he has the political will.  He will have the applause and acclaim of the House if he delivers on this simple and straightforward issue.  We will not hesitate to properly commend him in full.  Governments have to be called to account.  Political pressure has to be applied to ensure they do the right thing.  I take with a pinch of salt the statement of the Minister of State that the motion would have been better timed after the HSE service plan is published.

In the past few weeks the two major stadia in Dublin - the Aviva Stadium and Croke Park - have been given a rates bill that shows a fivefold increase on the figure for last year.  The bill for the Aviva Stadium has gone from &euro;437,000 to &euro;2.36 million, while the bill for Croke Park has gone from &euro;528,000 to &euro;2.112 million.  For the three sports involved - GAA, rugby and soccer - the increase will amount to &euro;3.5 million which accounts for well over 50% of the funding the organisations received from the Irish Sports Council to deliver various coaching programmes for members.  The organisations provide massive business and economic benefits for our capital city and cities, towns and villages.  If this is happening in the case of national stadia, there will surely be implications for sports and community organisations throughout the country.  As a result of the economic position, the Government has had to reduce the investment in sport for a number of years.  All of these organisations have volunteers who provide not just an economic but also a social benefit for communities, involving the young and not so young.  They promote positive sports activities.  One might argue that these organisations can well afford to do this, but in the case of the GAA, for example, 86% of funding into Croke Park is disseminated through the units at grassroots level.  These stadia are of large economic benefit to the State via sports tourism and events such as the Rugby World Cup and it is hoped the likes of the European soccer championships could bring millions of euro into the country.  We are, therefore, shooting ourselves in the foot with these massive rates bills.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700038#LL00100","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1382022300,"counter":639,"content":"<p>How much time do I have?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700038#LL00200","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speech","time":1382022300,"counter":640,"content":"<p>Strictly speaking, the Deputy has one minute, but I will be a little lenient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700038#LL00300","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1382022300,"counter":641,"content":"<p>The Acting Chairman failed to let us know at the start how much time we had.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700038#LL00400","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speech","time":1382022300,"counter":642,"content":"<p>The clocks are there for everybody to see.

There will be almost &euro;4 million less to be made available to clubs and communities throughout the country, with the money going to Dublin City Council instead because of the change in valuation of both premises.  There is a fear that there will be a revaluation not only of the two stadia we are discussing but also of all clubs and facilities throughout the country.  In my county of Kildare there are three race tracks and it seems that all of these facilities at the Curragh, Naas and Punchestown will see an increase in rates which will have a detrimental effect on them.  Will Dublin City Council give the extra &euro;4 million to my local GAA or soccer club in Kill or rugby club in Naas?  I cannot see that happening.  We need to reconsider the Valuation Act 2001 and ensure we obtain a derogation not only for the two main stadia but also for all the stadia and sports organisations throughout the country.  They are creating an atmosphere for young people, in particular, to participate in sport and prevent obesity.  I appeal to the Minister to contact the Valuation Office and examine the legislation to see if there is a possibility of providing for a derogation for the rates paid by these stadia which also support clubs and organisations throughout the country.  We should also consider if we can extend that derogation to sports and community organisations that have a beneficial effect on the nation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700038#LL00600","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speech","time":1382022300,"counter":644,"content":"<p>I have been generous to the Deputy who had his full two minutes and even a little more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700038#LL00700","speaker":"1183"},{"type":"speech","time":1382022300,"counter":645,"content":"<p>I am taking this issue on behalf of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin.  <\/p><p>  Deputies are aware that the Valuation Office, as part of its revaluation programme, is in the process of updating the valuations of all commercial properties.  The revaluation process has been completed and the revaluation is effective for rates purposes in the areas of Fingal, south Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  The revaluation process in Dublin city and the three rating authorities in Waterford is nearing completion and proposed valuation certificates have been issued in these areas.  Final valuation certificates for rateable properties in these four local authorities will issue in December 2013.<\/p><p>  At this time it is only the revaluation process that is likely to give rise to large increases in rates for stadia, as the local authorities, in order to assist business to the extent that they can, have not increased their annual rate on valuation in recent years.  In Dublin city and Waterford the valuations proposed are not yet in the public domain and at this stage they are a matter between the occupier of the property and the commissioner.  Before the valuations are published, the occupier can make representations to the commissioner and, after publication, appeals against a valuation can be lodged.<\/p><p>  The Valuation Act 2001 provides for the exemption from rates of land that is developed for sport such as playing pitches, golf courses, tennis courts, etc.  In accordance with this provision, all playing pitches are exempt from rates and the Act provides that community halls such as sports clubhouses which are not licensed to sell alcohol and the facilities of which are not used primarily for profit or gain are not rateable.  This allows for the exemption of most sports club premises throughout the country.  However, the Act specifically provides that where a club is licensed to sell alcohol and registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act 1904, it is no longer deemed to be a community hall and, therefore, the premises occupied by the club are rateable.  The sale of alcohol is a commercial activity and licensed club premises are competing with other licensed premises.<\/p><p>  The vast majority of sports facilities throughout the State are rates-free and most of those which are rateable are licensed to sell alcohol under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act 1904.  Any reduction in the rates applicable to these premises could distort competition and any proposal to provide a concession for sports stadia would have no basis in current valuation law.  If granted through a policy decision, such an act would in all probability be quickly followed by a similar claim by other commercial ratepayers, with the ultimate result being that Exchequer funding to all local authorities would have to be increased by an unsustainable amount to make good the shortfall that would result from such a reduction.<\/p><p>  If sports stadia face an increase in rates as a result of the revaluation process, it is because it reflects a relative increase in the value of sports stadia when compared to all other rateable premises.  This assessment of relative value is completed by the Valuation commissioner on an independent basis.  The revaluation programme will update the values on which rates are based to reflect modern values.  As it stands, rates in areas that have not been revalued are based on values and relativities that persisted in 1988 or much earlier.  The revaluation programme will ensure rates are levied on a much more equitable basis and any concession that might be considered for any category of property is likely to erode the equity of the system.  Any concession to a category of property would have to be passed to the occupiers of all other rateable properties.  Local authorities calculate their annual rates on valuations on the basis of the aggregate value on the valuation list.  Many sports stadia provide conference and other facilities on the premises on days when the stadium is not being used for a sports event and on these days they are in direct competition with other commercial providers who also pay rates.  This would further increase the inequity of a concession.<\/p><p>  The value placed on sport and sports events, large and small, cannot be expressed in monetary terms, but sports organisations have and continue to receive financial support from the State.  Apart from the ongoing support for sport, some of the large stadia projects such as Croke Park and the Aviva Stadium received substantial grant allocations towards their development totalling in excess of &euro;300 million.  I hope that is of some help to the Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700038#LL00800","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1382022900,"counter":646,"content":"<p>I will stick to the minute this time.

According to media reports yesterday, a study on the use of the controversial anti-malarial drug, Lariam, received by the Minister for Defence, Deputy Shatter, whom I welcome in the Chamber, is legally privileged and will not be published.  The use of Lariam has been a topic of concern for some time, and not only under the current Government.  It is vital that we answer these concerns.<\/p><p>  Yesterday <i>The Irish Times<\/i> carried a story stating that the administration of the drug to Defence Forces personnel travelling to malarial countries will continue, notwithstanding revised safety information from the manufacturer Roche, stating that the drug can cause serious neuro-psychiatric disorders.  Roche states that possible side effects include insomnia, anxiety and depression.  The company also mentions that hallucinations, psychosis, suicide, suicidal thoughts and self-endangering behaviour have been reported.  It states that adverse reactions can persist for several months after discontinuation of the drug.<\/p><p>  It seems that soldiers on a mission to Chad in 2009 were told that if they failed to take Lariam and caught malaria through their own fault the Defence Forces would not be liable.  It is also reported they were required to take the drug under supervision, were warned not to take any other anti-malarial medicine and were told that only Lariam is effective in Chad.  Other drugs such as Malarone and Coartem are used by other countries, including the United States.  Alternative anti-malarial drugs found in the possession of any soldier would be considered contraband and soldiers were told they could face disciplinary action if found with such drugs.<\/p><p>  Some serving and former members of the Defence Forces have begun legal action against the State, complaining of side effects including depression and suicidal ideation.  The report of the working group on malarial chemoprophylaxis, set up in 2009, examined the use of Lariam.  The group reported to the Minister during the summer.  A statement from the Department of Defence notes that the report was produced in the context of current and potential litigation, is legally privileged and would not be published.<\/p><p>  I am astonished by this attitude.  Surely the report should be published as a matter of course.  Is it not in any case subject to discovery by any lawyers taking action in this matter?  Does the fact it is not being published not give the impression there is something to hide on the part of the Department of Defence?  Should a Government that claims to cherish transparency, which pats itself on the back on a regular basis about improvements in the Freedom of Information Act and other areas, not publish this report?<\/p><p>  This particular controversy will not go away.  The momentum demanding action and either an expos&eacute; or an explanation on the part of the Department is growing by the day.  Whatever may have been said by different Ministers in the past, including those of my party who adopted a particular view on the matter, we cannot ignore the growing controversy.  Apart from that controversy, the growing body of evidence seems to suggest that at least there are questions to answer.  When we look at this drug as not only one of three possible medications that could be used, but also one in respect of which its own manufacturer has raised real and meaningful concerns, it is incumbent on he Department of Defence to address those concerns.  In this instance, where I understand the Minister has a report, he should at least publish it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700039#MM00500","speaker":"1054"},{"type":"speech","time":1382022900,"counter":651,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  I am sorry he is making allegations that somebody has something to hide.  I certainly have nothing to hide and I assume each of my predecessors who were Ministers for Defence for 14 years during the lifetime of the previous Government had nothing to hide.  The document to which the Deputy refers, the instructions from 2009 published by the Defence Forces, were published when the Deputy's colleague, Deputy Willie O'Dea, was Minister for Defence.  I have nothing to hide.<\/p><p>  Arising from assertions which had been circulating regarding the prescribing and side effects of Lariam, my Department established a working group in January 2011 to examine the use of Lariam and other anti-malarial drugs in the Defence Forces.  The group comprises representatives of the Defence Forces Medical Corps, Defence Forces personnel policy branch and Defence Forces human resources and litigation branch.  It also includes representatives from the State Claims Agency and the Chief State Solicitor's Office.<\/p><p>  The purpose of this group was to review issues arising in respect of the use of Lariam, having particular regard to current and potential litigation, to review and confirm the approach of the Defence Forces in regard to the use of malaria chemoprophylaxis in the Defence Forces and to ensure that the procedures in relation thereto continue to be appropriate and in accordance with best medical practice as promulgated by the relevant medical authorities.  The work of the group informs the Defence organisation's process of ongoing risk assessment and mitigation in the context of a proactive risk management strategy.<\/p><p>  The group reported back to me in June this year.  While the report was produced, as the Deputy correctly noted, in the context of current and potential litigation and is, therefore, legally privileged, I can confirm that the group investigated all the various allegations surrounding the use of Lariam and that it obtained advice from leading medical experts.  These experts concur with the practices followed by the Defence Forces in prescribing Lariam.<\/p><p>  On my behalf, the State Claims Agency is currently handling 24 cases taken by members and former members of the Defence Forces who allege personal injury as a result of their consumption of mefloquine, or Lariam.  High Court proceedings have been served in respect of nine of these cases.<\/p><p>  It is important to draw to the attention of the Deputy and of the House that malaria is a serious disease that can cause serious complications and death.<\/p><p>It is estimated by the World Health Organization that approximately 1 million people die every year from malaria in sub-Saharan Africa alone.  It has also long been recognised as being a serious threat to any military force operating in a malarious area.<\/p><p> The anti-malaria regime in place in the Defence Forces, including the use of lariam, has worked.  In the decade of deployment to sub-Saharan Africa by the Defence Forces, not a single member of the Defence Forces has died from malaria.  Research has shown that lariam is one of the most effective medications for protection against the type of malaria prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa.

There was a substantial problem in the American armed forces because they did not adopt the approach we adopt.<\/p><p>  There is nothing in the report that indicates in any shape or form that the approach that has been taken heretofore should not be taken.

It is not a matter for ministerial direction.  The expert group investigated all the various allegations surrounding the use of lariam and obtained advice from leading medical experts.  In the context of research, Lariam has been shown to be one of the most effective medications for protection against the type of malaria prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa.

I am sure the Minister of State would agree that one of the biggest factors leading to the economic crash was the role played by developers and planners as well as bankers and corrupt politicians.  Houses were sold at inflated prices.  The hundreds of empty housing estates across the State are all evidence of the importance of Government agencies being scrupulous in how they manage housing.  Each year, county councils spend substantial amounts of taxpayers' money on the purchase of properties for social housing so it is vital that there is transparency and certainty about the processes involved.<\/p><p>  It has emerged that in 2010 Louth County Council bought two houses belonging to senior members of the council&rsquo;s housing department.  Moreover, a senior executive in Louth County Council&rsquo;s housing department acted for the council in the purchase of his own home.  When my colleague, Councillor Tom&aacute;s Sharkey, and others raised this issue, they were told by the council that at all times proper processes and procedures were followed to ensure full compliance with all the relevant control mechanisms that govern housing acquisitions.  They were also told that staff are not excluded from the housing acquisitions programme.  Could the Minister of State tell us if proper processes were followed in this instance?  Does she believe that proper processes were followed if the person selling the house to the council was also the person buying the house on behalf of the council?  Will she urgently review the situation and if necessary clarify for local authorities the regulations surrounding the sale and purchase of housing by councils from staff?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700040#NN00500","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1382023500,"counter":657,"content":"<p>Over the years we have had many issues with planners and planning.

Of course I do not for a moment suggest that the issues I raise are in the same category but, nonetheless, they are serious.<\/p><p>  This issue has been brought to my attention and that of others, including the local media.  The <i>Dundalk Democrat <\/i>and Councillor Tom&aacute;s Sharkey have done much to expose it.  The purchase of private homes by local authorities has been an integral part of how we deliver social housing and meet mounting housing need in this State.  At the height of the boom, Louth County Council bought 18 homes of which two were from their own staff.  That is an obvious conflict of interest.<\/p><p>While it might not always be negative, the potential for corruption is too great to allow it to happen.<\/p><p> The two homes in question belonged to senior executive officers in the council.  Each recommended the other's for purchase.  This, in itself, is an obvious problem but it goes further.  One of the properties has serious questions over its suitability.  A three-bed bungalow in Tullagee, Knockbridge, purchased for &euro;137,500, had no building energy rating, BER, when signed off for purchase.  When a BER analysis was carried out, it received an E1, which is very low.  Thus, the house is not suitable for a council to be purchasing.<\/p><p> When a tenant was moved in, they were unhappy with the insulation and requested to be moved as it was too cold.  The council then applied for and used significant funding from the SEAI to upgrade the home to make it suitable for occupation.  That is further taxpayers' money to upgrade a home that should not have been purchased in the first instance given its condition.<\/p><p> There are further questions over rumoured inspections that yielded negative reports on the home before and after purchase which are now missing or unavailable.  The owner of the property, in his capacity as an executive officer, wrote to solicitors confirming the property had been inspected by a clerk of works and that the &quot;structure is in order&quot;.  A response from the council stated:<blockquote> The house was inspected by the Clerk of Works on December 1, 2010 and a detailed inspection form completed.

I share the concern expressed by both Deputies that where allegations are made with regard to a conflict of interest by public servants in discharging their official duties, this has the capacity to undermine public confidence in the service and the way public money is spent and accounted for.  There are robust legislative procedures in place under the Local Government Act 2001 and the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 which set out the requirements on declarable interests and the conduct of public servants in exercising their functions.  There are no exceptions to these requirements.  I can certainly provide them in response to Deputy Adams's request.<\/p><p>  New social housing supply is delivered through a range of measures under my Department's social housing investment programme, SHIP, including the construction and acquisition of social housing units directly by local authorities and by approved housing bodies, the social housing leasing initiative, the capital advance leasing facility and the rental accommodation scheme.<\/p><p>  Louth County Council acquired 18 housing units within its administrative area during 2010 as part of the work programme financed under my Department's SHIP.  I now understand that two of these were in the ownership of council employees, as indicated by the Deputies.<\/p><p>  In 2010, when the units in question were acquired, local authorities had delegated sanction to acquire housing units.  This delegated sanction applied where both the numbers of units and funding available for the acquisition programme had been agreed with my Department.  My Department does not have a role in the selection of particular properties for acquisition by a local authority and would not, at any time, be aware of the identity of the vendor.<\/p><p>  When identifying acquisitions, housing authorities are required to ensure that all the relevant issues are considered, including tenure mix and estate composition, specific local needs and that the acquisitions are appropriate for the purpose of social housing and the authority's management of its stock in so far as identified housing needs in its area are concerned.  Housing authorities are also required to achieve best value for money in the acquisition of properties.  It is an absolute requirement that the local authority obtains an independent valuation of each property by a suitable qualified person.  I understand this requirement was adhered to in both these cases.  If there is information to the contrary, I will be happy to receive it.<\/p><p>  The matter of the alleged conflict of interest was brought to the attention of my Department in September.  Following this, my Department was in touch with senior management in Louth County Council and requested a report on the alleged conflict of interest by council officials in the procedures leading to the acquisition of two properties.  The county manager subsequently commissioned an independent firm of auditors and risk-assessment managers to undertake a comprehensive review of the council's social housing investment programme in 2010, including the acquisition of 18 properties and, in particular, the procedures that applied in the case of the purchase of the two houses owned by local authority employees.  I understand that the review process is almost complete and that the independent consultants will report to the county manager very shortly.

We should be taking photographs of the properties, internally and externally.  That would give us a better idea as to their condition.

People who have received an overpayment from the Department have a liability under law to refund the amounts involved.  They have received moneys to which they were not entitled.  In 2012, overpayments amounting to &euro;97 million were recorded.  This represents 0.47% of overall annual departmental expenditure.  Recoveries in 2012 amounted to &euro;53.5 million, which is considerably more than what was recovered previously.<\/p><p>Until the introduction of recent legislation, the Department was limited in its capacity to recover overpayments without the person&rsquo;s agreement.  For this reason, overpayments often remained outstanding for a long period of time.  Deputies from all sides of the House who have been members of the Committee of Public Accounts will know that the Comptroller and Auditor General regularly took the Department to task about not having an active payment recovery system.  The Social Welfare Act 2012 provides for greater recovery levels of up to 15% from the personal rate of a person&rsquo;s social welfare payment without consent but excluding any payments received for dependent adults or children.  This amendment means that the Department is now in a position to ensure that all debt-holders in receipt of a payment are repaying their debts.  In addition, in order to improve the capacity to recover overpayments from persons no longer dependent on social welfare, the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 provides for the introduction of notice of attachment powers for the recovery of overpayments directly from a person&rsquo;s earnings or from monies held by him or her in financial institutions.  <\/p><p> I believe that having effective debt recovery is essential in deterring fraudulent activity.  It creates a climate in which people who have been overpaid know that they have a responsibility to repay and that the Department will take the necessary steps to effect recovery.  Both of the changes I have outlined above will significantly enhance the Department&rsquo;s ability to pursue overpayments from people who are not making efforts to repay their debts.  <\/p><p> My Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure that every effort is made to prevent overpayments, but if they occur, they are regarded as a debt to the Exchequer and every effort must be made to recover the amounts due.

There has also been an increase in the volume of customer claims under particular schemes.  Despite this, there have been significant improvements from 2012 in the waiting times for assessment by the medical assessors across all the illness related schemes.  The processing backlogs have been eliminated across all of the illness related schemes, except for disability allowance, which is being cleared.

This measure is being introduced to give jobseekers who are dissatisfied with an internship and have not secured paid employment subsequent to an internship a further chance.  It is important to highlight that this measure is being introduced in response to feedback from jobseekers who have participated in the scheme and was one of the recommendations contained in the independent review of the JobBridge scheme.  It is also important to note that the maximum duration of an individual internship will remain at nine months and that jobseekers will not be allowed to take up more than one internship with the same host organisation.<\/p><p>  The JobBridge scheme incorporates a number of design features to protect workers and jobseekers.  These include a cap on the total number of interns that can be hired by any one organisation; limits on the duration of internships of either six or nine months; a cooling off period in order that organisations cannot hire interns one after the other in sequence; requiring organisations to appoint a mentor for each intern, complete a standard agreement for each intern and provide an undertaking that the internship is not being used to displace employees. <\/p><p>  Host organisations are not permitted to advertise internships in areas where they have recently made redundancies or where they currently have paid posts advertised.  They must also complete and submit a monthly compliance report to the Department.  The Department monitors and enforces compliance by screening all applications and providing an online facility for interns or others to report breaches of these conditions.  We also conduct random site visits.  Approximately 9,000 organisations have sponsored interns in the public, private, voluntary and community sector and over 3,400 monitoring visits to these organisation locations have been completed to-date, of which about 98% have been satisfactory.  Remedial action is taken in all cases of non-compliance.<\/p><p>  The independent evaluation by Indecon found that 61% of interns went on to achieve paid employment.

It is not surprising that the bulk of the Minister's reply concerns measures to prevent abuse by employers of the internship scheme and interns.  This is no coincidence because the scheme is abusive in itself, essentially providing free labour for employers.  It is quite clear that the JobBridge and Gateway programmes are a ruse to reduce the figures on the live register by 11,000 and a lame excuse for the Government's failure to invest in the creation of jobs with real wages.  Does the Minister agree that the facts damn her?  Young people are not hanging around unemployed.  There were 32 unemployed persons for every job vacancy in August this year.  The result of the Minister's shameful measure in cutting the benefits for young people up to age 26 years will be to force them into a situation where they will be subjects for free labour and abuse.

While payment of child benefit has moved between the parents over the intervening years, payment has been made continually in respect of the child since the month following his birth.  I understand the principal residence of the child and the matter of who should receive the child benefit is under dispute between the parents in this case.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that payment of child benefit is generally made to the mother.  In circumstances in which a child resides part-time with both the mother and the father, payment is made to the parent with whom the child resides most of the time.  In this case, payment of child benefit was originally made to the mother and this remained the case up to May 2011.  At that time the child&rsquo;s father made a claim for the benefit and following investigation it was decided that he should receive the payment.  As a result, the payment was made to him from June 2011 until February 2013, when the child&rsquo;s mother submitted a new child benefit claim.  Inquiries about the length of time the child spent with each parent elicited conflicting information, so the deciding officer referred the case for investigation.  The parties were interviewed by separate social welfare inspectors and both provided evidence to show their son resided with them most of the time.  The deciding officer, having considered all available evidence, decided to award payment to the mother.  The other person appealed this decision.  As is routine practice, the file was referred back to the deciding officer for review.  The deciding officer did not consider it necessary to revise the decision.<\/p><p>  In subsequent representations, I understand Deputy Shortall raised concerns as to the weight attached to a supporting letter provided by a social worker.  In light of her representations, a senior official undertook a full review of the papers.  The review concluded that the social worker&rsquo;s letter should be excluded from the evidence.  On this basis, the deciding officer again reviewed all the evidence and concluded that the decision to pay the child benefit to the mother should stand.  As both parents claim the child resides more than 50% of the time with them, the deciding officer has made a judgment that the child can be considered to reside at least 50% of the time with his mother.<\/p><p>  I can confirm it is normal practice to refer back to the original deciding officer when a revised decision is to be considered, as happened in this case.  This is now subject to an appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700046#TT05300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1382027100,"counter":767,"content":"<p>I raised an individual case because I have serious concerns about the handling of this by the Department.  These are separated parents, both of whom claim to be the principal carer of the child.  When the Department found in favour of the mother I queried the decision and discovered it was based on a letter from a social worker which was on the file.  The social worker had no professional role with the family.  When I requested a review, senior staff accepted that the original decision was flawed.  The file was then sent back to the original deciding officer, who upheld the original decision, as the Minister stated.<\/p><p>Two issues arise in this instance and both require attention.  Will the Minister indicate what is the verification process for supporting documentation from professionals on the basis of which final decisions are made?  The decision in this instance related to child benefit and had knock-on effects in the context of increases for a qualified child and a family income supplement payment.  In the light of the change introduced in the budget, it will also have an impact in respect of the lone parent tax credit.  This is a very important decision and there is a great deal of money involved.  It only came to light that there was a letter from a social worker on the file after I had taken up the matter with someone at senior level within the Department.

As of 10 October, some 21,842 jobseekers had participated in the scheme, with 5,918 participants in active internships.  In addition, 2,948 internship posts have been advertised and are available on the JobBridge website.  It is important to highlight that participation in the scheme is voluntary for both jobseekers and host organisations.  A key measure of the effectiveness of any scheme designed to provide a pathway into employment is the extent to which participants progress into employment within a short period following completion of their placement.  In the past, a criticism made by the ESRI and the OECD was that the State did not perform a robust <i>ex-post <\/i>evaluation of scheme effectiveness and, as a consequence, ineffective schemes were allowed to continue in operation at a considerable cost to the Exchequer.  I decided, therefore, to commission an independent evaluation of JobBridge to assess its effectiveness early in its lifecycle.  I published the independent evaluation conducted by Indecon economic consultants earlier this year.  The evaluation found that 61% of interns who finished placements secured employment within five months.  These progression outcomes indicate that JobBridge is the best performing of all employment schemes and that it compares more than favourably with European averages for equivalent schemes.  In the context of the evaluation, 89% of interns stated JobBridge had given them new skills, 88% stated they had gained quality work experience, 81% stated it had improved their chances of gaining employment, 81% stated it had improved their self-confidence, 80% stated it had helped them identify job opportunities and 76% stated it helped them to establish contacts and networks.  These types of benefits accrue, regardless of whether an internship placement is within the public or the private sector.<\/p><p>  The Department's records indicate that 20% of all placements to date have been in the public sector.  The Indecon evaluation found that 41.2% of interns who undertook their internships in public sector organisations progressed into paid employment with other organisations.  This rate of progression exceeds that for other schemes such as the community employment scheme and T&uacute;, and shows that the experience that interns gain in public sector host organisations enhances their CVs and facilitates them in gaining employment with other employers.  I am satisfied, therefore, that public sector internships provide a valuable pathway to employment for many and I will continue to support such internships through the JobBridge scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013101700047#UU01200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1382028300,"counter":781,"content":"<p>In the past the Minister has accused me of being opposed to JobBridge.

It should not be forgotten that this is on the back of a free internship.  The criticism in the question relates to Government Departments.

They cannot get a job because they have no experience and they cannot get experience because they cannot get a job.  The six or nine months' experience overcomes that problem, which I acknowledge is a particular feature of the recession.  It is a response to the terrible situation I see, as somebody working in third level with many young people, in which people emerge with all sorts of qualifications from secondary and third level education and cannot get a job because they have no experience, but they cannot get experience because they cannot get a job.

In the context of the downturn in both construction and retail, it is odd that the Deputy would choose to make those comments.  Across the Border, his party has been cock-a-hoop when employment expansion in the IT industry has been announced.  As the Deputy knows, and I am sure he is familiar with business practices, in all IT companies there are periods when there are changes and reductions in one area of activity.  The company the Deputy referred to has been expanding employment enormously in other areas and has many thousands of people employed in the greater Dublin area, Galway and Cork.

If a person finds an internship in an area in which he or she is interested, he or she will be allowed a second chance, as it were.  That was a proposal from the interns in the survey by Indecon and it was a recommendation in the report.  One can only do that repeat experience if it is in two different organisations.  It is not meant to be a consecutive internship in a single organisation.  That is not allowed.  There are a small number of cases in which people find that the internship is not what they wish to do, but they would like a chance subsequently at another internship that they have identified as being of serious interest.  It is only in such circumstances that we allow a repeat.
