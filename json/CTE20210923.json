The HSE has been advised that the areas of interest to the committee include oversight and governance arrangements concerning grants to section 38 and section 39 organisations and the service arrangement between the HSE and SouthDoc.  We are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from the HSE: Mr. Paul Reid, CEO; Ms Anne O&rsquo;Connor, chief operations officer; Mr. Stephen Mulvany, chief financial officer; Mr. Joe Ryan, national director of operational performance and Integration; and Ms Mair&eacute;ad Dolan, assistant chief financial officer.  We are also joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by Mr. Kevin Colman, principal officer at the Department of Health.  They are all very welcome.<\/p>  <p>  When we begin to engage, I ask members and witnesses to mute their microphones while not contributing so that they do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent.  We have a hybrid meeting this morning, with some members in the room and others joining remotely.  I ask for everyone's co-operation with these arrangements.  <\/p>  <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the House, as regards references that witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and by statute, by absolute privilege.  However, one of today's witnesses, a Department official, is giving evidence remotely from a place outside parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  The witness has already been advised of this and may have thought it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218, which states that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of Government, or Minister of the Government, or the merits or objectives of such policies.<\/p>  <p>  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the House, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  To assist our broadcast services and the staff of the Debates Office, I ask members to direct their questions to specific witnesses.  If the question has not been directed to a specific witness, I ask each witness to state his or her name the first time that he or she contributes.<\/p>  <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, delivered his opening statement on the board's financial statements at our meeting of 16 September and it was recirculated to the committee before this meeting.

I am joined today by my colleagues, Ms Anne O&rsquo;Connor, chief operations officer; Mr. Stephen Mulvany, chief financial officer; Mr. Joe Ryan, national director of operational performance and integration; and Ms Mair&eacute;ad Dolan, assistant chief financial officer.<\/p>  <p>  We submitted information and documentation to the committee in advance of the meeting on the topics for examination, so I will confine my opening remarks to the following concerning section 38 and section 39 services providers.  The HSE must use the resources provided to it each year by the Government in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and well-being of the public.  The HSE is mandated in law to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.  These services are, by their nature, varied and complex.  In the main, the HSE delivers services directly but it also relies on voluntary providers to deliver services on its behalf.  It also funds providers to deliver similar or ancillary services.<\/p>  <p>   Section 38 and section 39 service providers comprise more than 2,100 funded and grant-aided organisations nationwide, including some of the large academic teaching hospitals, disability service providers and a diverse range of other health and social care providers.  These organisations play a central role in the provision of acute, community and home-based services to the public and many have a long history of caring for patients and service users within their communities.  They have been vital and trusted partners of the HSE during the Covid-19 pandemic in protecting, treating and caring for our most vulnerable.  I acknowledge and appreciate their enormous contribution to the success of the national health response.<\/p>  <p>  Annual funding released by the HSE to these providers is approximately &euro;5.4 billion.  Given this spending, the HSE has a formal governance framework in place with each organisation, incorporating standardised contractual documentation and guidance coupled with direct engagement processes.  The governance framework underpins the allocation and oversight of the funding granted and the services provided in return.  The requirements of the governance frameworks are onerous on providers, and we know that, and they are also onerous on the HSE.  However, such a governance framework is necessary to ensure the HSE and the providers meet their obligations to one another.  The terms of a governance framework are informed by the public spending policy and the framework is reviewed and updated in accordance with those principles.  The manner in which funding is overseen by the HSE is also informed by the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In this regard, I highlight two developments in particular. <\/p>  <p>  First, the large number of service providers, approximately 2,100, funded primarily by the community healthcare organisations, CHOs, led to a decision being taken to establish contract management support units, CMSUs, in each of the nine CHOs.  Several of these teams are in place and it is expected that the remaining staff for these units will be in place and the units fully operational by the end of the year.  These CMSUs are a dedicated permanent resource and their primary purpose will be to assist service managers at operational level in managing the contractual relationship with the service providers.  <\/p>  <p>  Second, as we advised the committee previously, external reviews of the governance of 30 organisations have taken place as part of phase 1 of this process.  Phase 2 will commence later this month and it will involve the review of the section 38 service providers not previously reviewed and some of the higher funded section 39 service providers.  The purpose of these reviews is to gain external assurance regarding the standards of governance and to ensure that enhancements are put in place where required.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that our section 38 and section 39 providers are separate legal entities, with their own boards that are directly responsible, in the first instance, for the standards of good governance within their organisations.  Most of these providers are registered charities and their boards are subject to oversight by the Charities Regulator, quite apart from any additional governance assurances the HSE may seek.<\/p> <p>We continue to work closely with our section 38 and section 39 providers to ensure the services we provide together meet the needs of our communities, are complementary to each other and are of high quality.  To this end, we will continue to examine and keep under constant review the governance framework in relation to section 38 and section 39 providers.  Some of these organisations are facing funding challenges, and committee members will be aware of this.<\/p> <p> The HSE is also participating, with representatives in the voluntary sector, in a dialogue forum set up following the report of the independent review group.  The aim of the forum is to build a stronger relationship between the State and voluntary providers for the benefit of patients and service users.  It is my view that we need to consider a revised governance framework which better supports accountable autonomy within the sector, while at the same time meeting the important and necessary governance and accountability obligations to which the HSE is itself subject.<\/p> <p> SouthDoc provides an out-of-hours GP service to a population of 694,000 in counties Cork and Kerry, in addition to the 3 million visitors to the region each year.  There are 502 GP members and the services provided by SouthDoc are governed by a service level agreement which is agreed and signed annually and reviewed quarterly.  The agreed level of expenditure for the full year of 2021 is &euro;7.5 million.  All calls to the service are processed through a central call centre hub in Killarney in the SouthDoc headquarters.  A triage nurse, in consultation with the patient, decides on the most appropriate course of clinical care for the clinical condition.  There are 12 walk-in treatment centres as well as seven treatment centres which are attended by appointment only in the SouthDoc catchment area.  While some treatment centres were temporarily closed due to safety concerns associated with Covid-19, all patients were still in receipt of a full out-of-hours service, which may have been provided in a different location or via telehealth.<\/p> <p> The SouthDoc service continued to operate throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, with necessary precautions applied during the different phases of the public health emergency.  SouthDoc introduced medical triage to support normal triage.  This allowed for certain issues to be dealt with via telecommunication, where appropriate.  There were two specific sites which were later to open, at Listowel in County Kerry and the Blackpool centre in Cork city.  Both services were the subject of discussion between SouthDoc and the HSE regarding their restoration, with both centres now open subject to public health measures.  The Listowel service recommenced in July and Blackpool recommenced in early September.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021092300002#A00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632385800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Reid for his opening statement.

The notion of having people in hospital who could or should be at home is not one that any of us want to live with.  There has been a lot of work done in relation to home support workers.  If we go back a few years, our challenge was one of funding.  We have two different groups awaiting home support.  We have people who have a package and maybe their care needs to be increased and they need more hours and then we have those who are on a waiting list to receive home support.<\/p>  <p>  In the last 18 months or so, we have found a reduction in the number of workers available.  This relates, in the main, to two things.  The first is that people are not applying for these jobs both in the public and private sector.  It used to be that this was a problem in certain parts of the country.  For instance, in parts of the south east, unfortunately, there have always been some issues with recruiting these workers into some of the private agencies.  However, it is now a national problem.  Some of our CHOs are only able to deliver up to 60% of their funded allocation of home support.  That is impacting hugely on people such as those the Deputy mentioned - people in hospital who are trying to go home - as well as the disability sector where people are not getting the right in-home supports.<\/p>  <p>  We are working on a number of fronts on this.  One challenge is around people not applying for these jobs.  They have other income at the moment and are not putting their hands up.  Equally, we have identified a problem with training.  We are working on a new model to bring people in and providing an internship-type training to try to encourage them.  We have found that many of the people who apply do not have the necessary qualifications.  They are very well meaning and want to do this work but the reality is that home support work is very rewarding but also very challenging.

That must be addressed.  What I hear today does not give me or the people I represent confidence.  There is a huge issue around section 39 organisations.  There is no capital funding available for Western Care to properly renovate its existing stock.  There is no plan to support the development of new facilities for both day and residential services, apart from what was available under the Covid-related minor works scheme.

Second, it is our understanding that it is proposed to rehouse or rehome some people in institutional settings like St. Stephen's Hospital in Glanmire and also in St. Catherine's, and possibly on the site of St. Finbarr's Hospital in Cork.  If it is the case that the HSE is proposing to re-institutionalise people at a time when the HSE policy and Government policy is to decongregate, I think that would be taken very seriously.  I ask that the HSE take another look at this decision on the basis that people are very concerned, given where it is proposed that people will be sent to, in that this further institutionalises them.  All I am asking at this stage is that Mr. Reid take another look at this and run the rule over it, as chief executive officer.  I will leave it there.<\/p>  <p>  SouthDoc is very important.  During the pandemic, a number of cells were taken out of action, and that is the fact of the matter.  Mitchelstown and Fermoy, as well as the Cork centres, were taken out.  This meant that cars were going much further afield to cover off services on an out-of-hours basis.  It meant that doctors were much more stretched, if they were doing home visits.  Please do not tell us how the service works.  We know how the service works.  There is a fear that the &euro;7.5 million of taxpayers&rsquo; investment in this service is not buying enough scrutiny of the service that is being provided, notwithstanding the fact it is a separate entity.  There is a presence by the HSE on the board of SouthDoc.  To my mind, that buys the taxpayer and the HSE greater scrutiny of how SouthDoc operates.<\/p> <p> On Deputy Colm Burke's point, which he ran out of time on, I share his view.  More and more people are now going to Cork University Hospital, CUH, on an accident-and-emergency basis and bypassing SouthDoc because they do not feel confident that they will be seen at times by SouthDoc.  We need to deal with perceptions in the public mind as to how SouthDoc operates.  I am very familiar with the Mallow service and the Mitchelstown-Fermoy service.  They are excellent services staffed by brilliant people.  I could not say enough good things about them.  However, we do not have a service in Youghal out of hours.  Someone who phones from Youghal is expected to go to Midleton.  That is a journey of about half an hour.  The services at times are stretched between the Waterford border and the Kerry border.<\/p> <p> There needs to be a review of how SouthDoc operates.  It is our view that the &euro;7.5 million investment of taxpayers' money buys the HSE greater scrutiny to ensure that it is triaging and building out a public message in a way that ensures that if people can avoid the accident and emergency department in CUH and go through their local services, while those services are very good, there might need to be a greater degree of scrutiny or some sort of review as to how the services operate, particularly within the city.  There needs to be a look back on why the Blackpool and Fermoy-Mitchelstown services were closed because the HSE took out a massive geographical area there.  They were taken out during the pandemic.  I ask - this is my only ask - that the HSE look back on how SouthDoc operated during the pandemic.  A little report could be furnished to Members of the Oireachtas or there could be just a look back on the basis of what lessons can be learned, how the service, which is by and large an excellent service, can operate more efficiently and whether it can cover more sufficiently east Cork.  I am convinced that it is not covering the Youghal area.  It does not have sufficient resources to cover the Youghal area and ensure that people in Youghal or further afield are not forced to go to Midleton or onward to Cork, directly to an accident and emergency department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021092300007#F01800","speaker":"1514","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632388800,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Reid to respond briefly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021092300008#G00200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632388800,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I reassure Deputy Sherlock that there was, has been and continues to be a lot of engagement with SouthDoc, particularly in terms of the restoration of the services in the two sites that were closed.

Kildare and west Wicklow, which would have a population of approximately 250,000 and a disproportionately young population with new needs, does not have a history of having organisations already in place because it is a growing area.  I note, however, that it got one of the lowest amounts of money in that distribution model.  Mayo, for example, got &euro;888,000, with Kildare and west Wicklow getting &euro;83,000.  There may well be a good reason for that.  I do not think there is any part of the country that could boast that it has an exceptional service because they will always be stretched.  However, is there an objective resource allocation model for the delivery of services?  When it came to, for example, the distribution of new staff around the time of the crash, where there was a relaxation of the embargo on recruitment of staff - for example, speech and language therapists and other therapists - Kildare in fact got a disproportionate number relative to the rest of the country because it was so deficient and the staff were distributed on an objective resource allocation model.

Covid has had a severe impact on our health services overall in terms of waiting lists and delayed care.  We can see in our emergency departments that many people have delayed their care during Covid.  We can see that because of the volume of patients, the frailty of some of them and the severity of their illnesses.  As my colleague outlined, delaying non-urgent care was a part of our response to the pandemic.  Health services have certainly been hugely impacted over the past 18 months.<\/p>  <p>  We in the HSE and the Department are anxious to put together a kind of restoration approach, not only to deal with non-Covid illnesses but also to address the size of waiting lists.  We want to do that from a few perspectives.  We will, first of all, look at how we can increase capacity in the public system.  That will mean significant extra recruitment and resourcing, for which we have funding.  We have approximately 10,500 extra resources compared with January 2020.  We have approximately 4,500 extra resources for 2021.  We will probably add another 3,000 before the end of this year.  On top of that, we have approximately 3,200 people working on our testing and tracing and vaccination programmes as agency staff who we want to convert to full-time employment.  We have funding for resourcing.<\/p>  <p>  This will be a significant challenge for the health service as we move to an approach that looks at increased public capacity.  Increased utilisation of private capacity is also part of our plan.  We are also examining a completely new way of delivering many of our services, using many new technologies and medical supports.  We are going to take a comprehensive approach but it will be a massive challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021092300010#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1632390000,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I wish to return to the integrated financial management system.

I noted Mr. Reid's earlier response on the matter.  My understanding is that it has now entered design stage, or that was the stage it was at a week or two ago.  Phase 1 of the project was to be completed by May 2024.  There has been a delay of 12 months, obviously, and the Department and the HSE have said that is due to Covid-19.  Phase 2 of the new system is to be completed in March 2025.  I wish to ask a couple of questions in that regard.  Assuming those targets are met, that is a full nine years after the recognition of the need for such a system and the decision to go ahead with it.  Will the whole system be out of date?  Mr. Reid, in reply to an earlier question, mentioned that the company concerned now appears to be out of the frame and a new company is being brought in.

I have spoken to people at different levels of the ambulance services.  The headline in my local newspaper two weeks ago said \"No Ambulance Help 'A Disgrace'\".  Sometimes headlines are not accurate, but on this occasion, it is.  I could rattle off cases where ambulances have been deployed and diverted but time does not allow it.<\/p>  <p>  One case involved a person in part of north Kildare about 50 km or 55 km from Portlaoise hospital.  A horse fell on top of this person and he was seriously injured with internal bleeding and all of that.  The ambulance came to within 2 km of him but was then stood down and turned back.  It was sent over to Athy to deal with a what they were told was an emergency.  The crew diverted but it was not an emergency.  Whoever made the call in used words that gave the impression to the person dispatching in the control centre that it was.  Meanwhile, another ambulance chased the original call for the emergency and took longer. <\/p>  <p>  There was also an example of an elderly person who waited more than two hours for an ambulance in Clonaslee.  There are other examples of people waiting for ambulances that did not show up.  The newspaper headline referred to a case where an ambulance did not show up and the people on-site were told not to move the patient.  It was a no-show.  There are no-shows and late shows.<\/p>  <p>  Insofar as I can ascertain, dynamic deployment can only work if there are huge resources and increased numbers of ambulances and staff.  I understand the problem at the moment is the service has between 20% and 25% fewer resources in terms of personnel and ambulances than it needs.  In Mr. Reid's estimation, is the capacity of the service 20% to 25% below what is required?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021092300011#K01100","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632390600,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Throughout 2021 and, indeed, 2020, our National Ambulance Service and crews have been extremely stretched beyond their normal role as 24-7 paramedics.

I will make a short opening statement and I look forward to the questions from members of the committee.<\/p> <p>  Looking at where we are now, this week marked a critical moment in our public and economic health, with many people returning to their workplaces for the first time in a year and a half.  In about a month from now, if everything goes according to plan, almost all of the remaining public health restrictions will be lifted.  We can, therefore, be increasingly confident that, absent a vaccine-resistant variant emerging, the worst of the pandemic may well be behind us.  This is very important.  The past 18 months have been unbelievably difficult for all.  The disruption to family life, the pain of losing loved ones and health issues and the impact of successive, but necessary, public health restrictions hindered our normal economic and social life in an unprecedented and highly intrusive way.  Throughout the pandemic it has been clear to me that the Irish people have responded with resilience.  Ordinary people, business owners and especially our front-line workers have risen to the challenge in an extraordinary way.  In particular, I acknowledge all those who were part of the vaccination programme.  Let us be clear &ndash; the programme has been one of the most successful in the world.  We owe them a huge debt of gratitude.<\/p> <p>  For the Government, it has been our job to match the success of the vaccination programme with an economic approach that has protected incomes, supported business and invested in the health service.  I will make the case to the committee this afternoon that we have succeeded in doing that.  To date, the Government has made a total of &euro;48 billion available to mitigate the worst impacts of the pandemic.  All of our budgetary tools have been utilised, including direct public expenditure, tax policy and below the line supports such as credit guarantees.  For example, more than &euro;17 billion has been spent on the three main income and business support schemes, the pandemic unemployment payment, the employment wage subsidy scheme and the Covid restrictions support scheme.  These schemes worked.  The success of these and other schemes is clear from official data.  Most economic indicators are now moving in the right direction and, most important, people are returning to their jobs.  For example, there were more than 480,000 of our fellow citizens on the pandemic unemployment payment in February, while today that figure is closer to 110,000.<\/p> <p>  As we enter the next stage of the pandemic, and I hope the next phase is the final one, we must move on to the next stage of our policy response.  The counter-cyclical budgetary stance has served us well over the past 18 months.  Such an approach should continue to serve us well in the recovery.<\/p><p>With all economic indicators suggesting a strong recovery is in prospect, we need to be careful we do not add fuel to the fire by maintaining current expenditure, which would be at an unprecedented and unsustainably high level.  This is particularly important given potential trends in inflation.  Accordingly, temporary supports such as the pandemic unemployment payment are being phased out in a careful way.  Similarly, employer supports such as the Covid restrictions support scheme will also come to a natural end.<\/p><p> While the pace of the recovery has been quicker than many expected, I fully recognise that some businesses and employees will continue to need support.  This is why the Government has committed to maintaining the employment wage subsidy scheme until at least the end of the year, but this has not come cheaply.<\/p><p> Over the summer, we estimated a budget deficit of around &euro;20 billion for the year.  During the pandemic, borrowing costs were kept to a minimum as central banks in all major economies purchased government bonds.  This looks set to continue for the next few months but, thereafter, we can expect a change to how central banks engage in financial markets.  We can expect, over time, a gradual change in borrowing costs and gradual renormalisation.  Only time will tell how different the new norm will be from the old, but it will be very different from where we are today.  This highlights the importance of policy supporting a credible path towards fiscal sustainability, as reflected in the target of borrowing only for capital investment from 2023.<\/p><p> Having said that, I believe there are genuine challenges that need to be addressed.  Additional public expenditure will be required to meet them.  This is particularly true in respect of capital infrastructure.  The forthcoming national development plan will lay out a multi-year plan for a decade, outlining expenditure of over &euro;136 billion.<\/p><p> Borrowing to fund investment that raises long-term productivity which changes our future is the right thing to do, but borrowing for day-to-day expenditure is not.  The latter runs the risk of changing the living standards of future generations, who have to pay for it.  We are determined to minimise the debt-service burden on our children.  However, the next generation will and must benefit from an improved stock of infrastructure.  This is why the Government will continue to borrow for capital investment from 2023 onwards.<\/p><p> Let me elaborate on public debt.  It is approaching a quarter of a trillion euro.  To express it more meaningfully, this is the equivalent of around &euro;50,000 per person, a figure among the highest in the developed world.  At some point, the debt will either have to be paid back or, more likely, rolled over.  What is likely is that it will be rolled over to a higher interest rate because we cannot expect the exceptionally low interest rates of today to last forever, nor can we base a strategy on such an expectation.  We need to be aware of our obligation towards future generations.  This is particularly true given our ageing population and the impending transformation of the economy away from fossil fuels.<\/p><p> The budgetary strategy outlined in the summer economic statement tries to get the balance right, with a total budget package of &euro;4.7 billion.  On the expenditure side, core expenditure will increase by &euro;4.2 billion, including &euro;1 billion for entirely new measures.  The remaining &euro;3.2 billion will allow for demographic pressures and deal with any changes to public pay.  There will be a significant increase in capital expenditure of some &euro;1.1 billion.<\/p><p> A further &euro;500 million will be focused on some tax measures, and these will be outlined on budget day.  The summer economic statement outlines how, over the next two budgets, temporary Covid-related spending measures will be phased out.  A pathway will be provided to meet core objectives set out in the programme for Government.<\/p><p> In practical terms, this means the implementation of an expenditure rule whereby total expenditure is fixed at just over 5% growth per year.  This is in line with the trend growth rate of the economy.  The rationale for this approach is to ensure that temporary or windfall revenues are not used to finance permanent changes.<\/p><p> For next year, an expenditure ceiling of &euro;88.2 billion has been fixed.  A key point to note here is that the summer economic statement committed to decoupling expenditure from tax revenues that could be temporary, such as lower than assumed or higher than assumed tax revenues.<\/p><p> Let me be clear that managing the public finances involves trade-offs.  When we consider the challenges and the options for new expenditure, we see there are only three options: raising taxes, increasing borrowing and reducing expenditure in other areas.  Budget 2022 will aim to strike the right balance between these choices.<\/p><p> In conclusion, as is always the case in the run-up to any budget day, there will be decisions, including difficult ones, that need to be taken, but that is the role of the Government.

I compliment the Government on its handling of the Covid era.  It is not all over yet but it was very competently handled by the Government.  We have to be grateful for the fact that good management made it possible to be able to assist or borrow to the extent that we did over the period in question.  We must recognise that not all economies supported their citizens to the same extent as ours.  For example, some countries had no emergency payments at all, with no payments for the private sector, which was disadvantaged.<\/p> <p>  While we provided supports, the challenges have not gone away.  I agree entirely that it is necessary to improve public infrastructure to provide the services required for future generations.  We must realise our population has increased fairly dramatically since the 1950s and it is now incumbent on everybody to provide services for the much larger population, which is to increase in the future.  Housing, health, education and, more lately, climate are the challenges that have to be addressed.  I strongly support work in this regard.  It will be a difficult time because there are competing demands in the sense of keeping the economy on the straight and narrow path while addressing the challenges and ensuring our borrowing to make economic progress is manageable.  The Minister said the borrowing to date is still within manageable proportions and that we do have an economy that is sufficiently capable and robust to come through at the end of the day.<\/p> <p>  The other point that is worth mentioning is that Covid did not come alone; it came in the immediate aftermath of the financial crash.  Many people and businesses affected negatively by the financial crash still have not recovered.  On top of this, we had Covid.  It is worth commenting on the fact that we had the two challenges one after the other in rapid succession.  Due to careful management, it has been possible to come through the storm to date relative easily.<\/p> <p>  I have two or three questions.<\/p><p>On private savings, which is a considerable amount, how does the Minister see that affecting our economic performance into the future?  It could well contribute to further inflation if not handled properly or it could be of benefit in various ways.  How does the Minister see that unfolding and will be capitalised on to the benefit of the country at large?  On the 12.5% corporation tax, some commentators have already pencilled the possibility of a &euro;3.5 billion negative impact.  I am not too sure about that.  I think there is scope there.  We had discussions on this in the past few days with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  The resilience of Irish business and the corporate sector in this country is still fairly solid and it may well be possible, in my humble opinion, to manage around it rather than be overwhelmed by it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092300002#B00300","speaker":"1584","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632351600,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the questions.  I will deal with each of them in turn.  On the role of private savings within our economy, it is the case that those private savings are playing a role in the purchase of homes and decisions around the purchase of large items.  We may well see that come through in, for example, the VAT returns and the figures we have in regard to the purchase of vehicles.  Overall, private savings are playing a big role in the successful reopening of our domestic economy.  One of the reasons we are seeing a rapid fall in the pandemic unemployment payment is the reopening more quickly of domestic enterprises, with a higher level of demand than they may have anticipated.  Private savings are clearly playing a role in driving that consumption.  There is benefit in the ability of those savings to play a role in the growth of domestic economy, which would not be as touched by the very large multinational presence we have here, but we need to be alert to what this could mean for inflationary trends in the future and to monitor that carefully.<\/p> <p>  On corporate tax receipts, the monitoring and modelling that we have done of corporate tax receipts points to, over time, a loss of up to &euro;2 billion in annual corporate tax revenue.  It is worth saying that for some years that might not result in a direct fall, but in the rate of growth being less than that which has happened in our recent history.  This is the reason it is so important we reduce our reliance on borrowing to fund day-to-day spending and get to a point where the taxes we are collecting are paying for the public services we have at the moment.  It is also the reason changes in carbon tax, which are difficult and I know can be a cause of challenge for many, are still so important in broadening our tax base.  I believe that even with the change that may happen with our corporate tax revenue, we have the ability to get the health of our public finances to a safer place, particularly over the next two years.  I remain confident that the Irish economy will be competitive, resilient and able to retain and grow jobs into the future.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092300002#C00200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1632351600,"counter":307,"content":"<p>Do I have time for another question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092300002#C00300","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1632351600,"counter":308,"content":"<p>The Deputy has one minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092300002#C00400","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1632351600,"counter":309,"content":"<p>Health, housing, education and climate have been identified as priority areas, particularly housing and health, where we need to urgently build the infrastructure to the extent that it is capable of dealing with the increased demand in terms of demographic changes.

The Minister outlined the budgetary package of &euro;1.5 billion discretionary, &euro;500 million of which is for tax cuts.  He also mentioned the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  It has criticised these commitments and the fact that core expenditure rules permit these tax promises despite that they are permanent measures in nature.  I am not sure if the Minister is aware of this but earlier today, in the D&aacute;il, the T&aacute;naiste made a clear commitment in terms of indexation on taxation.

We will have that debate at another point.<\/p> <p>  I have heard some commentary that not all of the contingency fund may be drawn down next year.  I have heard some of the views of IFAC on that point.  One of the experiences I have had from using these contingency funds and putting them together is that draw down can at times come from unexpected sources.  I have the experience of where we were with the contingency fund last year.  We announced two different funds last October.  I never thought I would be in a situation where both of them would be used.  If they were used, I never thought that either of them would be fully drawn down.  However, I found myself in a position whereby the funds were nearly entirely used by the summer.

I raise the issue of VRT on new and imported fossil fuel vehicles, including so-called hybrid vehicles.  I raise the matter because, as the Minister knows, we have very ambitious climate action targets.  Transport represents 20% of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions and private cars represent the majority of emissions from that sector.  We need to follow the example of Norway and significantly increase taxation on the purchase and importation of fossil fuel vehicles.  The reason to do that is to prevent a lock-in of transport emissions over the next 15 years.  We have to do that quickly, as soon as possible.  It is better to do it sooner rather than later.  There are clear and serious climate reasons to do so.<\/p> <p>  We have had a significant build-up of household savings during the pandemic, as the Minister knows and as others have mentioned.  From a balance of payments perspective, the purchase of new vehicles involves a lot of money leaving the State, compared to other, more labour-intensive household spending items such as home renovation.  Our taxation system should reflect that.  The average lifetime of a vehicle is approximately 15 years so new fossil fuel cars will be part of the national fleet for a long time.  It is appropriate to give an increased price signal to reflect our climate commitments.  <\/p> <p>  While electric vehicles are getting cheaper, there is not yet cost parity between fossil fuel vehicles and fully electric vehicles.  We can use VRT increases on fossil fuel vehicles to achieve cost parity in the next year, as has been done in Norway.  As most people know, Norway has one of the best take-ups of electric vehicles in the world.  Significantly raising VRT on fossil fuel vehicles would be a progressive taxation.  It would target taxation at those who are wealthy enough to purchase a new vehicle.  The Minister said to me in a meeting a few months ago that the taxation system changed in January, when we brought in the new worldwide harmonised light vehicle test procedure, WLTP, emissions rating for VRT.  The information I have is that the top selling new car in Ireland is a fossil fuel sports utility vehicle.  It is clear to me that further market signals are needed.<\/p> <p>  Raising VRT for fossil fuel vehicles is also necessary to balance out the loss to the Exchequer from the increased take-up of zero-emission vehicles which attract a lower tax.  While stability in taxation policy is desirable, our significant climate action agenda means it is inevitable that we will need to frequently change VRT and, indeed, motor tax to ensure the State's income stream is protected.  I ask the Minister to consider a significant increase in the VRT charged on fossil fuel vehicles.<\/p><p>He should do so as a prudent move to ensure the sustainability of the Exchequer as well as of future greenhouse gas emissions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092300002#D00900","speaker":"1594","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632351600,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the points he has made.  He acknowledged, but I wish to develop a little more, the really big changes we made in respect of motor taxation last year, that is, the change in motor tax and the very significant decision we made with the introduction of the worldwide harmonised light vehicle test procedure, WLTP, using which we correlated the tax paid on a car with the impact it has on the environment.  The Deputy may be aware that we are already seeing clear signals that the changes we made last year are having a contributory effect in the change in purchasing patterns for new vehicles.  What we have seen up to this point in the year is already a clear shift in purchase trends toward lower emissions vehicles.  To give an example, in 2020 the average WLTP figure was 135.6 g of CO2 per kilometre.  It now stands at 122.6 g.  That is a real sign of change.  I will not say for a moment that the changes we made in the Finance Act last year are the sole reason for that, but they are part of the reason.  So far this year, we have seen up to the end of July a 33% increase in the purchase of electric vehicles and hybrids.  To put that in context, the figure for 2020 was 20%, while in 2019 it was 13%.  The rate of increase is accelerating before we make any change at all.<\/p> <p>  In the budget last year we changed the taxation of hybrids, recognising that due to the fossil fuel component of some engines the environmental or climate impact of some hybrids is not as positive as may have previously been understood.  We changed some of our tax policy to capture and reflect that.<\/p> <p>  As regards further changes, as the Deputy stated, having already brought in a sweeping set of changes, I would normally be careful not to follow that with another set of changes only a year later, but I am aware of the importance of the points the Deputy is making.  I am aware of the existential nature of the climate crisis that we are, for now, trying to mitigate and I will certainly consider the points the Deputy is making.  I ask him to be aware that this is in the aftermath of big changes already made that appear to be having a role in changing purchase patterns.  Further changes have to be considered in light of what we have just done and in the context of a car market and car purchases that have had an incredibly volatile 18 months.  We will certainly consider the point the Deputy has made but I ask him to be aware of those matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092300002#E00200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1632351600,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The cars sold in 2021 or 2022 will still be around in 2030, by which stage, obviously, the challenge is to reduce emissions across all sectors by approximately 51%.  Transport will probably have to do more than other sectors, so taxation policy should join with that target.  I know that every effort is being made to ensure it does, but we have to be absolutely confident that we are not creating a problem for ourselves in eight or nine years' time.<\/p> <p>  The second point I mentioned, of which I know the Minister is abundantly aware, is the wall of cash that is there.

I am curious why the Minister included that in the first version of his speech but then removed it.<\/p> <p>  I wonder whether his Government is not guilty of making the same mistake, particularly in the area of the significant expenditures that are going out on housing assistance payment, the rental accommodation scheme and leasing arrangements to private property interests because of the failure of the State to directly invest in and construct its own social housing stock.  As a result, we are currently in a situation, and will be for the foreseeable future as I read the plans of the Government, of approximately &euro;1 billion, a figure that will probably rise every year, going out in those sorts of payments to private property developers.  Is that not a very significant and poor example of spending money in a profligate way that we should avoid?  We need to replace that expenditure with direct investment in our own social housing stock, where the rental revenue will come back to the State and it would be able to reinvest those funds in more social housing.  <\/p> <p>  A figure being bandied around for Housing for All is that it will cost &euro;4 billion a year.  I ask the Minister to confirm whether that is accurate.  In our discussions with the Parliamentary Budget Office, it pointed out that the direct Exchequer funding is significantly less than that and that the Government is essentially hoping that more than 50% of the spending that would be required to deliver the 330,000 houses by the end of the period covered by Housing for All will come from the private sector.

It often seems like a sensible distinction to make but, when examined closely, is often a false distinction.<\/p><p>For example, we have significant skills and qualified professional shortages in a whole range of areas - the health service, construction and engineering and many other areas.  It seems to me that the way to address that would be to create additional places in colleges and universities, which would be current expenditure, by creating additional places and removing things like fees and other obstacles to people accessing higher and postgraduate education.  That would be current expenditure, but it would be an investment in the future which would save us money down the line.  I would make a similar point about our proposal that we should have things like free public transport.  It would be additional current expenditure, but in the future it would save us on things like fines for carbon emissions and so on.  Therefore, I question the merits of that distinction in many areas.  I could quote others but I do not have time.<\/p><p> Lastly, I pushed at this committee, as did other members, for the examination of tax expenditures, which the committee has agreed to examine.  There is a huge shadow budget that we have every year that is not scrutinised in the same way as the direct expenditure budget.  We are proposing that those tax expenditures should be examined in the same sort of way during the budget as direct expenditures.  I would like the Minister to comment on that, because in my opinion many of those tax expenditures are essentially tax loopholes which allow big corporations to evade tax.  To give the Minister one example, and perhaps he might comment on it, in the latest available figures for revenue, the cost of intra-group transactions, a tax relief, in 2019 was to the tune of &euro;16 billion in lost revenue.  I presume that is accruing to some of the big multinational corporations that use transfer pricing to avoid their tax obligations.  That is &euro;16 billion in just one category of tax relief.  Should these things frankly not be closed down, or at the very least examined in a detailed way as part of the budgetary process?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092300002#E00700","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632351600,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  Given the warning that he has issued to me about not speaking for too long, I will try to be quick.<\/p> <p>  In response to the Deputy's first question, I just made the same point in different words.  I apologise for two speeches being issued to the committee.  I will ensure the same does not happen on budget day.  On the Deputy's second point about the use of HAP and housing-related payments, I would love to be in a position in the future where we do not have to make as much use of those payments as we are currently.  However, while we are in a situation where we are building more public and social housing and rebuilding our social housing stock, I believe those payments play a role in supporting those who need long-term secure rental accommodation while more permanent plans and homes are being made available to them.  <\/p> <p>  Third, on the Deputy's point about capital expenditure, sometimes the line is more blurred than economic textbooks might indicate but, from a policy point of view, there still has to be a segmentation.  There is a world of difference between making a decision, for example, to hire 1,000 more teachers in any given year and committing to building a new public capital project that has a finite end point, at the end of which you can make the decision as to whether you want to maintain the spending or not with few of the difficulties that are sometimes associated with the management of current spending.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's final point on the review of tax expenditures, as a matter of policy we review all tax expenditures every three years.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092300002#F00200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1632351600,"counter":333,"content":"<p>First, I would like the Minister to comment on the intra-group transactions and the capital allowances, which are the two biggest categories of tax reliefs.  To my mind, they are examples of aggressive tax avoidance by major multinationals.  Tax relief in this category amounted to &euro;16 billion in 2019, around &euro;6 billion in capital allowances and, of course, there is the research and development tax relief.<\/p> <p>  I should also mention in respect of climate that the Minister is going to increase the carbon tax once again.  The ESRI has stated that that is regressive for people on lower incomes when they have little control over their ability to reduce their energy use because of, for example, the quality of their housing.  Is that not the case? Is the ESRI not correct?  Is it not the case that it is going to increase fuel poverty, particularly given that, for example, in most local authorities next year the retrofit plans for social housing are for only 1% of the housing stock, so many people will have no control over the heating they need to keep their houses warm, and the Minister is going to punish them with further increases in the carbon tax?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092300002#F00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1632351600,"counter":334,"content":"<p>The ESRI report also acknowledges that there needs to be plans in place that mitigate the effect of an increase in carbon pricing for those particularly who are on fixed income, which is why, budget by budget, we have made changes in the fuel allowance.  My recollection is that the changes that we have made have been successful in protecting lower income citizens within our society from the more difficult consequences of an increase in carbon pricing.  Data and evidence are also available to show that has happened.<\/p> <p> On the Deputy's point about the use of capital allowances and intragroup transfers, I disagree fundamentally with the Deputy in describing them as tax loopholes in any way.  That is just a consequence of the fact that we have so many companies located here in Ireland but are managing large businesses that take place in other parts of the world from Ireland.  That inevitably means that changes take place to deal with transfer pricing, the transfer of funds from companies within a broader organisation that are part of how larger corporations run their businesses.  I accept that the figures are high, but I do not accept the characterisation of them as being in any way tax loopholes.  To re-emphasise, all tax expenditures are reviewed every three years.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092300002#F00400","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1632351600,"counter":335,"content":"<p>The Minister is most welcome to the committee's proceedings today.  I can assure the Minister that I will give him as much time as he needs within the parameters the Chair will allow to answer the questions I have for him and the observations that I will make.  I will try to be relatively brief.  I wish to focus on the issue of corporation tax and the impacts that proposed reforms will inevitably have on the Exchequer over the coming period.  I note with interest the remarks made by the Minister to Deputy Durkan earlier on regarding the &euro;2 billion figure, which has been the received wisdom in terms of the extrapolated potential loss to the Exchequer essentially around pillar 1, to which we have fully signed up.<\/p> <p>  I think it would be useful, based on the remarks in response to questions to me from the International Federation of Accountants, IFAC, yesterday, if we might reassess the figures in terms of what potentially could be lost to the Exchequer and what the position might be over the next period, if we do in fact sign up both to pillars 1 and 2 of the OECD process.  I draw the Minister's attention to remarks made by Feargal O'Rourke of PwC on RT&Eacute; Radio 1 on Tuesday.  He seemed to suggest that the figures the Minister has cited and we have all cited repeatedly in respect of the potential &euro;2 billion loss were in fact developed before there was any real OECD articulation of any new global minimum effective rate of \"at least 15%\".<\/p> <p>  First, does the Minister believe that we are at a point where we need to reassess those figures?  Related to that, if indeed we do sign up to to pillar 2 of the process in time, does he think we may end up losing something on the swings and gaining from the roundabouts, to borrow a phrase?  My final question in respect of the corporation tax process is whether the Minister sees a landing zone on the horizon for Ireland that would allow him and give him the confidence to sign Ireland up fully to pillar 2 of the process, given what he knows at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092300002#F00500","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"speech","time":1632351600,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Nash for his questions.  I might try to dispose of his earlier questions quickly and maybe spend more time dealing with his final question.  His first group of questions was about where we are with estimated revenue loss.  We had to form those judgments regarding revenue loss early in the OECD process.  At that point, I believe that it was vital that we plug into our figures and the public debate an expectation that revenues will begin to change.  We will only be able to revise those figures when the full detail of how an OECD agreement would work is fully agreed and communicated.  We are still some way off that.  As further detail comes in, if that detail merits a revision of the figure that I have shared with the Oireachtas, of course I will update those figures and communicate it in the right way to the Government and the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's final point about a landing zone, before I answer the question, it is important that the committee continues to be aware that any decision that we make is a decision that will carry significant consequences.  I will outline two of those consequences for either of the choices that could become available to us.  The first is to acknowledge that if we were to go into an agreement and it has a higher rate in it than our current 12.5%, then entering that agreement means a change in the rate.  I note that in the current agreement as it is laid down, there simply is not clarity regarding what a future rate could be, since \"at least 15%\" can clearly mean any figure higher than 15%.  I know that the OECD process, as critical as it is, is merely part of the process in which overall change will take place in corporate tax policy in Europe.  It is also worth noting that at least being in an agreement carries with it our continued ability to influence corporate tax policy inside the forum within which global decisions are made and has benefits regarding engagement and the influence that we can have in the OECD on issues that are important to us.  If and when we get to the right point to make this decision, those are issues that I will want to elaborate on.<\/p> <p>  If we are not in the agreement, of course it is the case that it gives us the ability and capacity to continue to preserve the figure that is there at the moment.  Our rate of 12.5% has, as I have argued in many cases, been a deeply important element in our economic success and development to this point.  Alongside preserving our ability to do that, there are three other factors that will require consideration.  The first is the most understandable one, which has been the subject of public debate.  It is the reputational consequence of being outside an agreement.  As Deputy Nash knows, I believe that it is justified to be outside the agreement at the moment.  The second is the real possibility, which is different from where we have been before, of the ability of other jurisdictions to form a view that certain revenue streams and levels of profitability are being undertaxed and, in the context of a global accord being in place on these matters, the ability developing in the future to tax that revenue in different ways.  Were that to happen, that would also have a potential effect on the stability and revenue that we gain from corporate tax policy.<\/p> <p>  The final issue relates to the medium-term consequences of being outside an agreement and what that means with regard to our ability to influence the future development of corporate tax policy, especially and vitally within the OECD.<\/p> <p>  I have shown my willingness to stand by our corporate tax policy and rate at many different points over the past four years and now, with the decision that I have made to be outside the consensus.  It is useful to indicate to the committee that in any decision that lies ahead, there are consequences that will be meaningful and potentially very real for our economy, which the Government and I will have to consider if we get to a point in the coming weeks or maybe later in the year of deciding to enter not just the process but the agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092300002#G00100","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1632351600,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming in.  I have been listening intently to what he has said and to the questions.  He mentioned crises or challenges for the economy that may be coming.  We have housing, health and climate action, including carbon tax and public transport issues.  We are fighting many things on many fronts.  The Minister talked about the national development plan and the spending that will happen.  That all relates to the infrastructure that we need for the country to sustain itself over the next 15, 20 or 30 years.<\/p><p>I offer as an example the media reports about Intel having shortlisted a site in Oranmore in Galway for development and creating up to 10,000 jobs.  A project of that size in the west of Ireland would mean that we would need to have at least 12 counties supporting that with resources, supplies and all that goes with that.  It would be transformative for the region.  If this project were to be successful, we would need to make sure that we are building the required infrastructure, including the outer bypass of Galway city, upgrading our roads to Sligo, creating rail lines and improving the rail networks that exist, because we are talking about up to 10,000 people.  There is a challenge but also an opportunity.  How will the Government deal with this?  I asked the T&aacute;naiste about it yesterday and he talked about additional supports for people in the region.<\/p><p>The eight counties in the Northern and Western Regional Assembly have been re-graded to being a region in transition, a lagging industrial region and a moderate innovator.  The European Union has done a score sheet.  It states that the re-grading is due to a lack of expenditure <i>per capita<\/i>to create the basis to keep balanced development in the country.

How will we access the potential of Structural Funds from the European Union to do that?<\/p><p>That is my first question for the Minister.  How does he see those challenges?

I refer to where we are in the reopening of our domestic economy, the level of entrepreneurship, the excellence of our schools and the work they have done in reopening and getting children back safely.  There is much in our society and country that we want to do better, but I also make the case for many things that are going well and of much of which we should be proud. <\/p><p> The Deputy made a point on our ability to meet the needs he described, particularly those of the communities and counties he referred to.  That is why the national broadband plan is so important.  It was not an easy or simple decision to make, but the Deputy and I made the decision to go ahead with the national broadband plan.  Whatever criticism I got for making that decision would easily be outweighed by the criticism we would all receive if we did not have a national broadband plan being rolled out in the context of the massive change that could take place in many communities the Deputy represents outside of our larger cities.  This is why the national development plan will be important.  It looks to respond to many of the infrastructural and funding needs the Deputy referred to and to lay out how the funding will be made available to deal with these issues over a ten-year period.  The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, is doing considerable work on this and I hope it will be published imminently.<\/p><p> I am not in a position to comment on the speculation over the investment the Deputy referred to but I make the broad point that the fact Ireland is still perceived to be competitive and attractive for investment decisions recognises, notwithstanding all we need to improve on, that our economy, society, entrepreneurs, public services and Government are coming together to try to do well on. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2021092300002#G00300","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632351600,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and I recognise that we have many positives in the country.

The DSG is appointed on a three-year cycle and the current iteration is the fifth.<\/p> <p>  The DSG is not established to be a lobby group.  Instead, members of the DSG are appointed to work in partnership with Departments to monitor the implementation of the national disability inclusion strategy, NDIS.

Some 52% of disabled voters surveyed after general election 2020 reported that they faced barriers to voting.  With Maria N&iacute; Fhlatharta in the National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, I launched this survey following my own experience of voting in a corridor during general election 2020.  We wanted to hear the experiences of disabled voters after the election.  It is something that has not been done before.  I quickly found out that my experience was not an isolated one.<br\/><br\/>Barriers that disabled voters experienced included inaccessible polling stations.  Many disabled people were unable to vote in private, as <i>ad hoc<\/i>arrangements were put in place.  There was a lack of information in accessible formats.  Some survey respondents reported not knowing how to vote, or not being able to vote or to follow electoral debates, as a result of the inaccessible information.  There was a lack of personal assistants.  In many cases, that was due to the election taking place on a Saturday.  It was reported that some people had nobody to bring them to vote.<br\/><br\/>Of the respondents who used postal voting, 52% also reported facing barriers.  It was reported on social media by disabled people that they had to vote in their car.  My DSG colleague, Ms Annette Costello, has also experienced issues both with in-person voting and postal voting.  I will now hand over to her to allow members to hear her direct experience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021092300002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Vivian Rath"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632351600,"counter":419,"content":"<p>When I attended my polling station during the recent elections, I found that the wheelchair ramp fitted at the polling station was not installed correctly.  Upon reporting this to the returning officer as a safety concern, I received a dismissive response and was told I was the only person who had complained about it that day and three other wheelchair users had already voted.  In my experience, returning officers and polling station staff are not properly trained in disability equality.<\/p><p>This is a major concern.  People are also reluctant to highlight issues that distort information in the public domain.  As I recall, there was only one wheelchair-accessible polling booth at my polling station.<br\/><br\/>I and many other disabled people have also experienced difficulties with the postal voting system.  Postal voting is often cited as a more accessible voting option for disabled people.  However, the application process is unnecessarily complicated and based on a medical model of disability, requiring certification from a GP for the first application.  On an annual basis, a written confirmation form must be signed, completed and returned to the local authority.  However, local authorities require an original signed confirmation and will not accept it via email.<br\/><br\/>This process fails to recognise that the vast majority of disabled people will have their disability for life and it will not diminish.  Disabled people can find access to a postal vote has been removed despite no change to their disability status, with this occurring due to a systems or administrative failure, which I have also experienced.  In addition to the administrative barriers this presents, it also demonstrates a lack of respect and dignity for disabled people by requiring us to provide proof in order to access our right to vote time and time again with the postal system.  The timelines for completion and return of a postal ballot must also be reviewed as they are more onerous than those for people attending a polling station on the day.  A number of colleagues on the disability stakeholders group have informed both Dr. Rath and me of their difficulties in the Braille system during the general election 2020 vote.<br\/><br\/>Progress has nevertheless been made in accessible polling stations, and I am happy to acknowledge that.  However, this progress is fragmented and inconsistent across the country.  While correct installation of a wheelchair ramp is important, it must also be understood that accessibility extends further.  The National Disability Authority published the accessible voting checklist 2015 to provide this guidance.  We understand from meeting officials in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage that this is sent to returning officers before each election.  However, as demonstrated by our experiences as outlined today, problems persist.<br\/><br\/>Therefore, it is critical returning officers and all polling staff receive training in how to implement this guidance, as well as training in disability equality.  An evaluation of the effectiveness of the accessibility measures in place must be carried out after elections and a complaints mechanism should be established to further safeguard the voting rights of disabled people.<br\/><br\/>The establishment of the electoral commission<b><\/b>is another very positive development.  The DSG understands that one of its first tasks will be to carry out research into the postal voting system and how it can be reformed.  It is vital that disabled people are consulted during this process.  I will now hand back to my colleague, Dr. Vivian Rath, to discuss the issue of political representation of disabled people. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021092300002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Annette Costello","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632351600,"counter":421,"content":"<p>As noted by Mr. Fergus Finlay during the week, this is not about disability but rather inequality.  What we can discern from Ms Costello's comments, for which I thank her, is that we disabled people face inequality in our right to access our vote.  As members are aware, public participation does not end with voting and this is also about active citizenship, having one's voice heard, seeing action and being involved in the community.  It is about people feeling as if they belong.  Article 29 of the UNCRPD also calls on state parties to actively promote an environment in which disabled people can participate in public affairs on an equal basis with others and to stand for election.  The extremely low representation of disabled people in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad reflects the inaccessibility of the current environment.<\/p> <p>  Disabled people face many barriers to candidature, including the extra costs of disability.  There are accessibility barriers, including the unavailability of Irish Sign Language interpreters or personal assistants and inaccessible meeting venues, information and transport etc.  There has been a failure by political parties to select disabled candidates and a lack of supports for disabled people to engage with local government structures, such as their local public participation network, PPN, as highlighted in a report by Wexford PPN recently.  This leads to political invisibility.<\/p> <p>  To make progress in this area, we disabled people recommend that all parties undertake a cross-party political pledge to promote and support the election of disabled candidates.  In addition, reasonable accommodation must be provided for disabled electoral candidates to remove some accessibility barriers.  We must establish a fund for elected office to cover the cost of disability faced by disabled candidates.  Similar funds were established by a similar committee in the UK.<\/p> <p>  At local government level we suggest that guidance and a bursary is provided to county councils to support initiatives that promote participation of disabled people in order to facilitate their active citizenship.  Today, we, the disabled people, are sharing our experiences of being left off the decision-making table.  By being left out, we do not have the opportunity to contribute to our own destiny.  We are here, making recommendations on how best to move forward.<\/p> <p>  Following this presentation, some members may point us to the electoral commission but they too can bring about change.

I commend the Deputies and Senators who have engaged on these matters to date and who have taken the time to consider the submission I wrote for you all late last year.<\/p> <p>  I am a public representative who was elected as a local councillor in 2019 to South Dublin County Council.  It was my first time to run for election and, as I am sure it was for all the members here, it was and remains a huge honour to have won the trust of the people in my local community.  I work very hard every day to ensure the people I represent, including disabled people, have a voice at the decision-making table.<\/p> <p>  I am a disabled woman and members will have read in my submission that I acquired my disability during my 20s.  It took me a long time to be able to accept this, to say it out loud and not to feel shame.  As we all know, people with disabilities in the past were simply written off.  They were segregated from society, left in the shadows and considered something of which to be shameful.  The State supported this by providing institutions to hide children and adults that were considered \"less than\".  The stigma remains to this day.  While much has changed since those very dark days, moving from a medicalised system towards a more progressive social model, the stigma and the State continue to work to prevent disabled children and adults from accessing and participating with the world in a meaningful way.<\/p> <p>  I call this structural violence, which is defined as \"a form of violence wherein social structures or social institutions harm people by preventing them from meeting their basic needs\".  I ask members to consider how they felt when I read this aloud.  Did they agree or did they feel uncomfortable or defensive?  I can assure the committee that disabled people and their families feel this structural violence each and every day.<\/p><p>We feel utterly let down by the State and I will use my time here today to outline why.<\/p><p> How do we know that the State is complicit in structural violence against people with disabilities, who make up around 13.5% of our population?  We have any number of examples, and I will outline some of those now.  The first relates to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Ireland signed up to that in 2007, yet only ratified it 11 years later in 2018.  There are issues with a number of pieces of existing legislation that either require significant review, such as the Disability Act 2005, or Acts that are not yet fully implemented, such as the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  The optional protocol remains unratified.  It, crucially, offers individuals a complaints mechanism which would allow them to make a case before the UN to determine whether or not the State is living up to its commitments under the convention.  Without the optional protocol, we have no way to hold the State to account.  The optional protocol cannot wait, and I urge the committee to consider the impact this is having on children and adults with disabilities across the country.<\/p><p> Another example relates to diagnosis and service provision.  The new assessment of needs system is not fit for purpose.  I have been through this process under the old system with my son.  We had to fight for proper diagnostic testing which concluded, eventually, that my son is autistic.  Throughout that time, I was advised that a diagnosis was not important and that I was \"labelling\" my child.  If my child hurt his arm, I think we would all agree it would be better to know if the pain was caused by a sprain or whether a bone was broken.  The doctor would order tests, including an X-ray, and a sprain would be treated very differently to a fracture.  Tests and treatment, whether that be a cast or even surgery, would all be carried out very quickly.  However, when it comes to disability, whatever form that is in, we are told that there is no need to get a full picture.  I spent years researching online before we finally got a diagnosis.  With a diagnosis, we were able to understand his sensory issues around noise, food and touch, his core weakness, his executive functioning challenges and why he feels anxious and overwhelmed in the classroom.  Knowing this helped us understand our son so much more.  We were able to know what his needs are.  This is not \"labelling\" our children.  The idea of labelling is rooted in stigma, the thought process being that the diagnosis will follow my child, that somehow we should be ashamed of it or that it might hurt him down the line.  It will only hurt him if the State continues to do very little to combat this stigma.  While diagnosis is crucial, it would be remiss of me not to talk about the lack of services available to our children.<\/p><p> My son was referred for an assessment of need in 2014.  By the time he completed that process, like so many others, he had aged out of early intervention.  Services given during that crucial time have a much greater chance of being effective due to brain development and plasticity children experience during those years.  He missed out, like thousands of children who are left waiting while not enough therapists or resources are provided.  My son was then added to the school age team in 2016.  He is still waiting to be seen five years later.  He was first referred into this system at the age of three.  He is now ten years old and has yet to meet anyone from Chamber House.  Worse again, we were unable to afford much private therapy throughout this time.  I cannot begin to describe how devastating it is to watch my smart, funny and kind little boy grow up, knowing that he may never reach his full potential because the healthcare system in this country is abysmal and we did not have the disposable income necessary to pay for private therapy.  There are thousands of families just like mine across the country.  I know the members of the committee hear from them every day.  The members listen to our stories when they knock on our doors, and yet here we are.  I hope the committee will give this area significant attention as its work continues.<\/p><p> Another example of structural violence relates to access to education.  When we consider Article 24 of the convention, there are too many examples where the State is letting us down.  Children with disabilities and additional needs face barriers to education from the very start.  While some improvements have been made in early education, over 500 children were unable to access a primary school place suitable for their needs in 2019.  I have dealt with families whose children are six, seven and eight years old and are desperate to find a school place for their children, denied over and over again.  We have no idea how many children are on reduced timetables and we know that too many children are without suitable in-class support, with little or no access to a special education teacher or special needs assistant, SNA.  Too many schools still have no special classes set up.  A report published yesterday by the National Disability Authority, NDA, and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, tells us that when disabled children makes it through their school years, there are still too many barriers in place for them to transition from post-primary to third level education.  How can we expect our children to engage and participate in the world without access to education?<\/p><p> Another example relates to income for disabled people.  In relation to social welfare payments such as the invalidity pension, disability allowance, primary medical certificates, domiciliary care allowance and carer's benefit or allowance, the State in most cases offers a means-tested payment that is below the poverty line, which also fails to consider the additional costs that having a disability can incur.  When the pandemic hit in 2020, with hundreds of thousands of workers unable to work, the Government provided a payment of &euro;350 a week.  It was understood that this really was the bare minimum needed for people and families to cover basic necessities.  However, many other cohorts, including disabled people, did not see any rise in their payments.  I do not know if anyone here on the committee has ever had to survive on payments of just over &euro;200 a week.  I have, for a very long time.  During the 2008 crash, my husband lost his job, through no fault of his own.  I had recently been diagnosed with otosclerosis and was unable to access audiology services.  We then experienced cuts to our social welfare payments, rather than increases.  We could not manage on such a low income, often having to choose between heating our home or paying the electricity bill.  We have spent many years living in poverty, as have our children.  Poverty grinds you down.  It is death by 1,000 cuts.  With no end in sight and the State failing to provide any safety net for families like ours, we ended up losing our home, something I never thought could happen.<\/p><p> Poverty negatively impacts both the individual and society.  There is a wealth of evidence to demonstrate that countries that work hard to eradicate poverty do better more generally.  Poverty is a social problem created by the State and can be tackled with interventions and resources for both the individual and his or her local community.  Despite this, too many disabled people experience poverty.  We know that one of the most effective ways of reducing poverty is access to education and work.  Article 27 of the convention recognises the right of people with disabilities to work on an equal basis with others.  However, Ireland has one of the lowest employment rates for people with disabilities in the EU.  When an intersectional approach is taken, imagine how much more difficult it might be to access employment if someone is disabled and is also a person of colour, a migrant, a Traveller, a woman, a queer person or an older person.<\/p><p> I urge the committee to give strong consideration towards the provision of personal assistants, PAs, for disabled people.  A PA could help empower the disabled person, provide them with opportunities to interact with the world, possibly engage in education and may even allow them to enter the work force if they want to.  A PA could help provide autonomy, independence and freedom to a disabled person and is very different to home services.  This is especially important when considering the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, and could be a real game changer for thousands of disabled people.  <\/p><p> I ask all members of this committee to consider how their work and recommendations can make meaningful and lasting systemic change, to move the State from oppressor to ally and to ensure that the rights of disabled people under the convention are centred, respected and protected by the State.  Policy must be poverty-proofed and an intersectional approach will ensure that all people are considered when looking at policy changes.

I thank all members of the committee for listening and I am happy to answer any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021092300002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Carly Bailey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632351600,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for offering me the opportunity to speak before it today.  For those who do not know me, my name is Gabe Cronnelly.  I am married to a wonderful woman, my better half, Raphael.  I am a father to three teenage boys and live in a remote and rural part of Galway.  I have been an active member of my local community for over four decades and have worked in both the private and public sector.  Since 2014, I have been a serving member of Galway County Council for the Athenry-Oranmore municipal district.  These are just some of the proudest milestones I have achieved in life thus far.<\/p> <p>  However, it has not all been plain sailing.  Eleven years ago I suffered a life-changing injury that resulted in the amputation of my right leg.  An accidental discharge of a firearm by a friend during a cold winter&rsquo;s day left me in a pool of my own blood out in the middle of a bog in Athenry.  There were 13 operations to save my leg.  The 14th was to amputate.  For many weeks and months after, I was in total despair.  I could no longer work at what I used to do.<\/p><p>I felt as though I would be a burden on my family for the rest of my life.  Every type of negative thought one could imagine entered my mind during those early days.<\/p><p> However, through the support of family, friends and kind strangers, I found the strength to see the positives in my life.  I began to see the opportunities, as a disabled person, to get involved in local community groups, disability organisations, charities and fundraisers.  As a person with a disability, I decided that I was not going to allow my disability to hold me back but, rather, that it would spur me on.  I turned my disability into my ability to get things done.  I became involved in the Irish Wheelchair Association and in Paralympic sports and more deeply involved in my local community and sports clubs to further encourage and support young people with disabilities.  I joined Embrace, a survivors network for those who suffered death or disability through farm-related accidents.  I devoted more time to groups such as the Athenry Men&rsquo;s Shed and the Galway Parkinson's Association.  All of this helped me to become fit and healthy again, both mentally and physically.<\/p><p> When I look back over the past decade of my life, two things really stick out for me.  The first is a sense of belonging.  Having support groups and various organisations to contribute to, but also to lean on in times of need, really helped me through some of the hardest times of my life.  The second is that I remember when I spoke about strength and that I had to muster up the strength to try to live an independent life.<\/p><p> For too many people in the disability community, independent living is a distant dream and untenable prospect and that is not okay.  For too long, our disabled brothers and sisters have been neglected and pushed aside by our broken political institutions.  At present, disabled people make up 13.5% of the population and that is expected to increase to approximately 20% by 2026.  Our voices must be heard at local level and national level.  Currently, only one Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas has a visual impairment.  There are gender quotas in place.  I would like to see quotas extended to disabilities to achieve a sense of belonging for disabled people.  We too should have a reserved place at the decision-making table.<\/p><p> The microaggressions by the State are constant in terms of the inadequacies of public transport for disabled people, the inaccessibility of many buildings and footpaths, the disproportionate levels of poverty affecting people with disabilities and the major challenges facing disabled people in the context of access to voting.  The right to vote should extend to everyone, including people with disabilities, such as me.  There are serious concerns that people with disabilities are being challenged in polling booths when presenting alongside their assistant or carer.  There have also been concerns raised regarding inaccessible entrances to polling stations for wheelchair users, which has created a sense of further exclusion for disabled persons.  Serious changes need to be made to ensure people with a disability are not disenfranchised from exercising their democratic right at every opportunity.<\/p><p> My experience of living with a disability has opened my eyes to other marginalised groups with which I regularly work, such as Traveller and migrant groups, in my role as councillor.  It is through this exposure to people who are different from me that I have become a mentor with the Immigrant Council of Ireland's internship scheme.  I would like to see such a scheme put in place for disabled people.  We need to make space for everyone who has a desire to be involved in local and national government.  The political representation of disabled people has not improved substantially since the foundation of the State.  Disabled people are left wondering whether the policies that affect them could be a little different if they had more of a say.  Indeed, such internship schemes could and should be extended to all marginalised groups to achieve a D&aacute;il or Seanad Chamber that looks a whole lot more like the society it governs.<\/p><p> There are a multitude of issues that are discouraging or downright preventative for a political candidate in my position, such as the difficulty in trying to knock on up to 2,000 doors during local elections with a disability, the need to get up and down ladders while putting up posters, attending functions that are not always disability-friendly and planning to get to and from meetings using insufficient public transport.  In addition to quotas and internship schemes, funding should be made available to remove these barriers to people with disabilities standing as political candidates.<\/p><p> It can be difficult for people with disabilities who have entered politics here or in Britain to get their voices heard.  There is a lot of patronisation and a general belief that only the needs of disabled people are being considered.  This is a huge loss to the system because political parties, council chambers, the Seanad and the D&aacute;il are missing out on the experience of including disabled people.  This would be valuable to them in terms of policymaking.  People with impairments bring solutions to their own difficulties, so not to involve them is a massive loss to us all.<\/p><p> The party whip system further prevents many disabled people from speaking the truth when they disagree with policies that affect them.  Impaired people and disabled campaigners, therefore, may fear they will get lost in the party system, with no avenue to ensure their perspectives are fully considered.  We need to ensure that diversity and inclusion are at the core of all decisions being made.<\/p><p> I came here today to share my story with the committee in order that it can learn from my experience.  I experience my day-to-day life as an amputee and I am here to rally against the marginalisation and microaggressions that the State forces on me every day.  I want to raise up the voices of people just like me, and those of other marginalised groups, in order that we too can have a seat at the decision-making table.  I believe true change can only come from changing the system and the system has so far failed to meet my needs as a disabled man.  If we are to meet the needs of people like me in the future, we need to take progressive steps to realise this change.  I thank members for their time and for listening to me. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021092300002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gabe Cronnelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632351600,"counter":427,"content":"<p>I thank Councillor Cronnelly.

I have a couple of questions for Councillor Bailey that are also for Councillor Cronnelly, but I will just ask them of Councillor Bailey for now.  She spoke of the use of reduced timetables creating a barrier to disabled children's equal participation in and access to education.  What policies and oversight does she believe are needed to ensure that reduced timetables and the use of isolation, seclusion and restraint in schools and other settings do not disproportionately impact disabled students and undermine their right to full and safe participation in education and, beyond that, in all aspects of school life?  In the context of our discussion of participation in education, I do not know whether Councillor Bailey is aware of the recent decision to treat children with additional needs or disabilities slightly differently with regard to track and tracing, which is another participation problem relating to education.  Right now, the Department of Education is saying that children with additional needs will be tracked, traced and sent home if they are a close contact but kids who do not have additional needs can remain in the classroom.  That is another participation problem and seems to be quite arbitrary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021092300002#D00300","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632351600,"counter":429,"content":"<p>We are hearing stories regarding reduced timetables, kids being kept in isolation, restraints and all sorts of things.<\/p><p>One of the main issues is the fact that we do not know.  That is the answer.  There is no record being kept of, for example, how many children are on reduced timetables.  Why is that?  Is that in the best interests of the child or is that down to a lack of resources from the perspective of the schools?  I was at a meeting of the Children's Rights Alliance recently where there was a discussion about that very issue.  A review is being undertaken at the moment.  We have been assured by the Minister that the findings of that review are due to be published shortly.  It is not clear at this point what the recommendations on foot of that review will be.  That is going to require engagement from a number of stakeholders.  I see in my own school and in many others across the country that there simply are not the necessary resources or training for teachers in mainstream classes, never mind special classes.  The resources are simply not there to be able to help them get ahead of what they would call challenging behaviour.  Interventions before a child becomes completely overwhelmed often can be the difference between that child becoming overwhelmed or not becoming overwhelmed but staff do not have the time to be looking out for signs or indications that the child is getting overwhelmed and stressed.  It is going to be important, whatever happens, to centre the child if it is in the child's best interests.  I am not entirely happy that is always the case at the moment.  Schools are, for the most part, doing their absolute best but they are stretched beyond recognition.  <\/p><p> I am concerned and worried about the new, front-loaded systems that are being brought in.  Many schools and parents are of a similar mind on that issue.  It is going to be based on a profiling of the school that does not take into account individual children within the school.  That really needs to be looked at.  The review itself will be interesting.  There is a role for the committee to look at that issue as part of its work to ensure, as I say, the child's interests in terms of what is centred here.  We must have a record of what is happening is real time and must not make the whole process completely burdensome in terms of administration for schools.  The schools administration system is hard enough and is more difficult now that we have Covid-19 on top of it.<\/p><p> I will talk about the distinctions that have been made between children in special schools and those in mainstream schools.  It is not clear why that decision was made.  I know this issue splits parents, some of whom feel it is the right thing to do and that there should not be contact tracing unless a child is showing symptoms.  It is really important that our children are in school, particular those with additional needs and those who come from more disadvantaged areas.  Those children have already been hit more heavily by Covid than most groups.  The rationale for making the distinction is not clear.  There can be other comorbid issues going on with a child with disabilities and perhaps the Department is concerned that such a child would be more susceptible to illness.  The rationale is not there and it would be good to find out what that rationale is.  It is also important to talk to the schools and the parents to get a sense of what they feel is the right thing to do here.  The problem is that rules are being made by people at the very last minute and loaded onto the schools.  The schools are overloaded with information and that makes it difficult for a school to make a case as to why that is perhaps not the best way of doing things.  I hope the committee can have a look at those things, can see whether we can tease those issues out further and make the situation better if we need to.  I hope that answered all of the questions the Senator asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021092300002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Carly Bailey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632351600,"counter":431,"content":"<p>That did answer my questions.

I congratulate all our speakers.  Councillor Bailey mentioned the assessment of needs, the time it takes for assessments to be made and the delay and frustration involved.  She said she has to fight for everything.  I hear the same thing every day of the week in my constituency office.  Parents of children who have issues are trying to find the best way forward but the system seems to be tied up in the system as opposed to tied up with the child.  That is one area I will be working on with the Minister to try to get more changes.  The management structure has changed in Galway, where teams have been created.  However, the same people are being dished around in a different way and we do not have enough resources.  If Councillor Bailey has any other ideas on how that should be done, it would be appreciated if she would send them to us.<\/p> <p>  I also raise the matter of disability payments.  I would welcome Councillor Bailey's views on whether they should be tailor-made.  The payment Councillor Bailey might get could be different to the payment Dr. Rath would get because of their different needs and wants.  There are additional costs involved in being a disabled person and that should be reflected in the supports that are given.  I would welcome any comments or ideas Councillor Bailey might have, even if she does not share them today when I know she is tight for time.<\/p> <p>  I will have questions for our other guests later.

Councillor Bailey has managed to secure a position in the public sphere.  I know first-hand what an uphill battle that must have been.

Does the councillor believe that needs to be mandated across all parties and legislated for or should individual parties define their own inclusion strategies?  Does she believe there is a gap that local authorities should be filling in terms of the UNCRPD and its implementation?  I think we can all agree that since Ireland signed the convention in 2006, progress has been painfully slow and has primarily centred around the capital.

Deputy Canney asked about the assessment of needs, the need to fight and whatever else.<\/p><p>It is a very difficult process.  The reason it has been changed is because under the Disability Act, the assessment of needs is supposed to be done within a six-month period.  The difficulty around that is instead of arriving at a diagnosis or understanding better what is going on with the child, the legislation is clear in that what has to be done - and all that has to be done - is understand what the child's needs are.  Many children are getting an assessment of needs done, potentially even within the time limit, although there are still massive delays in many cases, which does not outline whether the child is autistic, has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, or whatever it might be, but simply states the child has needs and will be referred to either a multidisciplinary team or for speech and language or occupational therapy.  It does not give a clear picture of what is going on.  The system tries do that as quickly as possible and then one is moved onto a waiting list.  Essentially, the idea of being able to come to a diagnosis has been got rid of.  The legislation, as laid out, is being met.  One gets moved onto a waiting list and then, for the most part, nothing happens.  One is just sitting there waiting and ageing out on early intervention and moving to the school age team.<\/p><p> I want to talk about a couple of parts to that issue.  As I said, diagnosis is really important but so too are the services.  There is no point in having a diagnosis and then not receiving the services one's child needs, as outlined in the service statement.  What has happened and what we are finding, setting aside Covid-19, is staff were being redeployed from services to the assessment of needs, in order to try to get that through more quickly and then there are even fewer therapists left at the end of it, to help the child out when he or she has come through that process.  The committee could look at that to see what has happened.<\/p><p> Obviously, at the very beginning of Covid-19, we really did not know what was happening.  The priority was testing and, wherever possible, contact tracing.  A number of staff across the public sector were redeployed and while I will not say after things calmed down but once we got a better handle on them, instead of advertising for contact tracing staff, disability services and dental staff continued to be used.  The two areas that already were significantly underfunded and under-resourced before Covid ever struck were further disadvantaged because they were being used to continue to help fight the good fight against Covid, instead of people being hired to do those jobs.  I do not know if everybody is back from redeployment but we already had massive a waiting list and 18 months later, that waiting list has become such that I just do not know when my child or thousands of others will be seen.<\/p><p> We were told that, especially around Dublin, there would be a reconfiguration of disability services.  I have heard that for the past three years and nothing is happened and that was before Covid ever happened.  I would love the committee to understand what has happened across Dublin and, potentially, other parts of the country.  I am not sure about that.  What has happened around the reconfiguration of service providers?  Where has that gone wrong?  Why has that stalled?  What has happened?  We do not get any information.  Please do not focus only on assessment of needs.  It often gets the most attention but there is simply no point in having a diagnosis if one's child still is not able to access the therapies and supports he or she needs to help the child understand his or her world better and come through challenges he or she might face.<\/p><p> I am not naive enough to think payments being more individualised is even possibly something that could be on the table.  However, there has to be some kind of movement around figuring out extra payments, at least to cover the extra cost of disability.  That could include things such as the heating having to be on longer, electricity for oxygen tanks or whatever else.  There are loads of different examples and the stakeholder group would probably be well able to provide those.<\/p><p> The extra costs are real, even those such as travelling to hospital appointments.  My Dad is also disabled and is a wheelchair user.  He has spinal and heart issues and has been going to different hospital appointments.  We looked at the past few months during which he had nine appointments, seven of which were in Dublin, because he has to use specialised services.  I would be the first to say that I want my Dad, or anyone I love, to go to somewhere that has the necessary experience to be able to treat those conditions but he is not getting anything towards the cost of his diesel to get up.  He needs my Mum to come with him because he needs someone to push around a wheelchair if I am not available.  We worked out that each trip, including tolls and the rest of it, costs at least &euro;50 and that does not include things such as a cup of tea or lunch.  He had a number of those appointments and many people have to visit their medical provider quite frequently, especially when there is a disability or an ongoing illness.<\/p><p> There are many different ways of looking at what those extra costs are and how we can meet them for people and not just after the fact.  My Dad is in receipt of an invalidity pension.  Very little is coming in to him and yet probably half of his invalidity pension was spent on diesel over the past couple of months.  It really needs to be looked at how we expect anyone on a disability to manage all of that on just over &euro;200 per week.  It is just not feasible. Yes, things should be more individualised.  Is that administratively possible?  Probably not but there could be ways and means of looking at that.<\/p><p> On the uphill battle, I fully support anything such as a quota system. The only thing I will say is very often, when we talk about quota systems, especially when we have one that is trying to have more gender balance, the first instinct is to go into the 30% or 40% quota for women.  We still have 60% or 70% on the other side.  If we are doing quotas and whatever that may look like, it has to be expense of the other side and not at women's expense.  That is a really important point to make, but I fully support it and I think parties can and should be doing much better.  I make no bones about how being open about having a disability is a big deal.  I am sure Councillor Cronnelly would agree with me on that.  I am in a slightly better position, because, mine is the hidden one.  Unless I tell, one will not necessarily know about it.  I very much appreciate the privilege of that.  Something could be done about that.<\/p><p> It is also all well and good to have political parties decide to do more about it, and they should, but let us understand the barriers to running for election, which I will leave for Councillor Cronnelly to talk that afterwards, and those once one gets there.  Let us say one is successful in becoming elected as a councillor, as I have been, or in getting to the Seanad or the D&aacute;il, are those settings accessible?  Are they set up in such a way that it is possible for one to participate, rather than being there as a token?  I find it very difficult in the local authority.  Work is under way, although there has been no consultation with me as to what my needs might be, but I could not hear anything in the chamber.  The ceiling is very high and the microphone system is very old.  I have struggled with that time and time again.  Covid has come along, we have moved online and suddenly, I have no problem.  I can hear everything, participate, get there and attend all the meetings.<\/p><p> I appreciate there is a sense of not wanting to move towards that type of thing and of wanting to get back to the chamber.  I know it is on the programme for Government, but a hybrid system will be a huge game changer for so many people.  One wants to be there and attend but there definitely will be times, especially for disabled people, when one simply cannot do so but one could attend online.  It is as simple as that.  I strongly urge the committee to look at that because that would be a game changer for disabled people, parents and all sorts of different people who, in terms of their jobs and so on, might not have the same flexibility to take on becoming a local councillor as others might.<\/p><p>People who are self-employed can fit that around their job and set their own hours.  For people like me who are in regular work and do not have the same flexibility, being able to attend meetings online would make a massive difference.  They are some of my thoughts on this issue and I am happy to contribute further on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021092300002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Carly Bailey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632351600,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I want to add to the point raised by Councillor Bailey on the supports provided.  One aspect that would be helpful, which was a recommendation we made, is to ensure reasonable accommodations are fully implemented for disabled candidates, as well as for disabled Deputies, councillors or anyone in a representative position.  Currently, that is not really happening.  It is certainly not happening for candidates.  Reasonable accommodations are provided for under the legislation.  The structures are already in place; it is just not happening.  Reasonable accommodations provide supports to help disabled people engage fully in the workplace, school or other environment.  It is only right and just that those same reasonable accommodations are allowable and fully implemented for disabled people.  It is the same issue, as recently occurred, with Deputies or Ministers seeking to take maternity leave.  We need to see the mainstreaming of these services across all parts of our services, whether people want to be a county councillor, be fully employed or be in school.  It can be done very easily.  The Oireachtas committee could have a big role to play in moving that forward.

I thank her for providing a perspective from three different generations and three different aspects of disability.  I completely agree with her in supporting people with transport needs in travelling to important medical and health appointments.  It is an area for which we have to look at putting services in place.  I also agree with the intervention, as outlined by Dr. Rath, in the area of reasonable accommodation.  I recall being quite shocked when Brian Crowley, a member of my political party, was appointed to the Seanad.  He was the first person elected with a disability and ramps had to be put into the Seanad Chamber.  Se&aacute;n Connick, also from my party, was elected in Wexford.  We have not had anybody with a physical disability, apart from Senator Conway, elected since.  It is wrong and we need to address this.<\/p> <p>  I was concerned by what Councillor Bailey said in terms of the assessment of need, about which I will make two points.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, put a major effort and significant resources into what, at the time, was considered as a postcode lottery in terms of getting assessment of need.  In the past 12 months, that has come down by 92%, which, in my opinion, was a big move.  However, Councillor Bailey has said that this is not making a difference on the ground in terms of interventions for the children.  My second point is on the reduced timetables that Councillor Bailey spoke about.  Senator Ruane and I did a lot of work on this in the education committee and made strong recommendations on it.  Last week, the Minister for Education brought out strong recommendations that will be in place from January of next year.  These include monitoring, which Councillor Bailey mentioned earlier.  We found it was important to note that there was no record or monitoring of reduced timetables particularly impacting children with special needs and children from Traveller backgrounds.  In addition, a requirement should be put in place whereby Tusla should be involved and have to be notified if, in the most extreme of situations, reduced timetables are introduced, and parental consent.  I believe those recommendations were strong and took on board the recommendations of the all-party education committee.  Does Councillor Bailey think that will make a difference to it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021092300002#G00400","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1632351600,"counter":444,"content":"<p>My question is for Councillor Bailey and for other witnesses.

Dr. Rath asked what we as Oireachtas Members will do.  I reassure witnesses that, as a committee, we have agreed to formally push the Government to ratify the optional protocol immediately.

Councillor Cronnelly spoke about gender quotas.  I am a supporter of them.  When considering who is elected and the demographics thereof, ultimately, the buck stops with political parties in regard to that.  I would like to hear from the stakeholder group and from the councillors.  What form should that cross-party approach take?  What should and could parties do?

I will ask three or four questions first and indicate who they are for. I ask that witnesses take note of them in order for them to come back to the question, as the timeframe is quite small.  If they need me to repeat anything, they can let me know.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Rath referred to the survey he carried out with Maria N&iacute; Fhlatharta following the 2020 general election.  It found that 52% of disabled respondents had encountered barriers to voting.  Does Dr. Rath believe there are issues with how we currently evaluate voting accessibility and that it does not tally with disabled people's actual experiences?  If so, how can these concerns be addressed?<\/p> <p>  My next question is directed to all witnesses.  Repeated studies have shown that access to education and participation in all aspects of community life is an essential foundation for disabled people's full participation in public and political life.  While a handful of representatives across Europe have built a platform through disability rights work which has allowed them to enter politics, many of the traditional routes into politics are still unavailable due to poverty, which Councillor Bailey spoke to extensively, social exclusion and physical access barriers, which have a direct impact on the under-representation of disabled people in public office in all countries, including our own.<\/p><p>Councillor Bailey touched on the broader context in her presentation and on the exhausting administrative and psychological burden placed on disabled people by a labyrinthine application process and our current adversarial system when it comes to accessing supports.  What role does this broader social exclusion and difficulty in accessing information about available supports play in hampering disabled people from political participation?<\/p><p> My next question is for Councillor Cronnelly.  What supports are in place to assist disabled people to register to vote in their local authority area should they encounter any barriers in doing so?  Should their local polling station be inaccessible to them, disabled voters have the right to petition the returning officer for permission to vote at another polling station in the constituency.  Is he aware of any targeted resources to ensure that local authority voters are aware of the rights they have in this regard?  Are supports available for those who may face challenges in submitting the petition?<\/p><p> I have one more question that is directed at all witnesses.  Means testing and other restrictions around disability-related supports and payments have been highlighted in this committee session, as well as in previous sessions, as creating practical barriers and having a chilling effect on disabled people's equal participation in many areas of life, from education and employment to relationships and choices over where and how to live.  Could any of the witnesses speak to any issues they have encountered in their work where the current disability support system actively discourages disabled people from full participation in political and public life?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021092300002#G00800","speaker":"1681","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632351600,"counter":449,"content":"<p>I call on one of the witnesses to respond to some of the questions.

That is part of the failing.  It should be advertised in primary care centres, doctors' surgeries and so forth, where there are people with disabilities, as well as in schools.  There are also young adults who are reaching voting age, for example, in the migrant community and in the Traveller community.  They are allowed to vote in local elections but not in general elections, so we do not get diversity across the board.<\/p> <p>  I am sure Councillor Bailey will agree with my point on the means test.  Means testing for medical cards and so forth is a stumbling block for representation in politics.  One's disability does not change, regardless of what work one does.  If one goes into work and one's threshold is above a certain amount, one loses one's medical entitlements.  When one loses one's medical entitlements, all one is working for then is to pay for one's disability, which is wrong.  It is a violation of human rights.  As Deputy Wynne stated, that is structural violence of the highest order.<\/p> <p>  When one goes to an assessment, one is staring at a clinical sheet.  I speak for myself as an amputee.  What works for me does not work for somebody else.  It is the way that we deal with things.  The assessment should be broadened to individualise the disability.  That is part and parcel of what the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities should do.  This goes across education, school, work and so forth.  One must give the person with a disability the tools to be fully inclusive.  The expertise they have, due to the challenges they face, should not be dismissed anywhere.  Again, I can only speak for myself.  When one encounters trauma and acquired disability, one has seen both sides of the spectrum, in going from being an able-bodied person to a disabled person.  The current structure for those who are called \"disabled people\" is enabling disabling.  Why are the people themselves who have disabilities not asked what way they want to be described, what they want and what they require?  The information should not be dismissed because it does not fit on the page.  We are all individuals.  The needs of a disabled person are a little bit more complex and we need something tailored to suit each and every one of us.  There is something wrong if one has to work to pay for a disability, for example, when one goes over a threshold for something or other or there are increases in social welfare payments and that excludes one from something else.  One's disability changes as one gets older, but one's entitlements do not.  When a person is younger and more able bodied, he or she can do certain things but as he or she gets older, it becomes harder with a disability as the disability is a bit more degenerative in respect of the person's capabilities.  They do not change with it.  We must start taking an individualised approach to assessments and all along the line to suit each person rather than using a list that is created by an able-bodied person who does not understand disability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021092300002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gabe Cronnelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1632351600,"counter":451,"content":"<p>I will move on to Deputy Murnane O'Connor.

It is like everything in life, unless you or a family member is in that position, you do not realise that the system is not functioning correctly.  That is something we must address.  We have an excellent Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who has responsibility for disabilities, but my biggest concern is that in recent months part of her remit was to be with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  However, she is still in the Department of Health under the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  I am very concerned about that.  I ask the committee to write today to the officials in the Department of Health asking when the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, will come within the remit of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  That is so important.  Because she is being moved to a different Department, we must also ask what her exact functions will be and what we can do to help.  This will be a big step but it has been going on for too long.  It is not acceptable at this stage that she is still under the remit of the Minister for Health.  We must get clarity on the situation.  I ask that we seek clarity, get the date and find out what exactly is the function of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and what we can do to make sure that we give our full support and get the matter sorted.<\/p> <p>  Some of my questions were answered.  I read in the information that more than one in four people living with a disability do not use public transport due to reasons of accessibility.  In my constituency, it is only in the coming weeks that the train station in Carlow will be wheelchair accessible.  That is not acceptable.  We are living in 2021, yet we did not have a wheelchair-accessible railway station in the main commuter hub of Carlow.  That is such a big issue and we must address it.<\/p> <p>  Polling booths were a big issue during the elections, especially for people who were visually impaired.  We must make sure that we address the matter.  Another issue I am working on is the fact that Carlow Garda station is not wheelchair accessible.  These are things that should not be allowed to happen.  We on this committee should not allow that to happen.  These are the areas on which we need to focus.  Previous speakers such as Councillor Bailey and Councillor Cronnelly have spoken about this.<\/p><p>It is so important when a person is in a position to do so that he or she constantly fights.  The witnesses seem to be fighting a battle and there must be more awareness and understanding about it.  Councillor Bailey spoke about education, special needs assistants and special classrooms.  We must ensure we prioritise these more.  It is something I am really dedicated to.  All the members of the committee will be 100% committed to working and achieving what we need to achieve for people with disabilities to ensure there is access, understanding and awareness.<\/p><p> I thank the witnesses for coming today.

In trying to be well-behaved, I was perhaps too well-behaved.  I intend to be brief.  This has been a very interesting discussion and I am very conscious that the purpose of today's broad discussion concerns participation in political, cultural, community and public life.  While we are talking about all the other elements, it goes to show a holistic approach is required and it is not just about one standalone issue; it is about society demonstrating the diversity that properly represents it.<\/p> <p>  I am always mystified and surprised to find that even with a constituency as large as 650,000 - and if each of those with a disability only had two people who care about them, believe me when I say there are more, we are talking about almost 2 million people either directly or indirectly affected by matters - there is still a failure in society to properly integrate people with disabilities in the normal and daily life to which they are entitled.  On a personal basis I do not propose to give any examples because I would rather give the floor to people like Dr. Rath, Ms Costello and others in the group of witnesses who know what they are talking about from daily experience.  If political and public life represented to a greater extent more people with disabilities, matters such as assessment of need would be sharper, more pointed and better understood by public representatives.  Services would also be delivered in a better way because there would be clear and linked understanding of these issues.  No matter what, until one walk's a mile in somebody's shoes, one does not know the realities.  Councillor Cronnelly has made that point very appropriately.  I thank the committee for its time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021092300002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Renee Dempsey-Clifford"},{"type":"speech","time":1632351600,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I intend to speak as little as possible so that I can hear from our excellent contributors because it has been such a fascinating session.  I am very mindful of what Councillor Cronnelly said about everybody having a unique and individual experience of disability.  In looking at this in theory, we must also consider very specific experiences because everybody's journey is so specific.  For example, a reasonable accommodation is different for each individual.<\/p> <p>  With that in mind, I want to go back to postal votes and voting in general.  I know in the 2020 election there was a real question and the National Council for the Blind of Ireland was very critical of the attempt to bring Braille into the process because the information was delivered very late.  To get very specific about it, the ballot did not make any sense.  People were given a number and they had to check to what number corresponded with a candidate.  Why could somebody not just write the name of the candidate on the ballot paper?  It is something for which we have facilities.<\/p> <p>  I am also very concerned about the comments about still having to prove a disability every year.  It is something we see in other areas and I am very aware of it.  Is there something the committee could suggest right now to lead to people being recognised as having chronic and unchanging disabilities?  Perhaps we could suggest to the Minister that the matter could be eliminated from the process.<\/p> <p>  I would like to hear from some of the speakers who have had a very specific experience.  Ms Costello's description of a ramp not working is useful.  If people require Irish Sign Language but want to access a public participation network, it can be difficult to get that access every day.  Do Ms Costello or any of the other speakers wish to comment on that?<\/p> <p>  There is also the question of quotas.  The Civil Service, including Departments, had a quota for employment of 3%, for example, and I know this has been increased to 6%.  If we are using that model, the quota in the UK is 10% and we should be looking at the same number.  This committee should consider the use of quotas in political and public life in more detail.  These are the types of numbers we should be looking at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021092300002#J00400","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632351600,"counter":457,"content":"<p>A range of questions have been put in my direction over the past half hour and, unfortunately, I will not be able to get to all of them.  I thank Deputy Cairns for being the first member to attempt to answer the question I posed.  Deputy Hourigan followed up, and I appreciate that.  This is about what Oireachtas Members can do and it is constructive and helpful for disabled people to consider that.  Another important step is to include disabled people in the process.<\/p> <p>  We can just look at the Oireachtas committee and its membership.  Should we have disabled representatives sitting on Oireachtas committees?  Yes, we should.  Do people who sit on these committees and who represent people with disabilities identify as disabled?  These are some very quick steps to take.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cairns spoke about the pledge, which would send a signal from political parties about what they want to do.  A similar pledge was made in Scotland and members might look to that as a template.  We can do even better than that.  A number of key steps are set out that could be taken.  For example, there could be a pledge to ensure all political events will be held in an accessible and inclusive manner, perhaps using the universal design approach to meetings and gatherings.  These are suggested steps.  Members could ensure sign language interpreters are used in debates.  There may be only five or eight steps in the pledge but this would send the signal that the process matters to the Members.<\/p> <p>  There are some parties, although I will not name them as members probably know them, that have taken some very proactive steps already.  I am extremely pleased to see the Oireachtas committee is acting on the failure to enact the optional protocol.  As members are probably aware, I am a member of the Irish human rights disability advisory committee, so I have a role in the monitoring of the implementation of the UNCRPD.  The failure to ratify the optional protocol took the teeth out of the UNCRPD and took power away from disabled people.<\/p> <p>  We are skirting around the cost of disability, which has been mentioned a couple of times.  Many years ago it was estimated to be approximately &euro;200 per week.  A candidate with a disability, like Councillor Cronnelly, or me, who was a student union vice president, knows what is involved with running for election and extra costs arising because of the disability.  What can be done about this?  We must start investigating the possibility of implementing a fund to support disabled candidates when they are running for election.  That would be very helpful and aid in covering the extra cost of disability.  There is a system around that which has been shown to be working very well.  Perhaps if the committee wants to consider that, it could look to the UK, where there is a similar fund.<\/p><p>In terms of direct experience, the survey on the experience of disabled voters in an election in Ireland, which was carried out by Maria N&iacute; Fhlatharta and me and is the only such survey of which I am aware, was the result of my own experience.  I live in Wexford.  Prior to the last general election, I made the returning officer aware that I would need an accessible polling booth.  In the 2019 local election there was no such booth available to me and I had to cast my vote at an open table, visible to everyone as they came in and out, with many remarking \"Hi Viv, I know who you're voting for.\"  As that was not a pleasant experience, in 2020 I made the returning officer aware of my need.  When I arrived at the polling station, there was no accessible polling booth, which is a lower polling booth that is shielded from view.  It is a very simple request.  Unfortunately, it was not met.  In terms of options, I could vote at the table where I had voted on the last occasion, leave the polling station or cast my vote in the hallway.  I cast my vote in the hallway.  If some other voter, not disabled but from another background, perhaps a minority background, was told that he or she must vote in the corridor, what would our view be?  Why then do we think it is acceptable for disabled people? These are the questions we need to ask.  This is not about disability; it is about inequality.  The Oireachtas committee comprises political representatives.  This is a political topic.  Nobody knows more about the politics of this than the politicians.  You need to work with us to present the solutions and move this issue forward.  <\/p><p> Senator Ruane made an interesting point in regard to widening the markers around accessibility.  In terms of action, we need first to implement what is already there.  We have guidelines, the UNCRPD and a clear framework for what needs to be done.  We need to implement it.  Second, we do need to widen the guidelines and the markers, to make them more open and to bring in the wider participation.  I refer again to Wexford, my home county.  The Wexford PPN disability committee report showed that there is no permanent structure in place within the PPN or the local council to channel the voice of disabled people on the ground.  As everyone here will know, to engage fully in politics you must start at ground level.  <\/p><p> I will hand over to Ms Costello who has had her own experiences with voting, which, I am sure, she would like to share.

It is nice to see Ms Dempsey-Clifford, Dr. Rath and Ms Costello here.  I have met them before on this issue, when they educated me on it.  It is great to have them before the committee and to have this meeting broadcast to the country.<\/p> <p>  My first question is for Councillor Cronnelly.  I am a former councillor.  I got involved in politics because I wanted to advocate for people with disabilities.  It was one the main reasons I put myself forward.  My platform at that time was local issues and infrastructure.  As a councillor, one's focus is more on infrastructure than on policy.  I was really frustrated at council level because I felt that the issue of disabilities was not being taken seriously.  There was a tick-box exercise in terms of passing motions on disability awareness training, access audit training and so on, with councillors who tabled motions, as I did, being congratulated on getting motions passed not but councils were not really listening.  In the witnesses' experience how can we, at this level, ensure local authorities are implementing the UNCRPD, in terms of our public realm projects, infrastructure and how people interact in our communities, at ground level, which is where we all are?  <\/p> <p>  Councillor Cronnelly mentioned putting up posters on poles.  One of my chief election managers is visually impaired and so there were so many things that were not right for her as we went about our canvass.  The list was endless, from the wrong tactile surfaces to bad footpaths and so on.  I do not have time to go into it now.  We learned so much on that canvass about the inequity out there.  We are all equal but there is a great deal of inequity out there.  At a council level, how can I help the witnesses to push that equity onto our streets for people who have a disability?  It raises the bar for everybody in society.  I do not believe that any family is not affected.  Where I come from, 15% of the population have some sort of disability.  I would love to hear from Councillor Cronnelly on those issues and I thank all of the witnesses for their earlier responses to many of the issues I had intended to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021092300002#K00300","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speech","time":1632351600,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Costello to respond on the questions directed to her.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021092300002#K00400","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632351600,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I thank the Vice Chairman for this opportunity.  I will be as brief as possible.  On the supports for people voting, I acknowledge there are newspaper publications indicating that if a person cannot attend his or her local polling station, he or she can attend an alternative one but as with a lot of other things, the person has to be his or her own best advocate and acquire the knowledge.  For example, if I want to go to my local polling station and I know it is not ideal, I then have to research all of the other polling stations within my local area to see which one suits best.  It is as not simple as whether it is a building that is a single storey.  It is also about parking and whether one can get up on the footpath or if a ramp will be required.  While there is a facility to support people with the right to cast their votes, it is not as simple and straightforward as one would think.<\/p> <p>  A very easy solution to remedy the postal voting issue is a requirement to have a registration signed off by a GP, which I do not necessarily agree with.  I also think we should be taken at face value and should not have to renew that on an annual basis.  Some of the other points were addressed by the other witnesses.  I do not wish to be repetitive but I would like to make the point that the vast majority of adults will acquire their disability.  People like me, Councillor Cronnelly and others were able-bodied for the vast majority of our lives, but something happened and our lives changed.  We had to adapt.  We are still the same people with the same goals and ambitions but we have to be more creative about how we get around doing things.  It is fair to say that people with disabilities have a military operation every day to get out and about.  I astonish myself on a regular basis in terms of how I adapt and find solutions to things that when I was able-bodied, I did not have to give a second thought to.  We take so much for granted when we are able-bodied and then something changes and our whole perspective has to change.  I applaud parents who have to do so much hard work to get basic human rights for their children.  It must be heartbreaking for them to have to face that constant battle.  The word \"battle\" accurately describes what they have to do.  I am new to Twitter.  Every day I see parents taking to Twitter in regard to the most basic of situations.  It breaks my heart.  I can only imagine what it is like for them.<\/p><p>We touched on the costs of disability as well.  In recent days we have seen the Government talk about utility bills increasing.  A lot of the fuel allowances are means-tested and there are a lot of disabled people who want to work and contribute to society and they are at that stage where, as Councillor Cronnelly said, if they are working they are doing so to pay all the costs of disability, not to have the additional benefits.  The price of fuel is increasing at a high rate and having the fuel allowance means-tested is harsh, especially when so many people are dependent on fuel for their heat because they are not mobile and their body temperatures are not as good as those of everybody else.  We also have to charge wheelchairs, electrical equipment and breathing apparatus.  Those items are essential to our lives and they cost money.  It is not an option to forego charging a wheelchair in order to save some money.  People have to make those difficult decisions and it is heartbreaking to be faced with that in this day and age.<\/p><p> I am delighted to hear that the optional protocols will be pushed forward.

It should be based around rights.  Most political parties would have some sort of equality statement and they need to work on those equality statements to ensure there are steps and policies within them to bring disabled people right through the processes of their parties from beginning to end.  Political parties also need to examine whether they provide any extra funding to support their disabled candidates in elections.  If the political parties themselves started working and lobbying on this to ensure these steps were implemented, a difference would be seen straight away.  For instance, they could refuse to go on leader or public debates unless the venues are accessible and available to all.  Steps like that would be useful and they would encourage and promote disabled people in politics.  A first step would be a pledge and commitment to support disabled people to engage in public and political life.  It does not have to be rocket science; there can be very achievable steps.  The framework is already there and the key is to ask disabled people.  Disabled people running in the last local election who required sign language interpreters could not access them and that was appalling.  That is the level we are at and that is poor.  Steps also need to be implemented at local level to ensure that we can access the council governing structures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021092300002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Vivian Rath"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632351600,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I mentioned in my opening statement that the Immigrant Council of Ireland has an internship for migrants to get the feel of getting involved in politics.  There is no reason why such an approach could not be adopted by the various parties to bring disabled people in.  Unless these pilot schemes are carried out to try something out it is easier to say it did not work or that it would work if this, that and the other were done.<\/p> <p>  People make assumptions on behalf of people with disabilities.  If you want to know something about disability you should ask a disabled person because he or she will tell you.  That goes back to Deputy Hourigan's comments on proving disability.  I am sure members have come across the situation as public representatives where a young person comes of age to be entitled to domiciliary allowance instead of children's allowance and so forth and is asked whether that person still has Down's syndrome.  That is degrading and represents ignorance of the highest order.  Some conditions are for life and no matter what happens in the future they will not change.  The same is true of spinal injuries, acquired brain injuries and amputations.  Unfortunately I had to witness that myself.  A year after my leg was amputated I got a letter in the post telling me I had to go in and do a medical to prove that my leg was still missing.  Who comes up with these ideas?  Members will have heard of these scenarios and they will be aware of them but a clinical system that does not allow the individuals to think for themselves is being used and that is wrong.  My leg is not growing back although I would love it if it did.  I had to change my work habits as I had been working in the construction industry and in the blink of an eye, I had to change my outlook in life.<\/p> <p>  Ms Costello said that we have seen both sides of the spectrum of being able-bodied and being disabled.  It has made me a better person because it gives me an open mind to try to understand disabilities more because I am directly affected.  I see what I used to be able to do and what I can do now.  To me there is nothing I cannot do but it takes me longer to do it.  Again, it is a military operation that we have to plan.  If you take Covid, for example, if I wanted to go to Dublin I had to prebook a train ticket and if I wanted to come back down and have a disabled companion travel with me, there was no facility in place for me to book a disabled parking spot on public transport.  During the height of Covid I would have had to wait for an extra two or three hours in Dublin, where there was a high incidence rate.  I would probably have caught Covid in those conditions and brought it home to my family.  Capacity was reduced by 50% to allow for social distancing and so forth but there were still plenty of seats available for people with disabilities to sit in.  There was no priority given to them even though their needs are more complex.  I could not decide on the day that I wanted to go to Dublin at 1.30 p.m.; I would have had to book my seat.  I could not do anything off the cuff but if I was an able-bodied person that facility was there.<\/p> <p>  The issue of the public realm and so forth was raised.  The public realm is all well and good and I have no issues with it but people with disabilities are not consulted in public realm planning.  For example, if you take someone with a visual impairment, his or her guide dog is trained to walk with the kerb and we have seen outdoor furniture being used in disabled parking spots.  Tomorrow is Make Way Day and the blatant abuse of disabled parking spaces is systemic in this country.  Some people do not know that the appropriate fine is &euro;150 for parking in a disabled spot, going up to &euro;225 after a month when the normal parking fine is &euro;40.  People justify it by saying they only wanted a spot for a minute.  Ms Costello will tell you that if we have to walk down the road, we become worn out due to mobility issues by the time we should have reached our destination.<\/p><p>If one goes to Lidl or Aldi, the prime parking spots are right outside the door and in open view in order to make it accessible.  If the people directly involved in the consequences of misuse of spaces were consulted, disabled parking would be more accessible.  They look well and they have hatch box lines and so forth, however, due to the practicality of their use, many spaces are not fit for purpose.  Some are not wide enough.  The people concerned and most vulnerable to the abuse of these spaces are not consulted.  Rights come first, as far as I am concerned, and policies come afterwards to ensure those rights are upheld.  The stakeholders are the people with the disabilities themselves.  They are best placed to speak for themselves.  I am sorry if that was a bit of a rant.  This is my own personal view on the matter and I will argue with anybody over it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021092300002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gabe Cronnelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632351600,"counter":468,"content":"<p>Do the members have any further questions or comments?

However, this exercise will only be worthwhile if we take what has been said on board.  I was struck by a few points made by Councillors Bailey and Cronnelly, who are practising politicians.  I have known Councillor Cronnelly since the first day he was elected to Galway County Council.  He will recall that on his first day in the chamber there was a big hoo-ha because he needed to sit in a particular place due to his disability.  He needed to put his leg at the edge of the seating arrangement.  It took three meetings to get the arrangements right.  That was an incident that will forever live in my memory.  I recall at the time that Councillor Cronnelly took it on board matter-of-factly.  We dealt with it and convinced people that political parties did not have a right to particular seats and that they had to accommodate everybody in the chamber.  It was an incident that continues to stick in my mind since that day.  Councillor Cronnelly has come a long way in advocating for people with disabilities and for others.  He laid it bare before us today.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of issues that have come up which we need to address as a committee.  We should continue working on putting the optional protocol put in place.  We should not allow it to get lost in a fog of excuses about legislation.  The other matter is the assessment of needs for young children, which I spoke about earlier.  We need to press ahead to ensure if changes are made, they are effective.  I note the comment Councillor Cronnelly made about his leg.  He said that it will never grow back but he wishes it would.  He has said that to me many times since I got to know him, in relation to how people are assessed.  I know of a case of a child who is blind.  Every time the parents apply for something for their child, they end up having to provide the paperwork to prove the child is still blind.  This is degrading and is absolutely wrong.  We need to make sure that the rights of people with disabilities are upheld.  The optional protocol is important in that regard.<\/p> <p>  On the matter of representation in politics, we should take on board the internships referred to by Councillor Cronnelly.  We should say that as of today we are going to advocate for this to be put in place on a pilot basis.  In regard to people with disabilities who are in politics, we should do a survey to find out how many are within local authorities.  Perhaps as a group, we should come together to advocate.  Today we have heard some powerful words.  Words are okay but we need to convert them into action in collaboration with the witnesses.  We should not consider that today's work is done or that the box is ticked.  We have spoken to these people and we need some action.<\/p> <p>  The right to vote is a right everybody has.  There should be no ifs, ands or buts about it.  The right to vote in privacy is what this is all about.  I look forward to working with the witnesses.  Today is the first engagement with this sector on political representation.  If we do anything as a committee, we should progress and advance this issue.  In the next election, be it local or national, more people with disabilities should be elected not on a token basis but on the basis that we require them within the system in order that they can be part of the legislative process dealing with the issues they face, as well as the issues everybody else faces.  It is incumbent on us to ensure that happens.  It is a challenge but we, as a strong committee, will do our best to make progress.<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their contributions.  Today has focused us on the areas that we need to work on.  I thank the Vice Chairman for her skill in ensuring everybody got a chance to say something.

While the incidents at Gorey and Ballymore Eustace will properly be the subject of discussion today, it is important we set out the broad challenges facing Ireland in ensuring the quality of our drinking water, the water we swim in and the health of our rivers and lakes.  They are all part of the same ecosystem.<\/p> <p>  The programme for Government states, \"Water infrastructure deficits impact on the provision of safe and secure drinking water, lead to pollution and environmental damage, and present a challenge to achieving sustainable development across urban and rural Ireland\".  The programme sets out a range of commitments to address infrastructure deficits, the need to adapt to climate change, and to progress institutional and regulatory reform in the water areas.<\/p> <p>  The past decade has seen a significant period of institutional reform in the approach to the delivery of water services and the promotion of wider environmental protection.  However, complex and pressing challenges remain and it is crucial the reform that has taken place since 2013 is built upon to meet the challenges now being faced.  First, institutional reform must be completed to ensure Irish Water is in a position to deliver on its potential as a world-class public utility to serve the current and future needs of the Irish people.  Reform of the delivery of rural water services must also be progressed to support rural communities.  Second, a sustained high level of investment is required to ensure Ireland can meet its obligations to comply with EU water and wastewater requirements, to ensure our infrastructure is resilient to cope with the challenges presented by climate change, and to support housing and regionally balanced economic development in line with the national planning framework.  Finally, we must protect our rivers, lakes and groundwater by modernising our legal framework and by working across government to address the causes of dispersed pollution, including through actions that coincide with, or support, national objectives in addressing climate change and biodiversity loss.<\/p> <p>  Recent Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, reports, including the most recent report on the state of the environment in Ireland, have shown a concerning trend of decline in the quality of the waters in our rivers and lakes over the past 10 years.  It is also worrying that this is impacting on rivers and lakes of previously excellent or high water quality.  Key actions must include credible management measures to address agricultural discharges and investment in urban and rural wastewater infrastructure, which are the two most significant pressures on waters.<\/p> <p>  I will turn to the Government policy on institutional reform.  Last February, the Government published the paper entitled Irish Water - Towards a National, Publicly-Owned, Regulated Water Services Utility.  The paper set out clearly that Irish Water must evolve to take full control of the water services workforce and of its assets.  The paper pointed out that unnecessary risks would arise to the safe and effective delivery of water services unless further service integration was progressed.  As the paper states, a fully integrated national utility provides \"clear and effective lines of authority, responsibility and accountability.  In particular, the necessary alignment between [the] operational control and statutory responsibility [will be] ... achieved, thereby minimising risks to service delivery.\"<\/p> <p>  Local authorities and their staff have worked closely with Irish Water under the service level agreements established to get Irish Water up and running, but the limitations of this model are clear.  A process commenced under the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, to seek agreement on new arrangements that give Irish Water full control of service delivery.  Formal talks took place in July and further talks are scheduled for next month.  However, it is clear, in light of the EPA findings of \"abject failure of operational management\" at Gorey and Ballymore Eustace in recent times, more immediate steps are now required to improve operational management and to rebuild trust in the delivery of our water services.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, set out a number of steps regarding his expectations in this regard last Saturday when we met with managers of Irish Water and the local authorities.<\/p> <p>  On investment, Irish Water, backed by sustained high levels of Government funding, is well-placed to develop the systems and services Ireland needs to serve our citizens in the 21st century.  In the immediate term, as part of budget 2021, the Minister secured funding of more than &euro;1.4 billion to support water services.  This includes &euro;1.3 billion in respect of domestic water services provision by Irish Water, being met by the Exchequer from the Department&rsquo;s Vote.  This overall investment will deliver significant improvements in our water and wastewater services throughout the country, including rural Ireland, and support a range of programmes delivering improved water quality in rivers, lakes and in the marine area.<\/p><p> In the medium term, the recently published Housing for All strategy recognises that investment in our water infrastructure is vital to reaching our target of 300,000 new homes by 2030.  In respect of domestic water services investment, there is a commitment of &euro;4.5 billion to be spent on vital infrastructure in the period 2021 to 2025, including on projects focused on supporting growth and future development, with particular focus on those supporting housing delivery.  Irish Water is continuing to work closely with local authorities across the country, ensuring that investment supports the growth of identified settlements where these are prioritised in line with their development plans.  My colleagues from Irish Water can give more detail on investment priorities, including town and village investment.<\/p><p> Through local authorities, the Department is working to deliver &euro;95 million of capital investment in the rural water programme for the period 2018 to 2021.  We are examining the wastewater requirements of villages and similar settlements that do not have access to public wastewater infrastructure serviced by Irish Water and are engaging with local authorities to quantify and qualify the number of villages and similar settlements that may be supported by this new scheme.  This process is at an advanced stage and will feed into the development of proposals for consideration by the Minister.<\/p><p> We also need to respond to the challenges of climate change, biodiversity crises and ensuring that our waters are well protected.  We would be doing the taxpayer and citizen a disservice if we undermined our investment in water infrastructure by not protecting the sources of our drinking water.  The measures required to take this overall approach to our water environment are set out in our national river basin management plan.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, will launch a new six-month public consultation and dialogue on the draft of our new six-year plan next week.  It might be of interest to the committee to discuss that plan at a future date.<\/p><p> I thank members for their time today.

Wexford County Council, which operates the plant on behalf of Irish Water under a service level agreement, dealt with the issue on site and completed a repair by 24 August.  Irish Water was notified of the issue on 26 August and immediately notified the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and the HSE.  The HSE advised that a boil water notice on the supply was not necessary at that point, as the incident had passed and the plant was operating correctly.<\/p> <p>  On 23 and 26 August, Irish Water customer services received complaints relating to discoloured water and potential illness in the community in the Gorey area.  On Thursday, 2 September, an increased number of reported illnesses were notified to the Irish Water customer contact centre.  The HSE also confirmed that there were reports of multiple illnesses in the community.  Irish Water issued an update to elected representatives in the Gorey area and updated our website advising customers that an issue had occurred and to contact their GPs if they felt unwell.<\/p> <p>  Given the seriousness of the failure at the Gorey treatment plant and the potential impact on public health, Irish Water activated its incident management protocols as soon as we became aware of the problem.  All relevant staff have now been briefed on the correct procedure in respect of reportable incidents.  Key systems and daily plant checks are being reviewed and a programme of works is in place.  Plant staff have received immediate refresher training and will receive further training in the coming weeks to avoid any recurrence of an incident like this in future.<\/p> <p>  I will provide some background to the Ballymore Eustace water treatment plant incident.  On Friday, 20 August, outside of normal business hours, the coagulation dosing system at the plant partially failed, meaning that the cryptosporidium and disinfection barriers were compromised for a number of hours.  Dublin City Council, which operates the Ballymore Eustace plant on behalf of Irish Water under a service level agreement, did not report the incident to Irish Water at the time it occurred.  The issue came to light on 30 August on investigation of related issues at the sludge treatment facility at the plant.  As soon as Irish Water became aware of the issue, it notified the HSE.  As the incident had passed, immediate public notification was not required.  Irish Water also formally notified the EPA of the incident and the site was audited on 9 September with the EPA, HSE, Irish Water and Dublin City Council in attendance.  Irish Water activated our incident management process and we are carrying out a post-incident and process review.  Irish Water has placed personnel on the Ballymore Eustace site to review the escalation and response protocols.  Staff retraining is being provided by the Irish Water compliance team to plant engineers and supervisors on how and what water quality incidents should be notified to Irish Water.  Dublin County Council management and plant staff are working in collaboration with Irish Water in a joint response to the issues.<\/p> <p>  I will outline some of the actions being taken following both incidents.  The protection of public health is a priority for Irish Water and 99.9% of the water we produce meets or exceeds the required standards and is safe to drink.  We rely on sampling and alarms to maintain high-quality standards, which is why when something goes wrong, it should be reported immediately so that we can take corrective actions or, where necessary, stop production and put out a boil water notice.<\/p> <p>  Irish Water has been proactively engaging with key stakeholders since becoming aware of these incidents.  We have been keeping the HSE fully apprised of our response to date in respect of its role as statutory consultee to Irish Water in matters of public health and we are co-operating fully with our environmental regulator, the EPA, to review both incidents and to implement measures to avoid any recurrence of similar incidents.  This is ahead of receiving the full findings of the EPA audits.  Our customer service staff at our contact centre have been fully briefed and are proactively following up with customers who have contacted us to discuss concerns that they may have and to deal with specific customer complaints that may have arisen.  Irish Water briefed elected representatives in Gorey at a councillor clinic on Monday, 20 September.<\/p> <p>  Following a meeting on Saturday, 18 September, with the Minister for Housing Local Government and Heritage and the chief executives of Wexford County Council and Dublin City Council, we have implemented the following immediate additional measures: we have prioritised a knowledge audit of the largest 20 water treatment plants in the country, which includes site visits and meeting relevant staff to ensure that proper processes are in place to deal with and escalate any future incident; we have proactively communicated with all local authority chief executives and directors of services nationally on the critical need to report incidents in a timely manner at all of the plants they operate to allow for risk assessments to protect public health; refresher training of all relevant water services staff nationally is being accelerated; and we will audit all water treatment plants over time to ensure that knowledge of all protocols is in place.  Where appropriate, Irish Water will also put staff on site in water treatment plants to ensure the continued safety of water production.<\/p> <p>  I would like to apologise again for both incidents.  While equipment failure and human error can occur, the late reporting of issues relating to the process failures at the plants left us unable to react and compromised water quality.<\/p> <p>  I will outline the implications of these incidents for the single public utility that my colleagues in the Department mentioned.  The current service level agreement, whereby Irish Water works alongside 31 local authorities to deliver water services, is no longer fit for purpose.  The issues that have arisen at the water treatment plants in Dublin and Wexford clearly show the limitation of the present ways of working and emphasise the urgent need for change.  Irish Water has legal responsibility but no direct control over water treatment plants around the country.<\/p> <p>  The Government's water sector transformation policy paper sets out the necessary transformation to a single public utility model where public water services will be controlled and managed by one national organisation.  We need to be clear that this is not a criticism of the thousands of experienced water services professionals working in the local authorities.<\/p><p>We want to address structural issues in order that the individual on the ground can avail of clear lines of communication and national support systems that a single organisation can provide.  Drinking water incidents can and will occur, and it is essential that we put the best possible structures and systems in place to reduce the frequency of such incidents and to deal with them effectively when they do occur.<\/p><p> It is critical that moving to the single public utility is progressed as a matter of urgency.  Irish Water is fully committed to the talks process under way at the Workplace Relations Commission, with further engagement to take place next month.<\/p><p> I will move on-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021092300002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Gleeson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632351600,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt you, Mr. Gleeson, but I need to move on to give members time to ask questions.

You are ruthless today, Chairman.  I will stick to the six minutes, you will be relieved to hear.  I thank everybody for coming.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to farmers.  Every time one comes into a committee meeting, reference has to be made to the farmers, the discharge and all that.  It is important we put on record that no sector of society has paid a bigger price or makes a bigger contribution to water quality and the environment in this country than farmers, who are facing into it again in terms of climate action targets and the nitrates directive.  Ultimately, responsibility for water quality rests with the EPA, Irish Water and, obviously, the Department.<\/p> <p>  Moving on from that, I wish to hone in on two specific points and I am happy for the witnesses to come back with the responses at the end or whatever the Chairman directs.  In the Irish Water contribution it is stated that Irish Water has prioritised a knowledge audit of the 20 largest water treatment plants in the country.  This arises from the meeting with the Minister at the weekend.  I do not think that is sufficient.  If Irish Water is saying 20, and even if one goes on the basis of one per county, there is a large tract of the country where Irish Water is not carrying out an audit.  Particularly as there is an imminent handover of the service from local authorities to Irish Water, there should be a full and complete audit of all treatment plants right across the country.  Can we get a list of the 20 plants?  Why is this audit not being completed across the entirety of the network?<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise a second point.  I agree - I think everybody does - that while we might not have agreed with Irish Water at the outset, it is critical now that we move very fast to a single-purpose utility.  I appreciate there are industrial relations issues at the moment, and those need to be resolved.  However, the kernel of the point I wish to make is that I believe there is undercapacity in terms of the number of staff working within the local authority network at the moment.  How engaged is Irish Water with those employee numbers?  Has it had much engagement?  Where there are existing vacancies within the network, for example, will it be Irish Water's view that ahead of any transfer over to Irish Water, those vacancies will need to be filled?  More than anything, it reads true on what Mr. Gleeson said about the incident at the weekend.  This was human error.  Human error in the main happens because facilities and services are not properly staffed, and it is very clear and evident that that was largely at the core of what happened at the weekend.<\/p> <p>  To summarise the question, how aware is Irish Water of understaffing at the various treatment plants?  I do not want to go into specifics because I know there are other members to come in.  Can Irish Water advise the local authorities to fill those roles?  If this service transfers over to Irish Water, these roles certainly will not be filled afterwards.  Therefore, if it is the case that this is transferring over to Irish Water, I want to see a situation whereby optimum staff levels transfer over and we are not transferring over at 90% or 85%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021092300002#C00300","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632351600,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I will answer those questions.  The Deputy raises some good points.  Human error is a large problem in these situations and we do need to make sure there are sufficient resources on site.  We certainly support the local authorities.  We know there are vacancies but we are supporting the local authorities in filling those vacancies.  There are certainly no budgetary issues behind those vacancies.  We are struggling with the local authorities to fill some of those vacancies.  Because of the current set-up, people do not see a career in water services, and I believe the single public utility will address that.  We will certainly try to fill all those roles before they transfer, and when people transfer we will continue to fill roles.  There is no great drive to reduce numbers.  We do want to bring in some efficiencies, but the first thing we need to address is public safety and public health.  That is my priority and it has always been a priority of Irish Water, so budgetary issues will be secondary to that.<\/p> <p>  I might bring in Ms Attridge on the audit situation.  We will start with the top 20 and will do that within the next two weeks, but we have 800 water treatment plants around the country so we are moving those audits further out.

Likewise, if we detect issues at plants, we will inform the HSE, so there is a continuous communication between Irish Water and the HSE through very formal structures - not through hospitals or GPs but through the HSE's own structures.

While people will focus, understandably, on the issues that arose in Wexford and Dublin, this meeting request was made before that.  It is important that we focus as well on infrastructure and constraints, particularly with reference to the small towns and villages growth programme which is geared at delivering in areas of growth potential which otherwise would not be a priority for Irish Water, given the understandable focus on big urban delivery schemes.  However, investment in this area is key if we are going to meet the targets in Housing for All.  Connections is a key barrier that is raised with me consistently by stakeholders in the construction sector.  Some &euro;97.5 million has been approved by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, for the scheme and councils across the country were asked to prioritise their areas of investment.  Realistically, we are only looking at the first priority area in most of the counties, including in Waterford.  The frustration is with the glacial speed at which these projects are moving.<\/p> <p>  I will give a local example, not to be parochial but because it speaks to the wider issue.  There is a developer in Waterford who is ready to break ground today for 19 family homes in Lemybrien in County Waterford, but there are issues and constraints with water and wastewater that have been identified by Irish Water.  These issues were identified in July 2019.  It was shown that studies and tests needed to be carried out with regard to both water and wastewater, which are still not completed.  I was assured they would be completed during the summer, and now I am assured they will be conducted in October.  I accept the bona fides of people in that regard.  However, with regard to what needs to happen here, and this is a direct question for Mr. Gleeson, is there a resource issue in this area?  Second, can he reallocate funding across to this area so we can progress with the design of the priority two, three and four areas in the local authority?  Then they would be shovel-ready projects and we are not looking at developing designs two years hence which ultimately will not go through the planning process, funding phase and build phase until five years' time.  Can we get many of them progressed at design stage if we front-load money into the scheme, to speed up the process both in the scheme in Lemybrien and in other areas?  Can Irish Water do tenders for such schemes in tandem with the planning process so we can look at streamlining the process?  It is a massive constraint, and it will be over the next number of years if we do not grasp this nettle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021092300002#D01400","speaker":"1647"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632351600,"counter":516,"content":"<p>It is a very good point.

If we prioritised what is normally at the top of the list, we would spend much money on large towns, on wastewater compliance and such.  Many smaller towns and villages would fall off the end.  It was appropriate and far-sighted to hive off a certain budget specifically for this important purpose to support national rural strategies.  The issue is that there is much work in deciding what to do.  The initial communication with local authorities was last year.  Much work has been done on that.  We are trying to advance everything as soon as we can.  Some 15 projects have been approved and there will be another tranche shortly.

The witnesses referred to boil notices in different areas.  I am from County Limerick.  I have been involved in construction all my life and I understand the process of building houses.  Fedamore, County Limerick has had a boil notice for 18 months and it is going round in circles.  Those 18 months have cost people in houses there between &euro;40 and &euro;50 to bring fresh water into the house for a family of four.  That is not acceptable.  That is my first question.  It is on the record of the D&aacute;il since I have already said this.<\/p> <p>  I had an open, frank meeting with Irish Water four weeks ago, relating to a site in Croom, County Limerick.  The site is delivering 56 houses, a nursing home and a cr&egrave;che facility.  Croom recently got a &euro;20 million new school, a primary care centre and an extension to its hospital.  It is an expanding town.  All that is needed to progress these 56 houses is a service agreement from Irish Water, which has been delayed for the past six months.  Irish Water yesterday received &euro;4.5 million in its account to provide the water supply that is needed from Limerick to Croom.  The company stated that it will have this delivered by 2023.  All I need from Irish Water is a service agreement that there will be water in Croom by 2023, which it told me at the meeting would be provided.  Houses will not be built overnight.  I can have 56 houses ready for 1 January 2023 and have people in them.  I can have vulnerable people who want to be in nursing homes in one in 2023 and all that is required from Irish Water is a service agreement.  The services are on site.  The sewerage systems have been laid by the local authority and the contractors for years.  They are waiting.  All Irish Water has to do is a service agreement.  It is holding up 56 houses, a nursing home and a cr&egrave;che facility.<\/p> <p>  All I want from the first frank meeting that I have ever had with Irish Water is connectivity between Irish Water and us, and to get answers.  I want answers about the service agreement for Croom and when the boil notice will be lifted, after 18 months, in Fedamore, County Limerick, and will come back in later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021092300002#E00400","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632351600,"counter":521,"content":"<p>We have reduced the number of boil notices around the country significantly but we still have challenging areas.

Is there an alarm system process whereby, if there is a motor failure, a dosing failure or whatever it might be, the system that is monitored and there are reaction times to deal with those alarms?

I have a couple of questions on staffing levels, although I understand the witnesses might not have the figures to hand.  Could I have an indication of the differences in staffing levels in the wastewater treatment plants between 2011 and now?  Has there been a significant reduction since Irish Water was established from the position when this was managed by the local authorities?  I understand that comes from the local authority side of things.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Gleeson said that when the issues happened in the Gorey treatment plant, the HSE said it was not necessary to put out a boil water notice.  What was communicated to the HSE and did it indicate its reasoning at that stage as to why it did not feel it necessary to issue public warnings following the incident?  There has been a great deal of discussion about the creation of a single utility and it was stated that having everything fall under Irish Water service level agreements with local authorities will no longer be the case.  I recall that when Irish Water was set up, it was said that local authorities would still retain a certain capacity and that service level agreements could be in place.  Will Irish Water indicate that if staff from local authorities fall under Irish Water, the management of wastewater treatment plants will at no stage be given out to private operators to manage to generate efficiencies?  We know what people will say at this stage of the process but we do not know what is going to happen in ten years.

Our main aim will be to recruit a direct workforce trained by Irish Water and held accountable by Irish Water.  We are not aiming to bring in contractors to run services; we will use contractors to supplement.  Where there are outages, where there are additional problems around leakage or where we have a plant issue that needs additional resources to fix a particular problem, we will use contractor resources.

I welcome the guests to the meeting.  I acknowledge the very fine work that has been done in my area in the last number of years.  A fantastic treatment plant in Youghal in County Cork was opened a number of years ago, which has meant that the Blue Flag beaches have been retained and the Ironman event was able to take place down there, and will take place again, thanks to the work of Irish Water.  Carrigtwohill also has a fantastic treatment plant, one of the most modern in the country open with great capacity.  Of course the big one, which was opened very recently by the Taoiseach, is the Cork Lower Harbour main drainage scheme, which took 44,000 wheelie bins of raw sewage per day out of the harbour.  I want to acknowledge the good work that is being done there and thank the witnesses for that.<\/p> <p>  On the flip side of this, which is the reason this meeting has been called, is the infrastructure for the small towns and villages growth programmes and the constraints that exist.  Some colleagues have suggested that Irish Water is acting almost as a planning regulator because people cannot build houses and go ahead with their plans for housing because of the constraints.  That is very evident in my own town of Midleton.  Very recently there was a CPO of land to put in a pipeline and build two pumping stations.  As regards CPOs, does Irish Water rely on voluntary agreements rather than going through the process?  My understanding from talking to local people is that if you can get voluntary agreements on CPOs, for wayleaves in particular, it is a lot faster and cheaper but there is another process going on that is far more formal and legalistic.  That is something the witnesses might take on board.  If Irish Water sat down and talked to the landowners and developers who control or own the land and try to get voluntary agreements it might be a lot cheaper and faster.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for our guests from the Department.  With respect to CPOs and planning, it seems to be a bit frustrating that Irish Water is CPO-ing land for wayleaves and pumping stations and then it must wait for that process to be completed before it can start applying for planning permission.  Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh in particular might be able to tell me this.  Are there plans to speed up that process by allowing utilities to apply for planning at the same time the CPO process is under way?  Does the legislation have to be changed to allow that?  It would speed things up enormously if that were the case.<\/p> <p>  The other big town in my area is Mitchelstown.  I know there is some work ongoing there but the witnesses might come back to me on that.  We are back to the reason this meeting was called, which is constraints.  We cannot build a doghouse in Mitchelstown because of the constraints.  It has been highlighted locally and there is a lot of frustration there.  In Castlemartyr, there is a developer ready to go.<\/p><p>Until he gets clarity and some kind of understanding or perhaps an agreement with Irish Water, however, he cannot even start the planning process. There is one village and two large towns in my area where developers and builders want to build.  There is an unbelievable demand for housing, yet they cannot proceed because of the constraints and because of Irish Water's wastewater treatment capacity issues.  I am told it will be 2023 before a pipeline to pumping stations will be ready in Midleton.  Again, that sound like an awful long time.  It seems to take forever for plans to get done.  I am told it would only take a couple of months to do the physical work but the CPO process, planning, tendering and all that stuff seems to take forever.  Is there any way that can be speeded up?  People are frustrated about it.<\/p><p> A builder is ready to go in the village of Glanworth in north Cork.  The wastewater treatment plant there is not fit for purpose and needs an upgrade.  He is going to contribute, in proportion, to the amount that would be linked to the houses he wants to build and yet he is finding it difficult to make any progress.  It needs to be done because it is in bad condition.  That is another small village in which a builder wants to build houses.  He is ready to go and wants to build but cannot because of the constraints.  I am sure colleagues all over the country have similar stories.<\/p><p> The witnesses might come back to me, although maybe not today because I know they are questions about specific locations.  Perhaps the suggestion with regard to CPOs, planning and even tendering could be telescoped together to make things move a lot faster.  They are the issues I wanted to raise.  I wanted to impart the frustration people have and highlight the significant demand for housing, and the fact that Irish Water is being seen almost as another planning regulator, and, practically speaking, in many instances, it is another planning regulator in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021092300002#G02500","speaker":"1515","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632351600,"counter":569,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

We are reviewing that.  We are trying to go quicker.<\/p> <p>  On the CPO side, we always engage on a volunteer wayleave.  That is where we start.  Typically, however, we end up in the CPO process.  It just turns out that way for whatever reason, especially in the areas of wastewater treatment.  People want wastewater treatment in their towns or village.

On the issue of the CPO, again, there are enactments going back to the 19th century that govern all of this so it is a very complex area.  I am not sure what the position is in terms of the CPO legislation generally.  In terms of the overall streamlining of planning, however, it is an objective of the Department and the Government under the Housing for All plan to try to streamline the process.

I want to broaden the discussion a little to water and wastewater quality.  It is a bit disappointing that the Department did not include in its opening statement an update on the ongoing European Commission enforcement for our failure to meet adequate wastewater treatment standards at a number of locations.  As attendees will know, the most recent EPA report identified 19 urban areas, towns, villages and cities where we were in serious breach of the wastewater treatment directive.<\/p> <p>  First, can we get an update on where the EU enforcement is at?  How many of those agglomerations are still in breach?  What is the revised timeline for when they will all be brought into line with the directive?<\/p> <p>  Second, with respect to Irish Water, the most recent EPA report identified 113 wastewater treatment plants at risk of falling outside of adequate standards on a number of indicators, including more than 30 that were pouring untreated sewage into our rivers, lakes and waters.  A total of 52 public drinking water supplies are at risk of not meeting adequate standards.  Will Mr. Glesson update us on the number of wastewater treatment plants and drinking water systems that are currently at risk?<\/p> <p>  This question is addressed to both the Department and Irish Water.  I know that colleagues have rightly been raising the need for new water supplies.  We have 556 residential areas, mainly in rural Ireland, that still have not been connected to the public water supply.  Can we get an update on what levels of increased funding will be provided for those?  It seems that until the existing residential areas in those counties are connected to the water supply, it will be difficult to provide new infrastructure for new housing.<\/p> <p>  On a final point, I note that in both statements, there is an argument that what happened in Vartry and Gorey strengthens the case for the move to a single utility.  I am a bit sceptical and the reason is that all the figures I have quoted would be the same tomorrow if there was a single utility.  This is not, therefore, just about the governance structures; it is also about the level of investment and the responsiveness to the at-risk water and wastewater treatment supplies.  I would be interested to hear how a single utility will advance any of those.  I presume the timelines for addressing all those problems will be the same whether we have the service level agreement to 2025 or whether we have a single utility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021092300002#H00700","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632351600,"counter":575,"content":"<p>I will answer and perhaps Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh can follow up.  On the single public utility and implementation of projects, we work closely with the local authorities, but, in effect, Irish Water is fully in control of capital projects at this stage.  The single public utility, therefore, is much more applicable to the operational issues.  As far as implementation, however, the single public utility is to a fair degree already there.  Irish Water directs all of the asset delivery type works with the co-operation of local authorities in certain areas but it is very much under our control.<\/p> <p>  The issues around delivery very much relate to planning, CPOs and so on we discussed earlier.  Once we get boots on the ground, we can deliver.  We will have to get back to the Deputy with all the figures he requested for this year because they do get updated.  We will perhaps be able to supply those by the end of this session or at least by the end of the week.<\/p> <p>  We will start work on 11 of those untreated agglomerations where raw sewage is going into the sea.  They will start this year with boots on the ground.  We will deliver those on schedule and we will have the vast majority of those untreated agglomerations completed by 2025.  We have reduced that number.  The volume of wastewater that was entering the seas and rivers has been reduced by 60% since 2014.<\/p> <p>  We have, therefore, made an awful lot of progress.  Our systems and processes are there, but, as I said, our greatest challenge is probably the planning and judicial review process.  That is where most of the projects are held up.

My colleague, Senator Malcolm Byrne, will talk about the specific localised contamination issues and Deputy Cathal Crowe is also here.  I wish to talk about Irish Water in a broader context.  While recognising the significant improvements and progress that have been made and also recognising the challenges, we need to have this conversation in the context of the social and economic challenge with housing and the housing crisis that is affecting everybody of every age.  One of the big concerns of the general public is that it is eight years since the establishment of Irish Water and in that time there was a decade of undersupply of housing, which we are now trying to respond to with Housing for All.  However, what concerns me is that I do not see in the presentations today how the organisation is geared up to deliver on Housing for All.  When I talk to people and councillors in every local authority around the country, from County Donegal to County Kerry to County Louth, there are issues with water quality, contamination issues, boil water notices and capacity issues in the water supply and in wastewater treatment.  I am repeatedly told by local authority members, members of the public and stakeholders in the construction industry that one of the greatest barriers to increasing housing supply is a lack of water and wastewater treatment infrastructure.  I will send Mr. Gleeson an email afterwards as I will not go through every example I have, but I can give multiple examples of housing developments of 15, 30 or 100 houses that are being held up.  Representatives of the CCMA are present and I want to hear from them in reply as well.  The CCMA and the local authorities will complete housing needs assessments this year for every local authority.  That is a very important development in helping us to understand where the housing need is and, most importantly, where housing delivery is going to be targeted.<\/p> <p>  I want to understand from the three parties represented today.  For the Department, there are the planning delays.  Three to five years is unsustainable.  That is basically saying we are adding three to five years to the housing crisis.  We need a plan to reduce that timescale.  We need to know in respect of the housing needs assessments that are being completed by every local authority that Irish Water and its capital plans are tied into that, so there is an understanding in every local authority of where it can plan and deliver homes.  I want a response from the three bodies on that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021092300002#J00500","speaker":"1656"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632351600,"counter":582,"content":"<p>I will start with the Department's point of view.  The Senator is absolutely right that the provision of water services is critical to housing delivery.  It is stated in the Housing for All document that we will not build the houses unless we provide the water services.  The Government is providing &euro;4.5 billion for investment in water services over the period of the plan.  That is significant investment.  Mr. Gleeson will speak to this in more detail, but there are a couple of positive developments happening here and it speaks to the strength of Irish Water as a national utility.  Irish Water has for the first time produced wastewater capacity registers and water capacity registers, so there is clear sight to all involved of where there is sufficient capacity in the system, or about to roll into the system, to facilitate the development of housing.  That feeds into the local authority development plan process.  There should be agreement between local authority ambition and the strategic approach to planning and the ability of Irish Water to service that development.<\/p> <p>  One will always hear stories about where development is held up because of a lack of capacity or some delays.  I was speaking to Mr. Gleeson in recent days and Irish Water has some powerful, graphic information on its ability to service the housing demand.  When one looks at it as a whole, the vast majority of development is serviced, and in a timely way.  Perhaps Mr. Gleeson will speak to that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021092300002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Feargal &Oacute; Coigligh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632351600,"counter":583,"content":"<p>The capacity registers are extremely important and a big development.

We will give the go-ahead in 2022 because we know that their completion will be in line with our completion.  We do work with them.  We also work with developers on diversion of storm water so we can increase capacity.

To follow up on that for Senator Fitzpatrick, as Mr. Gleeson outlined, we have capacity in the vast majority of towns and cities.  Irish Water has distributed water and wastewater registers that will indicate where they are to people.  They have been issued to the local authorities, the EPA, the CRU, the Department and approved housing bodies.  We are trying to direct people to where capacity is immediately available.  We also have growth programmes running in our capital investment plan, such as the networks extension programme and the local network reinforcements programme, as well as the local housing activation fund that specifically targets existing bottlenecks in our networks.  Where we have local constraints we work with developers and our customers to try to find local solutions while the long-term capital programme is being delivered.  As Mr. Gleeson said, it can take three to five years, but in practically all instances we can find local solutions, such as surface water removal, on-site storage and attenuation and so forth.  To put that in context, in 2020 we were in a position to approve connection offers for 34,579 homes and we were only in a position to refuse 125 connection offers for homes.  I fully understand that sometimes it can take a little time to come to a local solution, but the numbers are that, in 2020, 34,579 homes received a connection offer and we were not in a position to facilitate connection offers to 125 homes.

However, there are a number of logjams in the system, including labour, to meet our construction projects, but bigger than this is the provision of water and wastewater infrastructure, as we have been discussing.<\/p><p>It is of paramount importance that the first thing to happen is a national audit to realise the capacity issues.  I have heard concerns today and on numerous occasions in the D&aacute;il about how wastewater is stalling connections in housing construction all over the country, especially in towns and villages.  I can offer an example of a new estate in Dublin where wastewater is stored in an industrial-scale tank and removed by a slurry tanker at least weekly.  It is shocking to me, as a practitioner in construction, that this is allowed to happen.  It does not seem appropriate in our towns.  I question its compliance in a planning context.<\/p><p> The Land Development Agency has, as we all know, maps of State lands to identify development sites for social and affordable housing.  Our local authorities also have sites to procure.  Have the stakeholders here met with the agency and local authorities to assess the logjams in the water and wastewater systems?  If they have, is there a plan in place to allow housing to proceed where there is capacity, and a mitigation plan to open up capacity where required?  It was noted earlier that there is a capacity register.  Can that be made available to us?  I would be interested to see where the capacity is and where the logjams are.  If it is possible, I would like to put my questions to all the witnesses, starting with the CCMA.  I thank them in advance for their answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021092300002#J01000","speaker":"1574","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632351600,"counter":588,"content":"<p>The Deputy referred to meetings of local authorities and the LDA with Irish Water.  It is a regular feature of our business.  Going back to an earlier question, it is part and parcel of our spatial planning.  We have to look at capacity in different areas with regard to zoning and so on but when it comes to the crunch, with builders ready to go on-site and the time requirements, it adds pressure to the dynamics of supplying housing or business development in particular areas.  In dealing with 31 local authorities, Irish Water and the main businesses in the Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway areas, with teams out in the various regions, we have regular meetings about these matters and pressing demands of services.  Apart from the operational requirements of water and wastewater treatment plants, this occupies a much larger space on our agenda, if the Deputy understands what I am saying, because of the demand for infrastructural development, the programme for housing, Housing for All, and so on.  I cannot speak about the LDA.  I would not be familiar with it in my neck of the woods in Laois.  It is not a big player in the area.

Even though we might not be speaking much, we will take the lessons learned back to our system.  I do not want to go over earlier issues again but for local authorities and the CCMA, the top priority is always public health and public safety in everything we do, not just water.  We have an escalation process and well-established systems.  We appreciate that further investigation is happening.  We will take the lessons learned by Irish Water, the EPA and so on seriously, and apply them around the country.  There is no doubt that our role in water services has changed over the past eight years and that has been well covered.<\/p> <p>  I will go back to the question of County Donegal in particular.  I might comment on that with regard to Housing for All.  There is no doubt that we have capacity in certain locations for water and wastewater but we hear over and over again in our council chamber that we are driving people into towns where there is capacity, when they want to live elsewhere.  In many villages and towns, we consequently hear that they end up closing schools or reducing teacher numbers, have reduced numbers for GAA teams and so on.  These are practical, social issues to think of throughout society.  What will our public policy response to that be?  That is a wider issue.  We are now working on an action plan for the new Housing for All scheme.  It was welcome for small towns and villages in Donegal when it was talked about last year.  Irish Water and our own water services and planning staff worked well together to come up with those lists and prioritise what was needed to tackle something that was probably considered to be a poor relation in the water system for many years, with some legacy issues.<\/p> <p>  To address the scale in Donegal, &euro;8.6 million is the likely grant.  Those small-scale works could take several years.  That includes the first 11 on the list.  Another six have no sewers at all but the need is great.  That feeds into some other contributions.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that we will need to work closely again with Irish Water on Housing for All and the practicalities of delivering on the Government's programme.  There is much work to be done in the locations that people want to live.  That will require investment.  I have no doubt that we can do it, provided the money is there.

Following up the earlier comments I made, I am looking forward to hearing directly from them about the service agreement for Croom.<\/p> <p>  A survey was done in 2019 of the waterways and I will use Limerick as an example.  It showed the biggest polluters in Limerick are the local authorities.  Enforcement notices have been served on people by the local authorities.  They have been served on farmers, businesses and householders.  They are being penalised through the courts for polluting waterways.  When it comes to the local authorities, it is now shown they are the largest polluters in Limerick.  On one hand, we are penalising people, rather than investing and encouraging them to upgrade their systems, while, on the other, local authorities are the largest polluters.<\/p> <p>  I turn to Askeaton, County Limerick, which I visited last Friday.  I watched first hand raw sewage going into the waterways.  Askeaton has been looking for a sewerage system upgrade for 33 years.  Through successive Governments, people have been looking for the treatment system to be upgraded in Askeaton.  We have been hearing about boil notices that can go on for 12 or 18 months but we have 33 years of Askeaton looking for a sewerage system and I have witnessed raw sewage going into the local waterway.

I wish to engage with the representatives from Irish Water and to thank them for the good work they are doing.  I will try to start and end on a positive note and raise my concerns in between.  Works are almost concluded on upgrading a major water mains in Milltown Malbay, County Clare.  Members will be glad to hear that our good Oireachtas colleagues, the Healy-Raes, have the contract for this work.  They have done a good job.  The work is nearly finished and the local people seem to be quite happy with it.  I thank Irish Water for its involvement there.<\/p> <p>  I am seriously concerned that there are still 35 small towns and villages from which sewage drains out into rivers and indeed, the sea.  This has been criticised time and again by the EPA.  Looking at it in respect of Government and Irish Water, there has been non-compliance with the EU wastewater directive for the past 16 years.  We keep hearing that various schemes are being designed and are progressing.  There is a parlance in Irish Water.  I have heard it being used by Irish Water and other State bodies are using it.  I refer to, for example, \"Q1: design\" and \"Q4: procurement\".  It moves like this.  Let us call the Q1s, Q2s, Q3s and Q4s what they are.  They are seasons.  It is about kicking things down the road.  There are many Q1s and Q2s over a period of 16 years.  We need to deliver on them.  <\/p> <p>  In County Clare, there are several small towns and villages that are without sewers.  If you flush a toilet in these towns and villages, it goes down to a gravel soak pit, into a stream, down to the local lake, and ultimately, the population is consuming that same water from their taps somewhere along the food chain sometime later on the same day.  In County Clare, villages such as Broadford, which the Minister visited just a few weeks ago, Carrigaholt, Doolin, Cooraclare, and O'Brien's Bridge, have no sewerage infrastructure.<\/p><p>There is a need for a mindset that extends far beyond Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and the other major cities and towns.  We need to deal with this.  I have been speaking extensively on this issue to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath.  In the context of the review of the national development plan, there is a hope to provide a mechanism for funding these villages without sewers on a pilot scheme basis.  It is to be hoped that will be handed over to Irish Water.  We really need it to step up to the plate in that regard.  This is an issue on which Fianna F&aacute;il is leading in government.<\/p><p> Mains water in Limerick comes from a reservoir in Castletroy that serves a considerable portion of the city.  My concern is that it also serves a population of approximately 10,000 people in County Clare.  That is one tenth of the population of the county, so it is sizeable.  In the past year, there have been 15 major outages on that trunk main.  It is a 12-inch main that leaves Limerick city and crosses Athlunkard Bridge.  It serves communities such as Westbury, Shannon Banks, Parteen and Ardnacrusha.  The pipe continually bursts.  It is a mish-mash of old asbestos piping, cast iron piping and modern plastic piping.   It is an absolute disaster.  The issue was considered in quarters 1 and 2.  We need to hear something firm, definite and clear from Irish Water at this stage.<\/p><p> I am not sure which of our guests wish to respond to my questions.  I do not mind who answers so long as the responses are positive.  <\/p><p> I refer to malfunctioning sewerage plants.  When I was a pupil in junior infants, the classroom was in a prefab.  When I returned to the school 20 years later as a teacher, I was back in that prefab.  It is the same with the local sewage treatment plant.  We were all told that, like the prefab, it was temporary and would be gone in two or three years.  Lo and behold, 25 years later the sewage treatment plants in villages such as Meelick or Ardnacrusha in County Clare are still functioning and breaking down.  They have to be reseeded, pumped and desludged.  Worst of all, they have to be masked with odour-suppressing chemicals.  This issue is also before Irish Water.  Again, it is not moving quickly enough.  I hope our guests can somehow encapsulate some of those points and maybe give me some positive answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021092300002#M02400","speaker":"1519","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632351600,"counter":637,"content":"<p>We are well aware of the untreated water or sewage going into the systems and we have addressed that issue through the Chairman.

When there were not dissimilar problems at the Leixlip wastewater treatment plant in October 2019, one of the issues was the non-detection of several alarms.

As Irish Water is now going to conduct a review, can our guests tell us what lessons arose from the review following that technical failure at the Leixlip plant, which affected 600,000 households?  Is there a concern that the lessons that should have been learned did not get translated across the State, which is why there is a not dissimilar problem arising in Gorey several years later?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2021092300002#N00900","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632351600,"counter":645,"content":"<p>There is a difference between the two problems.  We discovered the issue in Leixlip.  We were notified of it straight away.  Unfortunately, we had to put a boil water notice on the system but, in the end, public health was protected because we were able to react quickly.  In that case, there was an operator error or an operator failure but it was communicated quickly and we got the boil water notice on and protected human health.  In Gorey, the failure related to a lack of communication.  The lessons learned are a little different.  Obviously, we provided retraining for all the operations staff in local authorities after the Leixlip incident but, as I said previously, people will make mistakes.  Relying on single individuals on night shifts to be solely responsible for delivering water is an area of risk.  It is an area we are trying to address through further investment in infrastructure, telemetry, better systems and better processes.  That will not happen straight away but, in the meantime, the public can be assured and have trust in us because the people who deliver the services for local authorities do so day in, day out,  They provide a good service and delivery and they work incredibly hard to ensure the water quality is good.

I am a principal officer in the Traveller accommodation unit in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Eamonn Waters, principal officer in the homelessness unit in the Department.  I am grateful for the opportunity to talk about this important issue today.  Addressing Traveller accommodation issues and Traveller homelessness is a priority for the Department.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that delivery on Traveller-specific accommodation has been disappointing in recent years and this is reflected in the levels of funding drawn down.  I am pleased to report, however, that local authorities made full use of the &euro;14.5 million which was available for Traveller-specific accommodation in 2020 and it is hoped and we are confident that this will be repeated with the &euro;15.5 million budget for 2021.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note that accommodation for Traveller households is provided across a range of housing options.  The majority of Travellers live in standard housing, including local authority and approved housing body accommodation and housing assistance payment, HAP, and rental accommodation scheme, RAS, supported tenancies in the private rented sector.  Funding for these housing supports is provided through various budget lines.  The Traveller accommodation unit&rsquo;s budget is provided solely for Traveller-specific accommodation, such as halting sites and group housing schemes.  Accordingly, funding available for and spent on the provision of accommodation solutions for Travellers is much broader than the often reported spend under the Traveller-specific accommodation budget.  The Department continues to work with all our stakeholders to improve the delivery and standard of all types of Traveller accommodation and this will continue.<\/p> <p>  The Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 provides that local authorities have statutory responsibility for the assessment of the accommodation needs of Travellers and the preparation, adoption and implementation of multi-annual Traveller accommodation programmes in their areas in order to meet the identified accommodation need.  The Department's role is to ensure there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the local authorities and approved housing bodies in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.  It is a matter for each local authority to set targets for the provision of Traveller accommodation, which they outline in their Traveller accommodation programmes.  These programmes provide a roadmap for local authority investment priorities over the period and form the basis for the allocation of funding from the Department for Traveller accommodation.  Current Traveller accommodation plans run for the period from June 2019 until June 2024.<\/p><p> I will briefly address the annual local authority estimate of Traveller households.  Each year, local authorities carry out an annual count or estimate, as it is known, within their functional area.  Normally, it is carried out in November.  In 2020, it was carried out in December.  The 2020 count indicated there were 10,809 Traveller households in the State, 78% of which are in standard accommodation and 22% of which are in Traveller-specific accommodation.  Of the 78% in standard accommodation, 45% are either in local authority or approved housing body, AHB, tenancies in standard local authority or AHB-approved accommodation.  Of those, 18% are in supported tenancies in the private rental sector, mostly through the HAP and RAS, with 9% in shared housing and 6% in accommodation provided by Travellers from their own resources.  Of the 22% of households in Traveller-specific accommodation, the count estimates 8% are within group housing schemes, 9% on authorised halting sites and 5% on unauthorised halting sites.<\/p><p> The Traveller accommodation expert group was established in 2018 to review the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 and other legislation impacting on the provision and delivery of accommodation for Travellers.  It presented its report in July 2019.  The report sets out an integrated set of recommendations intended to improve the effectiveness of the arrangements for providing accommodation for members of the Traveller community.  These recommendations address four key themes, namely, delivery reflecting need, planning, capacity and resources and governance.  A programme board was established to oversee the implementation of recommendations of the expert group and a work programme for 2021 has been put in place, covering 18 of the 32 recommendations.<\/p><p> The programme board met for the first time in March and has met four times since.  It will meet again in October.  It includes two representatives from Traveller organisations, two County and City Management Association representatives and two representatives from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and is chaired by the chair of the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee, NTACC.  The Minister attends quarterly meetings of the programme board to hear updates on progress and the board also updates the NTACC on progress.<\/p><p> Some of the recommendations which have been advanced to completion or are currently being advanced are on the funding allocation system, which was overhauled in 2020.  To facilitate ease of access to funding the Department ceased allocating specific budgets to individual local authorities.  Instead, it is open to all local authorities to apply for and draw down funds at any time throughout the year and this is actively encouraged by the Department.<\/p><p> The Department has also worked with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, in relation to the upcoming census to ensure that all Travellers are facilitated to participate in census 2022.<\/p><p> The Department has also been working on a recommendation to have a Traveller identifier on the social housing support application form.  Significant progress has been made on this and it will allow for evidenced-based planning for Traveller accommodation and will support the Traveller accommodation programmes, TAPs.  We expect that social housing support application form will be modified this year to amend regulations.  It should make a big difference to the management of data.<\/p><p> On the management and maintenance of Traveller-specific accommodation, the Department funds local authorities for that, or makes a contribution.  That contribution was increased by 50% earlier this year by the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke.<\/p><p> Research is being commissioned to consider the design and long-term maintenance of Traveller-specific accommodation.  This will involve wide stakeholder engagement and consultation and ultimately result in updated guidance for local authorities and approved housing bodies in the design of Traveller-specific accommodation.<\/p><p> Transient sites are an important part of the ambition of the Traveller accommodation plan.  As part of the work of the programme board, the Department will explore the provision of an all-island approach to the provision of a network of transient sites across the island of Ireland.  Discussions in this regard have begun with the Northern Ireland Housing Executive.<\/p><p> With regard to reporting on the provision of new Traveller-specific accommodation, delivery of new Traveller-specific accommodation such as permanent halting sites and group housing schemes will be tracked under Housing for All and reported in progress reports against the 50,000 new-build social housing targets envisaged under that plan.<\/p><p> The independent review of the role of social workers and personnel employed by local authorities specifically to assist Travellers with their accommodation needs is an important piece of work that was recently completed.  It was carried out to ensure services relating to Traveller accommodation needs adapt and remain relevant.  The Department commissioned research into the role of social workers and personnel employed by local authorities to assist Travellers with their accommodation needs.  Since the mid-1960s, local authorities have employed social workers to support Travellers in meeting their accommodation needs.  Since then, the nature and scale of the demands on local authority housing departments have changed and local authorities have taken on new housing responsibilities.  The Department is liaising with the CCMA on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report.<\/p><p> The pilot caravan loan scheme is an initiative which has been undertaken to ensure Traveller households have access to good-quality caravan or trailer accommodation.  The Department has, following an extensive consultation with stakeholders and approval from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, rolled out a six-month pilot preferential loan scheme in four local authority areas.  Following a review of the pilot, which it is hoped will be successful, the intention is to roll it out nationally during 2022, incorporating whatever changes are deemed necessary arising from the review of the pilot.  In the Department's view, the scheme has the potential to significantly improve living conditions for Traveller families and comfort levels within caravans and trailers.  It will be fully supported by the Department.<\/p><p> My colleague, Mr. Eamonn Waters from the homelessness division, will conclude the opening statement and speak about Traveller homelessness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021092300002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Benson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1632351600,"counter":660,"content":"<p>Travellers are over-represented in the emergency accommodation facilities provided for people experiencing homelessness.  We know this as the Department with responsibility for policy on homelessness and Traveller accommodation.  The committee will be aware of research published by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, which noted that one in nine people who are homeless identified as Travellers.  Homelessness among Travellers is higher than it is across the population of Ireland more generally.  Travellers are more at risk of homelessness.  This is reflected in research, and in our own work directly.<\/p> <p>  We also know that there is a relationship between social disadvantage and homelessness.  Unfortunately, therefore, the over-representation of Travellers among the homeless population is not a surprise.  However, it is not something that should be accepted.  With local authorities, which have statutory responsibilities for the provision of homeless accommodation and tackling homelessness, we are working to address this.  Some progress has been made in reducing homelessness generally across all groups.  Looking at family homelessness, in July 2018, there were 1,778 families in emergency accommodation, which was the highest recorded to date.  This has been reduced to 930 families based on the most recent information, from July 2021, and represents a fall of 48%.  Significant challenges remain but these are being addressed.<\/p> <p>  Housing for All, the Government&rsquo;s housing plan for the period until 2030, was launched earlier this month.  It is a multi-annual, multibillion euro plan which will improve Ireland&rsquo;s housing system and deliver more homes of all types for people with different housing needs.  It contains a comprehensive strategic approach to tackling homelessness.  There is a commitment to eradicate homelessness by 2030.  Housing for All confirms a housing-led approach to tackling homelessness for all groups and includes specific responses for members of the Traveller community.  When we use the term \"housing-led\", we mean that the most effective way to address homelessness is to provide more accommodation.  Under Housing for All, there are specific and costed plans to increase supply across all tenure types, including very significant commitments to social and affordable housing, with over 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable homes and 18,000 cost-rental homes to be delivered by 2030.  There are also specific commitments to fund the ambition of local authority TAPs and expand the Traveller-specific accommodation pipeline.  The capital amount being invested annually in social and affordable housing is &euro;4 billion.  This is the biggest such programme in the history of the State.  Housing for All includes 18 distinct actions tailored to eliminate homelessness.<\/p> <p>  The Housing First programme is central in responding to the needs of long-term homeless single people who have complex support needs.  There are also Travellers who fall within this category.  This programme is a partnership between the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department of Health, the HSE, local authorities and voluntary housing bodies.  Wrap-around supports are provided along with a tenancy.  Under Housing First, an additional 1,200 supported tenancies will be created for homeless individuals over the next five years.  This is in addition to more than 750 tenancies which will have been created under the programme by the end of this year.<\/p> <p>  Many families, some of whom are Travellers, have found themselves trapped in a long-term cycle of homelessness.  Housing for All commits the Department to working with local authorities and NGOs to identify families experiencing long-term homelessness who have complex support needs.  Those who do will be provided with enhanced tenancy supports to help them exit homelessness and maintain their homes.  The Housing for All plan specifically recognises the importance of addressing Traveller accommodation needs as a priority and commits to working with local authorities to improve the quantity and quality of Traveller-specific accommodation.<\/p> <p>  We welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee today.

As the Vice Chairman has said, I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. Colm Ward, director of services for housing in South Dublin County Council.<\/p> <p>  On behalf of the CCMA I thank the committee for its invitation here today and look forward to assisting it in its examination of issues in accessing housing and accommodation in the context of higher homeless rates among the Traveller community.  This is a priority issue for local authorities, and we welcome the opportunity to discuss our work in this area and some of the challenges faced.<\/p> <p>  Local authorities have a key statutory responsibility in the area of homelessness under various Acts, such as the Housing Act 1988 and the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  As set out in the Housing Act 1988, local authorities have general responsibility for the provision of housing for adults who cannot afford to provide it for themselves.  The Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 places a statutory obligation on local authorities to make provision for the accommodation needs of Travellers through the adoption and implementation of five-year Traveller accommodation programmes.<\/p> <p>  In relation to housing, local authorities broadly aim to achieve a situation whereby every household in which a housing need has been established has, as far as possible, available to it an affordable dwelling of good quality in a good environment at a tenure and location of choice.  All applicants seeking social housing accommodation, including Traveller-specific accommodation, are required to submit housing applications and relevant documents, in accordance with the housing regulations of 2011.  Where the applicant has particular family circumstances or a disability, the local authority will consider such issues when addressing the housing need.  It is the policy of local authorities to consult Traveller applicants regarding their accommodation needs and requirements to provide, where appropriate, Traveller-specific accommodation.<\/p> <p>  Each local authority has a Traveller accommodation programme, TAP, which aims to meet the existing and projected accommodation needs of Travellers in their areas, including providing Traveller accommodation in appropriate, suitable and well-serviced areas.  The TAP is prepared and structured in a prescribed format and reviewed every four years.  Specific programmes and actions are developed following an assessment of Traveller housing needs and a community and stakeholder consultation process.  The programme is approved by the relevant council and by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.<\/p> <p>  Each November, local authorities undertake an annual estimate of accommodation of Travellers which assists in drawing up the TAPs.  As has been outlined by my colleagues, it can be difficult to get accurate figures if ethnicity is not declared.  The CCMA welcomes the proposal of the expert review group on Traveller accommodation to formally record ethnicity and Traveller status in housing applications.  The CCMA has two representatives on the programme board established to oversee implementation of 18 of the 32 expert review group's recommendations.<\/p> <p>  The capital delivery programme for housing to meet the assessed and projected housing need of the Traveller community in local authorities is based on the TAP.  At present, the TAP requirements in capital delivery and housing maintenance are met by the same delivery and maintenance teams that are tasked with meeting increasing housing delivery targets, increased housing stock and asset management requirements, voids and retrofit programmes.  Where Traveller-specific accommodation is proposed, a significant amount of consultation with families and communities is required to build trust, design the best housing solutions and create favourable conditions for the planning process.  Such projects are very important but take up increased resources and time.  Local Traveller accommodation consultative committees, LTACC, have been established in all local authorities.  The role of the LTACC is to provide a forum whereby Traveller accommodation issues can be addressed in a timely and co-ordinated manner and where decisions are reached as far as possible on the basis of mutual consensus.  Membership of the LTACC consists of Travellers, Traveller development groups, elected members and local authority staff.<\/p> <p>  Local authorities provide a range of accommodation options to the Traveller community, including Traveller-specific accommodation.  Accommodation is provided by local authorities through a range of options such as standard local authority housing, which is the majority as it happens, approved housing body housing, group housing and halting sites and accommodation provided through subsidisation via the housing assistance payment and rental accommodation scheme.  With the support of homeless service providers, including non-governmental organisations, local authorities also provide emergency accommodation units with specific supports for homeless families and Traveller families using private emergency accommodation, transitional units, emergency accommodation, housing assistance payment homeless place finder and family hubs.  Local authorities are experiencing a growth in young Traveller family formations as well as changing dynamics for the provision of housing solutions to Traveller families.  The CCMA would like to clarity that local authorities provide emergency accommodation to Traveller families in the same manner as all homeless families.<\/p> <p>  Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the collaborative efforts of local authorities, the Department, the HSE, Traveller representatives and others have been crucial in mitigating against Covid-19 within vulnerable groups.  This unified approach continues to have a positive impact across the sector.  The CCMA worked with the Department and the HSE to carry out a Covid risk assessment of Traveller sites using a toolkit to identify areas that needed additional supports during the pandemic.  The CCMA strongly believes this very practical approach had a significant impact and local authorities will continue to build on this progress.<\/p> <p>  By April 2021, local authorities had drawn down &euro;4.5 million of a total &euro;15.5 million funding available for the provision of additional facilities for Traveller-specific accommodation.  This included the provision of 111 accommodation units, additional water and sanitation facilities, electricity supply, additional site cleaning, additional waste removal, pest control and site improvement works.  The roll-out of estate management initiatives, where Travellers are residing in local authority housing schemes, will help improve relationships between local authorities, residents and Travellers through environment, sports, arts, libraries, age friendly services and municipal district offices.  These programmes are focused on developing a more positive estate management approach and the CCMA strongly believes it will lead to the creation of new resident committees.  The active engagement of all residents, including Travellers, is encouraged.<\/p> <p>  Where some Traveller families may feel isolated, greater inter-agency involvement may break down barriers between settled and Traveller communities.  The pre-tenancy programmes offered by NGOs supporting the Traveller community strive to ensure positive outcomes by concentrating on day-to-day home maintenance, maintaining a tenancy, budgeting and advice and information on healthy eating are welcomed by the CCMA.  The Traveller accommodation support unit in the Department is in regular contact with local authorities to provide support and funding as appropriate.  In addition to capital funding for the build and refurbishment programme, the Department also provides specific funding to local authorities to employ social workers and Traveller liaison officers to work with and assist Travellers with their accommodation needs.<\/p> <p>  As I stated earlier, evidence would suggest that homelessness among Travellers is higher than it is across the population generally.  The data is difficult to capture as it is based on local knowledge only and where ethnicity has been declared.  As has been pointed out, progress is being made generally in reducing homelessness, with a 48% reduction in families in homeless accommodation between July 2018 and July 2021.  Local authorities have advised that when Traveller families become homeless they can be larger families requiring additional resources and it may be difficult to provide suitable accommodation for their needs.  There is also a need to have suitable wraparound support services for some individuals and families, which involves communication with various stakeholders.<\/p> <p>  On private rental accommodation, anecdotal feedback from some Traveller families is that, unfortunately, some landlords are not predisposed to offer private rented accommodation to Travellers.  Where Traveller-specific accommodation is proposed a significant amount of consultation with families and communities is required to build trust, design the best housing solutions and create favourable conditions for the planning process.  Such projects take additional time and resources.  These projects are generally not suitable for external design teams.  We try to do them in-house because of the consultation involved.  Compatibility between Traveller families can be an issue in allocating Traveller-specific accommodation.<\/p> <p>  Within local authorities, the role of a social worker is to provide care and case management to Travellers who present as homeless, who need to make applications for housing supports or who have experienced complex family issues requiring inter-agency interventions for many years.  Throughout the sector this resource is also tasked with a wide range of duties, such as homeless service delivery and supervision.  Child protection duties and housing welfare for an increasing number of non-Traveller housing applicants can sometimes result in reduced capacity to meet Traveller-specific support requirements.  Many Traveller tenancies require retrofit or extension works where families expand or have special requirements.  The number of presentations of single people using homeless services has increased throughout society in general due to the lack of supply of one-bedroom units.  This has been recognised by all stakeholders and it is something on which the CCMA is working with the Department to solve.<\/p><p> Local authorities are under significant pressure to increase supports to ethnic minorities and do not have the resources to meet all demand.  In accordance with the Housing for All strategy, the CCMA recognises and supports that addressing Traveller accommodation is one of a number of priorities that need to be addressed.  The CCMA is working in partnership with the various stakeholders to drive the recommendations contained within the Traveller accommodation expert review group report. <\/p><p> The CCMA welcomes the report of the independent review of the role of social workers and believes there is a need for a more sustainable funding model for the retention and expansion of the social work service and to reflect the wider role of the social worker both within the housing Department and across the local authorities generally.  It concurs with the report that support for those staff working with Traveller accommodation is required and more mentoring, training and active case study learnings is vital.  Greater inter-agency involvement is also required in some cases.  A good example of this is the work done by the local authorities in collaboration with the HSE during the height of the pandemic to ensure the correct measures were implemented to help alleviate, where possible, the spread of Covid-19.  The CCMA welcomes this continued collaboration.  It looks forward to working with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the development of the caravan loan scheme, which is in pilot in four local authorities.<\/p><p> Each local authority is actively supporting all members of the Traveller community, not just those who present as homeless, and the CCMA continues to foster relationships with all the stakeholders to deliver better outcomes for Traveller families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021092300002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Curran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1632351600,"counter":664,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Curran.

This means 2,162 families are in receipt of support from the State to maintain those tenancies, mostly under the RAS and HAP.  The Deputy is correct that there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that those tenancies are hard to sustain.  Most local authorities are working on tenancy sustainment.  They have tenancy sustainment officers who work with all tenants who are under pressure with their tenancy or are in danger of losing it, and they try to prevent that arising in the first instance.  It does arise at times and while we do not want to see people end up in homeless services, occasionally they do.  We then have to try to exit them from those homeless services.  My colleague spoke earlier about how difficult a process that can be.<\/p> <p>  Sometimes the market does not provide the accommodation needed, in particular for large families.  Much of the availability is three-bedroom and four-bedroom houses and sometimes the requirement is larger.  That can make the process more difficult.  The local authorities work as best they can, through their social workers, Traveller accommodation liaison officer and tenancy sustainment officers, to try to sustain tenancies and, when they are lost, to get alternative tenancies.  It is tough market out there, as members know, with a lot of people looking for accommodation.  Travellers have to compete with everyone else for tenancies, but they get as much help as possible.  The HAP place-finder has been put in place, which helps with deposits and other issues.  There are also protections in place under the Residential Tenancies Board which have been strengthened in recent times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021092300002#D00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Benson"},{"type":"speech","time":1632351600,"counter":672,"content":"<p>Competing is one thing, discrimination another.

In the meantime, we need to analyse it.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Curran mentioned that the Traveller identifier would be a feature of application forms.  Other people have said it could be done through registration of ethnicity on the form.  How would that apply in terms of priority?  Have the legal issues around other ethnicities been considered?

It is still not possible, legally, to do that.  Ethnicity is not a relevant factor when it comes to assessing whether a person or family is eligible for social housing supports and it cannot be collected on that basis.  We have enough legal provision to allow us to collect a Traveller identifier and to include a Traveller identifier on the form because it is a requirement under the 1988 Act that local authorities identify and count the number of Travellers in their areas and those who need accommodation.  That gives us the legal basis.  The Traveller identifier will be just that.  It will be optional as to whether Travellers want to identify.  There is no compulsion involved but once they do, we will be able to link people who have identified as Travellers with their accommodation choice, which has been a difficult process heretofore.  Without that baseline information, it is very difficult for local authorities to plan the provision of accommodation.  It will certainly close off that gap.  We hope that amending regulations will be introduced and the new form will be in place this year.

The identifier will start that process, but the Deputy is correct that it will take time for that to feed through the system, although we hope that local authorities will go through all of the applications from people they think may be Travellers and get them to identify as such.  We can then start the work to determine, once and for all, in an evidential way whether Travellers are freely expressing a preference for standard local authority accommodation or whether they would like Traveller-specific accommodation.<\/p><p>There are different views on that and no way of proving one side wrong or the other right.  We need to get the baseline data right and we have started that process.

As he is well aware, a common matter that arises at this and similar committees and in similar discussions is that local authorities are underspending on Traveller accommodation or failing to use their budgets.  If I understood his submission correctly, Mr. Benson has evidence to suggest that is no longer the case.  If that is so, I would like him to comment.

First, if I go back to 2008, &euro;34 million was being spent by local authorities on Traveller-specific accommodation.  That was at a time when a lot was happening in the construction industry.  It fell away thereafter because of the recession.  Nothing was being built and funding was tight.  It has started to improve.  As recently as 2017, there was as little as &euro;4 million being spent on Traveller-specific accommodation, but that has grown in recent years to &euro;6 million, &euro;8 million and, last year, &euro;14 million.  We expect &euro;15 million will be spent this year.  There is evidence local authorities are building a pipeline of projects and that is feeding increased spend.<\/p> <p>  It is important to make the point that the underspend that is talked about relates to Traveller-specific accommodation in the budget, but that is only part of the funding the Department makes available for the accommodation of Travellers.  They are accommodated under a range of accommodation options, including the housing assistance payment, the rental accommodation scheme, standard local authority accommodation or approved housing body accommodation.  Our data on that are not as good as we would like but we are working on improving them.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Curran talked about the amount spent and the number of tenancies offered to people where casual vacancies arise in the stock.  Where new social housing estates are built, Travellers are often accommodated in them.  Most local authorities have minimum requirements in terms of how many they offer to Travellers in new estates and developments.  All of that is not counted when the discussion being heard is about Traveller-specific accommodation.

I note that in Housing for All, the Department has stated that 90,000 social housing units, 36,000 affordable housing units and 18,000 cost-rental units will be delivered by 2030.  The Minister reduced the Part V requirement from 20% to 10%.  Will that impact on the figures for builds over the next ten years?  The 20% social housing requirement will not come into effect until 2025 for many new plans, which will impact on the figures if they are based on the 20% requirement.<\/p><p> A point was made that the number of homeless families has been reduced to 930, which represents a fall of 48%.

We have replicated that in south Dublin with some success.  We have received strong, positive feedback from families on that engagement on the design, facilities, playgrounds and access routes into developments.  We hope to see some projects flow from that through to the redevelopment Part VIII stage.  Notwithstanding the historical issues with Labre Park, I believe there is a good, strong pathway forward that will address it.  We are seeing it and replicating it in south Dublin.<\/p> <p>  As regards transient sites for the Dublin region, all the Dublin local authorities in the current Traveller accommodation programme have stated they want to meet the permanent housing need immediately.  We will continue to focus on a suitable location for transient sites.  In that Traveller-led consultation that I spoke about, we raised the proposition of having transient sites located adjacent to the development of permanent sites where there is space available.  That was rejected.  We also earmarked a historic site on the boundary between south Dublin and Dublin city as a potential transient site as well, but that did not progress because of challenges with families in respect getting agreement on it.  It is something we will continue to look at.  We have made the commitment that permanent accommodation has to be our initial priority.<\/p> <p>  In terms of Part V, the 10% social housing requirement is still there.  It does not change our parameters.  We have delivered some Traveller accommodation through Part V.  We are looking to do something similar in the Adamstown strategic development zone, which would deliver Traveller accommodation in an integrated fashion in a strategic development zone.

Perhaps the Deputy can take the issue up with the Minister, but that is my understanding of it.<\/p> <p>  On homelessness, we have seen a significant reduction in family homelessness.  Different factors played a role in this, some of which the Deputy mentioned.  Certainly, the moratorium on evictions helped.  During the Covid period, we also saw greater availability of rental accommodation from other sectors, such as short-term lets.  Recently, we have seen issues around student accommodation.  Some of that accommodation also became available in a different market.  We also saw a lot of work being done through HAP place-finder and tenancy sustainment support services.<\/p> <p>  Many of the programmes that were put in place in recent years have also been bearing fruit.  We saw policy work coming to fruition.  However, that is not to say that the time ahead of us is not going to be challenging.

The vast majority are looking for Traveller accommodation or local authority accommodation.

Have they engaged with organisations like the Irish Association for the Social Integration of Offenders, IASIO, or Care After Prison?  The name \"Care After Prison\" speaks for itself.  The organisation helps people to get accommodation, jobs and supports when they leave prison.  There are a large number of young Travellers in prison at the moment.  At one stage, I heard that Travellers account for 400 of the 4,000 people in prison, which is a significant percentage given the number of Travellers in the population.  It might be helpful to suggest that if the organisations represented today have not done engaged with IASIO and Care After Prison, they do so now because these organisations work on the ground with Travellers before they leave prison.  Very often people who leave prison without proper support end up homeless or in situations that lead to them returning to prison and the circle goes around.  IASIO and Care After Prison are two impressive organisations but there may be others.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of horses, I draw witnesses' attention to the stables for horses built by the Irish Prison Service outside Castlerea Prison to train Traveller and other prisoners in horse skills such as farrier skills.  Once trained, they could leave prison and get jobs in that industry.  The initiative has proven successful.  Jonathan Irwin and others supported it at the time and a lot of money was raised to make the project happen.
