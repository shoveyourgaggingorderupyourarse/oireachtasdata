I am joined by Ms Sonya Mallon, company secretary and general counsel, and Dr. John MacNamara, corporate sustainability lead.<\/p> <p>  Bord na M&oacute;na was established in 1934 to manage Ireland&rsquo;s natural resources and use them to support Ireland&rsquo;s security of energy supply.  In recent years the company has progressed through a period of remarkable change that has been largely driven by the climate emergency and the national response to it.  Today the company is committed to supporting Ireland&rsquo;s security of supply through the development and operation of renewable energy assets.<\/p> <p>  The war in Ukraine and the collective European response to it demonstrate the critical need to make urgent progress on the transition away from fossil fuels and the perennial requirement for us to have a secure supply of energy.  Bord na M&oacute;na is focused on helping Ireland on both counts.<\/p> <p>  The committee will be aware that Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s transformation has been progressing for many years.  The brown to green strategy prepared the company for the challenges and enabled us to make the necessary changes.  This strategy involved: eliminating the dependence of Bord na M&oacute;na on high-carbon activities; increasing investment in renewable energy, recycling operations and peatlands restoration; and enabling new low-carbon business operations.<\/p><p>The company&rsquo;s journey to sustainability was significantly accelerated when in 2019 the High Court ruled that peat extraction, on peatlands which requires assessment under either the environmental impact assessment, EIA, or habitats directive, requires planning permission.  Following the High Court ruling, for the first time in its history, Bord na M&oacute;na formally suspended all peat extraction.  The company made this suspension permanent last year.<\/p><p> The second part of the strategy saw the company take a leading role in delivering key aspects of national climate action policy.  This involves investment in a series of recycling and large-scale climate action projects such as wind, solar energy, battery storage, increased biomass renewable electricity, renewable gas and demand-side assets for delivery in this decade.<\/p><p> Also, at the end of 2020, Bord na M&oacute;na launched the peatland climate action scheme with Exchequer and company funding, which will harness the natural power of peatlands to secure a store of over 100 million tonnes of carbon in perpetuity, cut emissions and sequester more in the coming years.  Hundreds of people previously employed in peat extraction and transport are now working to restore peatlands, maintain a store of millions of tonnes of carbon, massively boost biodiversity, and develop the potential for new amenities for communities up and down the country.  The peatlands will also be critically important locations for Ireland's own supply of clean energy as we develop a range of renewable energy assets through our estate.  All of this progress means Bord na M&oacute;na is hiring people to work in a range of areas connected to the new green economy and continues to be a substantial employer in the midlands.<\/p><p> Regarding horticultural peat supplies, once the full implications of the High Court decision became clear the company signalled to its domestic horticultural peat customers that it would continue to fulfil orders of horticultural peat in 2021, while growers put in place agreements with their new suppliers.  Similarly, exports were cut and then eliminated as the company prioritised Irish customers.<\/p><p> The ability of Bord na M&oacute;na to extend supply of horticultural peat to domestic growers required careful management of horticultural grade peat reserves - a small percentage of Bord na M&oacute;na's peat stock.  The company also worked with stakeholders and our individual customers to extend supplies, longer than was previously planned, into the summer months of 2021.  During this period Bord na M&oacute;na also actively engaged with and contributed in detail to the working group on horticulture that was established by the Minister of State, Deputy Malcolm Noonan.<\/p><p> Regarding available stocks, Bord na M&oacute;na endorses the short-term actions called out in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine working paper published in January.  We support the proposal that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine commission an independent expert to work with all suppliers to ascertain the level of horticultural peat stocks available to growers.  The current understanding is that there is sufficient stock available to supply growers for the coming period.  We note the independent expert will also work with suppliers, Bord na M&oacute;na and growers to ascertain whether any other peat would be of interest or value to growers.  Such peat might be suitable for mixing by current suppliers to produce a growing medium of value to growers.  Should that be the case, Bord na M&oacute;na is willing to supply it.  Regarding company horticultural equipment, Bord na M&oacute;na has already indicated to departmental officials that it would be willing to assist in any way it can to alleviate the current situation that the Irish horticultural industry find itself in.<\/p><p> Concerning sites under 30 ha and their potential for future peat extraction, including licensed turf extraction, the legal position since the 2019 High Court ruling means that peat extraction that requires assessment under either the EIA or habitats directive requires planning permission.  This includes peat extraction below 30 ha where the extraction fails a screening exercise.  The committee will appreciate that the company has no discretion with regard to the application of the law in this regard.<\/p><p> Before we move to questions, I would like to acknowledge the contribution of our employees who have worked hard to ensure that Bord na M&oacute;na becomes a renewed, revitalised and thriving company that is delivering for the people of Ireland.  This renewed company is built on a strong foundation of service to the State and is now focused and working hard on the most pressing issues facing our present and future generations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022032300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ger Breen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Breen for his opening statement.  All the members of the committee and I have been lobbied strongly by members of the horticulture nursery industries who are extremely worried about their viability and the lack of available horticultural peat for 2022.  Thankfully, we are now in the midst of very good Spring weather.  Being able to harvest peat in this country for these native industries is essential.<\/p> <p>  I attended a conference in Paris of agricultural committee chairmen on Sunday and Monday last.  We were told there that the Commission has changed its position as regards the usage of coal in certain European countries.  The war in Ukraine has definitely changed the landscape significantly.  It brought home to us our lack of self-sufficiency.<\/p> <p>  I got figures today from the nursery industry as regards the significant cost of the importation of peat.  Leaving aside the significant cost, the folly that it is as regards climate change would be laughable if it were not so serious.  The idea that we have put ourselves in a situation that we have to import peat from an east European country defies comprehension.  The costs for Kildare growers alone were given to me today.  There is an extra &euro;400,000 per year on costs of transport alone for bring peat into this country.  Those industries will not be able to remain viable with such extra costs imposed on them.  I very much fear that we will see a scenario that our mushroom industry, with its cost base very significantly affected, will move elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  I am told that there is a bog in Prosperous which has the best peat in Europe and that we are to re-wet that bog in the next couple of months.  While I can understand the environmental benefit of this, surely to ensure that our native industries have peat available would make far more sense.<\/p> <p>  The industry is making substantial attempts to get away from horticultural peat.  At present, they are using 30% of timber fibre.  They hope to get that to 50% over a short period of time.  Bord na M&oacute;na had been their suppliers for a long number of years.  Bord na M&oacute;na has control of the vast majority of bogs in the country.  Mr. Breen is quoting legislation to us.  I fully respect the decision of the High Court but, as I have said, we have seen the Commission in the past couple of weeks reversing its policy on coal.  Surely there is room for us to get a derogation to allow us to ensure the survival of those native horticulture and nursery industries.<\/p> <p>  The re-wetting of bogs, while it will have environmental benefits, cannot be done by us at the expense of the economic destruction of two very important industries in this country.  I suppose that is an opening statement from me on which Mr. Breen can comment afterwards.  I will call other members who have questions for Mr. Breen.  Deputy Carthy indicated first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022032300002#B00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank the representatives from Bord na M&oacute;na - Mr. Breen and his colleagues - for being here.  For the record, it is good that Bord na M&oacute;na, a semi-State company, was willing to attend this committee.  I record my disappointment again that we have not been able to have a hearing with the three Ministers responsible because one is refusing to come and the others will not come unless he comes, which is a bizarre scenario.  I again propose this week that we invite any of the Ministers who are willing to come to discuss this issue to do so.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions - all relating to peat.  I am aware there are other issues that members want to talk about.<\/p><p>I wish to refer to the working group report on reviewing the use of peat moss, which Mr. Breen mentioned, and its references to Bord na M&oacute;na.  According to the report, Bord na M&oacute;na has indicated that it would be willing to assist in any way it can to alleviate the situation in which the horticultural industry finds itself and that this assistance could involve the provision, on commercial terms, of access to extraction equipment, institutional and professional know-how and mixing plant.

To set out two key aspects, we bought professional grade horticultural peat and provided mixing plants so that we might manufacture ready-made compost to meet the needs of our customers.  Given our long association, we are aware of the challenges posed to Irish growers.  We have been looking to see what we can do within our remit.  I am glad to be able to report that Bord na M&oacute;na and ICL have entered into a lease agreement for the professional growing media manufacturing facility at our Coolnamona facility and for the supply of professional horticultural peat to that facility.  ICL supplies sustainable growing media to professional and ornamental growers and plant propagators across the country. It operates in the professional market, not the retail market, and specialises in this sector.<\/p> <p>  One might ask, \"Why ICL?\".  It is one of the leading suppliers in the professional growing business in the UK and Ireland and has been supplying raw materials to the sector for many years.  Like us, it has been aware of change coming down the tracks and limited peat being used in future.  In recent years, it has conducted extensive research into sustainable professional growing media that enable Irish growers to continue production.  It has also made substantial investments in new technology.<\/p> <p>  The leasing of this facility, the supply of professional peat that is earmarked for the Irish market only and the use of wood fibre products to sustain brands through the use of Fibagro Advance wood fibre technology will allow for a transition programme that enables Irish producers to move from peat-based products to non-peat-based products over a number of years, all subject to the extensive research insights that ICL brings to the marketplace, for example, the pioneering innovative wetting agents that it is developing and, in terms of the fertiliser Osmocote, controlled release neutral technologies that will optimise product performance.  ICL has been looking into alternative products, reducing the percentage of peat within those and their impact on the crops that professional growers are trying to grow.  This should enable professional growers, if they wish, to source a product in the Republic of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022032300002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ger Breen"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I have a number of questions to ask.

I understand the legal side of it.  I am not questioning that whatsoever.  I am talking about - it was stated to me previously - where there were cases where there were agreements made or whatever.  That is for us to follow-up and to talk to Bord na M&oacute;na, but I welcome what Ms Mallon said.<\/p> <p>  On Bord na M&oacute;na, the following is a case that I have a full file on.  Bord na M&oacute;na in 2009 and 2010 was promoting willow.  Edenderry was the place that Bord na M&oacute;na was going.  While I am relating this sad story, the witness can note another question: is Bord an M&oacute;na going for the licence for the power plant again?<\/p> <p>  Bord na M&oacute;na was promoting willow and farmers bought into it around the country around that time. I have a case in Mayo where a farmer bought into it and was told - I am aware the witnesses did not know this - that it would be going up the country a long distance from Mayo and that, for example, Lanesborough and Shannonbridge would be going down the willow road as well.  I understand fully that the court case and all these things were a problem.  Unfortunately this man had lost his son and he was doing what he thought was good for his family and doing good for the climate etc.  It was sown, there was an agreement done and everything looked lovely.  This person is elderly.  You would imagine a person sent out to advise, no more than if Teagasc goes out to advise, would go through everything.  The bridge on the road had to be widened for the machine to go in to cut it the first year.  It is 11 years on the go and, to be honest about it, I would give more to a child than what it has made over those 11 years.  The ground was not suitable, to put it simply.  I have a letter where the contractor has said that it will not go in there anymore.  I can send Mr. Breen a video of the rooting that went on trying to take it out.  Is there a way that Bord na M&oacute;na will sit down with farmers where mistakes have been made and resolve those issues because if it is not suitable and if it has been a disaster, it costs to put it back into land?  Where mistakes were made and people have been advised wrongly, is Bord na M&oacute;na prepared to sit down with that poor divil, an elderly person who thought he was doing right?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022032300002#F00200","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I will pass it over to my colleague, Dr. John MacNamara.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022032300002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ger Breen"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":126,"content":"<p>First, I am not expressly aware of that particular case.

I thank them for coming into the committee.<\/p> <p>  Some of my colleagues noted earlier that this is a sad story.  I would like to put on the record that the work of Bord na M&oacute;na is not a sad story at all.  It is a very positive story from recent years.  The company has shown leadership and bravery in adopting its brown to green strategy.  Notwithstanding the challenges, and there are challenges, nobody would pretend there are not because there certainly are, my colleagues have alluded to them, and it is only right they seek to explore the solutions to them, it should be acknowledged that Bord na M&oacute;na is one of the leading companies in the State in this significant and important transition we have to go through.<\/p> <p>  I commend the work by Mr. Breen and his colleagues and their efforts to capture carbon.  He mentioned in his statement that 100 million tonnes is being locked in.  That is the right thing to do.  We should not seek to release that carbon.  If we did, it would make it very difficult for every other sector.  The right thing is to try to keep that carbon in the ground.  Of course, it is 100 million tonnes, but it could increase as the biodiversity develops and as sequestration will naturally increase beyond 100 million tonnes.  That figure is between five and ten times the annual emissions of the agriculture sector in Ireland.  It is not at all an insignificant figure.  It is very significant.  We should not be blind to that.  in doing that work, Bord na M&oacute;na is making huge inroads in restoring biodiversity.  We have a biodiversity crisis as well as a climate crisis.  In pursuing that strategy, Bord na M&oacute;na is addressing both the climate crisis and the biodiversity crisis, so it should be commended for that.<\/p> <p>  The challenges are clear.  When we try to transition and make big changes, as we have to, challenges are going to arise.  They are certainly doing so in the area of home heating, where the supply of peat for briquettes will come to an end, I think, in 2024.  Of course there is a challenge there.  There is a challenge in power generation because the power stations have closed.  Every day we must address how we will provide the power this country needs.  To be fair to Bord na M&oacute;na, it is a leader in that area as well.  The company has done extraordinary work in developing its renewable energy potential.  In closing its peat-fired stations, it has sought to address the energy deficit and it has driven on with the development of wind, solar and, more recently, with the very interesting plan to produce green hydrogen.  I say fair play to Bord na M&oacute;na<\/p><p>It is a leader in this area.  The more renewables we can deliver, then the lower the cost of energy to consumers.  We are not going back to a situation where we generate electricity from burning peat and it is a not a good way to do so.<\/p><p> Horticulture is the third challenge and it has taken up most of this discussion.  There are solutions for home heating such as retrofitting that reduces the need for energy in people's homes.  Retrofitting is expensive work but the State can do it in the timeframe in which transition happens.  Horticulture is a more difficult task and I welcome the statement that Bord na M&oacute;na is working with an independent expert.  I have a lot of faith in Bord na M&oacute;na and believe it will do everything that it can to get through the difficulties that will exist for some time to come.  I commend Bord na M&oacute;na on its work, leadership and bravery in stepping into a very difficult space.<\/p><p> I welcome the agreement between Bord na M&oacute;na and ICL.  It is a sign that Bord na M&oacute;na seeks to solve a very difficult problem.  I understand that it might be premature for the delegation to give me a good answer to my following questions given that we are at the coalface of research.  What volume of horticultural peat at the suitable grade might be produced in the coming years?  Does Bord na M&oacute;na think that it will lead to the challenge in the horticultural sector, particularly in the mushroom sector, being resolved?  What is the timeframe for the output of this research and production?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022032300002#G01500","speaker":"1594","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":154,"content":"<p>To which raw material does the Deputy refer?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022032300002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ger Breen"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I mean horticultural peat.

By ICL entering into an arrangement with Bord na M&oacute;na it gives a period in which customers can move as opposed to having to look for sudden changes.  To be fair to professional growers, one can purchase a growing media product but one will only know how good the ready-made compost is after sowing plants and seeing the outcome.

Based on the High Court ruling and the need for planning permission, Bord na M&oacute;na made the decision not to seek planning permission, accepted the ruling, waved the white flag immediately and in a very short space of time decided to suspend peat production completely.  Who made that decision in Bord na M&oacute;na?  Why was no regard given to a just transition or, indeed, any transition for the horticultural growers, the farmers who use peat for bedding and, indeed, Bord na M&oacute;na's supply of briquettes that is due to cease in 2023 or 2024?  What if Bord na M&oacute;na had sought planning permission?  Bord na M&oacute;na played a major role the last time there was an emergency.  In fact, we do not use the word wars but call them emergencies and we are very close to another emergency now.  In such circumstances had Bord na M&oacute;na proceeded to seek planning permission, as directed by the High Court, it could well be in a position now to help out.

For the 2022 season, we have an additional 20 plans, details of which are being communicated to local communities at the moment.  There is extensive stakeholder engagement in respect of each specific plan.  We have also allowed a number of site visits by various groups over the past year to show them the work that is done on the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022032300002#J00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ger Breen"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":177,"content":"<p>When Mr. Breen mentions community engagement, does that include engagement with individual land or site owners adjacent to the bog?

I know the piles around Castlepollard.  A problem arose last year for private individuals who had piles of peat that was to be hauled away on the moving-floor trailer to the place of processing.  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, in its great judgment, decided to start following people around roads.  It does not do what it is supposed to do but its staff followed people around the roads and insinuated that a pile of peat harvested a year or two before required planning permission if it was to be moved.  Bord na M&oacute;na probably has peat harvested up to 2020.  The line of questioning indicates that what is good for the goose is good for the gander.  Had Bord na M&oacute;na the same problem or was it just encountered by private individuals?  I would say this is what Deputy Carthy was getting at.  Mr. Breen is signalling that Bord na M&oacute;na has had no problem, which is good, and that EPA staff are not following its drivers around the roads.<\/p> <p>  With regard to wind farms, Bord na M&oacute;na has teamed up with the ESB in Oweninny in Mayo.  Mr. Breen will be aware that a company has gone into receivership and that subcontractors are badly affected.  The land on which the wind farm is to be constructed is that of Bord na M&oacute;na and the project entails co-financing.  Deputies Ring, Conway-Walsh, Calleary and I contacted the ESB but the phones must not be working there because no one ever got back to us to meet to resolve this issue.  A message needs to go back to whoever is responsible in the ESB.  We are told there is a 50:50 arrangement between Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB.  It is unfortunate to think that two Northern outfits were brought to Oweninny in the past week to go pricing.  There are 28 turbines done and three to go up.  The contractors, one of which once did the runway of an airport, were doing all the work on the project while Roadbridge was there only in name.  The workers have all come together and made a proposal.  They have the expertise but no one got back to them.<\/p> <p>  I presume Bord na M&oacute;na will get involved in this and give a fair hearing to somebody involved rather than two Northern outfits that have come down to look at a job locals were doing.  If Mr. Breen is talking to someone in the ESB or Bord na M&oacute;na, he should be clear that there will be no machines going in anywhere unless the people in the west of Ireland are sorted.  I want that message to go back to whoever in Bord na M&oacute;na deals with the ESB.  In fairness to the politicians I have mentioned, and even me &mdash; the project is not in my area but I have a construction background &mdash; no northern person should be coming down and walking in on top of people in the west of Ireland.  Mr. Breen can give that message to the ESB and his own people in Bord na M&oacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022032300002#K02800","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":225,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Breen want to pass any comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022032300002#K02900","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Oweninny Power DAC is a joint venture of the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na, as outlined by the Deputy.

I also ask for communication with those farmers to try to sort out their difficulties because they most definitely went into those projects in good faith.

The solution is not within the remit of Bord na M&oacute;na.  It is up to us as policymakers and legislators to make sure we get a solution fast to ensure the future viability of these industries.

However, committees are encouraged to take a gradual approach to this change.  Members and witnesses have the opportunity to attend today's meeting in the relevant committee room or online via Microsoft Teams.  All those attending the committee room and environs should continue to wash their hands properly and often and to avail of sanitisers outside and inside the committee rooms, be respectful of other people's physical space and practise good respiratory etiquette.  If they have any Covid symptoms, no matter how mild, they should not attend in the committee meeting room.  Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Members participating remotely are required to participate from within the Leinster House complex, as they are all fully aware.  Apologies have been received only from Deputy Shanahan so far.<\/p> <p>  Today we will look at fuel cost issues and price practices related to fuel.  Recent weeks have seen a rise in the cost of fuel, which has affected motorists throughout the country.  These cost increases are affecting transport companies in their ability to provide services to the wider public.  The current price of fuel has brought into light the matter of fuel retail, including competition compliance issues, while the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, has received a significant number of complaints about the increase in fuel prices.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to consider this matter today and to assist the committee in this regard.  From the CCPC, I welcome Mr. Jeremy Godfrey, Mr. Brian McHugh, Mr. Se&aacute;n Murphy and Ms Gr&aacute;inne Griffin.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses in respect of reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  The opening statement of the CCPC has been circulated to all members.  To commence our consideration of this matter, Mr. Godfrey will make opening remarks on behalf of commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022032300002#A00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":242,"content":"<p>My colleagues and I welcome the opportunity to brief the committee on the CCPC's role and our actions in respect of petrol and diesel prices.  First, let me introduce myself and my colleagues.  I am Jeremy Godfrey, the chairperson of the CCPC.  I joined on 1 January this year.  Brian McHugh has been a member of the CCPC for almost five years, and Se&aacute;n Murphy and Gr&aacute;inne Griffin are directors of our consumer protection and communications divisions, respectively.<\/p> <p>  The war in Ukraine has exacerbated pressures on the cost of living.  It has led to further increases in global commodity prices, notably of crude oil and wheat.  These increases can add to upward pressure on prices paid by consumers for essential items such as petrol and diesel.  This affects all consumers but has a particular effect on vulnerable members of society.  We fully appreciate the anxiety and concern they feel.  We are conscious that the recent concern about fuel pricing may be replicated in respect of the prices of other products affected by the war and by the economic sanctions that have followed.  For that reason it might be helpful if I briefly outline the general role of the CCPC in pricing.  Then I will describe the complaints we have received about fuel pricing and the actions we are taking.<\/p> <p>  I will summarise the CCPC's mandate in respect of pricing as ensuring that prices are set independently by competing businesses and that those prices are then prominently displayed at the point of sale, thereby enabling consumers to make informed choices as to which supplier offers the best value.  We do not tell businesses what prices to charge but we enforce laws that mean there is competitive pressure on businesses to set prices at levels that consumers will find attractive.<\/p> <p>  Let me set out the main ways in which the laws we enforce are relevant to pricing.  First, it is illegal for competing businesses to form a cartel - that is, an agreement to fix prices - or to agree a common pricing policy or to carve up a market in order that they do not have to compete.  It is also illegal for businesses to share information about their future pricing intentions.  Wholesalers may not dictate the retail prices charged for their products by independent retailers.  As long as businesses do not collude, however, they are free to set their own prices and may observe their competitors' prices and adjust their own prices accordingly.<\/p> <p>  Second, excessive pricing may be illegal if a business is in a dominant position, where it faces little competition and its customers have little bargaining power.  When a business is dominant, it is not allowed to abuse its position.  Most businesses, however, are not in a dominant position, and their pricing decisions are constrained by the need to compete rather than by any legal obligation.<\/p> <p>  Third, businesses must be transparent about their pricing and display accurate pricing information to consumers who may be considering buying their product.  In the case of filling stations, this means they must have large-scale roadside pricing displays in order that drivers can consider the prices before they enter a forecourt and can drive to an alternative business if they are not happy with the prices offered.<\/p> <p>  Fourth, businesses must not engage in illegal unfair commercial practices in respect of pricing.  For instance, they cannot claim to be offering a discount unless they have really been selling at a higher price.  However, selling at a high price in itself is not defined by law as an unfair commercial practice as long as the price is accurately displayed and the consumer is not coerced into paying it.<\/p> <p>  When we receive complaints about pricing, we assess them to see if they indicate a possible breach of one of these areas of competition or consumer protection law.  We can also take action on our own initiative when we suspect there may have been a breach.  However, we cannot investigate behaviour that a consumer regards as unethical unless the behaviour may breach the law.<\/p> <p>  Where appropriate, we investigate suspected breaches of competition or consumer protection law and we can take enforcement action if the investigation uncovers sufficient evidence of a breach.  The nature of enforcement action depends on the type of the breach and the nature of the evidence we have.  It can range from referring a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, for a criminal prosecution on indictment in the case of the most serious cartel behaviour through to fixed penalty notices or compliance notices for some breaches of consumer protection law.<\/p> <p>  I will now outline the complaints we have received about fuel pricing and the actions we have taken.  Over the past two weeks we have received almost 200 complaints from the general public and public representatives about fuel pricing.  In general, these complaints allege that filling stations have failed to pass on the excise duty reduction in a timely manner or that they have exploited the current economic situation to raise fuel prices and to increase profits.<\/p><p>Some complaints include allegations of collusion and a few contain information about price movements at particular filling stations.  We have also received a number of complaints relating to allegations of filling stations turning off roadside pricing displays.  We urge anyone who has specific information about collusion or any breach of competition or consumer protection law to provide it to us.  Whistleblowers who have information about cartels can provide us with that information anonymously at <i>report.whistleb.com\/ccpc<\/i>.  Separately, a business or individual that is the first cartel member to provide us with information about a cartel can apply for immunity from criminal prosecution.  Penalties for the other cartel members if they are found guilty of breaching competition law can include large fines and a maximum of ten years' \u00a0imprisonment for the individuals involved.<br\/><br\/>We continue to assess the complaints that we have received about fuel prices at the pump.  As part of the process, we are engaging with complainants and the industry, and will assess any evidence that might indicate the possibility of collusive practices.  We will be as transparent as possible about our work in this area.  However, we will not be able to disclose commercially sensitive information nor can we disclose details about any investigation until it is complete.  We are unable at this point to say when we will be in a position to give an update.<br\/><br\/>There are a number of other actions we have taken in relation to fuel pricing.  We have written to one trade association and two fuel companies about the competition law risks of making public statements about future increases in fuel prices, and we are continuing to monitor public statements.  We have updated our website to provide consumers with relevant information on price increases and our role.  We have written to fuel retailer representatives to remind them of their members' obligations under consumer protection law, and we will be continuing compliance checks in relation to pricing displays.<br\/><br\/>Irish consumers are not alone in suffering from increases in the price of fuel.  We have engaged with our European colleagues to discuss shared competition and consumer protection issues arising from the war in Ukraine.  As in Ireland, concerns have been raised in other EU member states about pricing changes and the resulting impact on consumers and businesses.  Across the EU, competition and consumer protection are just one area of law and policy that is pertinent to the impact of price rises on consumers.  Taxation and social policies are also very relevant, and tax changes are being implemented or considered in a number of member states.  Political leaders in the EU have also called for proposals for reducing energy dependence on Russia and have declared they will consider concrete options for dealing with the impact of rising energy prices on consumers and businesses, especially vulnerable consumers and SMEs.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion, may I say that the economic and geopolitical situation is putting pressure on both consumers and businesses.  We cannot insulate consumers from the effects of the global upheaval but we will work tirelessly within our mandate on their behalf.  We will continue to protect the interests of consumers by monitoring compliance with competition and consumer protection law, by reminding businesses that they must continue to abide by their obligations, and by taking action when we see evidence of such breaches.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022032300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Godfrey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Godfrey and invite members to discuss the issues with the delegation.

I would venture to say that is what prompted people to get in contact. I wrote to the commission, as did loads of people, to complain that the price hikes are wrong and should not happen and detailed how much it cost them to fill a fuel tank last week in comparison with this week.  Notwithstanding all of the global factors and issues, the price hikes did not make sense to people.  What people have said to me is that the scale of the increase was wrong.  Is there a case to be made to strengthen the law to make the practice illegal?  The commission can only investigate something that is illegal.  Something might be wrong, awful and morally abhorrent to everyone in the room but the commission can do nothing about it unless it is illegal.  Can the commission extend its powers to take in some of this issue which is unethical?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022032300002#B00700","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":250,"content":"<p>We have had exactly the same sort of complaints.

I am grateful for her acknowledgement that as a law enforcement agency, all that we can do is enforce the law.  We are definitely not the morality police.<\/p> <p>  On the question of whether law can be strengthened or whether there are unethical practices that ought to be dealt with by law, ultimately that is a policy matter for the Departments rather than for us.  As we build understanding of these markets and in the course of the inquiries that we are making, we will end up with some more understanding of what the impact has been of the price rises and how the rises in the price of crude oil and of the import price of refined products and those wholesale and excise prices have affected the industry and consumers.  If we see something that is widespread and unusual then we will bring that to the attention of the policymakers.  We certainly are able to give advice but it would be premature for me at the moment to say that there is a case for new laws.  When one thinks about what the laws might be, one must be cognisant of the possibility of unintended consequences. So, it is never straightforward.

That is a matter we should keep in mind, Chairperson, for future committee hearings.<\/p> <p>  Does the commission investigate whether prices for energy and fuel have risen further and more suddenly than external circumstances can justify?  We are all aware of the situation in which we are operating and we all understand that but would that be the starting point for an investigation?

They have given us a very good overview.  I have to confess to having some skin in this game.  I grew up many years ago in a small rural filling station.  I am very aware of some of the issues in recent weeks.  I have great empathy for the small filling station operators and their staff, many of whom have been vilified over the past couple of weeks.  I agree with Mr. Godfrey who gave a reasonable overview of the ecology of the fuel retail business.  I would, however, take issue where he said that most businesses are not in a dominant position.  Unfortunately a number of businesses in fuel retail are emerging as very much dominant players.  Some of them capitalised on the humanitarian crisis and war in Ukraine to the detriment of Irish consumers.<\/p> <p>  I am going to give Mr. Godfrey the view of one of those very small rural retailers.  There were no fuel price increases over the course of a weekend but over the five working days diesel was increased by 33 cent a litre and petrol by just under 20 cent a litre.  That was in the days immediately leading up to the excise reduction, which was 20 cent on petrol and 15 cent on diesel.  The forecourt operators have no control over that.  As Mr. Godfrey rightly points out we are a price taker in this.  I do not believe we have mentioned what I think is the big issue in this, the fuel importers and warehouses.  I understand there are three in Dublin, one in Cork and one in Limerick.  While we are price takers I would have a concern that the price may be coming from there rather than from global issues.  Another concern which I hope will come out in the scope of the commission's investigation in the coming months is that while many of the smaller retailers operating as branded filling stations pride themselves on delivering a very good service at a fair price, they feel they are being bullied out of the trade at this point by the larger, dominant groups that are intent on gaining market share.  The more fuel they are able to sell the greater their buying power.  They are able to get fuel at a lower price.  Is the investigation going to take in those fuel importers and warehouses?  Has the commission had any engagement with those entities thus far or previously?  Are they on the commission's radar in terms of any of its ongoing investigations?<\/p><p>I will come back to Mr. Godfrey when he responds to that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022032300002#C01400","speaker":"1597","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his question.

We would be very interested to hear from the Deputy&rsquo;s constituents and the people who have been in touch with him.

As for our prior engagement with the industry, there have been quite a few mergers in the industry so we have a role when there are mergers in any industry to assess whether the merger is likely to cause a substantial lessening of competition and to either block the merger or get it restructured.  There was a merger about seven years ago involving the terminal operators at Dublin and filling stations.  One of the things the CCPC did at that point was impose some conditions to make sure that there was not a reduction in competition at the Dublin Port terminal operations and to make sure that in certain local areas where it might have led to a reduction in the number in competition among neighbouring filling stations, to insist on some divestment of filling stations to preserve that competition.  In this way we have been involved with the industry. <\/p> <p>  There have been subsequent mergers as well that we looked at.  We have been involved in some of those issues in industry in the past.  We have taken action to preserve the level of competition. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022032300002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Godfrey"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":271,"content":"<p>In regard to the wholesalers and warehouses, will the CCPC be looking at those?

I wish to make one other point.  I have given some oversight of it, in terms of the step up in the price increase that took place in the five-day run-up to the reduction in excise.  Every dog in the street knew there was going to be a reduction in excise.  The reality is that 24 hours prior to the reduction in excise, a small rural filling station would have placed its order for 13,000 l of fuel.  The station would have paid &euro;2.16 per litre for it and then with the introduction of the excise reduction, would been selling that at &euro;1.99 per litre.  Over a 24-hour period the station was forced to carry a loss of &euro;5,100 on that delivery.  In terms of equality and fairness surely there has to be some recourse for those small retailers who bought in a supply of fuel within 24 hours or 48 hours of the excise reduction.  There must be some recourse for them, through their suppliers and indeed ultimately through the Exchequer.  Does Mr. Godfrey have a view on that?

In the case where we have received complaints that such signs have been off or not displayed, we have sent officers out to investigate that, so there has been attendance at a couple of stations with respect to that.  What the officer will assess is whether there was a reasonable excuse behind that or what was the intent behind it, and the officer will get an explanation from that trader.  If there is a reasonable and plausible excuse as to why that was not on, a warning is issued and, again, the trader needs to sort that out.

Looking online, it seems that Ireland's pricing is approximately in the middle of the range across the European Union.  There are approximately ten countries charging higher prices for motor fuels and eight that charge lower prices.  The tax element is approximately the same, with eight countries having a higher charge and the rest charging a lower amount.  Ireland is approximately in the middle of the table.<\/p> <p>  Over the past two or three months since the issue has put big pressure on people, has the commission tracked how Irish prices are rising compared with other countries?  Is there evidence that there is more profit-taking going on that may be signalled by higher prices in Ireland than in other EU countries?  What are margins like in this sector?  Is it a sector where excessive margins are, in general, being taken that may justify a review even if it is not an investigation or specific prosecution?<\/p> <p>  How is the issue of dominance defined in the motor fuel sector?  In a region or county where there are very few suppliers, could pricing be challenged on grounds of dominance or is that just too complicated?  Related to this, is there a concept of price gouging whereby prices are going up and people take advantage to gouge out more margin?  Is that something we could develop a code of practice around even if we could not individually prosecute people, so at least there could be some trail of evidence to indicate that gouging went on during a period of volatility that one could seek to investigate over time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022032300002#F00400","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I will try to answer his questions but if I miss one, please let me know and ask it again.  With the information we are gathering, we have been motivated to look at the matter by the recent very high level of public concern and anxiety over fuel prices.  With the information we are gathering, as well as being able to assess collusion, we will get a better sense of what is happening to margins in the industry by looking at wholesale and retail pricing.  When we have that sense and are in a position to provide an update, we will do so.<\/p> <p>  \"Dominance\" is a technical term that has much case law around what it means.  In the case of the fuel sector, in the past we have looked at mergers and at the retail level the market is very local and not even as big as a county.  We have tended to look at markets in urban areas as having a neighbourhood of approximately 3.2 km or 2 miles.  In rural areas, we have tended to look at markets where people are willing to drive a little further to get a good deal on petrol.  We looked at markets in those areas of approximately 5 miles or 8 km.  Those issues in retail are, as one of the Deputy's colleagues alluded to, very local.  There may be plenty of competition in one part of a county and perhaps less competition in another part.  There are also markets for wholesale selling of fuel and importing fuel for services one gets at terminals.  We looked at all of those with respect to mergers.  There are several players and there is no evidence at all of one dominant player in those markets.<\/p> <p>  The definition of dominance is really quite extreme, with a company able to act without care and it does not matter what competitors do.  The company does not need to care or worry about competitors or customers and it would have almost complete freedom to act.  It is very rare to find dominance in any market.  I would not want to say to the committee that issues of dominance in this market were very likely to be found.  With the case law on excessive pricing and dominance, the courts have held that, really, the pricing must bear no relation whatever to the cost before they are willing to uphold an accusation of excessive pricing.  We are not in that position in this market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022032300002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jeremy Godfrey"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and congratulate them on the work they are doing.  Is the commission satisfied there is sufficient public awareness of its existence, its role and powers?

Has it carried out any surveys on public awareness of its role?  I asked a number of people before this meeting and they were not aware at all that the commission even existed.

Does the commission need more resources?<\/p> <p>  In the submission it is indicated the commission wrote to one trade association and two fuel companies about the competition law risks of making public statements about future fuel prices.  What is that about?  I am not too sure about that impact or why it is so important.<\/p> <p>  Is collusion very difficult to prove and what must we have in order to prove that collusion exists?

His first question was about awareness of the commission.  We certainly believe it could be raised higher.  We are doing some work on how best to do that.  We are planning a number of campaigns for this year to inform consumers about their rights.  Those campaigns will also raise awareness of our existence.<\/p> <p>  On the question of resources, like anybody else we can always have vacancies and sometimes we struggle to fill them.  The labour market has been quite buoyant.  We are in constant communication with our Department about what resources we believe we might night.  Again, that is always set in the context of other pressures on Government expenditure.  It is an ongoing conversation that we have.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about warnings given to trade associations and companies about discussing price intentions.  Price signalling is also a breach of competition law.  Rather than having a complete agreement on what prices to charge, companies may, through public statements, signal to one another or trade associations about intentions.  In normal circumstances, a company considering increasing its prices may think there is a bit of a risk if it increases prices and its competitors do not follow.  If a trade association states that everybody will have to increase prices, the competitive risk would be reduced.  That is why price signalling is harmful to competition.  Sometimes people do this without having particular ill intentions.  Often, we like to give people a warning when we see it in order that it does not happen again.<\/p><p>The Deputy asked whether collusion was difficult to prove.  Yes, it can be difficult to prove and good evidence is necessary.  The Deputy talked about observing prices that were different in two towns.  The process we would go through as a law enforcement agency starts with having suspicion and assessing things.  Then we would get into more detailed evidence gathering, eventually potentially leading to prosecution.  The situation the Deputy described of observing unusual price patterns is not a smoking gun but it is maybe smoke.  That is how I would characterise it.<\/p><p> On the Competition (Amendment) Bill, it has not yet gone through all Stages in the Oireachtas, so I cannot tell the Deputy how it is working.

Surely the CCPC representatives can give us a timeline.  We are now at the end of March.  They should be able to say it is going to take two months, three months or six months.  That is fair question that needs to be answered.  Otherwise, we are all wasting our time.<\/p> <p>  I will also raise an issue that has been brought up this morning and which has come across in the discussion, which has been helpful.  Based on the information currently available, it certainly seems there are going to be further significant increases in fuel costs and energy costs throughout the year.  None of us can see into a crystal ball but we can consider where we and Europe as a whole are.  At this stage, people are at their wits' end.  We all see it across communities, particularly in my own community in west Galway.  The increase proposed in the carbon tax for 1 May needs to be deferred because it is just not possible for people to pay.  A family was on to me yesterday with regard to home heating oil.  They filled their tank fully for &euro;600 less than 12 months ago but could only fill it halfway yesterday for the same amount of money.

However on the other hand, it also has a role of consumer protection and I do not see why it could not at a very early date give an indication of what is happening in the Irish market.  What are the trends in pre-tax prices of fuel in Ireland compared with other EU countries?  Is there evidence that in general, Ireland is being exposed to some gouging?  Also, in my view Mr. Godfrey articulates some principles of good consumer codes of practice for suppliers in this period that do not represent new offences that they potentially can commit.  However advice to both consumers and to suppliers as to what a consumer should expect as reasonable protection in this arena would be useful.  Consumers would be reassured if the CCPC could offer some general assessment of what is happening in that marketplace, separate to the care that must be taken around prosecutions.  That is what I suggest could be done.

That is our first priority.  The information we gather in that process may well shed light on some of the issues the Deputy raises.  When I say we need to give an update, that does not necessarily mean we have to wait until all the competition issues have been resolved but I do not want to give a particular timeframe.  We will have to consider quite carefully what we can say and what use we can make of the information we have in a way that addresses the issues the Deputy has raised but in a way that does not compromise anything that might happen in court in the future.

People in many areas have no access to public transport and rely on driving private cars.  They cannot afford to buy an electric vehicle, for example.  They have no choice.

Deputy Bruton made a good point in suggesting they could provide an interim answer for us.<\/p> <p>  I am led to believe that we need more legislation or more resources put into the CCPC.  I know no public servant will come to the committee and say they need more resources, but the CCPC probably does need more resources.

In my opening remarks, I will refer to our latest assessment, which was published in the Central Bank bulletin at the end of January.  I will also reflect on the implications of more recent events.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine is shaping current and prospective developments in the European economy, as well as adding risks and uncertainty to the outlook.  During the first week of April, we will be publishing our next quarterly bulletin, which will include an updated forecast that will incorporate available information.<\/p> <p>  The economy overall has proven resilient through Covid-19 and, prior to the war in Ukraine, robust growth was expected over the coming years.  Modified domestic demand, MDD, is estimated to have grown by 6.5% in 2021, bringing the domestic economy broadly back to pre-pandemic levels.  Our latest forecast is for domestic demand growth of 7.1%, 5.2% and 4.8% in 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively.  If these growth rates were to emerge, by 2024 the domestic economy would be back to where it would have been expected to have been, had the pandemic not taken place. <\/p> <p>  The economy is expected to be operating at its potential level of activity over the course of our forecast horizon.  The extent of the labour market recovery has been encouraging.  The standard International Labour Organization, ILO, rate of unemployment is now approximately 5%, with the Covid-adjusted rate at approximately 7%.  Employment and labour force participation has increased relative to 2019, especially for females and younger workers.  We expect the labour market to tighten further, with employment growth continuing, but at a slower pace than last year, and the unemployment rate remaining relatively low out to 2024.<\/p> <p>  While the official earnings data are not straightforward to interpret at the moment and come with a lag, it is reasonably clear that sectors that have experienced consistently high demand for labour have also witnessed strong wage growth.  As the labour market tightens, it can be expected that wage growth would become more broad-based.  According to the latest available data, consumer price inflation in Ireland as measured by the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP, rose to 5.7% in February 2022.  This is the highest rate since late 2000.  It is in stark contrast to the experience over the decade preceding the onset of the pandemic, when inflation averaged 0.5%. <\/p> <p>  The experience in Ireland reflects common global drivers of inflation being witnessed to a similar extent in the euro area as a whole.  Specifically, the current rates of inflation are driven by higher global energy prices and supply bottlenecks, with some knock-on implications of the energy price rise for the prices of other consumer goods and services.  The energy component of the HICP rose by 30% over the year to February, with the most significant increases recorded in home heating oil, whose price is up by 53.8%.  Relatedly, the cost of motor fuels rose by 31.3%.  Excluding energy, HICP inflation in February was 3.7%.  More domestically determined inflation is most evident in rents, which increased by 8.5% over the year to February.<\/p> <p>  These increases in official consumer prices for energy and fuel, which are for February, are yet to reflect in full the developments of recent weeks and the implications of the conflict in Ukraine.  Both the spot and future wholesale price of oil and gas have risen substantially since the Russian invasion began and have also been volatile on a day-to-day basis.  In addition, wholesale prices have increased for products where Russia and Ukraine are prominent suppliers, such as coal, wheat and other cereals, fertilisers and certain metals.  The impact has already been seen in reported consumer fuel prices across Ireland, and will eventually also be reflected in higher than previously anticipated consumer prices for gas, electricity and food.  Our January forecast envisaged HICP inflation averaging 4.5% in 2022 and 2.4% in 2023.<\/p><p>While there is substantial <font color=\"#363636\">uncertainty as to the actual outturn, inflation will likely be significantly higher than this in 2022 and could remain elevated for longer than previously expected as a result of the war.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#363636\"> The economic effect of the Russian invasion of Ukraine can be primarily characterised as a supply-side shock, leading to higher prices and lower availability of energy and other commodities generally.  Direct trade between Ireland and Russia, as well as that between Ireland and Ukraine, is very low overall but exposure on the import side is relatively important for coal, fertiliser and some cereals.  However, the two countries are important in the supply of energy, metals and food commodities to the European market generally.  This will lead to higher inflation and slower growth in many of Ireland&rsquo;s main trading partners and affect economic conditions here.  Higher inflation, likely driven by energy and food components, will place increased pressure on household&rsquo;s real incomes and operating costs for businesses in Ireland.  Alongside a general increase in uncertainty, this can be expected to dampen domestic consumption and investment growth to a degree.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#363636\"> Regarding the public finances, the pace of recovery given the extent of the Covid shock has been remarkable.  We estimate that the 2021 general Government deficit to have been &euro;8.7 billion, which is  equivalent to -2.7% of GNI*.  The better than expected outturn for 2021 reflected the following: higher than anticipated domestic activity leading to better income tax and VAT receipts; lower than expected Covid-related expenditure; and positive surprises in terms of corporation tax receipts.  With the economy performing strongly as the effect of the pandemic eases, our January forecast was for a deficit of &euro;3.8 billion to be recorded this year, and a surplus of &euro;3.4 billion to emerge in 2023, which will be the equivalent to 1.3% of GNI*.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#363636\"> The re-emergence of a general Government surplus will contribute to an easing of the debt position.However, almost all of the improvement in the public finances is expected to be achieved through growth in nominal GNI*.  Our January forecast envisaged the general Government debt to be below 90% of GNI* in 2023, and fall further to 84.9% in 2024, having been 102.2% in 2021.  In euro terms, debt was only forecast to be 0.4% lower in 2024 relative to 2021, at &euro;231.2 billion.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#363636\"> The war in Ukraine raises many issues for the outlook and conduct of fiscal policy, spanning the immediate humanitarian response for those displaced by the war, mitigating the economic impact on the most vulnerable Irish households, and addressing medium-to-longer term implications.  I will briefly discuss some of these in a moment.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#363636\"> Before doing so I will mention some of the main risks to the current economic and fiscal outlook.  These can be summarised under three inter-related headings.  First, the escalation or prolongation of the war could worsen global supply conditions and dampen foreign demand.  Second, the scope for, and implications of, second-round or cost-push drivers of inflation emerging more forcefully.  Third, structural challenges for the public finances in light of already existing and emerging priorities that raise demands on Government resources.  Already existing priorities include the need to address infrastructure deficits in housing, climate action and the long-term costs of an ageing population.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#363636\"> This brings me to the overall budgetary stance in light of current circumstances.  The experience of the currently high rates of inflation is not uniform across the country.  Cost of living increases from higher food and energy prices tend to be larger for lower income, older and rural households.  This is because food and energy spending is a larger share of the weekly spending for these households.  It is appropriate for fiscal policy to reduce the impact of higher inflation on those households that are less able to cope with current circumstances.  Measures introduced in budget 2022 and afterwards will help to alleviate some of the cost of living increases.  The better than expected performance of the public finances last year has provided the Government with some additional space to fund this expenditure.  Nevertheless, with the public finances in a deficit position following Covid-19, this additional expenditure will be funded by borrowing.  If, for any reason, these measures became quasi-permanent then appropriate funding through current resources would have to be considered to avoid introducing a structural vulnerability in the public finances.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#363636\"> At the same time, pre-existing priorities in housing and climate action need to be addressed over the medium-term and at a time of inflationary pressures that are mostly externally driven.  While uncertainty over the outlook is particularly high, the nature of the economic shock arising from the war means that it remains likely that the economy will be reaching capacity constraints.  To ensure that the economy and public finances remain on a sustainable path over the medium term, the composition of fiscal policy may have to be adjusted to avoid excessive inflationary pressures domestically while simultaneously addressing these priorities for the community as a whole.  Tax and expenditure measures, which more explicitly support supply-side conditions, build resilience to future shocks across the economy and over the longer-term enhance the structural budgetary position, becoming a more immediate priority the longer energy and other commodity prices are expected to remain high.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#363636\"> In conclusion, the economy and the public finances have proven resilient through the pandemic.  As a result, both are overall relatively well positioned to address many of the challenges that may lie ahead.  However, the degree of uncertainty around the outlook is particularly high.  Careful management of the public finances in light of known and emerging priorities and challenges remains necessary.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022032300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Cassidy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Cassidy for his opening statement.

I welcome Dr. Cassidy and Dr. O'Brien.  I thank them for the presentation in terms of the Central Bank's quarterly bulletin.  It is really timely.  Committees have discussed these matters for many years but this is obviously an issue that is being discussed in every village and town across the State.  The first thing on people's lips now is the impact inflation will have on the cost of food, home heating oil and energy, and how people are going to make ends meet.  The outline Dr. Cassidy gave is an important contribution to raising awareness about where we are going.  However, for many families, it will be very concerning because, just like we have pointed out, the impact of the war in Ukraine has not really been felt yet in terms of prices.  Gas prices have been announced by Bord G&aacute;is, for example, and some people think they are the result of the war in the Ukraine but they were not.  They are the result of the increase in the price of gas that happened last year and we are going to see significantly further increases.  I ask the delegation to elaborate on that matter.  The die has already been set for the wholesale price of gas where these operators buy a large proportion, or the majority, of their gas well in advance of consumer use.<\/p> <p>  The Central Bank mentioned in its quarter 1 bulletin that inflation was projected to be 4.5%.  Obviously, those numbers are out of date now even though they are only a couple of weeks old.  Where does the Central Bank see inflation for the year 2022?<\/p> <p>  The Central Bank has done a very important piece of work by breaking down inflation as best as it can for different types of households and different types of income quintiles.  I have engaged with the director general of the Central Statistics Office, CSO, to have a better breakdown of inflation because, as we know from the work the Central Bank has done, inflation on the poorest households is about 1% higher than inflation on the most well-off households in the State.  Some of that is down to the fact that poorer income households use three times as much of their disposable income on energy than those in the top.  I am glad to see the CSO is about to prepare some technical work on this matter, which will be helpful.  Can the Central Bank estimate where it sees inflation for different income groups?  I ask because we are now looking at not just energy but some of the other staples such as bread as well as fuel, heating and electricity, which are increasing.  Given that social welfare rates were increased in the budget by less than 2.5%, what is the real impact on those who depend on a fixed income as a result of the levels of inflation?<\/p><p> My final question on this part is about the second-round effects that could spill into wider inflation in respect of goods and services later in the year.  Will Dr. Cassidy go into detail about the interconnectedness with Europe, Russia and Ukraine, as well as the impact second-round effects could have on the State?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022032300002#B00300","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I will try to address those issues in turn.  I fully agree with the Deputy's analysis that we saw evidence of significantly higher inflation during the second half of 2021, which related more so to the legacy of Covid and other global factors affecting energy markets.  Now we have a second wave exacerbating matters.  The official data that I quoted relates to February 2022 and, therefore, we will see a further uptick in inflation, particularly in the context of energy in light of the developments that we already know have happened.  A point I would note about energy inflation is the extreme volatility of wholesale gas prices in particular but also oil prices.  That can create additional problems and feed through to retail prices.<\/p> <p>  A third general point I wish to raise before I get into the answers more specifically, what we have not fully seen yet is a pass-through to food prices.  We have seen in recent months a modest uptick in overall food prices and a bit more of an uptick in elements of food prices relating to cereals, grains and oils.  There has been quite a sharp rate of increase in the past month or two.  There is no doubt that this has not yet fully passed through.  We will also see further pressures on food prices in the coming months.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy will understand that we are still working on these forecasts, but our current estimates suggest, in terms of the annual average, that it will be up between 1% and 2% over the year as a whole.  Whereas we were forecasting an average rate of 4.5% in our previous bulletin, this will likely be in the order of 5.5% to 6% on average.  We will have a more definite figure in two weeks' time.  As to the profile during the year, we expect to see the rate, which is currently 5.7%, increase and peak around the summer months.  Again, I apologise for presenting a range, but our estimates suggest that the inflation rate will peak in the summer in the range of 7.5% to 9%.  There is an expectation of a gradual decline during the second half of the year.  Importantly, we also expect the rate to remain higher than we previously expected throughout 2023.  Short-term effects in these markets will pass through on a more delayed basis to broader elements of the consumer price basket - this will lead on to the second part of the Deputy's question relating to second-round effects - and, therefore, we expect inflation to be somewhat higher during 2023.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the differential inflation rates, while the average inflation rate is 5.7%, we produced estimates of differential inflation rates for different parts of society that range from 5.1% to the highest of approximately 6.2%.  People who are experiencing the higher rates include lower income groups, older households and rural households.  If the rate averages at 5.5% to 6%, one can expect the average rate would be about 0.5% higher for the more affected groups, which in some respects may not seem like a lot.  If one looks at the corresponding incomes, however, it is a lot.  We believe the bill for the average household could be &euro;1,200 to &euro;1,300 higher than it would have been two years ago, which may be the best comparison.  Of course, for lower income households, that is a significant amount.  Estimates indicate that bills for food may be &euro;500 to &euro;600 higher if food price increases materialise as we expect.<\/p> <p>  When economists talk about second-round effects they often relate to the dynamic between prices and wages; high inflation leads to higher wages which in turn passes through to higher prices.  We are not yet seeing evidence of that.  We are not yet seeing any broad-based evidence of higher wages across the economy.  Where we expect this to show up is in gas and oil prices.  They are a key component of production and output across the economy.  That leads to higher production cost for most goods and services.  For some sectors in particular, that will pass through to higher prices for broader consumer goods and services.<\/p> <p>  I also mentioned developments in food prices.  Whether one considers that a second-round effect depends on what way one looks at it.  An important reason why food costs will increase is because of higher gas prices affecting fertiliser which affect food.  Therefore, to some extent it is also a higher second-round effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022032300002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Cassidy"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I appreciate that.  My time is limited so I will just make a couple of points.  One of the most worrying impacts regarding this year is that it is not a blip.  It is not short term.  The ESRI is projecting 5% inflation for 2023.  Dr. Cassidy has said that he expects a higher rate of inflation.  That means what is happening now will be baked in and will get worse next year, which is problematic for low- and middle-income households in particular.<\/p> <p>  On the positive side, the Exchequer and the economy are going stronger.  The ESRI has projected an increase and that we will be in surplus by the end of the year.  In its quarterly bulletin, the Central Bank has projected an improvement in excess of &euro;4 billion since the budget last year.  I am not sure if the Central Bank is still in the same space as the ESRI.  Does Dr. Cassidy believe there is scope for further targeted interventions to support those who will be hardest hit as a result of the high levels of inflation?<\/p> <p>  Where does Dr. Cassidy see the European Central Bank, ECB, response going in regard to this?  Does he see the ECB looking at interest rate increases in the short to medium term?  Does he see the ECB shifting monetary policy, perhaps as a result of the invasion of Ukraine, or are we still looking at supply-side problems, the mismatch between supply and demand, and that it is more likely to result in no change in policy from the ECB in the short term?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022032300002#C00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":396,"content":"<p>The Deputy is absolutely right about the improvement in the public finances.  We have estimated slightly different figures from the ESRI, which we will publish in a couple of weeks.  We probably see the economy remaining in deficit this year.  Previously, we expected a return to surplus next year.  We will probably still be looking at that but there is much uncertainty about how it will materialise.<\/p> <p>  In terms of what more could or should be done, all I can say is that given how things have developed, more measures may well be warranted or necessary.  That is a matter for the Government, however.  When one gets down to that type of decision, it is matter for elected representatives generally to debate.  The public finances were in a healthier position.  There were many improvements in recent years and there was a positive momentum coming into 2022, which leaves us better placed to address these shocks, which is a welcome development.<\/p> <p>  As to the ECB, I will restrict my comments to what it would say which is that while its focus is to achieve its price stability target, inflation of 2% over the medium term, it will not ignore current inflation developments.  While the Deputy is correct that it represents a supply-side shock, and the ECB can do nothing about global supply no more than about domestic policy, but because of the risk of second-round effects, the higher inflation is, the more likely it could pass through to underlying inflationary developments in the medium term.<\/p> <p>  The ECB published new forecasts two or three weeks ago that expect inflation to return to around target levels by 2024.  It is not forecasting excessive inflationary pressures in the coming years.  It also announced a moderation in asset purchases and the rate at which it will continue asset purchases until the summer of 2022.  It will announce at its next meeting in June what it will do in the third quarter.  It is emphasising optionality in the current circumstances given the high degree of uncertainty.  The ECB will undoubtedly remain absolutely committed its primary mandate that is price stability.  If there are signs that the medium-term outlook is for inflation above 2%, it will not hesitate to act.  However, on the other hand, if things go in the other direction from an inflation perspective, it will act in the other way.  The ECB is not committed.<\/p><p>It is maintaining its options open.

The higher inflation is now, the more likely it is that the medium-term forecast for the ECB will be even higher.  The current rate of inflation is relevant and is one of the factors the ECB looks at in making its decision.  If the current rate remains high, however, and the ECB does not expect this to pass through to the longer term, then that higher rate would not by itself be enough to change.  In addition to the current rate, the ECB will look at the headline rate over the medium term.  It also looks at the core underlying rate over the medium term, in other words, the rate that excludes energy prices.  It has set explicit conditions for all three of those.

Any situation like those mentioned by Deputy Lahart would probably be reflected in global energy prices being significantly higher than that, probably closer to their current levels than the benchmark expectation might be.  Dr. Cassidy mentioned that we are adding 1% to 2% to inflation this year as a result of currently available information.  If energy prices were expected to remain higher than they currently are for a longer period of time, we would be adding another 1% to 2% to the rate of inflation and doing something similar on the negative side to the growth rate.  You would expect the growth rate to be significantly lower than what we currently forecast or envisage in the context of the conflict as it is today.  Our previous forecasts had growth in the domestic economy of around 7% this year.  Based on current information, one could expect that growth to be around 1% to 2% lower when we come out with our forecast.

The current debt ratio as a share of income is around 100%.  There is no precise figure.  The days when people put a very exact figure on this are over.

Obviously if the Government reduces VAT or excise duty, at some point it will have to raise them again when the crisis is over and therein lies the difficulty.

Economically that is what one wants to do, to sustain spending in the economy and to prevent hardship within the economy.  One of the reasons, if not the main reason, we argue for lowering the public debt ratio during good times is to build up the funds or the buffers to allow us to spend money during times like Covid or the war in Ukraine.  When a temporary shock hits the economy it is absolutely appropriate to diagnose who is most affected and for money to be spent to alleviate the hardship caused.  The lower the debt ratio is at the start of the crisis, the more the economy is able to do that while continuing to borrow on international markets.  We came into this crisis in much better shape than the crisis of 2010 to 2012, when international markets would not lend to us because they judged that our debt position was not necessarily sustainable.  The first point to emphasise is the importance of getting the debt lower when times are good.<\/p> <p>  The second point that is extremely important is the difference between a temporary shock hitting the economy and a permanent shock.  If a permanent shock hits the economy, then it is a very different matter in terms of the appropriate policy response.  To give an example in the current context, ultimately if higher energy prices are permanent and if the prices we see now persist forever, then for an energy importing economy like Ireland, the economy becomes permanently worse off and we have to pay that cost.  No Government policies can restore the previous cost of energy supply and the money to meet the extra costs cannot be borrowed indefinitely.  It then becomes a political decision on how the costs will be redistributed within society.  Permanent shocks are very different because we cannot borrow the money forever to pay for them and society needs to make a choice about how those costs will ultimately be redistributed or absorbed over the longer term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022032300002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Cassidy"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I ask Dr. Cassidy to define a permanent shock.

On the last point about the nature of the energy price increases, Europe has substantially increased its renewable energy production.  I think I am correct in saying that 2020 was the first year in which the majority of electricity in Europe was produced renewably.  We have actually increased the renewable energy supply in Europe and in this country but that has not made a damn bit of difference to the cost of energy.  I ask Dr. Cassidy to explain that conundrum.  The narrative we are hearing from the Government is that faced with these shocks, we have to wean ourselves off our reliance on fossil fuels.  Now, for climate change reasons, we should do so anyway but there is an implication that if we do that, and develop more indigenous renewable energy, it will somehow lead to a reduction in the price of energy and electricity.  Is there any reason to believe that, other than the ideological assumption underpinning it?  It would be interesting to hear the Central Bank's response to that because when I look at the situation, given that the market is setting these prices regardless of where or how the energy or electricity is produced, there seems to be no evidence to support that suggestion.<\/p> <p>  The difficulty we have is that when we are talking about inflation and the cost of energy rising, there is an implication that we are all in this together in suffering the consequences, that this is a big problem for everybody.  Is it fair comment to say that it is not a big problem at all for those who produce energy?  Actually, they are doing extraordinarily well and this is a tale of two shocks.  There is the shock for the majority who have to buy the petrol, energy or electricity from the producers and suppliers but what we are witnessing is a bonanza in profit for those same producers and suppliers, whether the energy is renewable or fossil-fuel based.  That is actually what is happening here.  I would be interested to hear Dr. Cassidy's comments on that.  Is that an accurate description of what is happening in this country, in Europe and globally?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022032300002#E00800","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":428,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's first question, I agree.  I do not think that what we will see in the transition to renewables are lower prices or that this is their main intention.  The main intention of the transition to renewables away from fossil fuels relates to climate change objectives and, potentially, security of energy supply so that we become less reliant on international sources.  As far as I know, there is no evidence to suggest that this is being done to reduce the cost of energy.  Indeed renewables, at the moment at least, would be more expensive and there are potential inflationary effects in the shift to renewables.  I do not disagree with what Deputy Boyd Barrett is saying.  I am not very aware of the alternative argument, that it is being done for price reasons.<\/p> <p>  On the second issue, what Deputy Boyd Barrett is saying is also correct.  From a national perspective, we could look at it as the difference between energy exporting and energy importing countries.  This is a shock that benefits energy exporting countries at the expense of energy importing countries like Ireland.  That said, there is a shock to supply so it is not that energy exporting countries are able produce and sell the same amount of energy as they did previously and charge twice the price.  Certainly, the current situation benefits energy exporters at the expense of energy importers.  It is a terms of trade shock, I suppose and that is the nature of the shock.  <\/p> <p>  I would not say that it is the same within the energy sector.  I would not say it is the same for those selling energy, for example, energy retailers because they are paying the higher prices in order to purchase the energy and passing those on.  I do not have information on the extent to which they are passing those increases on or whether the increases are more or less than they are paying.  Certainly, the benefits of higher energy prices generally are felt by those producing the energy, the ultimate producers of it, at the expense of the energy importers or consumers.<\/p><p>I am not disagreeing with anything the Deputy is saying in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022032300002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Cassidy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Cassidy.  I think there are important implications of this.  In a globalised economy, the owners of the energy supplies are really the shareholders, who are not limited.  The companies will be based in a particular country, whether that is BP or Shell in Britain or Aramco in Saudi Arabia, but people with additional wealth in this country buy shares in these companies.  I often find the Central Bank's quarterly report at the beginning of the year fascinating, in which it shows the increases in household wealth, which have been pretty dramatic over the past ten years or so.  Many households in this country would be stunned to hear that household wealth had increased dramatically year on year for the past decade or so, but the Central Bank's reports demonstrate that.  That clearly indicates that very wealthy households have seen a very significant increase in their wealth.  Some of that is property based, given the rise in the value of property, but if I read the report at the beginning of the year correctly, it indicated that many of those increases were accounted for by increases in financial assets, that is, shares, dividends, savings and all that kind of stuff.<\/p> <p>  The wealthiest households in this country - this is probably an international pattern - have seen their wealth increase greatly.  Is it fair to say, therefore, that if they are shareholders in companies that are making significant profits, such as energy companies or arms companies, which have also been doing well recently, the inflation crisis is not a problem for them at all?  The increasing value of their investments, if they have investments in companies such as petrol, energy or arms companies, means they actually are benefiting from the inflation crisis that is crucifying everybody else.

According to the figures, by far the largest proportion of the increase in wealth relates to housing wealth.  The main distinction that could be drawn would be between those who have owned houses throughout recent years during the period of this increase in wealth against those who have not owned houses.<br\/><br\/>The second large increase has related to household savings.  There has been something of a distributional impact there.  Household savings have increased significantly since the outbreak of Covid and they have been concentrated among those sectors of the economy that have been less severely affected by Covid, where people have not lost their jobs but have not had the same opportunities to spend, so they have accumulated significant savings.  At the other end of the spectrum, those parts of the economy that were first to close did not accumulate the same level of savings and they tend to be dominated by lower-income workers.  Lower-income workers did not have the same opportunities to save as did higher-income workers.<br\/><br\/>In regard to the increase in the value of other financial assets, Ireland holds a very small share of financial assets outside of bank accounts and of property, which of course is non-financial.  Shares and so on constitute a very small overall proportion of the wealth in comparison with other countries and account for only a small proportion of the overall increase in wealth during that period.  It is true equity markets did well over a number of years, although not over recent years.  The current crisis is different from other fluctuations in oil prices whereby if oil prices increase, the oil producers make money, and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  This is complicated by the fact that many of the oil producers will have been negatively affected by developments in Russia too.  They may pull out of Russia and their businesses may be affected.  It will take a while to understand the implications of the current developments in Ukraine for energy companies generally.  As for the second part of the Deputy's question, suggesting the increase in wealth that has been recorded reflects the increase in value of shares in energy and oil companies, no, I really do not see that..<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022032300002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Cassidy"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":432,"content":"<p>I was not saying it was just that, I was just giving that as an example.

They will have been struggling already with the cost of living.  This suggests there is a layer of the population that has additional money and that has seen its household wealth increase.

It is possible it will get somewhat worse.<\/p><p>The analysis in December probably did not fully reflect what was coming down the line in terms of oil and gas prices, and fertiliser prices which will be a very important element of inflation this year.  Deputy Canney is, therefore, absolutely correct.<\/p><p> The Deputy is also correct about fixed incomes or those parts of the economy that are not going to see the same increases in earnings as maybe other parts of the economy.  Let us say the average rate of inflation this year is 6%.  If average earnings across the economy are increasing by between 3% and 4%, that means the average household is having a decline in real incomes of around 2%.  If somebody does not earn between 3% and 4% more and has the same income this year as last year, that is a much larger reduction in their purchasing power and real income during the year.  It is absolutely correct to say that rural communities are harder hit and that people on a fixed income or those who earn lower income increases experience larger declines in real incomes.<\/p><p> In terms of policy, given how things have developed, more measures may well be warranted or necessary.  That is a matter for Government, however, and it would be getting beyond our mandate for us to get into what specific policies may be introduced.<\/p><p> With regard to VAT, it is known that there are challenges with European fiscal rules.  We have a derogation for electricity and gas where the current rate is lower than the rate for other products and it could not return to that lower rate.  I am not an expert on European fiscal rules but it would be useful if any changes to those rules could be agreed at European level in order that one is operating within the framework.  To go beyond would really be to get into the policy sphere, and it is more appropriate that elective representatives rather than us discuss and debate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022032300002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Cassidy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":437,"content":"<p>On the cost of living, Dr. Cassidy spoke about energy in terms of security of supply and having independence.

Given the emergency and our reliance on outside supplies of energy, should we put in place emergency measures in the interim to ensure we can fast-track projects to deliver the green energy we all crave?<\/p> <p>  A good example of a project that has gone pear-shaped is the Derrybrien wind farm located in my constituency.  The ESB has now decided to decommission 70 wind power generating turbines because planning permission was not correct and the ESB has been told by An Bord Plean&aacute;la that substitute consent will not be given.  This decision flies in the face of what we are trying to create, namely, a secure green energy supply for the country.  Should we look at how we spread our resources around the country in terms of providing infrastructure, public transport and rail networks so that we can have connectivity, get people off the roads, out of their cars and into trains and have better options for people, including people who live in rural areas?  That is why people in rural areas are more affected by the inflation we are currently experiencing.<\/p> <p>  Fiscal rules were mentioned.

I am not aware of the specific projects that he referred to.  At a more economy-wide level, a key challenge is that we need to attract more investors to build flexible, cleaner gas-fired generators to supplement what we will have from wind-generated sources of electricity.<\/p> <p>  In recent years, we have been moving from a reliance on fossil fuels towards more renewable sources of energy.  Already, around 40% of our electricity is generated from renewable sources.  At the same time, we still have a higher degree of reliance on fossil fuels.  As the last couple of years have suggested, the generation of wind-powered electricity can be volatile.  There can be shocks to that supply, whether that is due to weather conditions or for other reasons.  One risks, and we have seen that risk called out during last year, the situation where, in moving out of fossil fuels and closing oil or coal plants, one is not making up the difference and one does not have enough renewable sources of energy.  We have had that experience called out over the last couple of years.  I do not have an answer in terms of exact policies but we need to think about incentivising and attracting more investors to build flexible, clean gas-fired generators to go along with wind-generated energy.  That would help to continue to reduce the reliance on fossil fuels and must happen.  At the same, we must reinforce energy supply to ensure we are not vulnerable to fluctuations in wind-powered energy.<\/p> <p>  My colleague, Dr. O'Brien, will respond to the question on fiscal rules.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022032300002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Cassidy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":439,"content":"<p>Specifically for 2022 and 2023, it would be a matter for the Council to decide the degree of flexibility that would be provided.

It has been an interesting discussion so far.  Unfortunately, I have had to pop in between different meetings.  If I repeat something, please let me know.  These are extremely difficult times.  It is interesting to see the conversation in the media.  Even before the invasion of Ukraine, there was a conversation about rising inflation.  At that time, many media commentators seemed to think that interest rates would rise in the European Central Bank, ECB, although it was clear that it would not increase them.  The witnesses speak about rising inflation and the underlying causes being supply bottlenecks for energy and so on.  I do not know how making borrowing more expensive and reducing economic activity addresses that.  We already have the second highest mortgage interest rates in the EU, at more than double the EU average.  January saw the typical new mortgage rate increase by 0.7%, which was the largest monthly increase in almost five years.  High mortgage rates add more than &euro;2,200 a year to the cost of living in Ireland.  Does an interest rate increase spell more bad news for homeowners who are nearing the end of their fixed term and for potential homeowners?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022032300002#H00600","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":448,"content":"<p>Earlier this month, the ECB announced its latest monetary policy stance and what it expects to happen.  It announced a reduction in the new asset purchases that it undertakes, that it will consider the future of asset purchases from the third quarter of this year, and that interest rates will only increase after asset purchases have stopped.  That does not mean that asset purchases will finish from the third quarter but that it will be considered only at that time, and interest rates will not increase until after that.  That is the official policy stance of the ECB.<\/p> <p>  Interest rates are abnormally low.  At some time, interest rates will normalise.  I will not put a timeframe on that.  A normalisation of interest rates will affect floating rate mortgage holders first.  Ultimately, it will affect those who have fixed rates of short duration.  It will transmit through much of the market and lead to higher payments.  We have looked at two scenarios.  A one percentage point interest rate increase would lead to an additional repayment of approximately &euro;130 each month.  A two percentage point increase would lead to an additional repayment of approximately &euro;260 a month.  That would add to repayment issues.  If that came along with the current severe pressures, that would make matters worse for households.  Higher interest rates from the ECB will not bring down the current rate of inflation, which is currently 5.9%.  That would not address the nature of the problem.  Monetary policy acts with a lag.  One cannot cure high inflation now.  Higher rates could ultimately lead to stronger underlying demand pressures over the medium term, which need to be contained, otherwise higher inflation can set in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022032300002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mark Cassidy"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":449,"content":"<p>I am happy to hear Mr. Cassidy say that.  It is what I have been trying to say and sometimes shouting at the television.  It is sometimes frustrating to hear about inflation and to hear people saying that we need to increase interest rates.

He will be sick of me talking about him.  I thank him for that.  It was a nice upturn.<\/p> <p>  Predicting financial downturns is tricky.  One metric that has a good predictive record is yield curve inversion.  An inverted yield curve is a situation in which long-term debt is considered less risky than short-term debt of the same credit quality.  In other words, it is seen as riskier to borrow short term than long term because it is expected that trouble is just around the corner.  I was looking at the USA's yield curve on Monday.  The five-year and ten-year yield curve was inverted, as was the three-year and ten-year yield curve.  The two-year and ten-year yield curve was just 19 base points away from inversion.  It seems that where the USA is concerned, the market is pricing in a high recession risk.  These inversions occur against a backdrop of an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve.  What are the witnesses' views on higher interest rates increasing the risk of recession in the EU?  What are the implications for Ireland, particularly with regard to the significant tax debt that has been warehoused and the significant number of companies experiencing cashflow problems at being at risk of going under?  We saw a large construction company go bust this week.  What are the implications for wage increases which, so far, have been concentrated in certain sectors where there has been strong demand, as Dr. Cassidy mentioned?  We hope that will spill over into other, lower paid sectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022032300002#H00800","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":450,"content":"<p>We are seeing the inversion of the yield curve in the USA.  We do not see it in the euro area.  Traditionally, an inversion of the yield curve often indicates that markets expert a downturn in the future.  They expect that longer-term interest rates will be lower than shorter-term rates.  Therefore, at some stage in the future, the Central Bank will reduce interest rates.  The Central Bank usually reduces interest rates because economic conditions are bad.  The Deputy is right in what she suggests.  I am not sure at the moment and think other factors could be behind this.  I would not put it down to expectations relating to the economic outlook.<\/p><p>At the moment the expected pace of interest rate rises in the US is very sharp.  Unless things divert from the current path there will be a number of interest rate rises in the near term, during 2022, into 2023.  It reflects a number of things but as much as anything it may reflect the sharp short-term pace, which will then normalise, rather than the fact that the downturn indicates recession.  I couch that with much uncertainty.  There are many reasons why a yield curve could be inverted.  Many market expectations can be reflected in that.

Obviously that is attributed to external factors and as Dr. Cassidy noted in his opening statement, supply-side issues.  Russian gas supplies, from what I can see, have actually been increasing rather than decreasing and according to one source by as much as 40%.  I also checked the International Energy Agency&rsquo;s most recent report produced this month, which stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe OPEC+ alliance agreed on 2 March to stick with a modest, scheduled output rise ... insisting no supply shortage exists.  Saudi Arabia and the UAE &ndash; the only producers with substantial spare capacity &ndash; are, so far, showing no willingness to tap into their reserves. <\/blockquote> <p>So, if supplies have not reduced but have actually increased and production costs are unchanged, is it speculation about future prices that is driving it?  I would be interested to hear that because obviously I have heard about the price of oil and gas futures having risen sharply but as we know, futures are essentially bets on the future and we know the future is extremely uncertain as we saw in the last few months with the invasion of Ukraine.

The Commission for Regulation of Utilities is better placed.  We are seeing enormous price increases for households, whether at the petrol pump or for electricity and gas but they are on the back of very large increases in international gas and oil prices.  These figures change every day.  International oil prices could be up maybe about 30% on where they were two years ago.  International gas prices are up by several hundred percentage points, they have increased by multiples.  That is actually something of a difference between the current energy crisis and previous ones.  Previous energy crises have nearly always been dominated by fluctuations in oil prices.  Fluctuations in gas prices is quite new and it shows the reliance that all of us have on gas.<\/p> <p>  In terms of gas and electricity, the latest increases show annual increases of 22.3% in one and 27.8% in the other.  That was in February and does not take into consideration any of the latest increases so there will be still further increases on top of that.  I reiterate that this reflects what we have seen.  Whether there is less or more than full pass-on, it primarily reflects what we have seen in international markets.  <\/p> <p>  The futures are for both to remain high and then gradually moderate from the second half of the year.  That is what the futures are expecting but to remain much higher than would have been expected two to three years ago.  However the expectation in future markets is to remain high but to moderate during the second half of the year.  In making our own forecasts, we use future prices for oil and gas to reflect those.  The one thing I always say about future oil and gas prices is that history and experience show that they are useless at forecasting what actually happens with oil and gas but they are probably better than anything else.  The ECB and ourselves have done a great deal of work and have not found any better way of forecasting.  We have done all the models we can.

Households will undoubtedly see an increase in mortgage repayments.  I quoted some figures whereby a 1% rise in interest rates would lead to an increase of around &euro;130 per month for the average mortgage holders.  Those most affected would be those on floating rates or tracker mortgages.  That would be the most obvious impact that households would feel.  From an economic perspective, higher interest rates also work to slow down business investment within the economy.  Interest rates are usually increased because the economy is beginning to grow at a faster rate than the Central Bank is comfortable with and that is being reflected and shown up in higher interest rates.  Higher interest rates slow the rate of economic growth overall because they slow household consumption, because households are paying more on mortgages and have pay more to borrow money.

It is easy to forget the dangers of high inflation but we are seeing them now.  If high inflation were to persist for a number of years, we would see much worse problems.

It is not that the ECB has specific powers to prevent any firms from increasing prices, but by keeping overall inflation at modest levels it reduces the risk of what the Deputy described.

Russia obviously operates in a global context as well.  If Russian banks and banking firms default, will that have an impact on inter-bank interest rates?  What might that mean?  What would the impacts of that be?  Is there a significant concern around that and, more broadly, around the impact of a default by the Russian state?<\/p><p>I am interested that while Ireland is not particularly exposed, we might intersect with them in certain sectors.  For example, I suspect there is lots of Russian investment, and probably lots of Irish investment too, in the London property market.  Are there particular sectors like that which the Central Bank might be aware of?  There is that aspect.

They are, very clearly, for us the two main effects.<\/p> <p>  On the possibility of default by the Russian banks, I rely little bit more the European Central Bank analysis for this because they have a greater insight into the European banking system.  The Irish retail banks, the ones that matter for the stability of our financial system, have negligible exposures to Russia, Ukraine, or anything affected by that.  In Europe there are some banks that are more exposed than others.  There are some individual banks that could find the situation problematic because of their exposures but in terms of the overall banking system, they are not a significant enough part to cause concern for the financial stability overall.  I would say the same for Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The London property market is an interesting example.  I would say that there are localised sectoral concerns like that.  In terms of the impact on Ireland, or those issues affecting the economy, those risks would be lower than the ones that I mentioned earlier.

It is a good example of what we were getting at previously, which is some sectors being affected.  Undoubtedly, Ireland has a large part of that leasing business, with around 60% of the world's leased aircraft being managed from Ireland.  I believe that 18 of the world's top 20 companies are managed from Ireland.  This is having an effect.  I do not have to hand the value of the transactions that might be affected.  As to how it affect the Irish economy, individual leasing firms clearly will be affected. Some will be affected more as some are more exposed than others.  The Chairman has made a very useful distinction in the question.  The national accounts will be affected to an extent.  The national accounts are very volatile in Ireland.  One reason is that aircraft leasing developments can affect investment and import developments but in fact they do so in a way that has no relevance for the actual Irish economy.  This is why we make these distinctions and why, for example, we say that GDP is not particularly relevant.

Let us say that it is half of the 1.9% that Ireland would be responsible for, were 10 million Ukrainians to be displaced.  Our figure would then be in the region of 100,000.

What is the Central Bank's view about our ability to do that?

It could not actually bring the prices below or to the level where the majority of people could afford them.  Now we are seeing another inflation crisis on top of that, which means that the cost of building materials and so on is going up further.

Clearly, with such a problem, you need a lot of social and affordable houses to be built in order that we can house our population.  There are issues with the building, development, cost and production of housing.  It is absolutely nothing to do with labour and the Deputy is right about that.

We need to be able to build houses better and smarter.  I would not give up on the ability of the market to do that.  It needs reforms within the housing sector that will allow the market to do that.  That is where you will get the most efficient housing market, which is not to leave aside that there will always be a need for social and affordable housing and for the Government to build houses itself.  There will always be a need for that but it needs to be side by side with an efficient, flourishing private market.

Certainly on the microside, if businesses have been operating for a long time, there is a memory of what happened previously that could also influence behaviour.  There is the cash buffer Dr. Cassidy mentioned but there has also been, to a certain extent as we have seen particularly during the past two years, the success of the support schemes that have been put in place, which have basically masked some of the need potentially for accessing liquidity through other means but that will be an issue, as was alluded to earlier, when those support schemes come to be wound down.  Hopefully, the broad thrust of economic growth will ensure firms will be taken on and they will not need the supports but they will still need, as some evidence from colleagues who have done research on this in this bank would show, liquidity support in some way, shape or form, whether it would be come through State backed schemes such as through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, other schemes or through the private market unaided.

Mr. Igor Pokojn&yacute;.  No doubt the ambassador would have been interested in and listening to the contributions to last week's meeting.  We had a marathon five-hour meeting and I thank the Vice Chairman, Deputy Howlin, for chairing it.  We want to create a better understanding of what is happening in the ambassador's country and we are looking forward to this discussion today.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, I have a note on privilege to read and some housekeeping matters.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if the witness's statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue his remarks.  It is imperative the witness complies with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, there are limitations to parliamentary privilege, and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses participating in the committee session from a jurisdiction outside of the State are advised that they should be mindful of the domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I would ask members partaking by MS teams prior to making their contribution to the meeting to confirm they are in the grounds of the Leinster House campus.<\/p> <p>  I call on the ambassador to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022032300002#C00200","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":530,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and members of the joint committee.  I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs the Slovak Republic's response to Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine.<\/p> <p>  This unjustified Russian military aggression on Ukraine is a clear violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and of international law.  It is an extremely difficult time for Ukraine as well as for all of Europe, especially in these days when the illegal annexation of Crimea by Russia eight years ago was marked on 18 March.  Ukraine needs universal political support, including the possibility of EU membership as well as financial and humanitarian aid from the international community.  Slovakia has repeatedly proven by its deeds that it stands with Ukraine.  Slovakia strongly supports the prospect of Ukraine's possible EU membership.<\/p> <p>  With partners from Europe and beyond the Atlantic, it was agreed that it is necessary to isolate Russia further to end Putin's military aggression and return peace to the European Continent.  The Russian Federation and Belarus will bear responsibility for this unprecedented violation of international law.<\/p><p>Slovakia is ready to support anything that will make the Russian and Belarusian regimes change their behaviour and end the invasion of Ukraine.<br\/><br\/>As a clear situation of immediate and serious humanitarian urgency has emerged in Ukraine, Slovak authorities make extensive use of the option provided by Article 6 of the Schengen borders code and allow for the entry into Slovak territory of persons who do not otherwise fulfil the usual entry requirements, such as being in possession of visas.  Documents allowing for the identification of the travellers are being accepted even if they are expired or damaged.  Information about the options available to persons incoming from Ukraine is available and frequently updated at <i>ua.gov.sk<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>Slovakia, as a neighbouring country with Ukraine, has opened its border and has so far received more than 270,000 refugees, mostly women and children.  It is estimated that an average of up to 10,000 refugees are entering Slovakia each day.  Since Slovakia is a small country of 5 million people and its border with Ukraine is only 100 km long, measures are being deployed to handle this large influx of people fleeing war.  Since not only nationals of Ukraine are fleeing war, Slovakia, alongside other relevant countries, has thus far organised 15 repatriation flights to India, China, Egypt and Morocco with more than 2,000 refugees on board.  Thirty-four special humanitarian trains with almost 3,000 refugees were organised from the Slovak-Ukrainian border to the Czech Republic.<br\/><br\/>The so-called Lex Ukraine Bill adopted by the Slovak Parliament addresses the issues of health and social insurance for asylum seekers, their employment and the presence of NATO troops on our territory.  Refugees who wish to stay in Slovakia can either request asylum or temporary protection, which is a new legal status approved by the Slovak Parliament after Russia invaded Ukraine.  The fastest way for refugees to receive support is to ask for temporary protection, which allows people to not only stay in Slovakia but also to receive accommodation, food, healthcare and work permits.  If a refugee has temporary protection, his or her healthcare fee is covered by the state.  This includes emergencies as well as further medical examinations and treatment.  It is possible to ask for temporary protection at the Slovak borders or at the departments of the alien police.  These currently operate non-stop and are dedicated solely to Ukrainians fleeing their country.<br\/><br\/>Refugees who cross the border are met by volunteers and state institutions offering humanitarian aid.  There are heated tents where people can sit and rest, and volunteers provide food and warm drinks.  Diverse collections of donations assembled by Slovaks are freely available on the spot, comprising items such as nappies, toiletries, durable foods, clothes and toys.<br\/><br\/>Transport from the border crossing to temporary accommodation is co-ordinated on the spot.  There are buses, taxi services and even volunteers who come with their cars offer to drive people.  Some municipalities and bus services provide free shuttle services.  Free of charge are also buses used to transport people from villages near the Ukrainian border to bigger Slovak cities with better infrastructure.  Furthermore, free transport is available for Ukrainian refugees on the trains run by the national carrier, which is the vast majority of trains in Slovakia.<br\/><br\/>A refugee child can register for a kindergarten or school.  More than 1,000 Ukrainian children have been enrolled in Slovak kindergartens, primary and secondary schools since the war in Ukraine began.  The ministry of education has been preparing a one-off financial contribution for schools to cover the increased costs.  Slovak schools are also working on employing teachers from Ukraine.<br\/><br\/>There is a dedicated website created for refugees from Ukraine, where they can register and apply for jobs.<br\/><br\/>With thousands of Ukrainian refugees arriving in Slovakia every day, the burden on the Slovak healthcare system will increase and some patients will have to be relocated to other countries in the near future due to an overload.  We consider the lack of staff, medicines and medical supplies to be the main problems for the future.<br\/><br\/>For Slovakia, as part of the EU and NATO, it is of key importance to note that since the very beginning we have had clear plans on how to strengthen our defence, especially along the eastern wing of the EU and alliance.  There is an airport in the western Ukrainian city of Uzghorod that can be attacked.  The runway of this airport ends just 50 m from the border with Slovakia.  This as an example of why it is vital for Slovakia to enhance the defence of our eastern border.<br\/><br\/>Last week, the Slovak Parliament approved the NATO enhanced forward presence in Slovakia, allowing the presence of up to 2,100 NATO soldiers.  The NATO unit consists of Czech, Dutch, Polish, Slovenian, American and German soldiers.  This unit brings some important capabilities that Slovakia lacks at the moment, notably the Patriot air defence system.  The defence of Slovakia and the eastern flank of NATO was discussed during last week&rsquo;s visit of the US Defence Secretary, Lloyd Austin, to Slovakia.  He met with President Zuzana aputov&aacute;, Prime Minister Eduard Heger and Defence Minister Jaroslav Na.  They declared both countries' readiness to help Ukraine defend itself.<br\/><br\/>Based on the evaluation of the Slovak intelligence services, the Slovak Republic expelled three diplomats and workers from the Russian embassy for their activities in violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.<br\/><br\/>It is essential to continue to provide war-torn Ukraine with many forms of aid, especially humanitarian assistance.  It is important that providing such aid be sustainable in the long term.  Hundreds of thousands of people fleeing the war are coming to Slovakia.  I would like to highlight the exceptional wave of solidarity with refugees which Slovaks and many other nations, including Ireland, are showing.  I also thank the European Commission and EU member countries that have positively responded and shown interest in helping us in this difficult situation.  We will continue to widely support Ukraine.  It is not alone.  I thank the committee members for their attention and am open to any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022032300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

We are having discussions about that issue here.  We are probably getting that influx of refugees a little later because Slovakia borders Ukraine and is much closer to the war.

I would ask this question of a representative of any country, but how is Slovakia verifying that transportation and has the ambassador any concerns about the trafficking of, in particular, vulnerable women?  I ask that question without accusing Slovakia of anything.  I have heard some stories.  Because of the necessity for transportation, it is difficult to vet people and carry out background checks.  Many people are offering their services for free.  It is a panicked situation because we need to get people away from the borders and reception centres and deliver them to other locations.  There is no way of checking individuals who are providing those services, most of whom, I am sure, are doing the best of work.  However, as with any crisis, one or two people are looking to do the wrong thing, if I can put it that way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022032300002#D00200","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":533,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  We are using everything we have for accommodation.  It was very difficult at the beginning.  We are now using hotels and any other accommodation that is available and not in use.  It is not only state property.  Private property is also being used.  As I mentioned, the Lex Ukrainian Bill provides for how these people should be accommodated and how to help the people who are providing the accommodation.  We are using everything available.  The committee will understand that we did not have time to think it over beforehand.<\/p><p>On the way, issues are arising which are challenging and we are resolving them.  The answer is that we are using everything we have because we are a very small country.  Compared to Ireland, we are 5 million people.  The committee can imagine that it is really a huge influx of people.<\/p><p> Regarding transport and how we can secure transport, first of all, it should be noted that most of the transport is provided by the state and municipalities.  This transport is safe.  The other point is that usually with the transport provided for refugees, there are also some security measures taken.<\/p><p> I am not sure if I mentioned, for example, that people are entering even without valid documents or without visas.  I am talking about the other side, people entering Slovakia.  It does not mean that we are not checking all these people.  If there are people who have no documentation, they are not forced to stay out of Slovakia.  They are welcome in Slovakia.  Nevertheless, they are going to special centres where they are provided with humanitarian aid as well as go through the registration the process.  We know who is entering and we know mostly where they are going or where they are staying but at times it is difficult to say.  For example, I know many Ukrainians are arriving in Ireland on flights, especially from Poland, and I was approached by some Irish friends and colleagues.  Since the Slovak language and the Ukrainian language are very similar, I was asked to approach our community to ask if people had somewhere people could stay, especially during the St. Patrick's Day week because accommodation was all booked out.  What I am saying is that like here and like every country where there is a huge influx of refugees, Slovakia is doing practically everything to accommodate them and it is manageable so far.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022032300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

The Deputy will be aware that we are quite a young country.  Like Ireland, Slovakia is 100 years old.  In 2018, we celebrated 100 years since the establishment of Czechoslovakia, by which I mean the first independent state of Czechs and Slovaks.  As Slovakia, we are independent from 1993.<\/p> <p>  If the Deputy remembers 1968, Czechoslovakia was an independent country.  During the Second World War, it was liberated by the Soviet army.  Until 1947, Czechoslovakia was not a communist or socialist country but then there were elections and Czechoslovakia became some kind of communist country at the time.  Nevertheless, Czechoslovakia tried to get out from under the influence of the Soviet Union in 1968 and we were invaded by Soviet troops and by troops from the Warsaw Pact.  I am saying this only to explain that we are really very sensitive to what is going on now in Ukraine.  We are not alone in having experienced this.  For example, in 1956, Hungary was in the same situation.  Poland was also in this situation.  The struggle to get out from under the influence of the former Soviet Union was experienced by all countries and this applies to Ukraine as well.<\/p> <p>  We were in a better situation after 1989, following the fall of communism in central and eastern Europe.  Ukraine was not so fortunate because Ukraine stayed under the influence of Russia.  This resulted in the annexation of Crimea and of Abkhazia.  One can see there are spots, or countries, that Russia has invaded or that are under Russian influence - to check on or control what is going on in these countries.  I am talking not only about Ukraine but about Georgia and the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic, which, in English, is called Transnistria.  One can see that these attempts by Russia or some forces in Russia to control or to check neighbouring countries is still going on and these countries are trying to get rid of this influence.<\/p> <p>  I could not believe Russia would do something like this - a military invasion to bomb a neighbouring country - especially as Russians and Ukrainians fought for freedom together in the Second World War.  Czechoslovakia was liberated not only by the Russian army.  It was the Soviet army consisting of soldiers from all the former Soviet republics - the Baltic states, Ukraine, Georgia.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure if this is enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022032300002#E00900","nonspeaker":"H.E.

First, the idea of a model \"Lex Ukraine\"  is one we might have a look at - codifying what refugees are entitled to in a legal framework - because part of the issue we have now is how, in a co-ordinated way, to provide information to people arriving here.  I am conscious that in his presentation, the ambassador tells us that 10,000 refugees a day are crossing into Slovakia.  We have had 10,000 in total so far and the scale is of an entirely different order.<\/p> <p>  I have two questions.  Slovakia provides, within this Lex Ukraine, the provision for people to work in Slovakia.  The information we seem to be getting is that many people, particularly moving as far as the neighbouring countries of Ukraine, in their mind at least have the notion that they will return home over the next few weeks or, at most, months.  Is Slovakia making provision for a long-term hosting of significant numbers?  Has the ambassador any notion how long refugees will stay in Slovakia?  There have been 270,000 refugees to date.  If the bombardment of Kyiv increases, there will be probably a great deal more.  How many will be long-stay residents of Slovakia?<\/p> <p>  In that context, is Slovakia working at a trans-European level to share the number of refugees across European countries on any structured basis?  I am conscious that the focus has to be on the wishes of the refugees themselves.  They cannot simply be transported to a country they know nothing about if they are unwilling to move but at the same time there is limited capacity, if we are talking about 10 million displaced people right now, for neighbouring countries to cope on their own.<\/p> <p>  What is the ambassador's expectation in terms of duration of stay?  Is it possible to have one?  Second, what level of co-ordination on a trans-European level is there for a sharing of accommodation across all member states and, indeed, beyond the member states of the European Union?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022032300002#F01500","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":562,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

The situation in Ukraine has demonstrated to other European countries that co-operation between different organisations is important, such as between NATO and the EU.  It is important that we work together.  I am aware there are different views on why we are trying to build military capabilities in the EU when we already have NATO.

I thank the ambassador for the presentation.  He clearly conveyed the immediacy and reality of what is happening and that 10,000 refugees are crossing the border into Slovakia daily.  It says much about the humanity of Slovakian, Polish and Irish people that we are willing to take in so many refugees amidst all this horror.  If just one positive thing has come out of this situation, it is this aspect.<\/p> <p>  I have two questions, but I will make a general comment first which relates to the last few questions and comments from Deputy Haughey and the Chair.  The ambassador spoke about Slovakia's struggle to escape from the influence of Russia.  I spent 15 years in the European Parliament, and it was not until I met people from Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Hungary and, indeed, Ukraine that I was able to gain some sense of their histories and why they jealously guard their independence, in just the same way we do ours.  I refer to the histories of those countries and the context from which they are coming.  I have come across some people who, certainly before this war started, had some sense that Ukraine was perhaps slightly ambivalent about Russian control.  The people I met did not understand, as the ambassador said, that countries wanted an equal partnership with Russia.  There is a feeling of being sisters and brothers, but that it must be an equal partnership.  Certainly, there has been a lack of understanding here about why countries like Slovakia are part of NATO and why they need to be part of that organisation.  I was taken by the ambassador's comments to the effect that he fully understands our neutrality.  It is extremely important to us, but it is also important that we fully understand Slovakia's situation and why it is part of NATO, and needs to be, for its security.<\/p> <p>  The subject of my first question was referred to by Senator Chambers when she spoke about human trafficking.  Commissioner Johansson said yesterday that the European Commission had activated a network of anti-trafficking co-ordinators.  I wonder if they have started to work.  With 10,000 people coming into Slovakia daily, it is extremely difficult, if not almost impossible, to manage that process and to put other structures in place at the same time.  We must, however, do our very best to protect people, and women and children in particular.  Has that process started?  Is anything happening in that regard?<\/p> <p>  My second question concerns what was said about employing teachers.  How is that initiative working?  Are there issues with language, etc.?  I refer to healthcare staff, because many of those will be coming into Slovakia as well.  Is the country in any way managing to integrate those people into its healthcare systems?  The ambassador almost mentioned that some of the main issues being faced relate to a lack of staff and medical supplies.  That is crucial.  Is any European mechanism in place, or being put in place, to try to ensure the availability of adequate supplies for countries such as Slovakia, Poland, etc., that are on the front line in receiving Ukrainian refugees?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022032300002#H00700","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":577,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her kind words and for understanding our mutual positions.  Regarding human trafficking, frankly, I am not able say much now because I do not have information from on the ground.  Therefore, I am unable to comment on this topic.  I am sorry, but I do not wish to just make up something to tell the Deputy.  I do know that security is important to us and that we have experience with human trafficking.  As I mentioned, I worked as a consul in the UK, and we had many cases of human trafficking there at that time.  Therefore, I understand the problem and I know what the Deputy is talking about, but I am unable to say how the situation stands in respect to refugees now.  However, precautions are being taken because we are well aware of this issue and we have previous experience of it.<\/p> <p>  I turn now to the topic of employing teachers and what the Slovakian Ministry of Education is trying to do in this regard.  The Slovakian and Ukrainian languages are not the same; they are different.  It sounds like they are practically similar, but they are really different.  In the eastern part of Slovakia, however, people speak a language similar to Ukrainian.  Therefore, even before the war, we had some Ukrainian cultural institutions, such as Ukrainian theatre.<\/p><p>We had it before in Slovakia, especially in the eastern part.  This is nothing new for us.  The minister of education is working hard to have a mechanism as soon as possible.  You have to find these teachers because when such a huge influx of people enters a country and you are registering them, the first questions are \"Are you well?\" and \"Do you need any help?\"  The emotional situation of these people is very bad.  They just fled their own country.  They left everything behind.  It takes several days for them to realise where they are and to look at how they can help their countrymen.  <\/p><p> We experience lack of medical staff.  As yet, we are just starting to experience it but it will be a problem for us.  That is why it was discussed at EU level during the recent meeting of ministers of health.  They discussed what to do and how to do it.  People will have to be transported to other countries for medical services or surgery.  This is being discussed now.  We have and will have this problem.  Not only us, but all front-line countries will come across this problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022032300002#H00800","nonspeaker":"H.E.

I commend his country and Government on their response.  It is obviously very challenging because 270,000 refugees going into any country, fleeing war and persecution, is an awful lot.  An increase of about 5.5% in the population over four weeks can be expected to put huge pressures on systems.  The ambassador touched on how much pressure his country's health service is under at this point and into the future.  Does the ambassador have a figure for how many of the 270,000 refugees are still in the country?  How many have moved on to other countries?  I know it is very fluid when we are dealing with up to 10,000 additional refugees arriving every day.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Harkin touched on the major concern highlighted by the EU Commissioner for Home Affairs, Yiva Johansson, when she spoke about the potential for human trafficking, particularly of children.  An estimated figure has been given for Romania of 500 unaccompanied minors or children having arrived there.  Does the ambassador have a figure for children or unaccompanied minors who have arrived in Slovakia?  I appreciate he did not have the full information as to what response is being taken or whether the actions that have been announced have been implemented yet, but he might have a rough figure.<\/p> <p>  Last week we had the ambassador's colleagues from a number of countries before the committee, including the Moldovan ambassador.

It went through Twitter all over the world.  He had only a phone number and his name written on his hand.  He was received by Slovakia and, in a few days, the Slovak authorities were able to find his family living in Europe.  They are already together.  That is not an answer to the question.  There are such issues.  There are many unaccompanied minors but we are doing what we can.  The good thing is that the registering process is a good one.  No one can enter without us knowing who he or she is or where he or she is going, but I do not know the exact figure.<\/p> <p>  Regarding NGOs, crisis management is working in every country.  We had plans with crisis management from day one.  I highlight the role of NGOs.  In the first days, they played a huge role.  Then the state agencies and organisations came in and it all started like a fluent mechanism.  NGOs are important in any humanitarian crisis.  I am not saying it is most of them but a huge number of volunteers are not working with NGOs but just coming, bringing humanitarian aid and coming with their cars.  They are asking: \"Have you somewhere to sleep?\" and are saying \"Come on, you can stay with me.\"  It is not that they just come and pick someone up and choose someone to stay with them.  It is a process.  You cannot just come to pick up a person.  There is a mechanism for this.<\/p> <p>  The question was about NGOs.  Yes, they are very important.

I discerned last week that there was concern that the defence of Georgia, Moldova and the rest of Europe is anchored on ensuring the presence of the United States and that anything that might be perceived as moving away from that would diminish the strength of the protection.

He has put on the table the conversation about possible US involvement or non-involvement in the future.  That brings up the wider question of possible Russian involvement in elections in Europe and other places, but that is for another day.  Putting European militarisation on the agenda and making moves on it at the minute probably only reflect the reality concerning European battlegroups and arrangements made under previous European treaties, etc.  However, considering that we want to make room for Ukraine to enter the EU, does putting these matters on the agenda make negotiation more difficult?  I hope Mr. Vladamir Putin will want a way out at some point and that there will be a negotiation.  I am not going to determine what that negotiation will entail, but we have all probably heard people state off the record at European gigs that we have a general idea where this could go.  It is on the agenda that the Russians will not accept Ukraine joining NATO.  Is there a difficulty in putting on the agenda the question of the EU setting itself up as, or highlighting the point of, a military alliance in that its doing so would become part of a negotiating gambit, just creating difficulties for Ukraine in the future?  I am not saying we should make things easy, because there is ultimately only one person at fault, namely, Vladimir Putin.  The big fear is that he is not looking for a negotiation or way out.

As a committee, we want to keep this issue very much on the agenda.  History is repeating itself, unfortunately.  I remember reading <i>Dynamo<\/i>, a football book set against the backdrop of 1942 when Operation Barbarossa was very much part of Kyiv.  At the time I read it, I thought all of this was behind us and would never happen again.  Reality bites, and it has bitten really hard this time.  <\/p><p>It is important for us as a country that is part of the European Union to not just show solidarity but to keep this issue very live on the agenda.  We will stay in touch with the ambassadors of individual countries along the eastern Baltic.  We had a great five-hour meeting last week.  We do not want to dip in and out of this issue; we want to have continuity because this is an important juncture in the history of the world.  We stand in solidarity with the Ukrainians.  We look forward to further engagement.<\/p><p>I thank the ambassador for his honesty and openness, and his diplomatic skills with some of the questions.

This is something I have considered carefully and discussed with the officials at length.  Before setting out the reasons I do not propose to accept the amendments, I want to make it clear that the obligation on some employers to have internal channels and procedures is an administrative requirement separate from the right of workers to report wrongdoing to their employer.  Therefore, there is no diminution here of the rights of people to make a protected disclosure.<\/p> <p>  Section 6(1) of the Protected Disclosures Act provides that a worker is protected if they report a relevant wrongdoing to their employer.  This applies irrespective of the size of the organisation they work for and the Bill does not change this.  Therefore, regardless of whether their employer has a formal reporting channel or not, all workers, public and private, remain entitled to all of the protections of the legislation.  That is a fundamental point worth remembering.  Workers will also have access to supports such as the Transparency International Ireland Speak Up Helpline to help them in understanding how to make a report.<\/p> <p>  Implementing the requirements as regards internal reporting channels will create a compliance burden for industry.  The European Commission&rsquo;s impact assessment of the directive estimates that the initial set-up costs for a typical small to medium enterprise as being &euro;1,374 in the first year with an ongoing annual cost of &euro;1,054 in subsequent years.  That was based on estimates made in 2017 and with inflation the true cost may now be higher.  This is an issue that I have probed myself to try to understand the costs that are involved in setting up these channels and maintaining them.   <\/p> <p>  Implementing the requirements is not a simple matter of printing a generic policy document and posting it on a wall in an office.  The directive and the Bill are clear that internal channels must be designed, established and operated in a secure manner that protects the confidentiality of the reporting person and the information they have reported.  In practical terms, this will require firms to appoint and train dedicated staff to operate these channels.  It will require the deployment of dedicated, separate and secure channels such as mail boxes, encrypted emails or webforms and dedicated phone lines and voice messaging systems.  All of these will impose costs on organisations.  Blanket imposition of the requirement to have internal channels to all employers would therefore be disproportionate, particularly given the impact of the pandemic and Brexit on the SME sector in Ireland as well as the pressures they are facing from very high inflation, and unworkable in many situations, particularly for micro enterprises.<\/p> <p>  It is hard to see what benefit there is in imposing these elaborate requirements on very small local retailers such as the local sweet shop or on a plumber and his apprentice.  It could also create a compliance burden for some voluntary or member-led organisations with a small cohort of employees, particularly in the areas of sport, such as GAA clubs, golf clubs, rugby clubs and heritage and the arts.<\/p> <p>  Furthermore, article 8.7 of the directive provides that member states can only lower the threshold of 50 employees if they carry out a risk assessment and notify the European Commission accordingly.  The directive sets the floor at 50.  It is open to the member state to go below that but it would require the carrying out of a risk assessment.  This has not been done and, therefore, I cannot accept this amendment.<\/p> <p>  Section 8, by way of the insertion of a new subsection, provides for a regulation-making power to lower or remove the threshold for certain firms or categories of firms subject to a risk assessment and a public consultation.  Therefore, there is an enabling provision within the Bill that would empower the Minister to bring in a regulation that lowers the threshold.  I accept that there are some sectors involved in certain high-risk activities, as the Deputies have raised, which could benefit from being subject to this requirement.  Indeed, the directive and the Bill already provide that the threshold does not apply in the areas of financial services, aviation safety and oil and gas safety, for example, and, of course, there has never been a threshold in the public sector.  It only applies in the private sector.<\/p> <p>  A number of submissions from regulators during the public consultation on the general scheme of the Bill identified other areas where there may be benefits in lowering or abolishing the threshold.  For example, ComReg suggested that operators of premium rate phone lines should be put within the scope of this requirement.  A number of suggestions were also made at the pre-legislative scrutiny hearings regarding certain accountancy firms and some technology firms.  We recognise there may be some merit in that and that is why we have provided the enabling provision in the Bill that is before the committee today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#C00300","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":637,"content":"<p>I understand the Minister's perspective on this and where he is coming from.

This was a key issue raised in the course of pre-legislative discussion and it also was raised by many speakers on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  I gave a commitment to look further into the issue.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 5 provides that where persons who are employed in a public body have made a protected disclosure prior to this Bill coming into force, they shall be entitled to request feedback from their employer as to what action was taken on foot of their report.  This implements recommendation No. 27 of the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report.  Following discussions with the Attorney General, we have concluded that it will be possible to provide for retrospective application of the Bill for workers who have reported prior to this legislation's enactment but have suffered retaliation after enactment.  As I said, this is in line with the recommendation in the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report.  In addition, I have asked the Attorney General to see whether we can go further in this regard, particularly to consider whether retrospection might be possible for workers who have both reported and suffered penalisation before this Bill is enacted but have not yet applied to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, or the courts for protection.  This is a particularly difficult legal question and the Attorney General has asked for more time to consider its implications.<\/p><p>Accordingly, I have decided to defer proposals for amendments in this regard to Report Stage in order that we have the opportunity to examine and discuss the full suite of possible enhancements that can be made to the legislation.  As I said, I am committed to providing for retrospection for workers who have reported before enactment but suffered penalisation after enactment, which is what the committee sought in its pre-legislative scrutiny recommendations.  In addition, I am anxious to go further than that.  The delay in bringing forward amendments, which we will do on Report Stage, is to see whether we can, in fact, go further than the committee has recommended.  I have no doubt we will discuss this issue further on Report Stage.  I want to ensure we can stretch the boundaries of what is possible in regard to the retrospective application of this Bill to persons who have made disclosures, who may well have suffered detriment and penalisation and who are not satisfied with the outcome of the process in which they may have been involved.  It is a complex area and retrospective application of legislation is always difficult.  I have conveyed my view to the Attorney General that this is a very important issue on which I would like to make progress.  He is going to do all he can to see whether that is possible and, for that purpose, he has asked for time.  I expect to bring forward additional amendments on the retrospective application issue on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#D00300","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":641,"content":"<p>Taking on board the views of all the people who have contacted us, we all can be in agreement that it is extremely important that the legislation be retrospective.<\/p><p>We know from the discussions we have had here and, as I mentioned, the harrowing stories people have, how important it is for this to be retrospective and how much people have lost as a result of doing work in the interest of the public good.

There is a significant issue here.  I do not know how the Minister will get around it legally but effort has to be made by all concerned to recognise the problem we now have.  There are cases currently going through a settlement process in which a certain amount of bullying and intimidation is being applied to get an outcome.  The protected disclosure element is not being recognised by Departments.  These are Departments that are supposed to be leading in terms of legislation and the application of law.  That is quite frightening because it is the State allowing this to happen and paying the legal fees to allow it to happen.  That is wrong.  It is an abuse of power and taxpayers' money.<\/p> <p>  There are cases that have been before various Departments for years.  I refer to the episode of \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" to be broadcast tonight.  Some cases have been with that Department for a considerable time but have not been resolved.  They are all being dealt with internally.  That is wrong.  I will be looking to the next step the Minister will take to determine how all those cases will be dealt with.  They have been stalled not by the whistleblowers but by the State itself using taxpayers' money to achieve the outcome it wants and to block in a very considerable way the whistleblowers and the advancing of the cases being made by those whistleblowers.  That is frightening.<\/p> <p>  The Minister heads up the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.   The committee previously asked how many cases have been settled and for how much by the various Departments that ended up on the steps of the courthouse.  We asked how many of those cases had a confidentiality clause forced on the whistleblower in the context of a settlement.  That is a significant piece of information that I would like to see as we go to the next Stage of analysing this legislation.  I would also like to know how many Ministers, not just in the current Government but also in previous Governments, received protected disclosures but sat on them.  How many Departments have not processed within the legal framework a protected disclosure?  The Committee of Public Accounts recently received correspondence regarding a whistleblower and named the whistleblower.  That is against the law and the legislation.<\/p> <p>  As a State, we seem to be presiding over an abuse of the current legislation and of taxpayers' money.  Departments seem to be sitting on cases and refusing to move on them for reasons not known to anyone.  The best trick in the book is to say to anyone inquiring about a whistleblower and the outcome of the case that it is being referred to the Garda.  There are cases in respect of which that statement was made in defence of the status of the case but the response of the Garda was that no case had been referred to it.  I do not think that is good enough.  The Minister and the Government have to take note of what is happening here.  We have to get to the bottom of the issues that all present have raised in the Chamber, at committee meetings and so on.  While this legislation may provide for the future, the manner in which the Minister addresses the retrospective nature of this is what we will be judged on because those people who made protected disclosures have been beaten up by the State and their lives have been ruined.  They have been named here.  They have come before the committee.  There have been cases where the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, has made a recommendation but the Department continues to try to defend itself with taxpayers' money.  How sick is that?  How wrong is it?  When it comes to this particular debate, I certainly will contribute more fully.  We have named names here.  I will not do so again today.  I ask the Minister to check with the various Departments on the questions I have raised and provide some sort of answers as we debate this on next Stage of the Bill.  <\/p> <p>  As regards the cases that remain to be dealt with, I am not saying all of them will be successful but I am saying to give them a chance.  These people are not making things up.  It may not be a sound piece of evidence that is being received but most of the whistleblowers I have encountered have come forward in good faith to try to improve the lot of the agency, Department or whatever it might be and they have been treated disgracefully by the State.  I really hope we have a fuller debate on this matter, with answers to those questions as we reach that point.  Do I take it the amendment is not being pursued now?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#E00300","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":645,"content":"<p>This amendment is being pursued but it is not the totality of what we are going to do.  I will revert to it on Report Stage and add to it.<\/p> <p>  The amendment before us is a retrospective provision.  It is a start but it does not capture all the retrospective issues and the examples the Chairman and colleagues have raised.  I know that for many people, this is the kernel of the Bill.  It is about the ability to apply the additional protections retrospectively to people who have already suffered detriment.  These are whistleblowers who have done the State immeasurable service.  I am anxious to go as far as we possibly can within the legal limits to accommodate that.<\/p><p>That is the political commitment I am giving.  The Chairman asked that every effort be made.  I assure him that every effort is being made and will be made until this Bill has completed its journey to make it as robust as we can.<\/p><p> The amendment we are discussing provides that where a person who is employed in a public body has made a protected disclosure prior to this Bill coming into force, they shall be entitled to request feedback from their employer as to what action has been taken on foot of their report.  That was the specific recommendation in the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report.   We will be able to go further.  We have agreed with the Attorney General that it will be possible to provide for retrospective application of the Bill for workers who have reported prior to the enactment of the legislation but have suffered retaliation after enactment.  This is in line with the committee's recommendation in the report.  We hope to go further than that.<\/p><p> I have asked the Attorney General to look at retrospection for workers who have both reported a protected disclosure before the Bill is enacted and suffered penalisation, but have not yet applied to the WRC or the courts for protection.  I think many people find themselves in that category.  If they have applied and are in a process with the WRC or have a case before the courts, the Bill will not step in the way of that because they are advanced in the process.  This lines up with the example the Chairman gave a while ago.  If any new penalisation takes place, even if it relates to an old case, somebody is entitled to make a new protected disclosure.  The content of what they are disclosing should be different and new so that it is not the same as the one made under the old legislation.  If any new penalisation is taking place, for example in the resolution of their case, that could constitute a basis for a new protected disclosure that would come fully within the ambit of the new legislation once enacted.<\/p><p> We are teasing out all those issues with the Attorney General at the moment.  The amendment is a starting point and it establishes that there would be retrospection in certain instances.  We are looking to stretch that as far as we can in line with the issues that the Chairman and Deputies Farrell and Buckley, in particular, have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#E00400","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1647993600,"counter":647,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1647993600,"counter":648,"content":"<p>Section 8, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1647993600,"counter":649,"content":"<p>SECTION 9<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":650,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 6, 7, 16 and 17 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#F00500","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":651,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 6:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 15, to delete line 7.  <\/blockquote> <p>These are technical amendments to delete the titles of sections 6A and 7A.

Again, my experience, even in the previous D&aacute;il, was one where people who came to me with protected disclosures did so as a last case scenario.  It was very difficult to get a reply from a Minister with responsibility in whatever was the relevant field concerning the protected disclosure.  I remember raising such an issue on the floor of the previous D&aacute;il and being told that it was a protected disclosure and what could the Minister do about it.  Those were the words of a former Taoiseach in the House.  I refer to my experience of the way whistleblowers are treated as well.  The biggest worry here, and Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell is right about this, is that the process is strung out for so long.  The financial pain is bad enough, but the mental torture and what happens to these whistleblowers is nothing short of degrading.  I suppose that is the word I will use, and that is being very polite.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned in the last section about going as far as is possible and getting additional protections.  This Bill, as we said from the outset, should be the strongest and the best that can be produced for the people doing this for the public right.  I raised a scenario with the Minister before regarding a situation where a whistleblower or whistleblowers come forward, a protected disclosure is made and the procedure is followed all the way to the top.  Apparently, regarding the issues raised, and here is the crux of this matter, there is no procedure, as it stands, to guarantee that the whistleblower or whistleblowers are being protected while the investigation is ongoing.  There is also no mechanism to truly find out if the issues reported have been resolved.  There is no corridor of inquiry there in that regard.  More important, sometimes misinformation is received back to say that the issues raised have been resolved, when additional protected disclosures state that the original complaint still stands and that the response given was misinformation.  <\/p> <p>  It is important to recognise that anything that weakens this legislation will be dangerous.  It is our responsibility to keep the Bill as strong as we can and to protect these people.  I say that because I would guess that most of us in the House have protected disclosures on our desks as it is.  They are not going to go away.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#G00200","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":696,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter.  The issue we are trying to address here is that the system currently does not work as intended.  We are trying to address that situation.  We are not preventing people from reporting concerns to a Minister.  In line with accepted best practice and in the spirit of the directive, we are merely requiring that a report should be made either to the person's employer or to a prescribed person first.  There are exceptions for emergencies or if the head of the public body concerned is directly complicit in the alleged wrongdoing.<\/p> <p>  For example, if an official in my Department at a level below that of Secretary General had concerns about the Secretary General, that person could come to me under the Bill as proposed.  That is absolutely fit and proper.  Otherwise, such concerns should come up through the line.  I think it is fair to say that the operation of the ministerial channel has been one of the most challenging areas of the implementation of the Act currently.  The intent behind the provision of a ministerial channel under the Act was to ensure that in the event of a public body failing to deal properly with an internal report, a worker in that public body would have the fallback option of reporting to the Minister.  In practice, there has been a tendency for reporting persons to either go to the Minister first or report simultaneously to their employer and the Minister.  <\/p> <p>  This practice of simultaneous or near-simultaneous reporting through different channels was raised as a concern by the Disclosures Tribunal, which recommended that the Oireachtas consider amending the legislation, so that when a report is made, the initial recipient is afforded a reasonable amount of time to act before the reporting person moves on to an alternative channel.  Additionally, Article 7 of the directive requires member states to encourage reporting internally in the first instance.  The introduction of a requirement that the reporting person should report using one of the other channels first is intended to address this issue, which is provided for within the directive.  We believe that allowing the Minister to refer disclosures to an independent expert - who will, as the members are aware, be the protected disclosures commissioner we are proposing to establish under the auspices of this Bill &ndash; with the requisite powers to take appropriate action as required, will deal with many of these issues and lead to protected disclosures being addressed in a more professional manner and to better outcomes, particularly for whistleblowers who report, and should appropriately be reporting, to the Minister.  <\/p> <p>  It may well be the case that the protected disclosures commissioner, having considered a protected disclosure that has been referred to him or her, will send that complaint to the Minister.  That is one possible outcome.  What we do not want to happen is a situation where there is a lack of clarity as to who exactly is responsible for dealing with a protected disclosure.  Often, a disclosure can go to multiple parties, including the Minister.  Therefore, a clear process must be in place regarding what happens when a protected disclosure comes in and who deals with it.  Equally, if such a disclosure does come into the Minister, it should be clear how the Minister should deal with it.  That is what we are seeking to address in the provisions of this Bill.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#G00300","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":697,"content":"<p>To touch on that aspect again, I understand what the Minister is saying.  My fear here, though, is that the Minister is saying this is a procedural thing and that certain channels should be set out for reporting these types of disclosures.  There seems, however, to be a gap in respect of when the procedural process is followed all the way to the top and the issues have not been addressed.  My problem is that if it is a governmental body or one paid for by public moneys that is responsible for seeing whether issues in protected disclosures have actually been dealt with, and the organisations concerned may not be fully truthful, what body or person then investigates?  Is that the type of situation where the procedure would be for a person to go to the relevant Minister to report the situation if he or she is not happy with the outcome?  Does the Minister understand where I am coming from?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#G00400","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":698,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#G00500","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":699,"content":"<p>That is one of my concerns, because it is not happening now.  It seems that issues in protected disclosures are still not being resolved, whether people go to a Minister or the Minister refers such disclosures to a body such as the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, for example.  The response comes back down the line to inform me, as a witness for the whistleblower, that the issues have been resolved.  Yet I know from the whistleblower that those issues have not been resolved.  Where does the avenue of procedural correction lie in that case?  That is where my concerns lie.  How do we strengthen and not weaken that aspect?  These powers are needed because sometimes it is the internal bodies that should be investigated as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#G00600","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":700,"content":"<p>To add to that, all of us in the House hear about cases that we come across or from individuals that we discuss issues with.  That could be to do with any area, such as banking or anything else.  We hear from whistleblowers, such as in respect of the tracker mortgage issue, for example.  We learn so much about how such things happened, why they happened and so on.  This is a great forum to articulate cases and remedies in the context of such cases to see if we can get that into law.  That is what I am trying to do here.<\/p> <p>  To go back to the last question posed and to link it to this one, let us take the example of what happens in a situation where a whistleblower has made the disclosure to the appropriate person and is then encouraged by the person to formalise the disclosure.  As the process proceeds over the years and is not dealt with, the matter then enters the legal realm.  That is what happens.  The agency concerned, and that could be the Department of Education, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, or whatever body, then circles the wagons and God help the poor unfortunate concerned when that happens.  The battle starts then and the degrading of the individual, which Deputy Buckley referred to, and the questioning of the integrity of that individual.<\/p><p>Then ill-health comes into it and all sorts of things happen.  In the course of this, the person decides he or she has not had any remedy, satisfaction or feedback as to whether the agency or entity being complained about has investigated the issues the person raised and that he or she is just simply being stonewalled.  This has happened.<\/p><p> Then, in later years, the person makes a submission, and Deputy Buckley gave an example, to the Minister.  The public sees the Minister as being the powerful individual over the entity concerned.  A person makes a report and protected disclosure to a Minister but nothing happens.  It then goes from the Minister back to the governing entity and then back to the entity the whistleblower is involved in or working for.  The outcome is a broken person who is not compensated fully and who has been bullied through the system to try to get a resolution and get it off the table.  There is no account as to whether the issues that were raised were dealt with.  To this day there are whistleblowers in this category.  They are waiting for it to be resolved.<\/p><p> The EU directive states that beyond an explicit prohibition of retaliation provided in law, it is crucial that reporting persons who suffer retaliation have access to legal remedies and compensation.  Unless they are willing to pay a fortune and run against the State they do not have access to legal remedies.  This is part of the problem.  The compensation is always something that will be disputed by the entity about which the complaint has been made.  These are existing cases I am speaking about.  The directive states the appropriate remedy in each case should be determined by the type of retaliation suffered and that the damage caused in such cases should be compensated in full according to the national law.  It states the appropriate remedy could take the form of action for reinstatement in the event of dismissal, transfer or demotion or of withholding of training or promotion.  If a protected disclosure causes a person on a combined salary of &euro;150,000 to &euro;200,000 a year to be out sick that person loses all of this salary.<\/p><p> At the end of years and years of battling with the State agency or Department, the remedy does not in any way equate to the problems created for the person who made the protected disclosure in the first place.  Neither does it address the issues.  Nobody will tell the whistleblowers they were right or wrong or whatever.  It is just a battle against the legal team.  Only one case, which is from the private sector, ever ended up in court with regard to the legislation on protected disclosures because it costs too much to do it.  As we discuss the Bill we are risking throwing all of those individuals in the system under the bus because the system refuses to deal with it.  Somebody has to call a halt to this and insist that every Minister who ever took a protected disclosure from anyone should deal with it.  I do not want to open the coffers of the State to all of these people but they should be judged and there should be an outcome.  The EU directive mentions restoration of cancelled permit, licence or contract and compensation for actual and future losses, past wages and future loss of income, costs linked to a change of occupation, compensation for other economic damage such as legal expenses and costs of medical treatment and for intangible damage such as pain and suffering.  None of this is happening.  It is shocking.<\/p><p> As legislators we watch how legislation is created and passed in the D&aacute;il and the arguments we all have on either side of the debate.  Then we see it being abused.  It is just wrong.  There are cases like this and I am asking the Minister to look at them and inform himself on how people are being blackguarded and do something about it.  I have read from the EU directive and I can tell the Minister I do not know many agencies in the State that are abiding by that law.  This is why we will have an argument down the line about this.  I do not think any legislation, and this legislation in particular, should be passed without addressing what we have already in the system and without addressing the abuse being heaped on these people on a daily basis.  This abuse has nothing to do with the protected disclosure, by the way.  It is an abuse of power by the legal teams in the State on either side.  We have to ask ourselves why no case has been taken to the courts.  What is going on?  I can tell the Minister there are broken people watching us debating this and they are looking for an outcome.  Some of the outcomes being suggested to them are farcical and wrong and we have to address them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#G00700","speaker":"1496","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":702,"content":"<p>What the Chair has said is not without foundation.  We have all dealt with situations similar in nature to those that have been described.  There are two sides to it.  A <i>prima facie <\/i>case should be established so that people cannot unilaterally decide to blacken somebody's name or reputation.  We need to be careful about this.  However, there are situations that come to our attention as elected Members of the Houses and our only response is to raise it in the House and we should do so.  It is the only place we get the privilege to do so.  On the other hand there are cases where there is already in existence a body that is appropriate to deal with the situation.<\/p><p>I can think of a particular case where the House would not deal with something because it was more appropriate for another body to deal with it.  It cost the State an awful lot more because the case went to court and the individual won.  The cost was immeasurably greater than it would have been if the issue had been answered in the first instance.  There will be others I have no doubt about it.  I remember being involved in arguments with the people concerned and saying they should settle it quickly, acknowledge it and deal with it and do whatever had to be done.  This was not done.  I got lectures about the law and all sorts about what consequences were.  That was all nonsense.  In the long and the short of it, when the court made its decision and rightly so, the cost to the State was much greater than was anticipated at the beginning.  Somebody was doing something wrong.<\/p><p>There are such situations that come up from time to time.  The only way Members of the Oireachtas can deal with them is to table a parliamentary question.

I fully understand and appreciate that many people are watching this debate.  They are looking at it through the lens of their own experiences which, in many instances, have not been good and they want to see a way forward provided through this legislation.  They expect the committee and the Oireachtas to bring about improvements.  That is exactly what we seek to do.<\/p> <p>  One of the main changes that will be introduced as a result of the enactment of this Bill is feedback and an outcome.  Under the existing Act, one makes a disclosure and does not have a legal right to an outcome.  One does not have a legal right to know how exactly it has been dealt with or to get any feedback.  That will be quite explicit in this Bill, which is a very important reform and a major step forward.<\/p> <p>  On the question of the ministerial channel and the related issues we have been teasing out, it cannot be considered in isolation from the role of the protected disclosures commissioner.  Let us call it the protected disclosures commissioner's office.  That office will be there to assist whistleblowers.  Whistleblowers will be able to contact the office to seek advice as to who is the appropriate prescribed person to refer a protected disclosure to.<\/p> <p>  It can be very difficult.  There are currently approximately 100 prescribed persons under the legislation.  If somebody at work sees something that he or she believes is very wrong and does not know where to turn, once this Bill is enacted, there will be a protected disclosures commissioner's office the person can contact.  The office will advise and guide the person as to who is the most appropriate prescribed person for that disclosure to be referred to.  That point is important and worth making.<\/p> <p>  In situations, which will be rare given there is a very large number of prescribed persons, in which the office cannot identify who the appropriate person is, it can deal with the protected disclosure, follow through and come to an ultimate determination in respect of it.  That is a very important change which will be made by this Bill once it is enacted, it is hoped, in the weeks and months ahead.<\/p> <p>  What we seek to do in respect of the ministerial channel is to make sure there is a proper process.  In reality, what will happen when a Minister receives a protected disclosure under the new regime, once the Bill is enacted, is it will be referred to the protected disclosures commissioner to assess who is the most appropriate prescribed person to deal with that disclosure.  It could well be the case that the most appropriate person is the Minister, in which case it will be referred back to him or her.  The Minister will then inherit all of the obligations under the new Act to consider, provide feedback and, ultimately, to come to a view as to the outcome of that protected disclosure.  Those points are important for context.<\/p> <p>  This is not in any way an effort to diminish the rights of people.  It actually strengthens them for all of those reasons.  They will now have a right to an outcome and feedback.  They have a right to have their case dealt with by somebody, be it a prescribed or suitable person designated by the commissioner or indeed the commissioner.  That represents significant progress for whistleblowers who, at present, operate in an environment which is not what it should be.<\/p> <p>  The Act was of its time.  It was groundbreaking for its time but it has been in operation for seven or eight years and we have seen its shortcomings.  We are using the opportunity of the transposition of this directive to try to improve it.  We are improving it, including in the treatment of the ministerial channel that is proposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#J00200","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"vote","time":1647993600,"counter":706,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 3; N\u00edl, 6.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p><\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#J00300","aye":["1522","1462","1579"],"nay":["1584","1626","1459","1496","1521","1473"],"abs":[]},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":707,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 23 to 27, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.

This reflects a number of concerns raised with the Department since the Bill was published that this provision was too restrictive and could impede effective investigation of wrongdoing.  The key purpose behind this amendment is to ensure that the legislation does not in any way stand in the way of a prescribed person or the commissioner from taking such actions as they see fit to address the wrongdoing reported.  There have been issues with the duty to protect the identity of the reporting person.  The amendments that have been made to section 16 of the principal Act and the various provisions setting out conditions under which a report may be transmitted to a more suitable competent authority go a long way to addressing that.<\/p><p>I do not want to repeat the same mistakes as regards confidentiality that in the past led to some employers and prescribed persons being paralysed by the confidentiality provisions in the legislation as regards the actions they could take to address the wrongdoing reported.  This amendment provides the necessary clarification in this regard. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#K06800","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":775,"content":"<p>We support the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#L00200","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1647993600,"counter":776,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1647993600,"counter":777,"content":"<p>Section 17, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1647993600,"counter":778,"content":"<p>SECTION 18<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":779,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 51 and 52 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#L00600","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":780,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 51:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 47, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(7) Any processing of personal data pursuant to this Act, including the exchange or transmission of personal data by prescribed persons, the Commissioner and any suitable persons, shall be carried out in accordance with applicable data protection law.<br \/><br \/>(8) Personal data which are manifestly not relevant for the handling of a specific report shall not be collected or, if accidentally collected, shall be deleted without undue delay.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote> <p>This provides for an amendment to section 16A requiring that, where reports are transmitted by the commissioner or prescribed persons, this be done in a secure manner compliant with data protection law.

Deputy Buckley and I strongly believe that everything that can be done to protect future whistleblowers, and, as has been discussed here today, those who have previously come forward, must be done and that they must be given all possible protection.  There is something very strange in people being penalised and given a difficult time for doing something that is in the public interest rather than in their own interest.

It made a difference and we put forward amendments to reflect key recommendations made by the committee.  It was a job well done and it strengthened and improved the Bill.<\/p> <p>  I echo the sentiment of the Chairman and other colleagues about the debt of gratitude we owe as a society to whistleblowers.  Words are easy but they want tangible action from Government and the system to support and vindicate them.  That is not to say every whistleblower is correct in respect of every allegation made.  Nobody is saying that, but where disclosures are made, there needs to be a clear and transparent process, an outcome and reasons for that outcome.  Instances of penalisation where people are punished for making a disclosure need to be dealt with strongly.  I am keen that we make progress in that space.<\/p> <p>  I will table amendments on Report Stage to give further retrospective application to the Bill.  There are a number of other areas where I am considering bringing amendments on Report Stage.  One area raised in the pre-legislative scrutiny report concerned the time limits for making complaints to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.

It may be more proper for the Minister for Health to bring such proposals, depending on which legislation needs to be changed.  We will consider that in the next week or two.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of areas of sectoral legislation where amendments on Report Stage may be required to clarify the relationship with this Bill.

The hospital doctor retention and motivation project, HDRM, is a research project that is funded by the Health Research Board, HRB, and is based at the RCSI graduate school of healthcare management.  The HDRM team comprises Dr. John-Paul Byrne, Dr. Jennifer Creese and me.  We are all present this morning.  We have submitted a briefing statement, which contains additional detail on each component of the HDRM project.<\/p> <p>  For the past four years, the HDRM team has researched doctor retention and the working lives of hospital doctors in Ireland.  We have interviewed emigrant Irish-trained hospital doctors in Australia and have surveyed and interviewed hospital doctors in Ireland about their working conditions.  Over the past two years, we have undertaken research on how the pandemic altered the working conditions, well-being and work-life balance of Ireland&rsquo;s hospital doctors.<\/p> <p>  A key aim of the HDRM project is to connect policymakers and hospital doctors.  We want to provide policymakers and medical workforce planners with the organisational intelligence they need to inform improvements to medical workforce policy and practice.  In doing so, we want to help them to see the everyday work, as is done by hospital doctors, rather than the work as is imagined.<\/p> <p>  Policymakers are often surprised at our research findings and are unaware of the many challenges faced by hospital doctors.  One reason for this is that hospital doctors are rarely asked about their working conditions.  Another reason is that hospital doctors, like many health workers, do not always feel safe to speak up about the challenges they face at work.  They have told us that sometimes they do not speak up because they fear it might damage their career or cause further deterioration in their working conditions.  Others do not speak up at work because they feel it would not change anything.<\/p> <p>  Among emigrant doctors in Australia, there was a sense that exit via emigration was a less risky option than speaking up.  It is difficult to see how change will happen in a situation where policymakers are unaware of the challenges that are faced by hospital doctors, hospital doctors feel powerless to improve their working conditions or the system and emigration remains a viable option for those hospital doctors who are seeking to improve their working conditions.<\/p> <p>  The HDRM project has sought to bridge the gap between policy and the front line by inviting hospital doctors of all grades to speak to us in confidence about their experiences of working in the Irish health system and for us to then share these anonymised insights with policymakers.  We are delighted to have the opportunity to present our findings to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health.  <\/p> <p>  Since 2018, we have surveyed and interviewed almost 1,200 hospital doctors about their experiences of working in the Irish health system.  We have interviewed 51 Irish-trained doctors in Australia about their decision to emigrate.  We have surveyed 1,070 hospital doctors in Ireland about their working conditions.  We have interviewed 48 hospital doctors about working through the first wave of the pandemic.  Most recently, from July to December 2021, we conducted a remote ethnography with 28 hospital doctors.  This involved interviewing each doctor twice and engaging them in a WhatsApp conversation about their working conditions over a 12-week period.  This is what we learned about their experiences of working in the Irish health system in 2021.<\/p> <p>  We found that the hospital doctors we spoke to are really struggling.  Both non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, and consultants are finding it hard to manage long working hours and a work-life balance that is heavily skewed in favour of work.  The pandemic appears to have intensified already difficult working conditions.  Respondents spoke to us about the challenge of working in a health system that feels understaffed and under-resourced.  Although they occasionally worked on adequately staffed teams, this was a rare occurrence.<\/p><p>Having too few staff to meet the demand for care impeded their well-being, but also restricted their ability to plan and improve services.  Doctor 6 said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re in a constant state of crisis now which makes it very hard to take a breath or plan for the future.&rdquo;  Doctor 11 said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all burned out ... I have gone from someone who was happily jumping out of bed to work to dreading it.&rdquo;  The hospital doctors we spoke to felt they could provide better patient care if they were better supported at work, that is, if the health system was better staffed and better resourced.  Doctor 7 said: &ldquo;I find myself apologising to patients on behalf of the system for their poor care.  It&rsquo;s draining.&rdquo;  Doctor 5 said: &ldquo;What keeps me up at night is ... people not having access to timely care.&rdquo;  Respondents found it difficult to see their patients struggle to access the care that they needed.<br\/><br\/>Doctors also spoke to us about challenging relationships at work, particularly with hospital administration, HR and hospital management.  For NCHDs, this related to their vulnerability as temporary employees who regularly move hospitals.  NCHDs spoke about being underpaid for their work, either in being placed on an incorrect pay scale or in being underpaid for the overtime they have worked.  As temporary employees, NCHDs found it difficult to resolve these issues, as this respondent explained:<\/p><blockquote>\tNCHDs ... are never around long enough to implement change.  Only there for 1 to 2 years max and moved to new hospital.  Just very easy for management not to listen. <\/blockquote><p>For consultants, there was a feeling that interacting with hospital management was a frustrating experience and was of limited value in bringing about change.  This dissuaded them from initiating change in their hospitals, as these doctors explain.  Respondent 1 said:<\/p><blockquote>\tI've said all that before.  No one would listen.  Nothing changes.  So that leads to disengagement ... just say nothing because, you know, saying stuff gets you nowhere ... and it just makes you feel bad.  You don't change anything but you just get all het up about it and that's really exhausting. <\/blockquote><p>Respondent 16 said: <\/p><blockquote>\tHaving spent my first [number of] years as a consultant as someone who innovates\/sets up services\/improves\/pushes\/advocates.  I am now resigned to simply doing the job and keeping away from management as much as I can.  It&rsquo;s too damaging having any interaction with them. <\/blockquote><p>Both NCHDs and consultants felt under-valued by the HSE and held out very little hope for health system improvement.  While they were deeply unhappy with many aspects of the health system, they also appeared resigned to it.  Although they recognised that they could provide better care if better resourced to do so, they had accepted that this was unlikely to happen.  Instead, they resolved to do their best for the patient in front of them.  As doctor 4 explained: &ldquo;Being facilitated to do the job well and efficiently is the type of recognition I would like.&rdquo;<br\/><br\/>Respondent hospital doctors appeared to waste considerable time and energy struggling with difficult working conditions, inefficient systems and challenging workplace relationships.  Gaining access to appropriate care for their patients or initiating even minor improvements at hospital level involved engaging in &lsquo;&lsquo;hand-to-hand&rdquo; combat with the system.  Should it really be this difficult?<br\/><br\/>Overall, HDRM research findings across four years of research reveal a medical workforce that is struggling rather than thriving.  They describe a health system in which both hospital doctors and their patients are upset and frustrated, disappointed that the system is failing them both.  If the health system is to recover from the pandemic, reduce hospital waiting lists, ensure timely access to healthcare and deliver on Sl&aacute;intecare reforms, it will need to strengthen its medical workforce.  Recruitment, retention and return emigration are all critical to medical workforce strengthening and they will all require substantial improvements to the working conditions of Ireland&rsquo;s hospital doctors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022032300002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niamh Humphries","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":841,"content":"<p>We move to questions.

I think we can improve doctor retention.  If the Deputy looks at the briefing document that we sent through, in the last two pages we outline six steps to improve doctor retention.  The most important thing, before we begin any of those steps, is to acknowledge the need to improve doctor retention.  We have high emigration, a high rate of consultant vacancy and a high reliance on non-EU doctors to staff the health system.  It is really important that we recognise how much of a problem this is and how urgent it is to address doctor retention.  If we want to improve doctor retention, we need to improve the working conditions of hospital doctors, improve staffing levels, reduce working hours and improve the work-life balance.  Unless we do that, I am not sure that anything else will work.  We need to encourage the retention and return of Irish-trained doctors, improve the retention of non-EU doctors and provide better flexibility in contracts and working hours for doctors.  We need to set out a vision for health workforce improvement as well as establishing a health workforce research centre.  This is a huge issue for the health system and it needs to be acknowledged and addressed.<\/p> <p>  On the plus side, it is incredible what we have achieved in four years with some Health Research Board funding.

They were on what we call a &ldquo;one in two&rdquo; call.  They worked every day from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. and they were on call every second night and every second weekend.  There has been a move away from that and there has been some change.  The number of junior doctors has increased substantially.  The overall workforce in the HSE has gone from 103,000 staff to 131,000, with an increase of approximately 27% in both the number of consultants and the number of junior doctors.<\/p> <p>  The problem I find in the feedback I get from junior doctors and consultants is the resistance to change.  The best example I can give is of someone who worked in the UK.  A new problem arrived at their door in regard to the type of patients they were dealing with, and they were able to get funding within six months to set up a particular clinic to deal with this new problem.  When they come back to Ireland, something hit them about a particular core group of patients.  They suggested that a special clinic be set up to deal with that but it took ten years for that to happen.  That summarises the position.  There seems to be huge resistance to change.  When junior doctors or consultants come up with proposals, there is resistance.  How can that issue be dealt with?  It has been in the health system for the past 25, 30 or 40 years and it has not changed in any way.<\/p> <p>  There is another issue.  In one of the major hospitals in Ireland, something like 14 highly specialised consultants have walked away and have gone totally into the private sector because they just could not cope with the fact they could not get their job done and they could not access beds and theatres.  Even as recently as last night, I was talking to someone who was trying to get their first access to theatre in five weeks and was told yesterday morning they would have to cancel their theatre list.  That is the kind of frustration that has resulted.  In the end, that consultant fought their corner and was able to go ahead with the operations.  It is that kind of resistance.  How can that kind of issue be dealt with?  How can the way administrators seem to be managing the care that doctors want to provide be changed, given there seems to be a resistance to that kind of change?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022032300002#B00500","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":845,"content":"<p>I think there is an appetite for change among the doctors we deal with.

Many of the doctors we have spoken to say there is not enough information going from the front line to hospital management and the HSE regarding what change and resources are required.  We have spoken to doctors, especially during Covid, when people have been dropping out through isolation or contracting Covid themselves.  It can take a long time to get the staff that are required and it can take months to resource a team, but it is that kind of speed of response that is required.

Could we go back to a situation whereby instead of being given a 12-month contract or a six-month contract, a doctor is given a three-year contract, for example, and is able to rotate between hospitals?  I know that is part of the training scheme, but if a doctor is not on the training scheme, he or she cannot get such a contract.

One of those findings is that one of the reasons doctors give for not speaking out about the challenges they face at work is because they fear it might damage their careers and there being a sense that repercussions might follow if they speak out in this regard.  Is that anecdotal?  Is it a rational fear, in the sense of there being examples in the research of circumstances where doctors did speak out and damaged their careers as a result?  We know about whistleblowers in some areas, and this topic came to the fore recently and we discussed it at this committee.  Regarding what is happening in healthcare generally, however, if one of the key findings emerging from the witnesses' research is that doctors are fearful of talking about the challenges they face because they fear the impact that doing so might have on their job or further career opportunities, are there examples of where something like that did happen?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022032300002#C01800","speaker":"1615","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":865,"content":"<p>I will hand over to my colleague, Dr. Jennifer Creese, shortly because she led on the paper about voice.

Obviously, that is the case and I have spoken to many doctors who fear doing that might damage their career.  Is that because they have seen it happen to themselves or to other people?  During the research, was it clearly established that there were explicit examples of this type of impact occurring to show that this fear is a rational one and that this accounts for why doctors do not speak up, or is it the case that doctors just have a fear that it may or might happen?  There is a distinction between those two scenarios.

When we surveyed hospital doctors, a quarter of them said they would not speak up if they had issues at work.  Probably about half of those respondents spoke about fear.  The kinds of things they said they were worried about included, and particularly for junior doctors, repercussions emanating from the consultants who were going to be giving them references, grading and pushing them through their higher specialist training, HST, and then progressing them through their careers.  Much of this aspect, then, probably has to do with the culture of medicine as a profession, and the specific culture of medicine in Ireland, in what is a relatively small community.  In some respects, therefore, it does not really matter for these doctors whether they do have anecdotal evidence or a direct example of someone having spoken out and having been punished for doing so.  It is more so that a kind of fear is built in throughout the culture about what would happen because that is the way the hierarchy works.<\/p> <p>  There are always stories about someone having heard something said about someone else's experience, but those stories perpetuate themselves and are very much bred into the culture.

Part of the medical culture is that doctors tend not to be sick and try to be in as much as possible.  This is part of medical culture throughout the world.  We have spoken to many doctors who feel guilt at having to be out sick.

Of those I interviewed, only 16 planned to return, and they planned to return for personal rather than professional reasons.  It is important for us to be a little fearful of our widespread doctor emigration figures.  Some 391 doctors last year leaving for Australia is a large number of doctors relative to the number we train.  Not all of them plan to stay in Australia forever.  Many of those I interviewed in Australia had not planned to stay there.  They had emigrated with the intention of returning, but while they were in Australia opportunities came up, they enjoyed work and they enjoyed the work-life balance on offer there, so they decided to stay.  We cannot just assume that those who leave will definitely return.  We need to start taking emigration more seriously, especially post Covid, when there is going to be increasing competition for doctors from all the countries the Deputy listed.<\/p><p>Doctors who were trained in Ireland and who speak English are going to be in demand worldwide post-Covid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022032300002#G01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niamh Humphries","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":927,"content":"<p>We do not have any figures for the US, Canada or London at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022032300002#H00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":928,"content":"<p>No, but I really-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022032300002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niamh Humphries"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":929,"content":"<p>Dr. Humphries is back.

I know that we are accused of having one of the most expensive health services in the OECD.  People on either side of the argument will talk about that.  However, if, having educated and preparing doctors, we are losing them to the extent we are, it will be virtually impossible to provide a health service at home.  There is a danger that the health service at home in Ireland will degenerate.  This problem is multiplying annually.  The service will degenerate to a great extent, making it impossible to have a level playing field insofar as working conditions are concerned.  I wanted to make that point.  Do any of the witnesses wish to comment on that or do they have any particular views as to how to challenge that issue?  It must be challenged one way or the other.

One of the issues we need to talk about is that, when doctors emigrate, we often hear that they will probably come back in a year but we are not sure whether they do.  However, in going abroad, they are often going to systems that have better work-life balance and better conditions where they can spend their time being a doctor and getting satisfaction from that.  Medicine is a competitive sector.  The labour market is competitive.  All of these countries are looking for highly specialised doctors in different specialties.  Doctors experiencing these better systems, better experiences and better work-life balance is a risk to our health system because they will obviously make comparisons.  We have written about this.  They compare the working conditions and work-life balance in Australia and Ireland and, for the majority, Australia comes out on top.  Australia obviously has its own issues but, with regard to doctors' own working life, participants had a better experience over there.

We need to look at ways and means of identifying how to break the cycle because, if we do not find out what can be done in that regard in the short term, the problem will only get worse.

This is an extreme example but in one case a number of doctors left a team due to Covid or having to isolate and one doctor was left doing a one in three call rota for two weeks, which means a 24-hour call every third day.  Those hours are incredible.  When it comes to the hours, it is not just a matter of the length of the work day but, as has been discussed, the intensity of work when the doctors are in there.

It is important to use agency staff as sparingly as possible, which involves workforce planning and making sure that there are as few gaps in the workforce as possible.<\/p> <p>  To come back to another thing the Deputy said, which related to the high rate of doctor emigration, the only reason the Irish health system has not collapsed as a result of this high level of doctor emigration is that those doctors have been replaced with non-EU doctors, who comprise 42% of our medical workforce and keep the show on the road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022032300002#H01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niamh Humphries"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":937,"content":"<p>I understand.

I was actually just writing a note to say that I will have to depart.  A group from the Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland is coming in at 11 a.m. and I am hosting them.  I am really thrilled to have an opportunity to speak.  I will only use five minutes of my time.  I thank the witnesses.  I am really concerned about some aspects of their presentation.  I am very taken aback and surprised.  I will just focus on one aspect, that of the HR relationship in hospitals.  The witnesses' evidence certainly took me by surprise with regard to the conditions.  The average layperson would probably think that doctors are highly respected and very influential in the day-to-day running and management of a hospital and in the decisions that are made, although they may just think that about consultants.<\/p><p>What I read and hear is of a powerless group of people who do not seem to be represented or have a representative voice and who are afraid of speaking for upsetting the apple cart, but not just that, of endangering their career prospects.  This is the kind of stuff that we as politicians hear from low-wage and low-income workers who are on zero-hour contracts working in the retail setting.  It is really shocking for me, certainly, and I can only speak personally, to read about this.<\/p><p> I thank the witnesses for this body of evidence they have brought forward.  I think the health world should be very shocked by this.  The doctors are the oil in the engine of the hospital system.  I am also really taken aback and minded by the witnesses saying that it is not all about money.  Often, in the public mind, people think doctors earn so much and want more money.  On the well-being piece and all of that kind of stuff, I am really struck by the idea that non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, and consultants feel undervalued by the HSE.  I was driving in the car listening to all the contributions remotely before I arrived.  What struck me is that an awful lot of stuff in the witnesses' presentation is very fixable.  There are some complicated bits and pieces in terms of contracts and that kind of stuff but what really struck me is how much of this is fixable and quick fixes are available.<\/p><p> I have one question in the very little time I have available.  We interact with hospital management groups all the time.  What can we as politicians do with regard to the management structures in hospitals?  I refer to this idea of having to replace a doctor.  A teacher does not have to find a substitute if he or she calls in sick.  Panels are in place for this kind of situation and the principal, that is, the boss, has to ring around the panel.  The Department of Education facilitates this in its own way.  I think we will be coming back to this topic.  I am sorry for ranting on; this is my question.  Do the witnesses think some of the power structures in some of the hospitals are out of control in terms of the respect in which hospital doctors are held?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022032300002#H01600","speaker":"1572","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":943,"content":"<p>That is a very difficult question to answer.

Many of them come to the end of their higher specialist training and there are no jobs for them in the system.  It seems crazy.  It takes a long time to train as a doctor and do postgraduate medical training.  Then they come to the end and have the option of staying in Ireland as a locum or emigrating.  Needing a break from the working conditions is another reason they go.  That can be very early in their careers.  A year or two into the system they feel they really need a break from it, so they go to Australia <i>en masse<\/i>.

It was very difficult for those in Australia to leave.  There were all those challenges.<\/p> <p>  The most disturbing thing coming from the research was the reluctance to speak out because of the impact on careers and people being seen as troublesome and so on.  The suggestion of the speak up guardian that Dr. Creese talked about is certainly something that needs to be looked at.  However, it does not tie in with my understanding of those doctors and consultants who are in the system that they are people who are frightened and nervous about speaking out.  The representatives were asked whether there was any evidence of impacts on career.  The evidence is slim, if it is there at all, regarding that but it was said there is a culture in the system.  That is something we can raise the powers that be that the committee deals with.<\/p> <p>  The fact that the representatives talked about low self-worth, not being listened to and not being asked about anything makes sense in the context of poor conditions.  I was surprised about the pay conditions.  We have heard from various representatives from different unions, including consultant groups and so on, and they all talk about the two-tier pay structure, which adds to the lack of self-worth.  If a colleague earns more than someone who is doing the same job, that undermines self-worth.  People before the committee a number of weeks ago talked about the impact that had on pensions.  As people get older, they look at this two-tier system.<\/p> <p>  How would the representatives address the difficulties consultants are having with hospital management?  What structure do consultants and doctors want?  Would the guardian structure be enough?  Is something else needed?  It was clearly outlined that people need to be asked how they are getting on and so on, which is something that is lacking in the system.  Is there anything else in the system or structures the witnesses are aware of that they can forward to the committee?  We will try to use whatever knowledge we have of the system to push forward some of the issues raised.<\/p> <p>  We need data on doctors who have been trained, which was mentioned, and a tracking system for where they go and their career progression.  That makes sense.  That is something the committee could recommend.<\/p> <p>  The HR issue seems crazy.  It appears to be something that would be easy to address.  People are being underpaid, they are not paid being overtime, and there is the issue of emergency tax.  If it is known someone is moving to a hospital in Munster, Ulster or wherever it is, those systems should be in place.  There are possibly recommendations the committee can make in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Is there anything else the representatives believe is outstanding in the system?

It seems ridiculous that we do not know where trained doctors are going.  There are major issues for the health service in that but from a taxpayer perspective, and value for money and so on, the State is spending a fortune on training doctors and we do not know how many of them we can retain.  It is ludicrous.  It was stated more than 50% of the annual number of 725 went to Australia and there are then all the other countries.

I do not have figures.  There was a figure that 90% of consultants have international experience.  It stemmed from the situation where Ireland could not provide training in certain fields.  It has continued as a tradition and it is expected now.  The international fellowship is usually 12 to 18 months.  Doctors tend to do that after higher specialist training, HST.  In Australia, I found that people would come for the international fellowship and within that 12- or 18-month period they would be offered a consultancy there.  The international fellowship is what people do after they complete their HST in Ireland and before they get a consultancy.<\/p> <p>  The reason for going abroad for an international fellowship is to wait for vacancies to arise in the Irish health system.  Even though someone may be fully trained as a specialist doctor, there is no vacancy to match that person.  In terms of workforce planning, it is hard to get your head around the fact that we have people who put so much time, energy and effort into training in a particular specialty and there is not necessarily a job for them at the end of it.  They go abroad, wait to see what consultant posts come up in the Irish health system and then apply for them.

That relates to the work&ndash;life balance issue we talked about.  I am aware that work&ndash;life balance was brought up at various meetings of the committee in respect of different healthcare professions.  However, it is not just about the number of hours; it is also about the intensity of the work when at work.  The doctors are working harder and faster than ever before, yet still do not feel they are getting on top of anything.  It goes back to the rota system, whereby doctors cannot predict when their day will end.  It also goes back to the mobility of NCHDs, who have to move to a new place every few months, leaving behind family, friends and support networks.  When we talk about work&ndash;life balance, we often say it is about really long hours.<\/p><p>Yes the hours are long and exhausting, but it is the quantity of the hours and the intensity of the work time.  It is the unpredictability of their work time.  They do not know when they are going to finish so they cannot dedicate any specific time to something outside of work such as hobbies or social life.  On top of that they have the mobility of moving around.  When those things are added together it has huge impacts on their mental, social and physical well-being, on their relationships with families and friends, and also on their career decisions which underlines many of the retention issues.  We have had doctors tell us that sometimes it felt like a choice between pursuing their profession or being a functioning, normal human being.  It is a really stark thing and it is something that cannot be said but it is a huge issue.

Before we proceed with business, I want to attend briefly to a housekeeping matter.  I ask the witnesses to bear with me while I do so.  Can I take it that the draft minutes of our previous public and private meetings, of Wednesday, 23 February and Wednesday, 9 March, respectively, are formally agreed and there are no matters arising?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Today's meeting is to discuss with the chairperson-designate of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, Ms Mary Curtis, her role and priorities.  Standing Orders provide that the committee has the power to require that the chairperson-designate of a body or agency under the aegis of the Department shall, prior to his or her appointment, attend before the committee to discuss his or her strategic priorities for the role.  We are delighted to welcome Ms Curtis, as well as Ms Celene Craig, CEO of the BAI.  They are joining us remotely via Microsoft Teams.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite Ms Curtis to deliver her opening statement, which will be limited to five minutes, followed by questions from members of the committee.  The witnesses are advised that the committee may publish the opening statement on its web page.<\/p> <p>  To limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, we encourage all members, witnesses and visitors to wear a face mask when moving around the campus and when they are in close proximity to each other, to be respectful of others' physical space and to adhere to any other public health advice.<\/p> <p>  Before inviting Ms Curtis to give her opening statement, I want to explain a number of limitations in regard to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Oireachtas in regard to references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, as today's witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, it is important that they bear in mind that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as does a witness who is physically present.  Such witnesses may think it appropriate to take legal action in this regard but I am sure that will not arise out of today's proceedings.<\/p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise to engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.<\/p><p>Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to any identifiable person or entity, they may be directed to discontinue their remarks.<\/p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present in the confines of Leinster House to participate in public meetings.  I cannot permit members to attend where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  I also ask members when contributing via Microsoft Teams to identify themselves when contributing for the benefit of the Debates Office staff preparing the Official Report.  Members should mute their microphones when they are not contributing to reduce background noise and feedback.<\/p><p> With all that housekeeping out of the way, we are down to the important part of the meeting, namely, our engagement with our guests from the BAI.  I invite Ms Curtis to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022032300002#A00200","speaker":"1557","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":1102,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media for the opportunity to meet to discuss my role and key priorities as chairperson designate of the BAI.  I was very pleased to be appointed as chairperson designate by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport, and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, last October.  Having been a member of the board of the BAI since 2017, I welcome the opportunity to continue to work with my fellow board members and the BAI executive in leading the organisation over the coming period.<\/p> <p>  Through my 25 years working in the Irish broadcasting industry, across both the public service and commercial sectors, I have gained understanding and knowledge of the Irish media sector and the challenges that lie therein.  This has been further enhanced by my membership of the authority which, in recent years, has had a particular focus on legislative developments and the evolving media landscape in Ireland and the EU.  These experiences have given me a understanding of the BAI, its strategic objectives and the environment in which it operates.  All of this will assist me in my role.<\/p> <p>  The BAI is the independent regulator for broadcasting in Ireland and was established further to the Broadcasting Act 2009.  The BAI has responsibility for a broad range of activities, including the licensing, regulation and support of independent and public service broadcast media.  Under the broadcasting funding scheme, the BAI also provides funding for programmes and archiving relating to Irish culture, heritage, and experience.<\/p> <p>  My application for the role of chairperson was motivated by a desire to ensure continuity of leadership in guiding the strategic direction of the BAI at a time of huge change for the authority, and in line with the organisation&rsquo;s strategy statement for 2021-2023.  The previous chairperson of the BAI, Dr. Pauric Travers, completed his term of office in December 2020 having provided excellent leadership to the BAI.  With a clear understanding of the BAI&rsquo;s responsibilities in terms of complaints, the Sound and Vision scheme, media literacy, licensing, compliance, the Irish language, diversity and media plurality, broadcast compliance and enforcement, I will apply the knowledge and expertise I have gained through my time on the board and during my career to ensure the BAI continues to function effectively in line with the Broadcasting Act 2009, while also focusing on the transition of the authority into the new media commission, as provided for under the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022.  In a context where the regulation of the media environment is evolving at a rapid pace, my knowledge and experience of the policy and legislative requirements will allow me to embark on the role without the necessity for a bedding-in period.  In addition, my familiarity with my fellow board members and the executive is already well established.<\/p> <p>  While all change management projects have unique features, they also have many in common.  Having led new projects, such as the digital television switchover in RT&Eacute; and the establishment of UTV Ireland, I will bring with me the project management skills and understanding necessary to support the BAI through its transition into the media commission.  As chair, I will also apply high standards of corporate governance in line with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  As the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill progresses through the Oireachtas and we await the report of the Future of Media Commission, the BAI is preparing for significant changes in media regulation and its own organisational structures, along with the opportunities and challenges that this will bring.<\/p> <p>  Steady and strategic stewardship of the BAI is required over the coming months and years.  It is my intention that the board and I will work closely and collaboratively with the newly appointed CEO of the BAI, Ms Craig.  Ms Craig leads an experienced, committed team of professionals dedicated to public service.  I am also grateful to have colleagues on the board who have consistently given generously of their expertise and demonstrated their commitment to the BAI.<\/p> <p>  I especially welcome the Bill&rsquo;s proposal for the functions and staff of the BAI to be transferred to the new media commission.  This approach will ensure the BAI brings its significant knowledge and regulatory expertise gained in regulation to date in contributing to the future work of the commission.  In reporting to the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, I also look forward to close collaboration with her and her officials in the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport, and Media.  I anticipate that this will be a necessity over the coming months.<\/p> <p>  I again thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss my role and key priorities as chairperson and look forward to answering any questions that members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022032300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Curtis"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":1103,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Curtis for her very comprehensive opening statement.

Working remotely in the last few years has enabled far greater outreach with respect to the number of interested parties and stakeholders we have been able to engage with.  We have also worked extensively with colleagues at European level.  The approach articulated by the BAI has been endorsed by the European Commission and other regulators.

It will be very important for the media commission going forward to understand what the algorithms are and what they do, and the impact they have on the activities on the platforms and the way they deliver content to their users.  Among regulators, our own organisation and colleagues, generally we find that there is a very strong understanding of what they are and how they impact users and content users of services.  There is also a very strong understanding of how and in what way algorithms might impact the activities of regulatory agencies in this field.

That has brought us into the area of having to make certain decisions over the years.

It is ironic that the committee with the remit for the media has not yet had sight of the report whereas every newspaper, radio and television organisation in the country seems to have seen it and is able to report on it.

What is Ms Curtis's view of the idea of a media licence?  It is something I am in favour of and on which some of us in Fine Gael did a lot of work on last year.  There should be a media licence applicable to all households rather than the current television licence.  That would increase the funding available.  This funding would not be used for certain television stations but for all TV, radio and the written media, which are under a lot of pressure, particularly after Covid and with the advancement of online media, etc.  What are our guests' views on such a licence that would be available to fund all forms of media?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022032300002#D00500","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":1132,"content":"<p>I assure the Senator that we have not seen the recommendations of the Future of Media Commission.

Our approach was that there needed to be a broader basis for ensuring support for public service broadcasters and, more generally, for public service media content.  That is the thrust of our submission to the Future of Media Commission.  We were very strong in making that point.  The best mechanism is obviously a matter for the Government.  The key point we would make is the real value and need to support public service content, including support for the two public service broadcasters, RT&Eacute; and TG4.  That is the case with all those offering public service content, including many national and local radio stations or the commercial television channel, Virgin Media.  We are also mindful, although they are outside our remit, of what local and national print media bring to the sphere of news, public debate and democratic discourse more generally.  We strongly support the need to look at ways of ensuring future sustainability.  Our work around funding for the two public service broadcasters has very much been guided by that principle and the belief in the value that public service broadcasting and content brings to democratic discourse here.  That is probably needed more than ever, particularly in light of the amount of misinformation and disinformation available to users online.  It is a vital requirement.  Covid particularly highlighted the value of such services and content.

It flows from Article 13.2 of the audiovisual and media services directive.  It is something we have been giving quite a bit of thought to and, indeed, other sectoral interests in this area have also taken an in-depth look at the kind of funding that might be generated and the purposes for which it might be disbursed.  Those are set within the framework of the legislation.<\/p> <p>  There are two ways of looking at this.  Assuming that the Sound and Vision scheme continues as it is, the content levy would potentially sit alongside that and I think we will see that the shape as currently proposed in the legislation is not dissimilar to that.  However, there would be a need to co-ordinate any sources of funding that might be available to support content within the scope of the legislation, and there would be a need to co-ordinate and try to look at that in the round in terms of the objectives of the media commission.  There is certainly potential in the content levy.

There is a question of looking at it all in the round in terms of the kind of content that is produced by either scheme, although, ultimately, it might be something that would merge into a single scheme.  At the moment, we believe it is vital to continue the Sound and Vision scheme while that Article 13.2 scheme is being developed.  We have done some preliminary thinking on this ourselves and we have also been trying to lay the foundation for this.  There is quite a lot of information that needs to flow from the sectoral players but also in other European jurisdictions.  We are trying to smooth the process through a memorandum of understanding that we have developed with the other regulators in Europe to ensure there is that smooth through-flow of financial information from the players that would be contributing to such a scheme.

We do not believe it could be feasibly managed, even with any amount of resources.  We understand where some of those key areas of concern are, and that is the first thing I would say.  Perhaps the resources should be targeted to those areas that are of most concern, for example, some of those more egregious forms of harm that can impact users online.

There may be self- and co-regulatory solutions.  We can elaborate on those at another time, if members wish.

Ms Curtis said that, in lieu of the media commission report being published, the BAI will just get on, do its work as charged and meet its objectives.  It is totally unfair to Ms Curtis, Ms Craig and the BAI that Ms Curtis had to say that because it is a bloody disgrace that the report is not published.  The Cabinet needs to get its act together.  I say that as a Government party member.  We need to publish the report and deal with the issue of how we will fund public service journalism.

It is not good enough.<\/p> <p>  Journalism in this country is in a precarious position, especially from a funding point of view.  We do not need to tiptoe around the issue.  We need to be frank with the public regarding how we will fund public service journalism.  Journalism costs money.  Good journalism and research cost money.  Newsrooms are being diminished, especially in print but now in audiovisual and visual as well.  A little while ago, a new building was opened for a local newspaper close to my heart.  As the speeches went on, the CEO stated that in ten or maybe even five years' time the paper would no longer have a print version but would be digital only.  As a member of the National Union of Journalists, that vista depresses me.<\/p> <p>  While newspapers are goosed, I am equally fearful about the commercial viability of public service broadcasting.  I note that the BAI's strategic objectives 14 and 15 reference the enhancement of financial sustainability.  I will turn to Ms Craig on that point.  She stated that she favoured the household charge.  We know from the leaks that the media commission report suggests scrapping the licence fee and moving to Exchequer funding.

Rather than confusing the issue, the point that we highlighted in our submission to the Future of Media Commission was the requirement that procedures and practices are in place that support public service broadcasters but, more widely, also support the future sustainability of public service content.  We recognise that broadcasters are obviously very key in that space but we also recognise there are some other key players, such as our independent radio and television services and, though not within our remit, areas of print journalism, which are being very challenged by the migration of traditional forms of revenue, mostly advertising, onto the online space.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022032300002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Celene Craig"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":1153,"content":"<p>Exactly.

The digital space, however, does not require any single form of regulation or reform; it requires many forms of regulation.  We work closely in this regard with some of our other regulatory colleagues in Ireland.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, for example, has functions in this area and we work closely with it.  In the way same that any online content requires regulation, this issue will come down to examining the areas where it emerges that regulation is desirable.  There may well include content areas, but other activities in the metaverse will impact other areas of regulation.  This is an aspect of regulation that is probably going to develop over time.  I am not sure I can say much more on this topic now.  We are very much focused on the immediate future, but if the principle of the regulation of platforms, and the activities that flow from the operations of those platforms, require regulation, then it highly likely there will be implications for regulation, and not just for a media commission, but equally for other regulators.

It is a challenge for us as legislators to deal with this issue as well, given the convergence of new technologies, and to explore how we can ensure our people are safe in this space.  Will the relevant powers in this context be devolved to the new media commission and will it be taking on this responsibility?  I do not say this lightly, but the media commission will be one of the most important regulators in the country, and that is why we have concerns regarding the staffing complement of the new body.<\/p> <p>  The move to regulate the social media companies represents a significant challenge.  We have seen the Data Protection Commissioner, DPC, and other regulators, impose significant fines for breaches of codes, etc.  Ms Craig has experience of having to deal with breaches of various media codes.  My concern about the breaching of some of these codes by these large social media platforms is that in many ways they simply regard these fines as a cost of doing business and write them off.  In instances where we see reckless behaviour by these companies, would it be appropriate for us to examine making the directors of these companies individually liable, including being subject to criminal liability?  I draw a parallel here with health and safety legislation, which is taken much more seriously when an individual director of a company can be held criminally liable for reckless behaviour.  Given Ms Craig's experience in enforcing codes and dealing with breaches by media outlets, what approach does she think should be taken on this issue?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022032300002#G01400","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":1171,"content":"<p>In previous submissions the BAI made to the Government, and we continue to hold this view, we stated that a whole suite of regulatory tools needs to be made available to the media commission, including the most significant and serious types of sanctions for the more egregious forms of breaches.<\/p><p>That whole suite of regulatory tools is desirable.  However, not dissimilar to the approach that the BAI has taken over the course of many years, we have also found it helpful to work in a constructive way with regulated entities as well, and consulting with them for example as well as public consultation, when it comes to the content and the workability of codes, guidance to ensure that they understand the objective to be achieved and actually have practical ways to give effect to that.  There are ways of working constructively and we believe that twin-track approach to regulation has served us well as a regulator over the years, strongly stressing that not being afraid to take significant and strong action where that is required.  We are not afraid to use enforcement powers where they are required.  I think a proportionate approach to regulation, especially in a new situation, is to try to ensure that platforms work with the regulator to ensure they can comply with the highest standards with the type of regulation that is envisaged and the policies, codes and rules that will be set by the media commission.  It is a two-track approach but that full suite of sanctions needs to be available to a media commission to ensure that where there are egregious breaches of the legislation or the policies and codes, that it can take appropriate action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022032300002#G01500","nonspeaker":"Ms Celene Craig","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":1173,"content":"<p>I agree.

For example, if someone is taking an issue or wants to promote a position on a particular political issue that may be going through legislation and wants to do that by way of advertising, that is the kind of challenge that might need to be considered.  The position of the BAI as previously expressed before this committee is that the whole area of advertising needs to be looked at the round.  We certainly would see something of an imbalance in regard to the rules currently applying to broadcasting and those applying in an online environment.  There is a need to look at the whole issue in the round and ensure a fairness in the way the rules are applied.  An electoral process is one very clear context in which political advertising occurs but political advertising in its broader definition can also apply to lobbying groups and agencies such as that, which might have particular political interests and want to promote their particular point of view.

It will obviously be very important to give that time to take effect and be put into place.  Based on our past experience, it is very often when you actually start to implement the provisions of legislation that a regulator is best placed to say how that legislation might be tweaked or developed in other ways.  Obviously, depending on the recommendations that emerge from the Future of Media Commission, there may well be ways in which its recommendations might be strengthened through legislation but I am sure that is well within the sights of the Minister and her officials.<\/p> <p>  Beyond that, in terms of regulation of platforms more particularly, we will very likely see the Digital Services Act emerging in the next six to 12 months from Europe.  It might be advisable in terms of platform regulation to see how that develops and how that takes shape in law.  I think there will almost certainly be the potential for further legislative changes that will be required coming out of that.  Indeed it is also likely that changes will come out of the European Media Freedom Act which I referred to earlier, in the context of which political advertising is being looked at.  There are a couple of key pieces from Europe that I think will very likely impact the Irish legislative space as well as our own deliberations or decisions that might arise out of the Future of Media Commission report.  There will be plenty of food for thought in terms of legislative changes.  I do not think there is anything more immediate than that.  As I said, I think it is important that the Online Safety Media Regulation Bill gets time to bed down and that the regulatory framework gets time to get up and running effectively.  It would be very important to ensure that the legislation is not in any way undermined.

In regard to the suite of regulatory tools, we set out quite a bit of detail in our original submission to Government in early 2019 as part of the Government's consultation around the formation of the media commission and the potential for online regulation.<\/p><p>I am delighted to say many of those recommendations have been taken up and are evident in the legislation, as currently drafted.  I am pleased to note there is quite a wide range of regulatory functions and powers, in particular relating to online regulation.  I would highlight, in particular, the power of the media commission to draw up its own codes.  It will have very extensive investigative and auditing powers, which we would have recommended.  We also made a strong recommendation that platforms be required to supply information to the media commission in a format to be designated by the commission.  All that is very much embodied in the legislation.  There is also an element of being able to future-proof some aspects of the regulation through, for example, the potential to extend the range of harms within its scope.  All in all, we believe it is a very solid item of legislation, as currently drafted.  It comprises a useful set of regulatory tools that will be available to support the commission&rsquo;s work when it gets up and running.<\/p><p> As regards disinformation and misinformation, the BAI has been very active in this area, not least through our work at a European level.  We are the Irish nominated body to the European Regulators Group for Audiovisual Media Services.  We have played a very active role in dealing with disinformation and misinformation, which is a key concern of the commission.  It is not covered in the legislation but I referred to the Digital Services Act coming down the path.  The European Commission has high hopes it will certainly deliver better outcomes in terms of misinformation and disinformation.  A voluntary code of practice has been compiled by a range of interests, including many of the platforms based in Ireland, but the voluntary nature of that code has not made it particularly successful.  The BAI has undertaken a number of reports both regarding the European elections and disinformation in the context of Covid.  Those three reports, which we have published and are available on our website, contain an extensive range of recommendations on how to deal with disinformation into the future.  We are delighted to say the European Commission has strongly endorsed the Irish report's recommendations and has fed those into its recommendations, which are going through and will be worked through the European Commission&rsquo;s proposals in this regard.  We have a big concern about that issue.  In terms of the sustainability of indigenous media and our traditional public service content providers, it rubber-stamps and reinforces our belief that there is a need to ensure their sustainability as a key mechanism for ensuring balanced and impartial democratic discourse, particularly against the wider backdrop of the extent of disinformation that can be available online.  In general, we share the committee&rsquo;s concerns.  It is an issue that needs to be addressed but perhaps the Digital Services Act, and we will have to wait a few more months to see how it shapes up in its end form, may well deliver some solutions and means of addressing disinformation in the online space into the future.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022032300002#H00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Celene Craig","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":1182,"content":"<p>I have one final brief housekeeping question.

The knowledge, the regulatory processes, policies and skills can be transferred to other areas of content regulation in on-demand services and in the online space but some more specific knowledge and expertise, some of which have been touched on, for example, data analytics, and knowledge of algorithmic processes and the impact on how content is delivered to users, will need to be developed and grow over time.<\/p><p>We believe, however, there will be very significant interest, particularly among those who are committed to serving the public interest, in working in the media commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022032300002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Celene Craig","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":1189,"content":"<p>Ms Frances Haugen was before this committee a few months ago and she told us there were only around 200 people in the world who were qualified to do some of the work she was talking about.

On behalf of the committee I welcome to this first session Mr. Tom McIlduff, chief executive officer; and Ms Anna Cullen, communications, AA Ireland.  We also have a delegation from Fuels for Ireland, represented by Mr. Kevin McPartlan, chief executive officer.  Representing the Irish Petrol Retailers Association, IPRA, and appearing remotely, I welcome Mr. David Blevings, spokesperson, and Ms Raylene McCaughey, manager of McCaughey's 24-hour service station in Monaghan.  I hope I am pronouncing her name properly.  There is also Mr. Martin McSorley, the director of Drive Service Stations, and Mr. Declan Cronin, director of Newpark Service Centre.  We will be joined shortly by Mr. Alan O'Donnell, director of Woodview Service Station.  They are all very welcome to this afternoon's meeting on the rising cost of fuels, which is a very important matter for business and the public.

I thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to speak today.  The AA is Ireland's motoring organisation  It has acted as a voice for motoring interests and in a leading role supporting road and transport policies for more than 100 years.  We have also grown to become one of Ireland's largest personal lines insurance intermediaries in Ireland, providing motor, home and travel insurance.<\/p> <p>  The rising cost of fuel is one of the most important issues for the motorist today.  The AA fuel prices survey, which the business has done since 1991, has been followed in that time by many consumers and customers.  Our AA fuel website page is one of the most visited on the site, with in excess of 30,000 visitors over the past month, an increase of 500% compared with the previous month.<\/p> <p>  This survey has shown that average fuel prices are rising steadily, and as the committee knows, we have had record prices several times in the past few weeks.  The average price for fuel in Ireland currently stands at &euro;1.84 per litre for petrol and &euro;1.90 per litre for diesel. That is 62 cent per litre more than in 2020 for petrol and 70 cent per litre more than in 2020 for diesel.  There has been considerable media attention in recent weeks as the price passed &euro;2 per litre, although that price subsided, in part due to the relief in duties and the settling in oil prices internationally.<\/p> <p>  As I am sure members of the petrol industry will illustrate, the oil market is very volatile and changeable now, and that is something out of the control of our Government.  The reality is that the price that Irish consumers will pay is determined largely by global supply and demand economics.<\/p> <p>  We have seen high oil prices before and back in July 2008, Brent crude oil reached a record just over $147 per barrel but 14 years ago the price of fuel was &euro;1.17 per litre for petrol and &euro;1.09 per litre for diesel, which is 57% cheaper than today for petrol and 74% cheaper than today for diesel.  Inflation of course plays a role but so do increased taxes and duties.<\/p> <p>  If we paint a picture of the fuel running costs of the average motorist in 2022, what do we see?  For a start, surveys indicate the average motorist drives 17,000 km per year in an average family hatchback, which probably has a 50-litre fuel tank.  That motorist is currently paying &euro;92 for an average fill of petrol or &euro;95 for an average fill of diesel.  In recent weeks, a number of customers have paid more than &euro;100 per tank.  Those who drive larger vehicles, whether by choice or necessity, such as a seven-seat car, are still paying more than &euro;100 per tank.  According to AA Ireland calculations based on this, the average petrol car owner is spending &euro;2,234 on petrol per year or &euro;1,900 per year on diesel.  The diesel car is likely to go further because they are slightly more efficient.  In the case of a petrol car, that driver is spending &euro;680 more per year just on fuel than two years ago and &euro;700 more in the case of diesel.  By AA Ireland calculations, for every 20 cent increase in the price of fuel, the average driver adds approximately &euro;240 per year to their fuel bill.<\/p> <p>  It is also important for us to indicate that there are actions motorists can take while driving that can reduce their fuel use when driving.  For example, research indicates that driving at 100 km\/h rather than 120 km\/h on a motorway can reduce fuel consumption by more than 20%.  In addition, a tyre underinflated by 10% can increase fuel use by 2%.  For those living in urban centres, there is an alternative to a car.  They are not always taken up but many of us might jump on a Dublin bus, a DART, Luas or a bike in a cycle lane to get to our destination.  The reality for many Irish consumers and AA Ireland customers is that in less densely populated areas, this can be very difficult.<\/p><p>We know that people living in rural areas are much more dependent on their cars and that, in many instances, they simply do not have the variety of options that those living in more densely populated areas have.<\/p><p> This was borne out by statistics from the CSO, in the national travel survey, which showed that 12% of journeys in populated areas were by public transport and in thinly populated an rural areas, only 1.7% were made by bus and 0.2% were made by rail.  Some 83% of journeys are made by car in thinly populated areas according to this data.  For many people who bring their kids to school, go to college, or care for relatives, which are everyday activities, using the car has become increasingly expensive to do because of the rising costs of fuel.  AA Ireland welcomes the move to electric vehicles, EVs.  We are adapting our business every day to suit this change.  For example, in recent weeks we took delivery of several free-wheeling hubs, to allow our patrol vans to more quickly rescue EVs and get them back on the road quickly by being towed behind a patrol van rather than being lifted on the back of a larger lorry.<\/p><p> The future is very much electric and we are seeing that happen.  Currently, about 12% of new cars sold in Ireland are fully electric.  Using an overnight rate for electricity, a full charge can cost as little as &euro;6 for approximately 400 km of driving.  The average cost of fuel is &euro;50 for the same distance.  However, the average Irish car is nine years old, and despite State subsidies, the electric car remains out of reach for many.<\/p><p> The reduction in duties on petrol and diesel is welcome and will have a positive impact on motorists affected by these higher prices.  We all want a cleaner, greener automotive future, but running costs impact many motorists, especially those who simply do not have a wealth of transport alternatives in thinly populated areas.  I thank the committee for inviting us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022032300002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom McIlduff","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":1197,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair, the clerk to the committee and the committee for inviting us.  Fuels For Ireland is the representative body for the fuel sector in Ireland.  This industry employs more than 13,000 people in filling stations alone and provides a similar number of jobs in support functions.  It is an industry that collects in excess of &euro;3 billion in taxation on behalf of Government each year.  It is working hard to meet our shared objective of carbon neutrality by 2050.  Fuels for Ireland members currently provide 50% of Ireland's total energy needs.<\/p> <p>  During all the public health restrictions designed to protect us from Covid-19, our people continued to show up to work day after day, providing the products on which this country relies for transport, heating and business.  Russia's appalling and brutal invasion of Ukraine has created significant challenges for our industry, but we were already in challenging times, particularly with high international commodity pricing.  Demand was already outstripping supply as the world emerged from Covid-19.  Demand from China in particular spiked very sharply.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, refused to increase production and the sanctions imposed on Iran were all having a serious impact, which was reflected in high wholesale prices for fuel products in the months prior to 24 February.  In the days preceding Russian aggression, we had three severe weather events in Ireland that prevented or delayed cargoes of fuel being unloaded.<\/p> <p>  Coming into February, ahead of the tragic invasion of Ukraine, we had two specific problems.  There was a pinch on supply, with less than we would have liked in stock due to unusual weather events.  Second, there were rising international wholesale prices.  On top of these pre-existing challenges, the tragic invasion of Ukraine occurred and caused extreme volatility within our market and our industry.  This was by no means unique to Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Over many years Europe has developed a massive reliance on Russia for its energy.  Some 29% of the gas used in the EU and 35% of oil products came from Russia.  Despite the lack of formal sanctions, many companies, including Fuels for Ireland members, unwound themselves from contracts with Russian suppliers.  This effectively reduced the supply to the global and European oil markets.  In addition, many countries that had used Russian gas for electricity generation switched to oil and thereby created a massive increase in demand.<\/p> <p>  While wholesale fuel prices have fluctuated since Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine, the overall trend has been significantly upward.  In the 13 days between the start of the conflict and the Government announcing an excise duty reduction, the wholesale market prices had increased by 26 cent per litre on gasoline and 45 cent per litre on diesel.  When VAT is applied, petrol ultimately cost Fuels For Ireland members 32 cent more per litre, and diesel 55 cent more per litre to bring to consumers.  While the excise duty cuts succeeded in blunting the price rises, they were never going to entirely eradicate or reverse them.  Recent weeks posed significant challenges regarding prices, but also in the availability of product.<\/p> <p>  Fuels For Ireland members have worked hard to ensure stability of supply, but there has been much ill-informed commentary on stocks held.  The reality is that, while we have always maintained supply, there has never been the abundance of fuel in Ireland that some commentators have repeatedly and wrongly claimed.  To illustrate this point, in the six months prior to January 2022, the maximum commercial stock of fuel products, including crude oil at the refinery, that was held at any point in Ireland was sufficient for 19 days.  In the aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine, there was a point where there was only one day of commercial stock of diesel held in terminals at Dublin Port.  Fuels for Ireland members have had to manage stock responsibly, even when that meant having to impose maximum volume limits for orders from bulk fuel customers.  We have been consistently rebuilding stocks to normal commercial levels, but that means buying fuel at high wholesale prices.  Wholesale prices were already increasing prior to the unjustified invasion of Ukraine and the levels of commercial stock were nowhere near the levels that were being widely reported.  We must also recognise that the oil in storage has to be replenished and built up to normal levels and that replenishment has to happen at the wholesale rate on a given day.<\/p> <p>  We have worked with the Government and the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, to ensure that there is security of supply to Ireland throughout this period.  While NORA keeps a minimum of 90 days stock of oil to be deployed in the event of a supply shortage, this may only be released by order of the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications.  Even then, it is released at market rates.  NORA, and its strategic fuels stocks, does not render the Irish market immune to international price spikes.  At each step along the way, we have worked with NORA and a number of Departments to ensure that there has been clarity on fuel supply levels.  We are grateful to officials from the Departments of the Environment, Climate and Communications and Transport and NORA for their determined efforts and deep engagement with industry to maintain security of supply.  Despite the system coming under pressure at various points, we have ensured fuel has flowed to consumers and businesses, and assuming normal consumer behaviour, we are completely confident that this will continue.<\/p> <p>  This is the backdrop against which we have seen these price rises and, while it is encouraging to see respite on market prices in recent days, it is important to stress that further price volatility could occur.  It may well be beyond our control.  There has been great mischaracterisation of the work of the industry during this deeply uncertain time, and we are unhappy over how things have been portrayed in recent weeks, not least the inference that the industry has been engaged in any sort of profiteering.  This is simply not the case.<\/p> <p>  This inference has come in addition to repeated messaging that the excise duty reduction, welcome though it was, would take effect from midnight on the night the reduction was announced.  This could not possibly have happened.  As was flagged by industry to Government in advance, excise had already been paid on supplies that were on forecourts at that point.  It gave people a false impression that prices would reduce immediately and caused anger and frustration that was often directed at our colleagues.  In the two days prior to the excise duty cut, the wholesale price of diesel according to Platts increased by approximately 20 cent per litre, while the excise duty decreased by 15 cent per litre.  The effect of the excise duty cut was no more than a partial neutralisation of the price increases that had occurred in the two days before it was announced.<\/p> <p>  Further fiscal interventions seem likely to remain under consideration, including changes to VAT, which is applied to excise, levies and tax on fuel as well as the product itself.  We ask that industry be involved in discussion of such policies to prevent similar misunderstandings to those that arose regarding the excise duty cut.  Given the topic of this session is the rising cost of fuel, we need to recognise that this issue is not a short-term concern just borne out of the current tragic situation in Ukraine, but rather something that is more systemic and long-term.  It is the policy of successive Irish and many other international governments to reduce the capacity to produce fuel and, ultimately, increase the price of fuel to consumers.  This is justified by claims that by driving prices higher, demand for fossil fuels will drop, despite unrelentingly consistent and conclusive evidence to the contrary.<\/p><p>The reality, as shown in AA Ireland statistics, is that the price of fuel rose by 34% in the year to February 2022.  This is the highest level of price change on record and, according to analysis of data in a soon to be published Grant Thornton report, some 62% of comprised taxes and subsidies.  This proves the earlier point on price volatility leading into the present challenge and the level of Government taxation on fuels.<\/p><p> Our focus is on powering today and tomorrow.  Fuels for Ireland and its members have made an unequivocal commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, not just for our own companies but to support Ireland in meeting this objective.  We have repeatedly stated that fossil fuels cannot be the basis for Ireland's future energy plans or the business strategies of our members.  We have already invested in EV charging networks that mean a greater proportion of Irish forecourts provide charging points than any other European country.  We have spent years urging Government to double the biofuel component of petrol and are part of an industry that is investing its brightest minds and billions of euro into developing low- and no-carbon liquid fuels.  <\/p><p> We talk of a just transition, but it often seems that we expect to switch fully from one state to another with no steps along the way.  This risks leaving great swathes of people and businesses in Ireland behind.  To pursue a policy of strategically increasing the price of fossil fuels in the belief that this will drive all toward EVs or heat pumps ignores the fact that those least able to bear the high entry costs to these technologies are those hardest hit by high fuel prices.  With our focus on supplying the energy we need today and tomorrow, we believe there should be no penalties without realistic alternatives.<\/p><p> Analysis of the impact of Government fiscal and environmental policy on demand for fuel will soon be published by Grant Thornton.  It will report that a price rise in fuel is more likely to impact deprived households and that rural dwellers on lower incomes are the most inelastic to fuel price fluctuations, needing to compromise on other spending to cover these price rises.  In the context of this meeting and of the soon to be published report, it is our view that Government policy on fuel taxation should be comprehensively reviewed.<\/p><p> We welcome this opportunity to engage with the committee about how best we can continue to play our role in ensuring stability of supply and clarity on pricing and will always make ourselves available to Oireachtas committees and individual Members to inform political discussion on our sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022032300002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin McPartlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":1199,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it.  I am joined by four of our retail members.  I thank the Chair for introducing them and I thank them for giving up their time to present to the committee.  The Irish Petrol Retailers Association is a trade association for independent retailers in Ireland.  We lobby on issues that affect our members and have no financial interest in or give any advice on pricing to our membership.  Our members are mostly family-owned businesses who until recently were seen as essential workers during the pandemic and who worked tirelessly to keep services going for the nation.  That positive view of retailers has been severely damaged in the past two weeks.<\/p> <p>  We have approximately 500 members across the Republic, who purchase fuel from the major oil companies based on the previous market day closing price.  Retailers are emailed a daily wholesale price which gives them the purchase price of fuel for next-day delivery.  On Monday the wholesale price shows the price for fuel on Tuesday delivery.  Retailers have no control over wholesale pricing.  The heightened political tensions resulting from the invasion of Ukraine and the package of economic sanctions imposed by the West in response resulted in an unprecedented increase in prices for crude oil, which led to increased prices for refined products, as most countries were concerned at the potential loss of Russian oil supply and the effect that would have on the market.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note that fuel retailers have no control over wholesale prices.  If an increase is applied at wholesale level, the retailer has to pass this on to retain profitability.  To not pass on increases would be commercial suicide.  Regarding the claims of retailers gouging during the week of 7 March, our retail members on this call have advised us that on the two days - Tuesday, 8 March and Wednesday, 9 March - the market moved up approximately 11 cent per litre for unleaded and more than 18 cent per litre for diesel, meaning that retailers who purchased fuel on Wednesday, 9 March paid &euro;2.03 per litre for diesel and &euro;1.98 per litre for unleaded.  On Thursday, that increased to &euro;2.05 per litre for diesel and &euro;2.17 per litre for unleaded.  These prices were supplied by the retailers on this call and they can confirm that if required.  When our members buy fuel, they commit to buying 38,000 litres per order and, depending on the size of the station and frequency of sales, that load of fuel could last up to a week as independents tend to be smaller sites selling lower volumes.  In a volatile market, they cannot sell at a quick pace and have been stuck with a lot of fuel in the ground at very high prices.<\/p> <p>  When Government announced that excise cuts of 20 cent per litre and 15 cent per litre would take effect from Wednesday midnight, retailers could not implement this immediately without taking a huge hit and losing money on stock in the tanks.  As an example, one of our members who is present advised that they bought fuel on Tuesday, 8 March before the excise cut and could not pass on the reductions.  They sold the product at a loss, resulting in the loss of approximately &euro;6,000 to &euro;7,000 per site.  During this difficult week, due to the messaging from Government, we saw widespread abuse of retailers, bordering on violence.  Some retailers advised that their staff refused to come to work following the abuse they received from customers over the reported allegations of gouging and profiteering in the media.<\/p> <p>  We explained this to the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, and the Ministers of State, Deputies Troy and English, via a video call last Friday, 11 March and there was general acceptance that retailers who had bought fuel before the duty change could not have passed on the decrease until they sold what was in their tanks.  We have asked for that to be clarified by Government but to date we have seen nothing in the media to support that.  Government messaging should have followed up the call about the cut in excise duty with a statement that the decreases would not be immediate because of fuel in retailers' tanks purchased before the excise reduction.<\/p> <p>  Moving forward, it is imperative that Government engages with the sector before making such statements.  While we welcome the excise cut, we believe reductions could go further.  An obvious option would be to reduce VAT on fuel sales as this would be a clear benefit for consumers and, as it does not affect stock, a much easier proposal for retailers.<\/p> <p>  To conclude, retailers have no control over the price they pay for fuel and purchase it as required at the daily wholesale prices.  With the war in Ukraine, supply problems and a shortage of diesel, most retailers increased their stock levels prior to the excise cut.  The more stock retailers had in, the more they lost.  The retailers suffer the loss when the Government reduces the excise duty as they have bought the stock in and paid the higher duty prior to the cut.  Smaller retailers are worst affected as it takes them longer to sell a load of fuel if they bought it at the wrong price.  They cannot afford to take the loss on a full load of 38,000 litres plus the stock in their tank.  They cannot increase the price as they become uncompetitive at the pump with reduced sales, as well as the negative publicity when Government announced the price going down.  A lag time must be allowed for retailers to change prices.  The key question I hope we will address today is how we can stop this happening again.

I note the frustration that both Mr. McPartlan and Mr. Blevings are expressing on behalf of the public regarding fuel prices.  I wanted to get to the heart of the matter so I drove last Monday to petrol stations in my constituency.  I got to nearly all of the ones in Limerick city.  My constituency covers Limerick city, east Limerick and a bit of north Tipperary.  I found that of 32 petrol stations, 29 had offered serious price reductions.  Their prices were below the national average.  I found that three of the 32 stations were charging &euro;1.99 - virtually &euro;2 - per litre of diesel and &euro;1.89.9 cent for petrol, which is just short of &euro;1.90.  Those stations were associated with a certain supplier of fuel that I will not name.  In other stations with the same supplier, the prices, instead of being &euro;1.99.9 and &euro;1.89.9 for diesel and petrol, respectively, were &euro;1.83.9 and &euro;1.79.9, respectively, resulting in differentials of 16 cent per litre of diesel and 10 cent per litre of petrol.  Three petrol stations in Limerick are giving a bad name to the other 29, which were passing on reductions.<\/p> <p>  My first question is for Mr. Blevings.  How is this happening?  Is anyone overseeing the price of petrol and diesel at the pumps?  Well over 90% of petrol stations were very consistent in passing on the excise reduction for petrol and diesel, but three were outliers.  Two were serious outliers, charging nearly &euro;2 per litre of diesel.  This means that there was no passing on of the excise reduction.  Nearly &euro;1.90 was being charged for a litre of petrol.  Is there anyone who oversees the pricing in Mr. Blevings&rsquo; sector?<\/p> <p>  My next question is from Mr. McPartlan.  How does the supplier issue arise?<\/p> <p>  Perhaps Mr. Blevings will deal with my next point.  It is approximately 12 days since the excise duty reductions were introduced.  I fail to see how the petrol and diesel in the tanks would not be used up within a 12-day cycle and, therefore, how come a small few outliers are giving a bad name to the vast majority of petrol retailers who are providing an excellent service to the public?

It reflects the market conditions.  In response to the specific question about the global oil majors, the Ukraine situation is four weeks old.  I do not believe that any financial reporting can accurately say what the impact of those four weeks has been at this point.  Specifically, do I think that Fuels for Ireland members will report bumper profits as a result of this?  Absolutely not.  As the committee has heard from some of the independent retailers, just as they took a bath, to use a colloquialism, on prices immediately after the excise duty cut, it is very likely that some of the majors also took serious losses in the immediate term to try, first, to meet consumer expectations that prices were going to come down and, second, to protect their staff from the abuse and threats we have talked about.

The profit we make on fuel is per litre.  If I sell a litre at &euro;1 or &euro;2 I make 5 cent.  It does not matter what the price is.  I do not make a percentage of the selling price.  We will not see excess profits being made by anybody.  The Government is making more because it gets a percentage of VAT.  As the price rises it gets more but we do not.  We get the exact same no matter what.  We will make less because since this has happened our volumes have decreased by more than half.  I have a site that was doing 35,000 l a week and it is now doing 14,000 l a week because I cannot sell the stock that is in the ground.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to competition I fear the 500 members of the IPRA will not be available to meet the committee in five years because most of them will be gone.  The reason for this is we cannot survive on the small margins we are getting.  We are losing volume year after year.  Bigger operations are wiping us out.  Other than this, we are also being absolutely destroyed by overheads.  Earlier we spoke about electric cars.  Five years ago, I was paying 17 cent a unit for electricity; now I am paying 40 cent.  The electricity bill on my site in Wexford has increased from &euro;36,000 in 2017 to &euro;110,000 this year.

Due to the increased demand over the past number of weeks in the likes of kerosene, paraffin and even agricultural diesel, the tanks of many major supplies that come into Ireland ran low, so there was a shortage of some of those products.<\/p> <p>  There are two comments I would like to make.  One is on the smaller retailers around the country.  I was brought up in this business in Cork and I have no doubt that in the next 20 years many of the small retailers in rural areas will go out of business because there is no profit in selling petrol and diesel.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of the refined product coming into Ireland, my belief is we are too dependent on a few refiners.  Over the past number of years, the big major suppliers such as Shell, BP and all of those companies left Ireland.  They had a supply source because they had their own refineries.  Now I believe only one company in Ireland has a refinery that is actually supplying to Ireland, and they are supplying many of the companies.

I am president of the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA.  It is no exaggeration for me to state that the licensed road haulage sector is in a serious existential crisis at present.  The ever-increasing hikes in fuel costs have been hitting our sector for many months now and are coming on top of operating conditions that are already extremely challenging.  Brexit, driver shortages and Covid-19 constraints on operations have built up a perfect storm for our members, their colleagues and families.  The ever-increasing costs of running a licensed haulage business are forcing people out of the sector and forcing some members to park up their trucks.  The sector is fiercely competitive and members are finding limited opportunities to recover increased costs from their customers.  Members are also facing huge uncertainty about the future, given the ongoing dependence on diesel-powered vehicles for the medium term, with a Government that flatly refuses to recognise this reality.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, seems to want to wish away diesel from our economy by imposing penal taxes on the essential fuel used for heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, but has not presented any realistic alternatives to our members.<\/p> <p>  It is vital to fully understand the important role that licensed haulage plays in our economy and society.  Licensed hauliers are literally the wheels that keep the economy moving.  Our members bring goods to and from Ireland and play an important role in the distribution of goods and the supply chain, ensuring that homes, businesses and essential services are able to function effectively.  Any loss in the effective functioning of our national haulage fleet will directly impact on many areas of our economy.  Therefore, it is disheartening to hear about well-established and long-standing licensed hauliers who are getting out of the business or downsizing their operations.  Given the high-cost operating environment and the uncertain future, they cannot make their business pay for them.<\/p> <p>  We have made strong representations to the Government about the high cost of fuel.  We welcome the recent announcement of an interim relief scheme to licensed hauliers to meet extra fuel costs.  This payment was around an additive, AdBlue, and sought to ease the burden of high prices.  The payment of &euro;100 per week for each HGV on the road for an eight-week period will assist the sector in the short term but it is very much only a stop-gap measure.  We also met the Minister for Finance and put different scenarios to him, and we subsequently got the 15 cent decrease, which is very welcome and which I acknowledge.  However, sticking-plaster solutions only push the problem down the road and provide no assurance to licensed hauliers that the Government gets the problem and is prepared to address the matter comprehensively.<\/p> <p>  In order to address high fuel prices and other operating costs for our sector, the Government needs to give sufficient fuel rebates to licensed hauliers as essential users of diesel.  We have argued with the Government that the current diesel rebate scheme needs to be recalibrated to ensure it is an effective support for a key sector of the economy.  We have indicated to the Government the levels of change required in the existing diesel rebate scheme but there is no indication that the Government will move on this issue.  The blind opposition to fossil fuel subsidies is preventing the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, from looking at reconfiguring the scheme to a more workable alternative which can also help to reduce costs and emissions.<\/p> <p>  We need to implement the significant fuel saving measures which we have presented to the Government as a means of reducing fuel consumption.  These are very simple initiatives that could make a significant difference to the amount of fuel used, such as altering traffic light sequences in urban areas, creating a toll-free channel for HGVs at toll booths and changing the operating hours for depots at ports.  Each of these initiatives would help to reduce fuel consumption, reduce costs and reduce emissions.  We need to support the transition of the national HGV fleet to more fuel-efficient options.  This is a no-brainer but, regrettably, we are running up against a brick wall on this issue.<\/p> <p>  There is no acceptance in government of the stark reality that diesel will remain the key transmission source for licensed hauliers operating HGVs out to the medium term.  There is no substitute fuel source available to the sector at present and no indication of one emerging in the medium term.  The Government needs to remove the doctrinal objection to diesel as a fossil fuel and instead change the focus to securing the lowest emissions possible and the highest fuel efficiency from diesel vehicles.  Modern fuel technologies mean that HGVs can now use diesel and achieve the lowest possible emission levels for CO2, NOx and SOx, as well as achieving high levels of fuel efficiency.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Road Haulage Association would warmly welcome it if this committee could act as an interlocutor on the issue of fuel costs and the future of this vital sector.  All too often, we are told that specific measures cannot be taken because of potential objections at EU level.  Yet, when we examine matters directly in Brussels and look at measures adopted in other member states, we find that Irish Government objections do not stand up.<\/p><p>There is nothing at EU level stopping the Irish Government from introducing a new diesel rebate scheme that acknowledges our sector as essential users of diesel.  Similar schemes exist in Holland, Belgium, Spain, Italy and France.  Such a scheme can also form part of initiatives to move the fleet to a low-carbon, low-emission and fuel-efficient future but this will require the Government accepting that diesel will be the fuel of necessity for our sector for at least the next ten years.  Put simply, there is no viable alternative at present or coming from HGV manufacturers over the medium term.<\/p><p> It is also important to point out at this juncture the reason we are harping on so much about how we only have the choice of diesel.  Even if other alternative fuels become available, we cannot leave the island on ferries because the other fuels are effectively a bomb going on the ferry.  The channel tunnel recently totally stopped accepting gas in any proportion, or hydrogen if it should happen to be available.  We cannot get to the markets other than with diesel.<\/p><p> Heads need to be banged together to come up with workable and practical suggestions and outcomes, which we presented to the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Eamon Ryan, recently, that can assist the sector while also meeting Government objectives on climate change.  We can meet our targets if we are helped.  Workable and practical outcomes can be achieved to avert the current crisis and bring this sector to a sustainable and viable future.  These measures can tackle high fuel costs for our members as essential users of diesel and can support the transition of the sector to a low-carbon future.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman.

My name is Aidan Flynn, chief executive of the Freight Transport Association of Ireland, FTAI.  The FTAI is a not-for-profit membership trade association for the Irish freight, passenger and logistics industries.  We welcome the opportunity to present to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications on the topic of the rising cost of fuel at a time when fluctuating fuel prices are having a significant negative impact on businesses, which is feeding into increased inflation to consumers.<br\/><br\/>Ireland's supply chain and passenger service sector must be protected from sharp and spiralling increases in fuel costs.  The volatility in the fuel markets was evident in the final quarter of 2021 and has been growing in intensity since.  Since October 2021, the European Commission put in place the legal framework that enables the EU and its member states to take action to address the effect of sudden price fluctuations due to the increased spike in energy costs, attributed at the time to increased energy usage spikes due to global economic recovery.  Two of the main recommendations were to provide temporary, targeted reductions in taxation rates for vulnerable households and to provide aid to companies or industry in line with EU state aid rules.<br\/><br\/>We welcome interventions to date such as the 15 cent reduction in excise duty on diesel and the emergency measure of the &euro;100 grant per vehicle for vehicles listed on a road haulage operator licence.  The question must be asked, however, as to why the coach and bus sector and the own-account sectors were excluded from this emergency provision.  The Government must become more flexible and proactive in dealing with the fuel crisis we are experiencing at the moment.  It has taken until the eleventh hour, some five months after the European Commission&rsquo;s intervention, to see action by the Irish Government, which is frustrating for all in the transport and logistics sector.  We need a dynamic and flexible approach to deal with exceptional circumstances.<br\/><br\/>In the 2021 FTAI submission on the ten-year haulage strategy to the Department of Transport, we suggested that a subgroup of the Government task force on emergency planning should be created to have representation from the freight distribution and logistics sector as we deem it essential in ensuring comprehensive preparations for, and response to, all emergencies.  We submitted that this subgroup should include the Department of Transport and key stakeholders within the logistics sector, and that the subgroup should commence work immediately and form part of the national emergency planning in the event of future pandemics as well as, for example, disaster planning around fuel shortages and natural disasters.<br\/><br\/>Having dealt with the emergency brought about by Covid-19 and the consequences of Brexit, the pressures on the freight distribution and logistics sector are again intensifying due to the increases in energy prices, evidenced by the volatility of the price of a barrel of oil, which breached $140 per barrel in an intense week of trading recently.  It has since decreased in price; I think it is $117 today.  However, the average price per barrel of Brent oil is currently approximately $97 per barrel.  To put this in context, in March 2021, the average price of a barrel of oil was $65; a 48% differential.<br\/><br\/>Wildly fluctuating fuel pricing, while not a regular occurrence, creates panic and unnecessary uncertainty in the market for both the consumer and essential service users.  It is critical that essential services are ring-fenced and protected from such volatility.  Recently, transport operations were limited to the volume of product they could purchase; not because of supply issues <i>per se <\/i>but because of the hourly volatility in price fluctuation.  This unpredictability feeds uncertainty around security of supply and availability of product at affordable prices.<br\/><br\/>Commercial fleet operators come in many guises, operating across all industries including haulage, manufacturing, retail, warehouse and distribution, construction, private and public passenger transport, security, telecommunications etc.  Currently, there are more than 40,000 Irish registered heavy goods vehicles greater than 3.5 tonnes.  Of that number, 21,437 vehicles are included in the 3,812 <br\/><br\/>road haulage operator licences issued by the State.  The average-size haulage operator has five and a half trucks.<br\/><br\/>The own-account HGV operations are identifiable as being involved in the movement of their own goods, not for hire and reward, such as fuel distribution, retail distribution, local authorities, waste management services and so on.  There are 1,542 large public service vehicle, LPSV, licensed operators in Ireland, with a total of just over 12,000 coaches and buses in the fleet.  This is an average of 7.79 buses per operator.  Understanding the size of commercial fleets, including the differentiation between the haulage sector and the own-account sector, is important in aiding our understanding of the necessary supports for mainly small to medium-sized businesses without distorting the competitive forces that deliver efficient and profitable logistics services.<br\/><br\/>Benchmarking operational costs is a key ingredient in aiding businesses in our industry to develop robust business plans that support decision-making and enhance profitability and competitiveness.  The FTAI publishes an annual report called the Manager's Guide to Distribution Costs.This is an industry-wide survey examining the costs associated with personnel, operational, maintenance and fuel costs of commercial fleet operators in the haulage and logistics sector.<br\/><br\/>According to this guide, fuel accounts for more than 41% of operational costs for articulated vehicle fleets and just under 25% of rigid vehicle costs.  The most recent report identified the average fuel cost per kilometre at 33 cent at a time when the average price per litre was &euro;1.33.  We have seen the price of a litre of diesel increase significantly by more than 40% in the past 12 months.  This is having the impact of increasing that cost per kilometre to 46 cent.  This increase is crippling for those who do not have fuel surcharges built into their contracts but also is damaging to freight distribution cash flow, particularly when the curve of fuels prices has a constant upward and steep trajectory.<br\/><br\/>The FTAI has repeatedly advised the Government to review the current diesel rebate scheme to make it more accessible and fit for purpose to alleviate some of the pressures on the haulage and public service vehicle, PSV, sector.  There are challenges with the current system with less than one third of qualifying operators actively participating in the scheme.  This scheme must also be broadened to include the own-account sector, which is responsible for most of the national retail and food and energy supply services distribution.<br\/><br\/>Currently, the rebate scheme provides a 7.5 cent per litre rebate, which is payable three months after the fuel has been purchased with certain terms and conditions applying.  The scheme should be made more efficient to support cash flow for operators and, particularly in exceptional periods such as we are currently experiencing, should be flexible enough to facilitate monthly claims and payments.  It should also be renamed and extended to include alternative fuels such as compressed natural gas.<br\/><br\/>Of course, we are not here today to suggest that the Government must do everything to provide subvention for our industry.  We want to highlight the work that is being done by our members and others in operating in a professional manner while striving for recognition.  Solidarity within the supply chain and passenger services is also essential in protecting the sustainability and viability of essential service providers.  It is imperative that the burden of increased costs is shared, thus mitigating the risk to service provision, developing fair competition and, critically, security of service.<br\/><br\/>Why, for instance, should haulage operators be fully responsible for the increasing rate of carbon tax?  Currently, carbon tax accounts for 8.5 cent per litre of diesel.  This is increasing to 11 cent in May and will increase year-on-year until it is 71 cent per litre in 2050.  The purchasers of these services have an influence on the environmental impact through the contracting of their freight distribution services.  <br\/><br\/>It must become the norm that these costs are considered in a professional and engaging manner where all parties understand the realities and pressures of operating effective and efficient logistics and passenger services.  Developing more transparency and guidance for industry on fuel pricing will support and aid this reality.  The quarterly diesel repayment rate is calculated using the national average purchase price.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, provides this information.  It is this rate that is referenced by the Revenue Commissioners.<br\/><br\/>The CSO could publish more frequent updates on fuel pricing that could become the reference de facto for fuel escalator agreements.  The public sector should lead by example in support of fuel escalator arrangements and guidance should be available to all to support progressive and fair contract arrangements that will ultimately spread the risk of fuel inflation and share the burden of increased carbon taxes.<\/p><p>Since 2014 the FTAI has promoted, and in recent years run, a CO2 reduction programme.  This is our TruckSafe green certificate programme, which is funded through the energy efficiency obligation scheme and regulated by the SEAI.  This recognises hauliers and commercial fleet operators for their performance improvement based on primary measured data submitted quarterly.  To summarise the results of the overall programme for the period 2014 to 2020, we have avoided 89,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions, more than &euro;750,000 has been paid out to licensed operators for demonstrating reductions in fuel consumption and there have been more than &euro;56 million in savings from avoided fuel use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022032300002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan Flynn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":1456,"content":"<p>I am conscious of time and I ask Mr. Flynn to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022032300002#P00200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":1457,"content":"<p>I will finish now.

I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it today.  I am the chief executive officer of CILT Ireland.  CILT is the globally recognised professional members body for all professionals involved in the mobility and supply chain industries.  We are an independent membership body operating in more than 40 countries and representing more than 30,000 professionals globally.  We promote and support professionalism and enhanced standards.<\/p> <p>  CILT Ireland recognises the difficulties for our sector arising from increasing fuel costs.  These difficulties need to be set against an already incredibly challenging and fast-changing environment brought about by the global pandemic and Brexit.  The supply chain industry is still adjusting to the enormous changes forced upon it by these events and now finds itself also affected by the volatility in part brought about by the tragic situation evolving in Ukraine.  The combined effects of these highly-disruptive events are felt right across the sector in all modes, road, rail, air and maritime.  All parts of the supply chain have needed to adapt and introduce new methods of operations to maintain supplies and services.  Passenger as well as freight movements have been affected and the industry's ability to move people and goods economically has been challenged as never before.<\/p> <p>  CILT Ireland believes that the long-term solution to the issues facing the industry is in a sustainable approach to decarbonisation for the industry, aligned with clear transitional plans and combined with higher levels of professionalisation, education and training programmes, and the adoption of innovative technology.  This strategic approach will require appropriate plans and supports to transition from a reliance on carbon-based fuels, as well as a whole-of-industry approach to professionalisation so that standards, capacity, and sustainability are prioritised.  A sustainable approach may require the reassessment of lowest-cost solutions and a reduction in proprietary and exclusive distribution lines, for example. <\/p> <p>  Collaboration and shared resources are key to the long-term success of the industry with a recognition that much of the industry is made up of smaller independent operators who usually do not have significant economic or financial influence.  These smaller operations may not have the same ability to adapt, often because of contractual obligations, and survive in adverse conditions.  This must be recognised by industry as well as the customers it serves.  There is potential to improve the shared understanding of costs, contracts and the business environment within the sector.<\/p> <p>  There is a need to develop practical and viable plans for all parts of the supply chain utilising industry professionals who can help industry adapt to the inevitable unforeseen circumstances.  Strategic planning covering input security, sustainable supply chains, decarbonisation targets and economic sustainability are crucial to the success of the industry.  Investment in training and education and the promotion of professionalisation and standards will be required.  The knowledge, skills and analysis which professional bodies such as CILT can contribute can be leveraged in the short, medium and long term.<\/p> <p>  The current volatility in fuel prices highlights several key challenges that require addressing.  Security and sustainability of supply chains and the impacts of rising input costs on the economy are two of the most important.  CILT Ireland recognises that short-term measures will be required but believes that only a strategic response using appropriate policy instruments is now needed to effectively deal with the problem.  The current crisis is a symptom of the much larger challenge to decarbonise our sector.<\/p> <p>  The latest environmental package, Fit for 55, in the European Green Deal published in 2021 has set out a vision to make Europe carbon neutral by 2050.  For the road transport sector, the emphasis is on alternative and cleaner energy fuels for all vehicles, intending to phase out the sale of internal combustion engines vehicles for heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, no later than 2040.  Based on the latest CILT Ireland policy research, we would like to bring to the attention to the committee two main findings.  There is a divergence between the Government's incentivised decarbonisation direction and the industry's preferences, which might hinder the uptake of cleaner vehicles among heavy duty vehicle, HDV, and HGV operators.  The current decarbonisation policies indicate a trend towards electrification for the transport sector in general.  However, the study shows that operators consider hydrogen and biofuel as more feasible options.  Given the limited market choice and technological support availability, electrification might not be a feasible option for HDV and HGV operators in the near term.  In addition, the high upfront investment of cleaner vehicles and the availability of the infrastructure throughout the country are also significant barriers.<\/p> <p>  The current Government policies on transport decarbonisation are less reflected in terms of measures and support schemes for most SMEs in the market.  Small and micro companies are significant elements of the transport industry in Ireland, similar to the European context.  They are aware of green technologies but less interested in adopting these green practices in their operations or participating in the current decarbonisation schemes.  During the engagement with the transport operators in this study, a sense of being overwhelmed has been felt.  The operators are preoccupied with ongoing workloads and hardly have the capacity or resources to make a strategic plan for decarbonisation in their operations. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022032300002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Kenny"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1647993600,"counter":1459,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and committee members for inviting the Coach Tourism and Transport Council of Ireland, CTTC, to appear before them today to address the crucial issue of the spiralling fuel costs currently crippling the industry.  We are delighted with this opportunity, which will allow us to outline the detrimental impact of the crisis on the bus and coach industry and the integral role the sector can play in alleviating the cost of living crisis for many.  I am joined by Mr. William Martin and Mr. Brendan Crowley, who are fellow executive council members of the CTTC.  I acknowledge the desire of the CTTC to work in tandem with the Government in addressing this crisis.  We are Ireland's largest representative body for the private bus and coach sector, with a comprehensive membership spanning mostly indigenous family-run operators, working across scheduled services, international tours, private hire and school transport.<br\/><br\/>The private bus and coach sector is an integral part of Ireland's national transport network, and collectively the sector is responsible for carrying more than 75 million passengers per year, helping to sustain 11,000 direct jobs and contributing in excess of &euro;600 million to our national economy.  Private operators are responsible for attracting one fifth of all tourists who visit Ireland annually.  This has an enormously positive impact on regional retailers, hospitality outlets, visitor attractions and other relevant businesses throughout the country.<br\/><br\/>The sector is also largely responsible for the provision of school transport, with more than 90% of the 41 million school journeys being carried out by private operators.  On an annual basis, more than 120,000 children are transported to their place of education on 7,000 different bus routes to 3,000 separate schools.  As such, commercial operators are an essential foundation stone of the Irish transport network, and the smooth carriage of thousands of passengers and school commuters remains dependent on the viability of the sector.<br\/><br\/>The recent invasion of Ukraine has resulted in soaring fuel costs that continue to rise at a level which, simply put, is unsustainable for the sector.  Having spent the past two years grappling with the unprecedented reduction in passenger levels as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, we are now in the midst of another crisis, which is pushing the sector to the brink of collapse.  For the most part, commercial operators have been left with little choice but to absorb the financial repercussions of crippling fuel costs.  While scheduled service operators with direct award contracts have the benefit of fuel variation clauses contained therein, which help to insulate operators to an extent, this <i>status quo<\/i>ends in June.  Correspondingly, the situation is somewhat bleak for coach tour operators and school transport providers.  This is owing to the fact that many of these operators have signed up to contracts, either with Bus &Eacute;ireann or private tourism companies, for previously agreed rates.  In some cases these last for up to five years.  They are now unviable, unworkable and, worse still, they threaten the livelihood of these businesses.<\/p><p>In particular, the lack of alignment in State contracts and Government procurement is troubling and we need to see legally enforceable fuel variation clauses introduced in school transport contract in order that operators have protection against extreme variations in fuel costs.  They currently do not have this.  Fuel variation clauses are a progressive means of protecting all parties to a contract and essentially, act as a safeguard against the risk and uncertainty associated with the sudden change in the price of essential materials needed to give effect to the contractual obligations.  These clauses are designed to support sectors and industries that are susceptible to external events and beyond the control of the parties.  They allow for prices to rise or fall as the relevant circumstances prevail, which gives a large degree of certainty and comfort to all.<\/p><p> Many of our members are at the forefront of school transport and a recent research survey bleakly highlighted the impact of external events on the sector.  Two thirds of operators have seen fuel costs increase by up to 60% over the course of the past 12 months, 90% of operators need up to a 35% increase in contract rates to continue to operate their services and 95% of school transport providers are unable to guarantee service provision up until the end of the academic year in June.<\/p><p> Furthermore, the coach tourism sector in Ireland is facing a competitiveness issue as the country is at the higher price range for visitors and given recent events, it will be increasingly challenging to continue to position Ireland as an attractive tourist destination.  This in turn risks jeopardising our once-thriving international and domestic tourism markets, responsible for independently attracting 2 million tourists, and threatens the viability of thousands of businesses and jobs across the country.<\/p><p> The fact of the matter is that every facet of public transport has been impacted by pre-existing contracted rates which if not resolved, will have a detrimental impact on congestion, our decarbonisation ambitions and strategic transport provision across the country.  Commercial bus companies cannot continue to provide the same level of service and maintain current schedules while grappling with an average 50% to 60% increase in the price of fuel.  Given the majority of our members operate routes outside of Dublin any adverse impacts on general service provision will have a disproportionate impact on the regions.<\/p><p> In order to alleviate the worst impacts on general route delivery and service provision, the Government needs to implement a number of crucial policies without delay.  It should reduce VAT on fuel to 9%.  This worked very well for the hospitality sector when it was in crisis and a similar policy must be adopted to safeguard the mass transportation sector during a time of extraordinary financial hardship.  Just last week, the CTTC wrote to the Government recommending a temporary reduction in VAT, the details of which can be worked out in consultation with industry stakeholders.  The Government should align all State transport contracts to ensure the inclusion of fuel variation clauses, which will insulate school transport operators against further diesel hikes, which are expected.  The Government should introduce a special fund for embattled coach tourism operators that have pre-existing contractual arrangements in place with international tour companies in order that they can continue to attract millions of international visitors this year.  The Government should encourage members of the public to take public transport as a means of offsetting the cost of living crisis.  Buses serve as a feasible solution while offering crucial regional connectivity.  This would alleviates city congestion and would help to reduce the country&rsquo;s carbon emissions.  In ordinary times, buses are a cost-effective transport option for commuters and collectively, our sector has a vital role to play in helping Ireland to realise its sustainability objectives.  It is imperative we safeguard this.<\/p><p> One full coach takes 40 cars off the road.  As a country, we should be deploying every available incentive and strategy, to encourage a modal shift away from private vehicles towards public transport and I acknowledge the crucial steps taken by the Government so far in this regard.  However, asking operators to shoulder the financial burden of crippling fuel costs is the antithesis of this and as absorbing these price shocks will ultimately undermine efforts by operators to electrify their fleets, we also need to look at ways and means to facilitate this transition in a meaningful way by enabling commercial operators unfettered access to purchase EVs.  Without essential support at this time, the industry will be in jeopardy, which will render the 2050 zero emissions target impossible.<\/p><p> At the outset, I was keen to emphasise the CTTC&rsquo;s desire to engage proactively with the Government, in seeking to address this crisis.  It is in that same spirit that I thank the committee for this opportunity to contribute.  We look forward to answering any questions that members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022032300002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. J.J.

You either increase fares, increase patronage or you go out of business.  Increasing fares is not an option at this stage because there is a lot of pressure on people who want to commute and travel.  Many Government initiatives are actually working in the opposite direction where they are going to reduce fares, even though we are excluded from those initiatives, such as the 20% reduction in fares and the student or youth fare, which we have been excluded from as well in the short to medium term.  We therefore have no option but to try to absorb it.  It will impact on service delivery and service levels.

We want to bring it forward to be a modern industry that uses fuel efficiently, but we have not had an indication from the Government about what would be acceptable.  As I was listening to one of the presentations that was made earlier, I took exception to the suggestion we do not embrace modern technology.  We do but, as we have pointed out - this is where the State can act as an interlocutor &ndash; hydrogenated vegetable oil, HVO, and biofuel are not available to us in sufficient quantities to keep the fleet going.  As for hydrogen and gas, the ships and the channel tunnel will not take us on board.  We need diesel to supply Ireland, full stop.  We can have clean diesel or additive diesel and we can do our best with it and modernise our fleet to a Euro 6 standard.  There is no higher standard, no matter the mode, than Euro 6.  We are keen to embrace it and anxious to get there.<\/p> <p>  In the context of Fit for 55 in Europe and all the green agendas, we seem to be trying to move faster than anyone else and to reach the deadlines more quickly than anyone else, yet we have the furthest distance to go and are the island off the island.  It is too competitive an agenda in the context of the costs to us.  We need the Government to be an interlocutor with Europe to highlight Fit for 55 is only aspirational.  There is no law about it yet.  Other countries are giving rebates and other incentives.  Romania cut its price to &euro;1.40 just before the crisis started.  We are cognisant of the fact the State must keep the price of fuel in or around $300 a barrel.  That is the law.  How it is administered up or down can be determined by the State.  We need to bring home the essential user to the supply chain or it will all stop.  The crisis here, with the price increases so severe, is moving so fast that when we met the Minister for Transport on a Thursday some weeks ago, by the time we were meeting the Minister for Finance on the Monday, the whole agenda had changed, given how much and how fast the price had increased over the weekend.  It is now at such a crisis point that we must move fast.  There was a stoppage in the co-operative in Nenagh today - I will not name it on the record - and the milkmen did not go out to collect the second round of milk.  It was a stand-off, and that is spreading to other co-operatives.  We need the Government to be an interlocutor in Europe for us.<\/p> <p>  There are three parts to this, one of which is our industry, which will take some of the strain.  The second is our customers.  There are public limited companies, PLCs, and co-operatives with very fat balance sheets that have not addressed the costs and have not come to the hauliers.  Third, there is the State, which can help us following a spike or a spiral and dig us out to get over any of these issues.  There is nothing to bring the customer to the table.  Customers are up against a big wall; they are individuals and small companies.  We heard the consumer affairs expert talk earlier about price gouging.  If we cannot bring the customer to give us the increases, they are not addressing the facts.  We need the State to indicate what is acceptable and give us the supports, as we have requested.

The precedent is there.  The National Transport Authority has variation clauses in some its contracts.

We are well aware that there are three parties to this, and that the customers has to take up their share but nobody could keep up with the spikes that are there now.  With Ireland being the furthest distance from Europe, and the west and south coast being further again, we must have the supports that would enable us.
