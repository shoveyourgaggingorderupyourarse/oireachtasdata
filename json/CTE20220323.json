Article 21.7 of the whistleblowing directive clarifies the legal position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the TSD on the one hand, and the protection of whistleblowers on the other, and makes clear that a person who makes a disclosure of a trade secret in accordance with the rules of the whistleblowing directive should not be subject to this public interest test.

This is something I have considered carefully and discussed with the officials at length.  Before setting out the reasons I do not propose to accept the amendments, I want to make it clear that the obligation on some employers to have internal channels and procedures is an administrative requirement separate from the right of workers to report wrongdoing to their employer.  Therefore, there is no diminution here of the rights of people to make a protected disclosure.<\/p> <p>  Section 6(1) of the Protected Disclosures Act provides that a worker is protected if they report a relevant wrongdoing to their employer.  This applies irrespective of the size of the organisation they work for and the Bill does not change this.  Therefore, regardless of whether their employer has a formal reporting channel or not, all workers, public and private, remain entitled to all of the protections of the legislation.  That is a fundamental point worth remembering.  Workers will also have access to supports such as the Transparency International Ireland Speak Up Helpline to help them in understanding how to make a report.<\/p> <p>  Implementing the requirements as regards internal reporting channels will create a compliance burden for industry.  The European Commission&rsquo;s impact assessment of the directive estimates that the initial set-up costs for a typical small to medium enterprise as being &euro;1,374 in the first year with an ongoing annual cost of &euro;1,054 in subsequent years.  That was based on estimates made in 2017 and with inflation the true cost may now be higher.  This is an issue that I have probed myself to try to understand the costs that are involved in setting up these channels and maintaining them.   <\/p> <p>  Implementing the requirements is not a simple matter of printing a generic policy document and posting it on a wall in an office.  The directive and the Bill are clear that internal channels must be designed, established and operated in a secure manner that protects the confidentiality of the reporting person and the information they have reported.  In practical terms, this will require firms to appoint and train dedicated staff to operate these channels.  It will require the deployment of dedicated, separate and secure channels such as mail boxes, encrypted emails or webforms and dedicated phone lines and voice messaging systems.  All of these will impose costs on organisations.  Blanket imposition of the requirement to have internal channels to all employers would therefore be disproportionate, particularly given the impact of the pandemic and Brexit on the SME sector in Ireland as well as the pressures they are facing from very high inflation, and unworkable in many situations, particularly for micro enterprises.<\/p> <p>  It is hard to see what benefit there is in imposing these elaborate requirements on very small local retailers such as the local sweet shop or on a plumber and his apprentice.  It could also create a compliance burden for some voluntary or member-led organisations with a small cohort of employees, particularly in the areas of sport, such as GAA clubs, golf clubs, rugby clubs and heritage and the arts.<\/p> <p>  Furthermore, article 8.7 of the directive provides that member states can only lower the threshold of 50 employees if they carry out a risk assessment and notify the European Commission accordingly.  The directive sets the floor at 50.  It is open to the member state to go below that but it would require the carrying out of a risk assessment.  This has not been done and, therefore, I cannot accept this amendment.<\/p> <p>  Section 8, by way of the insertion of a new subsection, provides for a regulation-making power to lower or remove the threshold for certain firms or categories of firms subject to a risk assessment and a public consultation.  Therefore, there is an enabling provision within the Bill that would empower the Minister to bring in a regulation that lowers the threshold.  I accept that there are some sectors involved in certain high-risk activities, as the Deputies have raised, which could benefit from being subject to this requirement.  Indeed, the directive and the Bill already provide that the threshold does not apply in the areas of financial services, aviation safety and oil and gas safety, for example, and, of course, there has never been a threshold in the public sector.  It only applies in the private sector.<\/p> <p>  A number of submissions from regulators during the public consultation on the general scheme of the Bill identified other areas where there may be benefits in lowering or abolishing the threshold.  For example, ComReg suggested that operators of premium rate phone lines should be put within the scope of this requirement.  A number of suggestions were also made at the pre-legislative scrutiny hearings regarding certain accountancy firms and some technology firms.  We recognise there may be some merit in that and that is why we have provided the enabling provision in the Bill that is before the committee today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#C00300","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I understand the Minister's perspective on this and where he is coming from.

This was a key issue raised in the course of pre-legislative discussion and it also was raised by many speakers on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  I gave a commitment to look further into the issue.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 5 provides that where persons who are employed in a public body have made a protected disclosure prior to this Bill coming into force, they shall be entitled to request feedback from their employer as to what action was taken on foot of their report.  This implements recommendation No. 27 of the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report.  Following discussions with the Attorney General, we have concluded that it will be possible to provide for retrospective application of the Bill for workers who have reported prior to this legislation's enactment but have suffered retaliation after enactment.  As I said, this is in line with the recommendation in the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report.  In addition, I have asked the Attorney General to see whether we can go further in this regard, particularly to consider whether retrospection might be possible for workers who have both reported and suffered penalisation before this Bill is enacted but have not yet applied to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, or the courts for protection.  This is a particularly difficult legal question and the Attorney General has asked for more time to consider its implications.<\/p><p>Accordingly, I have decided to defer proposals for amendments in this regard to Report Stage in order that we have the opportunity to examine and discuss the full suite of possible enhancements that can be made to the legislation.  As I said, I am committed to providing for retrospection for workers who have reported before enactment but suffered penalisation after enactment, which is what the committee sought in its pre-legislative scrutiny recommendations.  In addition, I am anxious to go further than that.  The delay in bringing forward amendments, which we will do on Report Stage, is to see whether we can, in fact, go further than the committee has recommended.  I have no doubt we will discuss this issue further on Report Stage.  I want to ensure we can stretch the boundaries of what is possible in regard to the retrospective application of this Bill to persons who have made disclosures, who may well have suffered detriment and penalisation and who are not satisfied with the outcome of the process in which they may have been involved.  It is a complex area and retrospective application of legislation is always difficult.  I have conveyed my view to the Attorney General that this is a very important issue on which I would like to make progress.  He is going to do all he can to see whether that is possible and, for that purpose, he has asked for time.  I expect to bring forward additional amendments on the retrospective application issue on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#D00300","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Taking on board the views of all the people who have contacted us, we all can be in agreement that it is extremely important that the legislation be retrospective.<\/p><p>We know from the discussions we have had here and, as I mentioned, the harrowing stories people have, how important it is for this to be retrospective and how much people have lost as a result of doing work in the interest of the public good.

There is a significant issue here.  I do not know how the Minister will get around it legally but effort has to be made by all concerned to recognise the problem we now have.  There are cases currently going through a settlement process in which a certain amount of bullying and intimidation is being applied to get an outcome.  The protected disclosure element is not being recognised by Departments.  These are Departments that are supposed to be leading in terms of legislation and the application of law.  That is quite frightening because it is the State allowing this to happen and paying the legal fees to allow it to happen.  That is wrong.  It is an abuse of power and taxpayers' money.<\/p> <p>  There are cases that have been before various Departments for years.  I refer to the episode of \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" to be broadcast tonight.  Some cases have been with that Department for a considerable time but have not been resolved.  They are all being dealt with internally.  That is wrong.  I will be looking to the next step the Minister will take to determine how all those cases will be dealt with.  They have been stalled not by the whistleblowers but by the State itself using taxpayers' money to achieve the outcome it wants and to block in a very considerable way the whistleblowers and the advancing of the cases being made by those whistleblowers.  That is frightening.<\/p> <p>  The Minister heads up the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.   The committee previously asked how many cases have been settled and for how much by the various Departments that ended up on the steps of the courthouse.  We asked how many of those cases had a confidentiality clause forced on the whistleblower in the context of a settlement.  That is a significant piece of information that I would like to see as we go to the next Stage of analysing this legislation.  I would also like to know how many Ministers, not just in the current Government but also in previous Governments, received protected disclosures but sat on them.  How many Departments have not processed within the legal framework a protected disclosure?  The Committee of Public Accounts recently received correspondence regarding a whistleblower and named the whistleblower.  That is against the law and the legislation.<\/p> <p>  As a State, we seem to be presiding over an abuse of the current legislation and of taxpayers' money.  Departments seem to be sitting on cases and refusing to move on them for reasons not known to anyone.  The best trick in the book is to say to anyone inquiring about a whistleblower and the outcome of the case that it is being referred to the Garda.  There are cases in respect of which that statement was made in defence of the status of the case but the response of the Garda was that no case had been referred to it.  I do not think that is good enough.  The Minister and the Government have to take note of what is happening here.  We have to get to the bottom of the issues that all present have raised in the Chamber, at committee meetings and so on.  While this legislation may provide for the future, the manner in which the Minister addresses the retrospective nature of this is what we will be judged on because those people who made protected disclosures have been beaten up by the State and their lives have been ruined.  They have been named here.  They have come before the committee.  There have been cases where the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, has made a recommendation but the Department continues to try to defend itself with taxpayers' money.  How sick is that?  How wrong is it?  When it comes to this particular debate, I certainly will contribute more fully.  We have named names here.  I will not do so again today.  I ask the Minister to check with the various Departments on the questions I have raised and provide some sort of answers as we debate this on next Stage of the Bill.  <\/p> <p>  As regards the cases that remain to be dealt with, I am not saying all of them will be successful but I am saying to give them a chance.  These people are not making things up.  It may not be a sound piece of evidence that is being received but most of the whistleblowers I have encountered have come forward in good faith to try to improve the lot of the agency, Department or whatever it might be and they have been treated disgracefully by the State.

I will revert to it on Report Stage and add to it.<\/p> <p>  The amendment before us is a retrospective provision.  It is a start but it does not capture all the retrospective issues and the examples the Chairman and colleagues have raised.  I know that for many people, this is the kernel of the Bill.  It is about the ability to apply the additional protections retrospectively to people who have already suffered detriment.  These are whistleblowers who have done the State immeasurable service.  I am anxious to go as far as we possibly can within the legal limits to accommodate that.<\/p><p>That is the political commitment I am giving.  The Chairman asked that every effort be made.  I assure him that every effort is being made and will be made until this Bill has completed its journey to make it as robust as we can.<\/p><p> The amendment we are discussing provides that where a person who is employed in a public body has made a protected disclosure prior to this Bill coming into force, they shall be entitled to request feedback from their employer as to what action has been taken on foot of their report.  That was the specific recommendation in the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report.   We will be able to go further.  We have agreed with the Attorney General that it will be possible to provide for retrospective application of the Bill for workers who have reported prior to the enactment of the legislation but have suffered retaliation after enactment.  This is in line with the committee's recommendation in the report.  We hope to go further than that.<\/p><p> I have asked the Attorney General to look at retrospection for workers who have both reported a protected disclosure before the Bill is enacted and suffered penalisation, but have not yet applied to the WRC or the courts for protection.  I think many people find themselves in that category.  If they have applied and are in a process with the WRC or have a case before the courts, the Bill will not step in the way of that because they are advanced in the process.  This lines up with the example the Chairman gave a while ago.  If any new penalisation takes place, even if it relates to an old case, somebody is entitled to make a new protected disclosure.  The content of what they are disclosing should be different and new so that it is not the same as the one made under the old legislation.  If any new penalisation is taking place, for example in the resolution of their case, that could constitute a basis for a new protected disclosure that would come fully within the ambit of the new legislation once enacted.<\/p><p> We are teasing out all those issues with the Attorney General at the moment.  The amendment is a starting point and it establishes that there would be retrospection in certain instances.  We are looking to stretch that as far as we can in line with the issues that the Chairman and Deputies Farrell and Buckley, in particular, have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#E00400","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1647993600,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1647993600,"counter":42,"content":"<p>Section 8, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1647993600,"counter":43,"content":"<p>SECTION 9<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":44,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 6, 7, 16 and 17 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#F00500","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 6:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 15, to delete line 7.  <\/blockquote> <p>These are technical amendments to delete the titles of sections 6A and 7A.

Again, my experience, even in the previous D&aacute;il, was one where people who came to me with protected disclosures did so as a last case scenario.  It was very difficult to get a reply from a Minister with responsibility in whatever was the relevant field concerning the protected disclosure.  I remember raising such an issue on the floor of the previous D&aacute;il and being told that it was a protected disclosure and what could the Minister do about it.  Those were the words of a former Taoiseach in the House.  I refer to my experience of the way whistleblowers are treated as well.  The biggest worry here, and Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell is right about this, is that the process is strung out for so long.  The financial pain is bad enough, but the mental torture and what happens to these whistleblowers is nothing short of degrading.  I suppose that is the word I will use, and that is being very polite.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned in the last section about going as far as is possible and getting additional protections.  This Bill, as we said from the outset, should be the strongest and the best that can be produced for the people doing this for the public right.  I raised a scenario with the Minister before regarding a situation where a whistleblower or whistleblowers come forward, a protected disclosure is made and the procedure is followed all the way to the top.  Apparently, regarding the issues raised, and here is the crux of this matter, there is no procedure, as it stands, to guarantee that the whistleblower or whistleblowers are being protected while the investigation is ongoing.  There is also no mechanism to truly find out if the issues reported have been resolved.  There is no corridor of inquiry there in that regard.  More important, sometimes misinformation is received back to say that the issues raised have been resolved, when additional protected disclosures state that the original complaint still stands and that the response given was misinformation.  <\/p> <p>  It is important to recognise that anything that weakens this legislation will be dangerous.  It is our responsibility to keep the Bill as strong as we can and to protect these people.  I say that because I would guess that most of us in the House have protected disclosures on our desks as it is.  They are not going to go away.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#G00200","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter.  The issue we are trying to address here is that the system currently does not work as intended.  We are trying to address that situation.  We are not preventing people from reporting concerns to a Minister.  In line with accepted best practice and in the spirit of the directive, we are merely requiring that a report should be made either to the person's employer or to a prescribed person first.  There are exceptions for emergencies or if the head of the public body concerned is directly complicit in the alleged wrongdoing.<\/p> <p>  For example, if an official in my Department at a level below that of Secretary General had concerns about the Secretary General, that person could come to me under the Bill as proposed.  That is absolutely fit and proper.  Otherwise, such concerns should come up through the line.  I think it is fair to say that the operation of the ministerial channel has been one of the most challenging areas of the implementation of the Act currently.  The intent behind the provision of a ministerial channel under the Act was to ensure that in the event of a public body failing to deal properly with an internal report, a worker in that public body would have the fallback option of reporting to the Minister.  In practice, there has been a tendency for reporting persons to either go to the Minister first or report simultaneously to their employer and the Minister.  <\/p> <p>  This practice of simultaneous or near-simultaneous reporting through different channels was raised as a concern by the Disclosures Tribunal, which recommended that the Oireachtas consider amending the legislation, so that when a report is made, the initial recipient is afforded a reasonable amount of time to act before the reporting person moves on to an alternative channel.  Additionally, Article 7 of the directive requires member states to encourage reporting internally in the first instance.  The introduction of a requirement that the reporting person should report using one of the other channels first is intended to address this issue, which is provided for within the directive.  We believe that allowing the Minister to refer disclosures to an independent expert - who will, as the members are aware, be the protected disclosures commissioner we are proposing to establish under the auspices of this Bill &ndash; with the requisite powers to take appropriate action as required, will deal with many of these issues and lead to protected disclosures being addressed in a more professional manner and to better outcomes, particularly for whistleblowers who report, and should appropriately be reporting, to the Minister.  <\/p> <p>  It may well be the case that the protected disclosures commissioner, having considered a protected disclosure that has been referred to him or her, will send that complaint to the Minister.  That is one possible outcome.  What we do not want to happen is a situation where there is a lack of clarity as to who exactly is responsible for dealing with a protected disclosure.  Often, a disclosure can go to multiple parties, including the Minister.  Therefore, a clear process must be in place regarding what happens when a protected disclosure comes in and who deals with it.  Equally, if such a disclosure does come into the Minister, it should be clear how the Minister should deal with it.  That is what we are seeking to address in the provisions of this Bill.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#G00300","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":91,"content":"<p>To touch on that aspect again, I understand what the Minister is saying.

There seems, however, to be a gap in respect of when the procedural process is followed all the way to the top and the issues have not been addressed.  My problem is that if it is a governmental body or one paid for by public moneys that is responsible for seeing whether issues in protected disclosures have actually been dealt with, and the organisations concerned may not be fully truthful, what body or person then investigates?  Is that the type of situation where the procedure would be for a person to go to the relevant Minister to report the situation if he or she is not happy with the outcome?

Yet I know from the whistleblower that those issues have not been resolved.  Where does the avenue of procedural correction lie in that case?  That is where my concerns lie.

We learn so much about how such things happened, why they happened and so on.  This is a great forum to articulate cases and remedies in the context of such cases to see if we can get that into law.  That is what I am trying to do here.<\/p> <p>  To go back to the last question posed and to link it to this one, let us take the example of what happens in a situation where a whistleblower has made the disclosure to the appropriate person and is then encouraged by the person to formalise the disclosure.  As the process proceeds over the years and is not dealt with, the matter then enters the legal realm.  That is what happens.  The agency concerned, and that could be the Department of Education, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, or whatever body, then circles the wagons and God help the poor unfortunate concerned when that happens.  The battle starts then and the degrading of the individual, which Deputy Buckley referred to, and the questioning of the integrity of that individual.<\/p><p>Then ill-health comes into it and all sorts of things happen.  In the course of this, the person decides he or she has not had any remedy, satisfaction or feedback as to whether the agency or entity being complained about has investigated the issues the person raised and that he or she is just simply being stonewalled.  This has happened.<\/p><p> Then, in later years, the person makes a submission, and Deputy Buckley gave an example, to the Minister.  The public sees the Minister as being the powerful individual over the entity concerned.  A person makes a report and protected disclosure to a Minister but nothing happens.  It then goes from the Minister back to the governing entity and then back to the entity the whistleblower is involved in or working for.  The outcome is a broken person who is not compensated fully and who has been bullied through the system to try to get a resolution and get it off the table.  There is no account as to whether the issues that were raised were dealt with.  To this day there are whistleblowers in this category.  They are waiting for it to be resolved.<\/p><p> The EU directive states that beyond an explicit prohibition of retaliation provided in law, it is crucial that reporting persons who suffer retaliation have access to legal remedies and compensation.  Unless they are willing to pay a fortune and run against the State they do not have access to legal remedies.  This is part of the problem.  The compensation is always something that will be disputed by the entity about which the complaint has been made.  These are existing cases I am speaking about.  The directive states the appropriate remedy in each case should be determined by the type of retaliation suffered and that the damage caused in such cases should be compensated in full according to the national law.  It states the appropriate remedy could take the form of action for reinstatement in the event of dismissal, transfer or demotion or of withholding of training or promotion.  If a protected disclosure causes a person on a combined salary of &euro;150,000 to &euro;200,000 a year to be out sick that person loses all of this salary.<\/p><p> At the end of years and years of battling with the State agency or Department, the remedy does not in any way equate to the problems created for the person who made the protected disclosure in the first place.  Neither does it address the issues.  Nobody will tell the whistleblowers they were right or wrong or whatever.  It is just a battle against the legal team.  Only one case, which is from the private sector, ever ended up in court with regard to the legislation on protected disclosures because it costs too much to do it.  As we discuss the Bill we are risking throwing all of those individuals in the system under the bus because the system refuses to deal with it.  Somebody has to call a halt to this and insist that every Minister who ever took a protected disclosure from anyone should deal with it.  I do not want to open the coffers of the State to all of these people but they should be judged and there should be an outcome.  The EU directive mentions restoration of cancelled permit, licence or contract and compensation for actual and future losses, past wages and future loss of income, costs linked to a change of occupation, compensation for other economic damage such as legal expenses and costs of medical treatment and for intangible damage such as pain and suffering.  None of this is happening.  It is shocking.<\/p><p> As legislators we watch how legislation is created and passed in the D&aacute;il and the arguments we all have on either side of the debate.  Then we see it being abused.  It is just wrong.  There are cases like this and I am asking the Minister to look at them and inform himself on how people are being blackguarded and do something about it.  I have read from the EU directive and I can tell the Minister I do not know many agencies in the State that are abiding by that law.  This is why we will have an argument down the line about this.  I do not think any legislation, and this legislation in particular, should be passed without addressing what we have already in the system and without addressing the abuse being heaped on these people on a daily basis.  This abuse has nothing to do with the protected disclosure, by the way.  It is an abuse of power by the legal teams in the State on either side.  We have to ask ourselves why no case has been taken to the courts.  What is going on?  I can tell the Minister there are broken people watching us debating this and they are looking for an outcome.  Some of the outcomes being suggested to them are farcical and wrong and we have to address them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#G00700","speaker":"1496","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":96,"content":"<p>What the Chair has said is not without foundation.  We have all dealt with situations similar in nature to those that have been described.  There are two sides to it.  A <i>prima facie <\/i>case should be established so that people cannot unilaterally decide to blacken somebody's name or reputation.  We need to be careful about this.  However, there are situations that come to our attention as elected Members of the Houses and our only response is to raise it in the House and we should do so.  It is the only place we get the privilege to do so.  On the other hand there are cases where there is already in existence a body that is appropriate to deal with the situation.<\/p><p>I can think of a particular case where the House would not deal with something because it was more appropriate for another body to deal with it.  It cost the State an awful lot more because the case went to court and the individual won.  The cost was immeasurably greater than it would have been if the issue had been answered in the first instance.  There will be others I have no doubt about it.  I remember being involved in arguments with the people concerned and saying they should settle it quickly, acknowledge it and deal with it and do whatever had to be done.  This was not done.  I got lectures about the law and all sorts about what consequences were.  That was all nonsense.  In the long and the short of it, when the court made its decision and rightly so, the cost to the State was much greater than was anticipated at the beginning.  Somebody was doing something wrong.<\/p><p>There are such situations that come up from time to time.  The only way Members of the Oireachtas can deal with them is to table a parliamentary question.  If the question is not answered it means perhaps that behind the scenes the relevant Department said that it did not want to answer the question and it was none of its business.

I fully understand and appreciate that many people are watching this debate.  They are looking at it through the lens of their own experiences which, in many instances, have not been good and they want to see a way forward provided through this legislation.  They expect the committee and the Oireachtas to bring about improvements.  That is exactly what we seek to do.<\/p> <p>  One of the main changes that will be introduced as a result of the enactment of this Bill is feedback and an outcome.  Under the existing Act, one makes a disclosure and does not have a legal right to an outcome.  One does not have a legal right to know how exactly it has been dealt with or to get any feedback.  That will be quite explicit in this Bill, which is a very important reform and a major step forward.<\/p> <p>  On the question of the ministerial channel and the related issues we have been teasing out, it cannot be considered in isolation from the role of the protected disclosures commissioner.  Let us call it the protected disclosures commissioner's office.  That office will be there to assist whistleblowers.  Whistleblowers will be able to contact the office to seek advice as to who is the appropriate prescribed person to refer a protected disclosure to.<\/p> <p>  It can be very difficult.  There are currently approximately 100 prescribed persons under the legislation.  If somebody at work sees something that he or she believes is very wrong and does not know where to turn, once this Bill is enacted, there will be a protected disclosures commissioner's office the person can contact.  The office will advise and guide the person as to who is the most appropriate prescribed person for that disclosure to be referred to.  That point is important and worth making.<\/p> <p>  In situations, which will be rare given there is a very large number of prescribed persons, in which the office cannot identify who the appropriate person is, it can deal with the protected disclosure, follow through and come to an ultimate determination in respect of it.  That is a very important change which will be made by this Bill once it is enacted, it is hoped, in the weeks and months ahead.<\/p> <p>  What we seek to do in respect of the ministerial channel is to make sure there is a proper process.  In reality, what will happen when a Minister receives a protected disclosure under the new regime, once the Bill is enacted, is it will be referred to the protected disclosures commissioner to assess who is the most appropriate prescribed person to deal with that disclosure.  It could well be the case that the most appropriate person is the Minister, in which case it will be referred back to him or her.  The Minister will then inherit all of the obligations under the new Act to consider, provide feedback and, ultimately, to come to a view as to the outcome of that protected disclosure.  Those points are important for context.<\/p> <p>  This is not in any way an effort to diminish the rights of people.  It actually strengthens them for all of those reasons.  They will now have a right to an outcome and feedback.  They have a right to have their case dealt with by somebody, be it a prescribed or suitable person designated by the commissioner or indeed the commissioner.  That represents significant progress for whistleblowers who, at present, operate in an environment which is not what it should be.<\/p> <p>  The Act was of its time.  It was groundbreaking for its time but it has been in operation for seven or eight years and we have seen its shortcomings.  We are using the opportunity of the transposition of this directive to try to improve it.  We are improving it, including in the treatment of the ministerial channel that is proposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#J00200","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"vote","time":1647993600,"counter":100,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 3; N\u00edl, 6.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p><\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#J00300","aye":["1522","1462","1579"],"nay":["1584","1626","1459","1496","1521","1473"],"abs":[]},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 23 to 27, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.

This reflects a number of concerns raised with the Department since the Bill was published that this provision was too restrictive and could impede effective investigation of wrongdoing.  The key purpose behind this amendment is to ensure that the legislation does not in any way stand in the way of a prescribed person or the commissioner from taking such actions as they see fit to address the wrongdoing reported.  There have been issues with the duty to protect the identity of the reporting person.  The amendments that have been made to section 16 of the principal Act and the various provisions setting out conditions under which a report may be transmitted to a more suitable competent authority go a long way to addressing that.<\/p><p>I do not want to repeat the same mistakes as regards confidentiality that in the past led to some employers and prescribed persons being paralysed by the confidentiality provisions in the legislation as regards the actions they could take to address the wrongdoing reported.  This amendment provides the necessary clarification in this regard. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#K06800","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":169,"content":"<p>We support the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#L00200","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1647993600,"counter":170,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1647993600,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Section 17, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1647993600,"counter":172,"content":"<p>SECTION 18<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":173,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 51 and 52 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#L00600","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 51:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 47, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(7) Any processing of personal data pursuant to this Act, including the exchange or transmission of personal data by prescribed persons, the Commissioner and any suitable persons, shall be carried out in accordance with applicable data protection law.<br \/><br \/>(8) Personal data which are manifestly not relevant for the handling of a specific report shall not be collected or, if accidentally collected, shall be deleted without undue delay.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote> <p>This provides for an amendment to section 16A requiring that, where reports are transmitted by the commissioner or prescribed persons, this be done in a secure manner compliant with data protection law.

There is something very strange in people being penalised and given a difficult time for doing something that is in the public interest rather than in their own interest.  There are a lot of positives in this Bill.  We will discuss further amendments on Report Stage on things the Minister discussed earlier.  My main point is that we owe a debt of gratitude to those who have blown the whistle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#L05200","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I echo what Deputy Farrell said and thank the Minister for working on both sides.  I also thank the members.  As has been said many times, the two most difficult things to do in this country are to tell the truth and to help people because you normally get punished for it.  This is important.  Everybody should be proud of what has already been achieved, even though nothing has been achieved.  We must be aware of the people outside here who have been persecuted, battered, beaten down, broken and had accusations made against them, yet still have the courage to stand up and do the right thing.  They have to be commended.  I thank the Minister and Deputy Farrell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#M00100","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I thank members for their co-operation and support of the Bill to date.  We have had a good discussion and that will continue in the D&aacute;il Chamber on Report Stage.  We have work to do on this side of the House on further amendments and so on, which I will say a word on in a moment.  I acknowledge the work of the committee at pre-legislative stage.  It made a difference and we put forward amendments to reflect key recommendations made by the committee.  It was a job well done and it strengthened and improved the Bill.<\/p> <p>  I echo the sentiment of the Chairman and other colleagues about the debt of gratitude we owe as a society to whistleblowers.  Words are easy but they want tangible action from Government and the system to support and vindicate them.  That is not to say every whistleblower is correct in respect of every allegation made.  Nobody is saying that, but where disclosures are made, there needs to be a clear and transparent process, an outcome and reasons for that outcome.  Instances of penalisation where people are punished for making a disclosure need to be dealt with strongly.  I am keen that we make progress in that space.<\/p> <p>  I will table amendments on Report Stage to give further retrospective application to the Bill.  There are a number of other areas where I am considering bringing amendments on Report Stage.  One area raised in the pre-legislative scrutiny report concerned the time limits for making complaints to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  I am looking into the issue with the WRC, the T&aacute;naiste's Department and the Attorney General and may make proposals on it on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  I understand the HSE has sent the committee the reports on the interaction between the Protected Disclosures Act and the Health Acts.  My Department has also been furnished with a copy of this report, which it had not seen before.  My officials are examining it and I will consider if any Report Stage amendments in this regard are needed.   It may be more proper for the Minister for Health to bring such proposals, depending on which legislation needs to be changed.  We will consider that in the next week or two.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of areas of sectoral legislation where amendments on Report Stage may be required to clarify the relationship with this Bill.  My officials are in discussion with the Attorney General and the Departments involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#M00200","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I wish to be associated with other speakers on the Bill.  The important things for a complainant are that there is a conclusion and outcome, that the complaint is investigated and that whether it is right or wrong is clarified in the course of it.  The wall of silence is not acceptable.  It is an old-fashioned idea that if you avoid it long enough, it will go away by itself.  A wrong does not go away by itself or with help.  The proposed legislation will deal with this in a meaningful way.  It will be an important contribution to labour law and law in general.  The important things are that the public can rely on it, realise they have done their job in so far as they can and it is up to somebody else to deal with it now, and that they see it being dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022032300002#M00300","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1647993600,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I extend to the Minister and his officials the thanks of the committee for the manner in which they engaged on the Bill.
