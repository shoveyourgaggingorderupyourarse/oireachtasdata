As a consequence of the US Measures, there was an increased risk of steel originally destined for the US market being diverted to the EU market and thereby distorting or severely disturbing the EU steel market. To address this risk, the EU introduced Steel Safeguards Measures in 2018 and these Measures have been continued following a review of the Measures in June 2021. The decision to continue the Measures for a minimum period of 2 years was based on a Commission-led review of the need for such Measures undertaken at the request of several Member States and which was conducted in the first half of 2021.  <\/p>  <p>  The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU has also had an impact on the market as the UK is now treated as a third country and it has been provided with its own set of Tariff Rate Quotas as part of the EU's Safeguard Measures.  <\/p>  <p>  The current Safeguard Measures allow for the importation of steel from 3rd Countries by way of quotas, determined in line with traditional volumes of trade in steel, before the Safeguard tariff is applied.  Thus, traditional trade flows should not be impacted<\/p>  <p>  On 31st October, in a positive sign of improved EU-US relations, the United States announced that from 1st January 2022, it would establish a quota-based system on exports of EU steel and aluminium into the US in place of the 2018 tariffs on all such imports. This system would allow all EU Member States to export steel and aluminium products to the US - within traditional trade volumes - without attracting the additional 25% tariff. The volume of EU steel and aluminium exports affected by this new arrangement is approximately 4.4 million metric tonnes and this US decision will remove tariffs on $5.5 billion of EU steel and $1.2 billion of EU aluminium exports. These exports would have otherwise continued to be subject to duties.  In response, the EU has suspended its rebalancing countermeasures against the US that were imposed in 2018. These joint actions are welcomed but are considered to be incremental steps in finding a permanent solution to the issue of trade in steel and aluminium between the EU and US. In that regard, I note that Irish industries impacted by the tariffs imposed on both sides of the Atlantic have welcomed the development and that they can now recommence traditional trade relations without the punitive 25% tariff being applied.  However, we are all aware the a permanent resolution still needs to be worked on and the EU and US are committed to such endeavours.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, in light of the changes made by the US, the EU Commission has recognised that its Safeguard Measures may need to be recalibrated to take into account changed internal market dynamics due to the potential of increased volumes of EU steel and aluminium products being exported to the US and the availability of EU produced steel for local users and importers. However, it is important to note that the US arrangement only applies to EU exports of steel and aluminium. Exports to the US from other third countries remain subject to the US \"Section 232\" tariff measures. <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the Commission will undertake a review of its Safeguard Measures in early 2022 which will include an analysis of the impact of the new US and EU arrangements on EU exports of steel and projections on future EU production capacity and user demands across Member States. This review process will be open to submissions from users and importers in order to better inform the Commission's decision-making process.<\/p>  <p>  Since applying the original Safeguard Measures in 2018, the European Commission has completed 3 reviews of the Measures, with the most recent review published in June 2021. The findings of that most recent review included details on the availability of quotas across the product categories impacted by the Measures.  The Commission's review found that during the first three years of application of the Measures (July 2018 &ndash; May 2021), there have been consistent and increasing free-of-duty TRQ volumes available at the end of each period in nearly all product categories. For example, in year-3 of the measures up to 20 May 2021, 36% of the available TRQs in steel remained unused, some 11 million tonnes. Thus, the data available indicated that the application of the EU's Safeguard Measures does not affect the availability of supply, as quotas, under which imports do not attract the Safeguard Measures' tariff, are not exhausted before the end of a given period. While it is acknowledged that many sectors of the Irish economy are experiencing price pressures as the global economy emerges from the economic impact of COVID-19 and the slow return of pre-pandemic levels of manufacturing production - as well as the new dispensation with the UK post-Brexit - the EU&rsquo;s Safeguard Measures are not considered to be a principal cause of either supply availability or price increases.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to note that the current measures in place include a 3% year-on-year liberalisation rate which means that the available TRQs increase each year by 3% from the benchmark period of 2015-2017. Therefore, TRQs for the periods 2021\/22 and 2022\/23 will match the level of imports recorded in 2018 - a noted high watermark for trade in steel. <\/p>  <p>  In designing the Measures, the European Commission has sought to ensure full compliance with the safeguard rules provided for under the World Trade Organisation and the Commission has reassured industry and Member States that it continues to monitor the situation for both producers, users and importers to limit any negative impact of the application of the Measures.<\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department continue to engage with Irish industry and representative groups on the matter and liaise closely with EU officials regarding the operation of the safeguard measures to ensure that they continue to meet their objective in guarding EU steel producers from the harmful impact of trade diversion of steel while at the same time ensuring that the EU market stays open to fair and sustainable competition where EU importers can secure supply at competitive prices.  As always, steel sourced within the EU is not subject to any such tariffs as part of the Single Market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500060#WRB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Services Card","counter":42,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500060#WRB02600"},{"type":"question","counter":43,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[62393\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500060#WRB02700","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"when the mandatory requirement for a public services card to access public services other than that of the Department of Social Protection will be removed in view of the settlement between the Data Protection Commission and the State; if he intends to introduce legislation to make public services cards mandatory for accessing non-welfare services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":44,"content":"<p>Matters relating to the Public Services Card fall under the remit of the Department of Social Protection.

By 2025, Ireland must ensure the separate collection of 77% of plastic beverage bottles placed on the market (by weight), rising to 90% by 2029. In the case of aluminium, Ireland currently surpasses the EU recycling target, achieving 54% for 2019 which places Ireland as a frontrunner towards the attainment of EU aluminium packaging recycling targets. The over-riding objective is to ensure that all packaging placed on the Irish market is reusable or recyclable in an economically viable way by 2030 and these measures, contained in our Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy, are set with a view to achieving optimum results in the area of all packaging materials. My officials will engage with the approved body, when appointed, to ensure the appropriate reporting mechanisms are put in place for the scheme, when introduced. <\/p>  <p>  In working towards the introduction of a deposit return scheme, my Department established a sub-group\u00a0of the Waste Advisory Group with representatives from the beverage producers, retailers, environmental NGOs and the waste sector.

These targets represent a very significant increase in both the volume and depth of retrofit activity in Ireland.   Research and analysis carried out on the cost of retrofitting to inform the new Retrofit Plan\u00a0was aligned\u00a0with the targets to upgrade homes to a BER B2\u00a0and the installation of heat pumps. The work required and associated cost of bringing a home to\u00a0a BER B2 is determined by a number of factors including: the size and type of home; wall type; as well the age and starting condition of the home.\u00a0 Estimates compiled for the Department indicate that the cost to retrofit the fabric of a house to a B2 and install a heat pump can range between &euro;14,000 and &euro;66,000.<\/p>  <p>  The National Retrofit Plan is designed to address barriers to retrofit across four key areas: driving demand and activity; financing and funding; supply chain, skills and standards; and governance. <\/p>  <p>  SEAI grant schemes will continue to be a central element of the Government&rsquo;s strategy to encourage homeowners to retrofit their homes and\u00a0a new National Retrofit Scheme will be launched early next year.

These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end users. <\/p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 3 December 2021, 424 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs.

The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. My Department is reviewing the Scheme at present to ensure that it is as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort and which will support installation of public chargers particularly in areas without own driveway.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the national charging infrastructure strategy, due for publication early next year, will consider this issue in particular and develop proposals to address the current disparity between homeowners with and without off street parking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500061#WRC03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pensions","counter":115,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500061#WRC03300"},{"type":"question","counter":116,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[62019\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500061#WRC03400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of progress of the updated pension scheme for Dublin Bus drivers; if there are reasons for the delay in implementation; and if he will provide a specific timeline for when the new scheme will come into effect.","asker":"1468","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":117,"content":"<p>The CI&Eacute; Group has two pension schemes, namely the Regular Wages Scheme (&quot;RWS&quot;) and 1951 superannuation scheme (&quot;1951 Scheme&quot;), and issues in relation to CI&Eacute; pension schemes are primarily a matter for the trustees of the schemes, the CI&Eacute; Group and their employees.<\/p><p>  In relation to the RWS, CI&Eacute; has prepared and submitted draft Statutory Instruments (SIs) to give effect to the proposed changes to the scheme.

EWSS provides a subsidy to qualifying employers, based on the number of qualifying employees on the payroll. <\/p>  <p>  As an economy-wide support, the EWSS has played a central role in supporting businesses, encouraging employment and helping to maintain the link between employers and employees since July 2020. As of 9 December 2021, payments of approximately &euro;5.73 billion and PRSI credit of over &euro;902 million have been granted to 51,700 employers in respect of some 696,900 workers.<\/p>  <p>  The EWSS legislation provides that for employers to be eligible for the EWSS, they must be able to demonstrate that their business will experience a 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders for the calendar year 2021 compared to the calendar year 2019 and that this disruption to normal business is caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.   I would also draw attention to the fact that, despite the exit from most public health restrictions during the summer, the eligibility criteria was not tightened in the Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021 which was enacted in the summer and which extended the scheme beyond end-June 2021. In fact, the reference period to which the metric must be applied was broadened out in the above Act to span a full year thus effectively relaxing the conditionality to qualify to benefit from the scheme in most cases.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, for most businesses, eligibility is determined by comparing the actual turnover or level of customer orders of the business for the calendar year 2021 with the turnover or level of customer orders of the business for the calendar year 2019. Many businesses were fully closed or limited in their capacity to trade due to the public health restrictions in place for the earlier months of 2021. This change in the EWSS assessment period meant that such businesses could generate the equivalent of up to 70% of their calendar year 2019 turnover or customer orders for the remainder of 2021 and still remain eligible to claim support under the scheme.  <\/p>  <p>   To address the specific question regarding businesses that have expanded, so they are operating at over 70%, such businesses would not be eligible for EWSS as their turnover exceeds the threshold for EWSS support. The EWSS scheme is calibrated in such a way to ensure that support is available for those businesses that are most adversely impacted by the pandemic. The eligibility requirement of a 30% reduction in turnover has been a key feature of the scheme since its introduction and I have no current plans to alter this criterion.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputies will be aware, as part of my Budget Day announcement I outlined that the EWSS will remain in place in a graduated form until 30 April 2022 and that there will be no changes to the eligibility review period. While the scheme will be closed to new employers from 1 January 2022, eligible employers who are availing of EWSS at 31 December 2021 will continue to be supported by the scheme, if they so choose, until 30   April 2022.   <\/p>  <p>  As announced on 9 December last, arrangements are being made to extend the enhanced rates of EWSS for the months of December 2021 and January 2022 to give certainty to businesses when they need it most and to help to maintain employer\/employee links.  This matter is scheduled to return to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann later today for approval as part of the Finance Bill 2021 process.  From 1 February 2022, the original two-rate structure of &euro;203 per week and &euro;151.50 per week will apply; for March and April 2022 the flat rate subsidy of &euro;100 per week will apply and the scheme will end on 30 April 2022.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the deliberations associated with this most recent change, consideration was given to amending the reference period so that all businesses would have to demonstrate eligibility for EWSS in the period January to April 2022 by way of a 30% decrease in turnover compared with the same period in 2019.  However, for a number of reasons, including the fact that such a change could have the effect of excluding certain businesses who, in line with my Budget Day announcement, might have otherwise expected to be eligible for EWSS and who have planned accordingly, such an approach was not proceeded with.

The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to Covid restrictions as set out in the relevant legislation. <\/p>  <p>  To qualify under the scheme a business must, under specific terms of the Covid restrictions, be required to either prohibit or significantly restrict, customers from accessing their business premises to acquire goods or services, with the result that the business either has to temporarily close or to operate at a significantly reduced level. For the purposes of CRSS, a qualifying &ldquo;business premises&rdquo; is a building or other similar fixed physical structure in which a business activity is ordinarily carried on.<\/p>  <p>  The CRSS applies to businesses carrying on trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, which requires the business to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises and as a result, is operating at less than 25% of turnover in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  It is not sufficient that the trade of a business has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19.  The scheme only applies where, as a direct result of the specific terms of the Government restrictions, the business is required to either prohibit or significantly restrict access to its business premises. <\/p>  <p>  The cash payment is 10% of the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 up to &euro;20,000 and 5% thereafter, subject to a maximum weekly payment of &euro;5,000, for each week that the business is affected by the Covid restrictions. <\/p>  <p>  With the easing of Covid restrictions in recent months many businesses are no longer significantly restricted from operating and therefore are no longer eligible for the CRSS. However, eligible businesses have been able to claim enhanced restart week payments to assist them with the costs of reopening.   A total of &euro;704m has been paid out under the CRSS in respect of 25,500 premises.<\/p>  <p>  The public health restrictions currently in force, require nightclubs and discotheques to remain closed until 9 January 2022 and they will be eligible to receive the CRSS until then.<\/p>  <p>  Under the relevant legislation, the CRSS was due to end on 31 December 2021 but is now being extended to the end of January 2022. Provision is also being made to allow the Minister to extend the CRSS up to 30 April 2022 by Ministerial order if deemed necessary. <\/p>  <p>  Following the agreement of Government on 3 December 2021,   my Department and Revenue sought to develop a proposal to modify the CRSS to provide for a supplementary subsidy (in addition to EWSS) for businesses which are subject to the latest restrictions on operating.  The objective of the modified scheme was to provide targeted, timely and sector-specific support to supplement the reduced EWSS payments to the sector.  <\/p>  <p>  However, on further consideration and analysis of the data on CRSS, it proved to be administratively complex to design such a scheme and it would not be possible to have it operational ahead of Christmas as was hoped.  The proposed modifications which included a change to both the turnover threshold and the  rate, as well as consideration of a higher  weekly cap, had the potential to significantly increase the cost of the scheme, particularly in the context of uncertainly around the trajectory of Covid-19 and the impact of the  Omicron variant.  <\/p>  <p>  Therefore a decision was taken that a restoration of the higher EWSS rate was a relatively more efficient and effective way to support businesses in the immediate term. The CRSS will remain in place to support businesses who are required to close or significantly restrict customers from accessing their business premises, and who meet the qualifying criteria.  <\/p>  <p>  I propose to introduce amendments to the Finance Bill 2021 to give effect to these changes in the Seanad this week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500062#WRD01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs","counter":160,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500062#WRD01900"},{"type":"question","counter":161,"qnumday":57,"qnumall":"[62071\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500062#WRD02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if consideration will be given to extending the trans-Border worker&rsquo;s relief post-January 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1605","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":162,"content":"<p>Trans-Border Workers&rsquo; Relief may apply in the case of an individual resident in the State but who commutes to his or her place of work outside the State.

There is an exception in respect of merely incidental duties which may be performed in the State.<\/p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the operation of this relieving measure is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. Revenue understands that due to COVID-19, certain individuals whose duties of employment are normally performed outside the State, may be required to work from home in the State, which would result in them being ineligible for relief under Section 825A TCA 1997.  In recognition of this, on 23 March 2020, Revenue issued updated guidance on the COVID-19 hub of its website and notified by eBrief No. 046\/20, to provide for a concession in respect of this relief as follows - &ldquo;<i>where employees are required to work from home in the State due to COVID-19, such days spent working at home in the State will not preclude an individual from being entitled to claim this relief, provided all other conditions of the relief are met. For example, the employment income must be fully subject to non-refundable foreign tax<\/i>.&rdquo; This concession initially applied in respect of the 2020 tax year and was later extended (on 21 December 2020) to the 2021 tax year.<\/p><p>Revenue continues to regularly review all COVID-19 related matters and, provided all other conditions of the relief are met, Revenue&rsquo;s temporary concession will be further extended into 2022, for the period that public health measures require employees to work from home.<\/p><p>The COVID-19 concessional treatment is only relevant to those individuals whose employment enables them to perform their duties from home.  Certain service type employments requiring in-person attendance at the workplace would not fall into this category and as such, these individuals would presumably not seek to claim the concession, as they would already qualify for the relief.<\/p><p>Further guidance on the relief and the extension of the concession in 2022 may be found in Tax and Duty Manual www.revenue.ie\/en\/tax-professionals\/tdm\/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax\/part-34\/index.aspx - Transborder Workers&rsquo; Relief.<\/p><p>I am aware that there have been calls to place this concessional treatment on a statutory footing so that individuals who are resident in the State but work outside the State for a non-resident employer can continue to avail of the relief if they exercise their duties of employment in the State. <\/p><p>During the debates on Finance Bill 2020, I undertook that this matter would be examined as part of the work of the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) for 2021. The resultant paper was discussed by the TSG as part of its deliberations on 8 September last.  The examination encompassed very detailed consideration of all relevant matters including the equity of treatment between Irish residents who pay tax in the State, the competitive position of Irish employers and the established principles of international tax. The review identified a number of significant concerns from a policy perspective when having regard to the interest of the wider body of taxpayers encompassing Irish resident employees and employers. The full TSG paper (TSG Paper 21\/04) can be located here  - www.gov.ie\/en\/collection\/d6bc7-budget-2022-tax-strategy-group-papers\/. <\/p><p>This matter was discussed at both the Committee and Report Stages of Finance Bill 2021 in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and, in fact, it was during the Report Stage debate that I informed the House of Revenue's proposed extension of the temporary concessionary treatment into next year as already mentioned.

The Act enhances the transparency of Ireland's fund vehicles, reduces potential for money laundering and ensures the highest standard of international requirements are applied.

The Government remains fully committed to supporting businesses, employers and employees insofar as is possible at this time.<\/p>  <p>  The objective of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is to support employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the Covid-19 crisis. It is an economy-wide scheme that operates across all sectors.  <\/p>  <p>In money terms, the overall support provided to-date (9th   December) by EWSS is over &euro;6.6 billion comprising direct subsidy payments of almost &euro;5.73 billion and PRSI forgone of &euro;902 million to 51,700 employers in respect of over 696,900 employees.  <\/p>  <p>  The eligibility criteria for EWSS are based on self-assessment principles and the legislation provides that an employer must be able to demonstrate that his or her business will experience a 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders between 1 January and 31 December 2021, by reference to the corresponding period in 2019, as a result of business disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  The Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) applies to businesses carrying on trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, which requires the business to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises and as a result, is operating at less than 25% of turnover in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Subject to meeting the qualifying criteria, a cash payment equivalent to 10% of the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 up to &euro;20,000 and 5% thereafter, is made subject to a maximum weekly payment of &euro;5,000, for each week that the business is affected by the Covid restrictions. A total of &euro;704m has been paid out under the CRSS in respect of 25,500 premises.<\/p>  <p>  Following the agreement of Government on 3 December 2021, my Department and Revenue sought to develop a proposal to modify the  CRSS to provide for a supplementary subsidy for businesses which are subject to the latest restrictions on operating.  The objective of the modified scheme was to provide targeted, timely and sector-specific support to supplement the reduced EWSS payments to the sector.  <\/p>  <p>  However, on further consideration and analysis of the available data, it proved to be administratively complex to design such a scheme and it would not be possible to have it operational ahead of Christmas as was hoped.  The proposed modifications which included a change to both the turnover threshold and the rate, as well as consideration of a higher weekly cap, had the potential to significantly increase the cost of the scheme, particularly in the context of uncertainty around the trajectory of Covid-19 and the impact of the Omicron variant.  <\/p>  <p>  Therefore a decision was taken that a restoration of the higher EWSS rate was a relatively more efficient and effective way to support businesses in the immediate term. The CRSS will remain in place to support businesses who are required to close or significantly restrict customers from accessing their business premises, and who meet the qualifying criteria.  <\/p>  <p>  The enhanced rates of EWSS subsidy will apply for a further two months, December 2021 and January 2022. This will give certainty to businesses when they need it most.  <\/p>  <p>  The CRSS was due to end on 31 December 2021 but has now been extended to the end of January 2022. Provision has also been made to allow the Minister to extend the CRSS up to 30 April 2022 by Ministerial order if deemed necessary.<\/p>  <p>  The Government and I have been clear that there will be no cliff edge to supports for employers, and we are confident that revised rates for the EWSS and the extension of the CRSS will give certainty to businesses when they need it most. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500062#WRD03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Revenue Commissioners","counter":176,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500062#WRD03500"},{"type":"question","counter":177,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[62282\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500062#WRD03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Revenue Commissioners have discontinued all face-to-face interaction with citizens; and, if so, if such a service will be restored.","asker":"1549","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":178,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that its public offices remain closed in accordance with public health advice in respect of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the situation is kept under constant review in line with guidance.<\/p><p>Revenue has also advised me that its telephone helplines remain operational despite the difficulties encountered from the pandemic.

The importance of Irish culture, Irish art and Irish productions as a whole cannot be understated - it contributes to individual and societal well-being, as well as contributing to Ireland's reputation as a country with a rich cultural history and output.<\/p><p>In relation to the timeline for the launch of the pilot the Deputy will appreciate that this is a major policy intervention requiring significant resources to develop a coherent policy and to operationalise.  This work is ongoing and my ambition is to open the scheme for applications early in Q1 2022.  <\/p><p>My Department is holding a stakeholder consultation forum today on the basic income guarantee pilot scheme, to provide stakeholders with the opportunity to engage with the policy development and share their views.  Stakeholder engagement has been central to my Department's response to the pandemic and this forum will ensure that the arts sector, those working in it and the resource bodies and representative organisations are given the opportunity to feed into the policy development for the scheme.<\/p><p>The selection process, application details and rate of payment for recipients of the Basic Income Guarantee pilot scheme will be finalised following the stakeholder engagement, however, I can confirm the following: <\/p><p>- Participation in the scheme will not be based on a means test.<\/p><p>- It will be a non-competitive process, therefore once a person satisfies the eligibility criteria they will be included in a randomised selection process.<\/p><p>Proposals for the parameters of the scheme will be finalised in light of the stakeholder engagement.  <\/p><p>I believe the Basic Income Guarantee pilot scheme will bring new life and support to the Arts and Cultural Sector and I hope it will provide an important legacy for our artists and creatives. In addition to this measure, I also secured continued investment of &euro;130m for the Arts Council in 2022. Combined, these measures will significantly contribute to the development of the arts in Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500063#WRE03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","counter":232,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500063#WRE03200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Provision","counter":231,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500063#WRE03100"},{"type":"question","counter":232,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[62042\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500063#WRE03200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if departmental guidance is provided to local authorities to determine the proportion of their houses that are appropriated into the social housing stock, either through direct build or acquisition, that are four- or five- bedroomed.","asker":"1520","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":233,"content":"<p>Under Housing for All, the Government will deliver 47,600 new build social homes and 3,500 social homes through long-term leasing in the period 2022-2026.<\/p>  <p>  In September, I issued social housing delivery targets to each local authority for the period 2022-2026.

My Department operates a number of funding programmes that assist local authorities to work in partnership with AHBs to construct, purchase and lease new homes and make them available for social housing. One such programme that AHBs progress construction projects through is the Capital Advance Loan Facility (CALF). <\/p>  <p>  CALF funding is capital support provided to AHBs by local authorities to facilitate the funding of construction, acquisition or refurbishment of new social housing units. This loan facility can support up to 30% of the eligible capital cost of the housing project, with the housing units provided to local authorities for social housing use under long-term lease arrangements known as Payment and Availability Agreements. A nominal interest rate of 2% fixed per annum is charged by the local authority on the initial capital amount. Repayments on either the capital or interest are not required during the term of the loan (between 10 and 30 years), although where an AHB chooses to, repayments can be made during the term. At the end of the term, the outstanding capital amount plus the interest accrued, is owed and repayable to the local authority. The local authority issues the CALF monies to the AHB and the local authority, in turn, recoups same from my Department.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the specific project mentioned by the Deputy, I can confirm that the project did receive conditional CALF funding approval in 2018.

The Flood Risk Management Guidelines provide for the incorporation of flood risk identification, assessment and management into the planning process. The requirements of these guidelines apply not only to the  implications of river\/rainstorm flooding, but also to coastal flooding, mainly as result of high tides and storm surge effects. These Ministerial Guidelines were issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. Planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la are required to have regard to the Guidelines in carrying out their functions under the Planning Acts.<\/p><p>In particular, the Flood Risk Management Guidelines require Strategic Food Risk Assessment (SFRA) to be undertaken for statutory plans, such as county development plans and the results of such assessments to be integrated into the approved plan, including consideration of possible coastal flooding. The relevant statutory plan is a critical consideration in the assessment of any planning application.<\/p><p>In the assessment of planning applications, the Flood Risk Management Guidelines provides comprehensive guidance in Section 5 of the document.  It is noted that it is a requirement that &ldquo;any known flood history on or affecting the application site must be declared on the application form&rdquo;<i><\/i>and this is also included in the standard planning application form as set out in Planning and Development Regulations, 2001.<\/p><p>The key considerations regarding the assessment of planning applications are set out in the introduction to section 5 of the Flood Risk Management Guidelines.  These include: <\/p><p>- Planning applications will, where appropriate, need to be accompanied by a detailed flood risk assessment to be considered by planning authorities in determining applications. <\/p><p>- Development within flood risk areas, that would be defined as inappropriate as set out in chapter 3 of the guidelines, but considered to be necessary to meet the objectives of proper planning and sustainable development, will be subject to a &lsquo;Justification Test&rsquo;.<\/p><p>- Most flood-risk issues should be raised within strategic assessments undertaken by local authorities at the plan-making stage. Therefore, as more plans are reviewed and zoning reconsidered, there should be less need for development management processes to require detailed flood risk assessment.<\/p><p>It is a requirement that where applications are made in areas at risk of flooding, that they should be accompanied by a site-specific flood risk assessment, even for uses which are considered appropriate in flood risk zones. <\/p><p>In relation to assessment of a planning application, the Flood Risk Management Guidelines state (Section 5.14), that it should be based &ldquo;principally on the policies and detailed objectives of the development plan, with flood risk considered along with the full range of planning considerations for the application<i>&rdquo;<\/i>.  The Guidelines go on to state that planning authorities &ldquo;should adopt a risk-based sequential and balanced approach that gives priority to development in areas of lowest risk.&rdquo;<\/p><p>I am satisfied that the Flood Risk Management Guidelines provide comprehensive advice on dealing with flood risk in the planning process. Consideration is now being given, in conjunction with the OPW, to update technical advice to take account of revised climate change information. <\/p><p>The assessment of individual planning applications is carried out on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the requirements of the Planning and Development Act 2000, having regard to planning guidance and other relevant factors and are a matter for each planning authority and\/or An Bord Plean&aacute;la to determine as appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500064#WRF01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Homeless Persons Supports","counter":275,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500064#WRF01800"},{"type":"question","counter":276,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[62231\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500064#WRF01900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if there will be a review of the transfer of homeless services from the Department of Social Protection in February 2019 to reflect on the challenges entailed in the transfer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1520","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":277,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[62232\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500064#WRF02000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the person or body that oversees the funding made available to each homeless action team to ensure balanced regional development and equity between regions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1520","askee":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":278,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[62233\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500064#WRF02100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the professional training homeless action team personnel have in order to be able to respond appropriately to vulnerable and at-risk persons who may have complex needs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1520","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":279,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 to 99, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  My Department's role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at a local level.\u00a0Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless services rests with individual housing authorities.

This is essential for our health at home as well in low income countries where the impact of the pandemic is reversing hard won gains and deepening social and economic inequalities.<\/p>  <p>  Currently just over 55% of the global adult population is vaccinated, but this falls to rates as low as 1.3% in some of the world's poorest countries. The COVAX Facility is working to accelerate the distribution of vaccines to low and middle-income countries to address this inequity, and so far, over 610 million doses have been distributed to 144 countries across the globe.<\/p>  <p>  The WHO has set a global vaccination target of 70% by the middle of next year. My Department, with the Department of Health and the HSE, is working to help achieve this target. Recognizing the need for effective health systems if vaccination campaigns are to be successful, since the beginning of the pandemic at least &euro;200 million in Irish Aid funding has been invested in improvements in global health, working with bilateral partners and at the global level, with the WHO, GAVI the Vaccine Alliance and the Global Fund. Ireland is currently on the board of the Global Fund, using this opportunity to ensure continued and effective focus on the need to strengthen health systems.<\/p>  <p>  This year, Irish Aid has given &euro;8.5 million in funding to the COVAX Facility to enable the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines for low and middle-income countries.  This week, the Government approved a decision to donate up to three million vaccines via the COVAX facility in the coming months.  This is in addition to our on-going donation programme which so far has led to the gifting of 1.8 million vaccines. In September, Ireland donated 335,500 vaccine doses to Uganda, along with all of the necessary equipment to support immunisation. At the end of November close to 500,000 of doses were delivered to Nigeria, 122,000 doses were delivered to Indonesia on Saturday, 276,000 doses were delivered to Accra in Ghana on 14 December, and further deliveries to Indonesia, Egypt and other low and middle income countries are expected over the coming weeks. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s contribution is part of a very significant Team Europe contribution to the pandemic response, collectively approaching &euro;3.2 billion in contributions to COVAX alone.

This work will continue next year as required. <\/p><p>Ireland is a committed member of the European Union and during 2021 my Department has been working with our European colleagues to support each other during this time of crisis, and as we rebuild our economies. This year, a new strategy to increase Irish representation in the European Union's Institutions and Agencies, was also launched. All of this work will continue and deepen in 2022 and beyond. <\/p><p>My Department will work to protect the island of Ireland from the worst effects of Brexit, and as the inextricably linked histories of Ireland and Britain enter a new phase, we will foster enhanced links between our States to protect and strengthen our bilateral relations.<\/p><p>  A key priority of Government is the commitment to work with all communities and traditions on the island of Ireland to build consensus around a shared future. This consensus will be underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement and by absolute respect for the principle of consent. <\/p><p>  Membership of the UN is a cornerstone of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and in January this year, we took up our seat on the UN Security Council for the 2021-2022 term. At a time of ever-more complex global threats, only coordinated international action and collaboration will bring about solutions. At the outset, the Government set out three overarching principles for Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the Security Council: building peace, strengthening conflict prevention, and ensuring accountability. Throughout the year, including during our successful presidency of the Council in September, we have been engaging actively across the full Security Council agenda, which includes some 30 country and regional files and 20 thematic files. Ireland has been particularly engaged in work on the humanitarian situation in Syria, the deeply concerning situation in Ethiopia, the JCPOA (Iran nuclear deal), Climate and Security, Women, Peace and Security, and Peacekeeping. We have also held leadership roles on Somalia sanctions and the UN Office in West Africa and the Sahel, and we played an active role in the Council&rsquo;s response to the crisis in Afghanistan, as well as a range of other pressing issues on the Council agenda. <\/p><p>  Delivering first class consular and passport services to our citizens will remain an essential priority. Our global diaspora remain an integral part of the wider Irish family and my Department will continue to work with them in maintaining and deepening this vital relationship. This includes through continued support to Irish communities abroad as they too manage the impact of the pandemic. <\/p><p>  Recognising the significance of the transatlantic relationship between Ireland and the US, which is set out in the US Canada Strategy 2019-2025, we have worked successfully to strengthen our diplomatic, cultural, and economic relationship with the US at all levels in 2021. This will remain a central priority for Government in 2022.  <\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s Overseas Development Assistance programme is an essential element of our overall foreign policy and national presence overseas. The Government is committed to reaching our goal of contributing 0.7% of GNI on overseas development cooperation. In 2021 we have continued efforts to support investment in public health, by way of response to the pandemic. Next year we will continue to provide support for those countries that are poorest and most vulnerable to climate shocks and ensure that climate change is included as a core theme in strategy development where Ireland has a significant development cooperation programme including Small Island Developing States. <\/p><p>  Our Missions abroad are charged, among other things, with promoting Ireland, identifying new markets and opportunities for Irish business, and protecting and supporting Irish citizens. We will continue to implement the Global Ireland Strategy, which includes the commitment to double our global footprint by 2025. In 2021, new Embassies opened in Morocco, the Philippines and Ukraine and a Consulate General in Manchester. New missions provide enhanced capacity to support Irish citizens abroad, as evidenced recently by the repatriation of Irish citizens managed by the newly-arrived team in Rabat. Next year, work will continue to support the opening of a further three consulates in Miami, Lyon and Toronto, as well as an Embassy in Senegal.  <\/p><p>  The implementation of Global Ireland also sees my Department building and utilising other platforms to promote Ireland across the world. For 2021, major achievements included the delivery of a successful Irish pavilion and theme at EXPO2020. Also, amidst considerable limitations to in-person St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day activity, my Department developed and managed an expansive and substantive digital programme. For 2022, we will build on these efforts and deliver a safe and meaningful celebration of St Patrick's Day around the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500064#WRF03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":294,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500064#WRF03700"},{"type":"question","counter":295,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[62269\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500064#WRF03800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will review correspondence from a person (details supplied) in relation to a passport application; if he can assist in getting these documents back; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":296,"content":"<p>With regard to the specific application about which the Deputy has enquired, the Passport Service has contacted the applicant and their documents will be returned as requested. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500064#WRF03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":298,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[62318\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500064#WRF04100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the reason the processing time on a passport is reset on receipt of additional documentation thereby resulting in first-time passport applications or passport express renewal applications taking significantly more than eight weeks; when this new procedure was introduced; if he will review it; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":299,"content":"<p>The processing times for all passport applications are based on current average application turnaround times and apply to passport applications that are fully complete, where all required supporting documentation has been correctly submitted to the Passport Service by the applicant.<\/p>  <p>  Applications can take longer than the average turnaround time if applicants have not provided all of the required documentation to correctly complete their application.

It is also important to note that the Bill provides that the proposed ETA system will not apply to Irish or British citizens and the UK Government has made clear that there will continue to be no immigration checks on the land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. The UK Government has spoken about the requirement coming into effect by 2024, though this timeframe could change.<\/p><p>  Officials in my Department are seeking clarification with the UK Government as to how it is proposed to apply the requirement in Northern Ireland and what changes are intended to be introduced in future immigration rules. As the Deputy is aware, tens of thousands of people, including many non-Irish and non-British nationals living in Ireland, cross the land border every day &ndash; visiting friends and family, going to work, socialising. There are also considerations in terms of supply chains and for tourism on an all-island basis should this proposed legislation impact on any cross-border movements for non-Irish and non-British nationals. <\/p><p>  For our part, the Government has made its position clear that there should be no hard border on the island of Ireland. This legislation remains under consideration within the UK Parliament and we will continue to engage with the UK Government to ensure that our position is clearly heard as this legislation progresses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500064#WRF04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":307,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500064#WRF05000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces","counter":306,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500064#WRF04900"},{"type":"question","counter":307,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[62044\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500064#WRF05000","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if allegations of a recent sexual assault on an Irish soldier at an Irish military overseas United Nations mission involving another Irish soldier have been referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.","asker":"1485","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":308,"content":"<p>The alleged offences are currently under investigation and for this reason, it is not appropriate for me to comment on the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500064#WRF05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":310,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[62045\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500064#WRF05300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"his views on whether innocent military personnel who are rotating with the current Defence Forces detachment in the Lebanon should suffer a form of collective punishment with newly imposed restrictions as a consequence of the actions of a member who allegedly sexually assaulted another soldier after drinking alcohol; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1485","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":311,"content":"<p>The incident referred to in your question is currently under investigation and therefore it would be inappropriate for me to comment.<\/p><p>With regard to the decision to employ a no-alcohol policy, the military authorities have informed me that this decision was made by the General Staff, to replicate a policy that has already been successfully employed in other troop missions overseas. <\/p><p>This decision supports a positive culture and working environment within the Defence Forces and will continue to contribute to promoting the health and well-being of our personnel overseas on peace support operations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500064#WRF05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Policies","counter":312,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500064#WRF05500"},{"type":"question","counter":313,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[62190\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500064#WRF05600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the main policy achievements and initiatives undertaken by his Department during 2021; and his main priorities for 2022.","asker":"1545","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":314,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government contains an ambitious range of commitments concerning the Defence sector that my Department will continue to implement over the lifetime of the Programme.  <\/p><p>During 2021, one of the key commitments was to establish a Commission on the Defence Forces.  On the 15th December 2020, the Government approved terms of reference and the membership of an independent Commission on the Defence Forces.  The work of the Commission will inform the future development of the Defence Forces.  The Department of Defence will continue to support and assist the Commission in their work.<\/p><p>The Defence Organisation has played a significant role in the State's overall response to the Covid 19 pandemic.  The response has involved the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces and Civil Defence, having regard to their specific roles.  The Defence Organisation has participated in a number of official groups such as the High Level Task Force for Covid 19 Vaccination.  In addition to supporting the HSE, the Defence Forces have also provided a broad range of supports to other Departments and Agencies.Provision of this support will continue to remain one of my Department's main priorities for 2022.<\/p><p>Implementation of projects arising from the White Paper on Defence (2015) has continued.  In total, of the initial 95 projects, 47 are now formally completed and closed with an additional four in the closing process.  The review of progress on all projects, taken in Q1 this year, has led to the approval of an updated White Paper Programme Implementation Roadmap.  An additional five<b><\/b>projects were to be initiated during 2021, four of which have commenced with a further one to commence shortly.  I have  also approved the commencement of 15 projects in the period 2022 to 2025.  14 other projects have been deferred, pending recommendations of the Commission on the Defence Forces and the Defence Organisation will interact with the Commission on these issues. <\/p><p>The three year implementation plan for &quot;Civil Defence - Towards 2030&quot; has been approved and is being implemented and other Public Sector Initiatives have been progressed.  In March 2021, my Department entered into a contract for the provision of a new on-line Civil Defence volunteer and equipment management system (VEMS) which will allow more efficient management of around 3,000 Civil Defence volunteers, their training and activities.  It will also assist equipment and vehicle management.  The new VEMS system will 'go-live' in 2022.  <\/p><p>My Department also completed the procurement and introduction of an online Learning Management System for Civil Defence, facilitating blended learning for Civil Defence volunteers nationwide.  In conjunction with Local Authorities and Civil Defence Officers, my Department completed the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council 'Government Validation Framework' and ' Quality Review Framework' for Civil Defence.  The Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC) is an independent statutory body who set the standards for education and training for pre-hospital emergency care in Ireland.<\/p><p>In 2022, my Department will progress the  introduction of a modern aggregated legislative basis for Civil Defence and will also complete the development of, and roll-out the new on-line Civil Defence Volunteer and Equipment Management System. <\/p><p>My Department has progressed a number of activities including recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces, and related HR issues.  Central to this was the continued implementation of the High Level Implementation Plan &ldquo;Strengthening Our Defence Forces&rdquo;.  A range of other recruitment initiatives have been introduced including commissioning from the ranks, the re-entry of former PDF personnel with specific skills and a sea-going service commitment scheme for members of the Naval Service.In addition, a range of direct entry specialist competitions have also been initiated as a further means to fill critical positions.  <\/p><p>An Independent Review will be established to examine the effectiveness of systems, policies and procedures in place in the Defence Forces to deal with incidents of unacceptable behaviour in the workplace.  The Independent Review &lsquo;<i>Dignity and Equality in the workplace, The Defence Forces &ndash; an Independent Review&rsquo; <\/i>will be established in early 2022 and will be undertaken by external and independent experts in the field. The final Report will be brought to Government and all recommendations will be considered in full.  <i><\/i><\/p><p>An organisational capability review of the Department of Defence commenced in 2021.  The Review is being conducted by the Organisational Capability Review team and has involved engagement with Departmental staff and key stakeholders in the policy and operational domains of the Department.  Their report is due to be finalised soon.<\/p><p>The Department of Defence and Defence Forces Strategy Statement 2021-2023 was published in April 2021 and comes at a pivotal time for the Defence Organisation with the establishment of the Commission on the Defence Forces and the Organisational Capability Review of the Department of Defence.  This Strategy Statement will be subject to a mid-term review in 2022.  <\/p><p>In relation to international initiatives, my Department's main focus in early 2021 was Ireland's policy input into negotiations around the establishment of the European Peace Facility (EPF), the new mechanism to finance Common Security and Defence Policy activities.  In addition, my Department is actively engaged in the negotiations on the EU's Strategic Compass which aims to enhance and guide the implementation of the Level of Ambition arising out of the EU's Global Strategy by defining policy orientations and specific goals and objectives in areas such as crisis management, resilience, capability development and partnerships.  In the latter end of 2021, we entered the stage of final negotiations on the draft text of the Strategic Compass, so further policy input will be required by my Department in 2022 prior to its expected adoption in March 2022. <\/p><p>Since taking a seat the UN Security Council at the start of this year, the additional structures put in place between the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Defence and the Defence Forces have worked effectively to achieve great coordination on peacekeeping policy issues.  Notable successes include UNSCR 2594, spearheaded by Ireland, which will make a significant structural difference to the UN's peacekeeping architecture, defining what the transition from peacekeeping to peacebuilding entails, and how it should be managed.  <\/p><p>At the recent UN Peacekeeping Ministerial in Seoul, I announced a concrete package of commitments including new and existing pledges that will work towards the UN Secretary General's Action for Peacekeeping (A4P) initiative and agreed Security Council priorities.<\/p><p>In 2021, my Department and the Defence Forces established a joint (civil-military) Research Technology and Innovation (RTI) unit.  The Unit led engagement with Science Foundation Ireland on a Defence Organisation Innovation Challenge with a total prize fund of &euro;2.3 million.  Following review by an international panel following best academic practice, ten projects have been selected to progress to the initial concept phase.  <\/p><p>In 2022, in addition to the ongoing support of the Defence Innovation Challenge culminating in an award of &euro;1m to the winning project, the RTI unit will focus on the development of an innovation ecosystem, fostering innovation within the Department and Defence Forces, accessing International Funding and promoting R&amp;amp;D Capability Development.<\/p><p>Significant progress has been made during 2021 in updating Defence Force Regulation R5, the regulation pertaining to the Reserve Defence Force.  The updated version is at the last stage of finalisation, and will be sent for Ministerial approval shortly.<\/p><p>The 11<sup>th<\/sup><b><\/b>'Be Winter Ready' public safety campaign was launched in November 2021.  My Department also planned, published and launched the 'Be Summer Ready' public safety<b><\/b>campaign in April 2021.  Under the chairmanship of my Department, the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning prepared and published the Strategic Emergency Management (SEM) Structures and Framework  Guideline Document 1 on National Emergency Coordination Groups, and revised and published SEM Guideline Document 3 - Critical Infrastructure Resilience, Version 2.  My Department also coordinated and led the Irish position negotiating the proposed EU Directive on the resilience of critical entities.  <\/p><p>In 2022, my Department will continue to prioritise and enhance interdepartmental strategic emergency management through capacity building and knowledge sharing and will develop a governance model to meet Ireland's obligations under the proposed EU Critical Entities Resilience Directive.  My Department will review the existing SEM suite of documents to ensure they reflect international best practice for the Irish context and develop a new SEM Guideline Document on National Exercises.  Work will also commence on the 2023 iteration of the National Risk Assessment process.  The National Risk Assessment identifies and assesses the likelihood and impact of key risks facing the State across a broad range of emergencies. It will also form part of the EU-wide risk assessment process. <\/p><p>My Department will continue to implement the rolling 5 year Infrastructure Plan and rolling 5 year Equipment Development Plan for the Defence Forces.  Major equipment projects are being progressed and delivered including the upgrade of the Mowag Armoured Personnel Carriers, PC 12 and C-295 aircraft and the new Mulit Role Vessle (MRV ) for the Naval Service.  Climate action has been integrated into equipment &amp;amp; infrastructure programmes of work and this will continue in 2022.  <\/p><p>In relation to legislation, the Defence (Amendment) Act 2021 was enacted during 2021.  The Act updates provisions in the Defence Acts relating to overseas operations and the enlistment of minors.  It also provides for an enhancement of the role played by the Reserve Defence Force in support of the Permanent Defence Force, including the removal of the absolute prohibition in the Defence Acts on members of the Reserve Defence Force serving overseas.  During 2022, my Department's main priority in relation to legislation will be the enactment of the Defence Forces (Evidence) Bill. <\/p><p>I am satisfied that significant progress is being made in implementing the Government&rsquo;s ambitious programme for Defence and I look forward to ongoing delivery of key commitments and priorities for my Department and the Defence Forces throughout 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500064#WRF05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":317,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500065#WRG00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":316,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500065#WRG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":317,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[62128\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500065#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her views on concerns raised in correspondence (details supplied) with regard to the 2022 leaving certificate examinations; if she will consider the option of predicted grades for this cohort of leaving certificate students in view of the continuing impact of Covid-19; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":318,"content":"<p>The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations.<\/p><p>In view of this I have forwarded your query to the State Examinations Commission for direct reply to you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500065#WRG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":319,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500065#WRG00500"},{"type":"question","counter":320,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[62140\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500065#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will take steps to ensure that a family (details supplied) living in emergency homeless accommodation can access transport in order that they can attend school.","asker":"1460","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":321,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[62141\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500065#WRG00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the steps she has taken and will take to ensure that all children who are living in emergency homeless accommodation have access to school transport.","asker":"1460","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":322,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 113 together.<\/p>  <p>  School Transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department of Education.

The Commission has completed this work and its report was published on the 7th October 2021.  The Commission&rsquo;s Report has unambiguously established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that change is needed.  It is a comprehensive and detailed report that takes account of responses to an extensive consultation process.  The report sets out a wide range of recommendations, including measures to increase Social Insurance Fund (SIF) income.    <\/p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and of future generations of older people, the Government intends to consider the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully.  The report has been referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection and the Commission for Taxation and Welfare for their views.  I will also work with my officials over the coming months to examine each of the recommendations carefully and will consult with colleagues in Government through the Cabinet Committee system.  I intend to bring a recommended response and implementation plan to Government by the end of March 2022.  I think it is important that we complete that work before reaching conclusions.<\/p>  <p>  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.

In addition, the bottom income quintile actually gained, on average, experiencing a rise in income of nearly 2 per cent.  The ESRI found that the PUP and wage subsidy measures were particularly effective in cushioning families at the lower end of the income distribution from losses.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the enormous strain on the national finances caused by the pandemic, I was pleased to be able to secure the largest social welfare package in 14 years in Budget 2022. The Social Protection Budget package is worth &euro;558  million in 2022. Budget measures include:<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;5 increase in the maximum rate of all core weekly payments, e.g., pensioners, widows(ers), loneparents, jobseekers, carers, people with disabilities, and people on employmentprogrammes (e.g. Community Employment, T&uacute;s and the Rural Social Scheme), with proportionate increases for qualified adults (formerly known as adult dependants); <\/p>  <p>  - &euro;3 increase in the Living Alone Allowance from &euro;19 to &euro;22 per week to people with disabilities and people aged 66 and over who are living alone.  This will benefit over 230,000 pensioners, widows\/widowers and people with disabilities;<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;3 increase for qualified child dependants aged 12 and over, bringing the rate to &euro;40 per week;<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;2 increase for qualified child dependants under age 12, bringing the rate to &euro;48 per week; <\/p>  <p>  - Parent&rsquo;s Benefit &ndash; increase from five to seven weeks for parents of children under two years of age.<\/p>  <p>  Most of these are included in the Social Welfare Bill which is proceeding through the Oireachtas this week.  <\/p>  <p>  I was particularly pleased that we were able to establish a protocol with Tusla which ensures that victims of domestic violence are now able to access rent supplement as seamlessly and as quickly as possible. <\/p>  <p>  In fulfilment of a commitment under the Programme for Government, I was glad to be able to introduce a benefit payment for people aged 65 who are no longer engaged in employment or self-employment. A person in receipt of this payment is not required to be available for full-time work or to be genuinely seeking work and they are not be required to sign on the Live Register.  <\/p>  <p>  These are some of the key achievements which my Department, through the enormous efforts of all of its staff, was able to deliver over the past year.<\/p>  <p>  My priority in 2022 is to assist those on PUP and the Live Register back to employment and continue to target resources to those most in need. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500066#WRH00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":380,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500066#WRH00800"},{"type":"question","counter":381,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[62212\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500066#WRH00900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if a person (details supplied) is in receipt of their full entitlement of illness benefit;

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.<\/p>  <p>  The criteria for Fuel Allowance are framed to direct the limited resources available to the Department in as targeted a manner as possible, and so it is focused on long term payments where an applicant satisfies a means test.  People on long term payments are unlikely to have additional resources of their own and are more vulnerable to poverty, including energy poverty.  <\/p>  <p>  Partial Capacity Benefit (PCB) allows people to continue to receive a percentage of their previous payment while in employment.  In addition, the scheme has been designed so there are no restrictions on the number of hours a person in receipt of the payment can work and there are no restrictions on earnings.  It is for this reason it is not a qualifying payment for fuel allowance.<\/p>  <p>  While the Department continues to keep the range of supports available under review, any decision to extend the qualifying criteria for fuel allowance in the manner suggested could only be considered while taking account of the overall budgetary context and the availability of financial resources. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, Exceptional Needs Payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources, and this may include exceptional heating costs.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection commissioned Indecon International Consultants to carry out research into the cost of disability in Ireland.  The Programme for Government commits the Government to use this research into the cost of disability to individuals and families to properly inform the direction of future policy. <\/p>  <p>  This matter is significantly wider than the income support system which is why a whole-of-Government perspective is being taken.  There is not a single typical &lsquo;cost of disability&rsquo;, rather there is a spectrum from low additional costs to extremely high extra costs of disability, depending on the individual circumstances of the person with a disability.  Additional costs of disability go across a number of areas of expenditure including housing; equipment, aids and appliances; mobility, transport and communications; medicines; care and assistance services and additional living expenses.<\/p>  <p>  The Government published the report on 7 December.  The Government has referred the report to the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Steering Group, chaired by Minister of State for Disability Anne Rabbitte T.D., to consider what actions across Government should follow arising from the recommendations contained in the report.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500066#WRH02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":398,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[62259\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500066#WRH02600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will consider including disability allowance and blind pension as qualifying payments for the partial capacity benefit in order to support those with a disability in seeking and gaining employment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":399,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[62260\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500066#WRH02700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will consider changing the eligibility criteria which restrict applications for partial capacity benefit to those who have been on invalidity pension or illness benefit for a minimum of six months; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":400,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 139 and 140 together.<\/p>  <p>  Both the Disability Allowance (DA) and Blind Pension (BP) schemes are age related, means tested social assistance based schemes, which are also subject to a medical assessment and a habitual residence requirement.   Each of these schemes has also been designed to support recipients to avail of opportunities to pursue their own employment ambitions, be that self-employment or insurable employment.  When an individual, in receipt of DA or BP,  commences employment, they can avail of an income disregard of &euro;140 per week. In addition, a 50% taper on earnings between &euro;140 and &euro;350 is also applied, i.e., 50% of earnings in this band are disregarded for the purpose of the means test. Earnings above &euro;350 are assessed at 100% i.e. for every euro earned above &euro;350 a euro reduction is applied.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2022 saw the introduction of measures to further support persons in receipt of DA or BP to enter or return to employment, these included:<\/p>  <p>  - An increase in the earnings threshold above which means is fully assessed - by &euro;25 from &euro;350 to &euro;375 per week - for DA (and BP. This will take effect from June 2022.<\/p>  <p>  - An increase in the general weekly means disregard entry point for Disability Allowance from &euro;2.50 to &euro;7.60. Currently the first &euro;2.50 of weekly means is disregarded for Disability Allowance. The effect of this measure will be to increase the weekly rate of payment by up to &euro;5.10 per week for Disability Allowance recipients who have means. The change also aligns the DA general disregard with that for BP at &euro;7.60 per week.  This will take effect from June 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Illness benefit is a short term scheme, where a person cannot work due to illness - the maximum duration a person can be in receipt of this payment is 624 payment days.  Invalidity Pension is payment made to people who cannot work because of a long-term illness or disability.   Entitlement to these payments is dependent on the individual's social insurance contribution record, as well as satisfying other qualification criteria relevant to the schemes. <\/p>  <p>  The Partial Capacity Benefit (PCB) scheme is designed for people who are in receipt of  Illness Benefit, for at least 26 week, or Invalidity Pension and who have retained some capacity for work and wish to return to or enter employment.  If awarded, PCB will allow them to continue to receive, in addition to their earnings from employment, a percentage of their Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension payment while working.<\/p>  <p>  The personal rate of payment of PCB is based on a medical assessment of a person&rsquo;s restriction regarding their capacity for work and whether the person was in receipt of Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension (i.e. their existing rate of payment).  After the medical assessment, if a person's restriction on their capacity for work is assessed as moderate, severe or profound their payment continues at 50, 75 or 100 per cent of their existing rate, respectively. If assessed as &lsquo;mild&rsquo; they will not qualify for PCB. <\/p>  <p>  The duration a person can be in receipt of PCB is linked to the payment they moved from, subject to a maximum of 156 weeks.   In the case of Illness Benefit, the maximum duration of the payment is 624 payment days (104 weeks) and this applies for PCB (less the 26 weeks required to be eligible for the scheme).  In the case of Invalidity Pension the maximum duration of 156 weeks applies.  <\/p>  <p>  Where a person completes their allowed period on PCB, a new application can be made.  The application must meet all the eligibility criteria including, in the case of persons in receipt of Illness Benefit, the requirement to have completed 26 weeks in receipt of the payment.  <\/p>  <p>  I have no plans at this stage to change the qualifying and eligibility criteria for PCB. The Department regularly reviews its supports and payments schemes to ensure that they continue to meet their objectives.

This rate of pension was based on a yearly average calculation of 14, based on the person&rsquo;s social insurance record of 661 qualifying paid and credited contributions from their date of entry into insurable employment on 15 April 1966 to end-December 2011, the end of the tax year preceding their 66th birthday. <\/p>  <p>  The person concerned requested a review of their contribution record, and additional contributions were awarded.

Pension entitlement is calculated as a percentage of the maximum rate.

As announced on Budget day, 2022 will see a transformative and ground-breaking package of measures introduced to begin to implement the vision set out in the group&rsquo;s report. &euro;78 million is being made available to enable this, including &euro;69 million for a Core Funding stream, equivalent to &euro;207 million in a full year. Core Funding will be introduced from September 2022. <\/p><p>Currently, significant additional investment is being made in the sector through the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which will remain available to the sector until April 2022, with a continued exemption to the turnover rule for employers in the sector. Since August 2020, ELC employers have been entitled to access the EWSS, with an exemption to having to demonstrate the 30% drop in turnover that applies to other sectors.  <\/p><p>Between October 2020 and November 2021 enhanced rate EWSS equalled &euro;34 million, per month, for ELC providers, covering, on average, 80% staff costs or 50% total operating costs. Enhanced rates of EWSS will continue for December 2021 and January 2022. <\/p><p>From 1 February 2022, the original two-rate structure of &euro;203 per week and &euro;151.50 per week will apply; this amounts to &euro;22 million per month for ELC providers, covering, on average, 50% staff costs or 38% total operating costs.<\/p><p>For March and April 2022 the flat rate subsidy of &euro;100 per week will apply and the scheme will end on 30 April 2022; this amounts of &euro;11 million per month in the sector, and will cover, on average, 25% staff costs or 11% total operating costs.  <\/p><p>With the additional costs of play-pods and other public health measures estimated to be no more than &euro;12 million per month, the EWSS at enhanced and standard rates far exceeds what is required by the sector to adhere to public health guidance. EWSS at flat rates is just marginally below this.<\/p><p>A once-off transition fund of up to &euro;37m will operate from May to August 2022, to support providers in the period leading up to the new Core Funding stream, in return for a commitment not to increase fees from September 2021 levels. The sum paid to each service under the Transition Fund will depend on the service&rsquo;s capacity and location, and will reflect opening hours. Information will be available in early 2022 about the exact levels of funding for individual services under the Transition Fund.<\/p><p>Budget 2022 also saw two changes to the NCS which will result in more parents getting more subsidised hours of ELC and SAC, contributing to realising the full vision of the Expert Group.  This will see the NCS universal subsidy extended to all children under 15 benefitting up to 40,000 children and the removal of the practice of deducting hours spent in pre-school or school from the entitlement to NCS subsidised hours, benefiting an estimated 5,000 children from low income families.<\/p><p>Sustainability Funding also continues to be available to providers where there are sustainability difficulties. The Covid-19 Impact Support funding strand is available for both community and private services for eligible ELC and SAC services that require further financial assistance in addition to current support measures available.<\/p><p>The full implementation of the Expert Group's recommendations will be a multi-annual process, with funding likely becoming available on an incremental basis. The introduction of Core Funding and other Budget 2022 measures begin the implementation of the recommendations, substantially increase public funding for ELC and SAC and put in place the conditions to develop a partnership with the sector for the public good. <\/p><p>Material relating to the work of the Expert Group, including <i>Partnership for the Public Good<\/i>, an information webinar and other publications are available on a dedicated website, www.first5fundingmodel.gov.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500066#WRH04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Policies","counter":420,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500066#WRH04800"},{"type":"question","counter":421,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[62189\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500066#WRH04900","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the main policy achievements and initiatives undertaken by his Department during 2021;

The various actions are aligned with the Department's five strategic goals, which are to:<\/p>  <p>  - Tackle crime, enhance national security and transform policing<\/p>  <p>  - Improve access to justice and modernise the courts system<\/p>  <p>  - Strengthen community safety, reduce reoffending, support victims and combat domestic, sexual and gender based violence<\/p>  <p>  - Deliver a fair immigration system for a digital age<\/p>  <p>  - Accelerate innovation, digital transformation and climate action across the justice sector. <\/p>  <p>  The full Justice Plan 2021 is available to view at: www.justice.ie\/en\/JELR\/Department_of_Justice_Action_Plan_2021.pdf\/Files\/Department_of_Justice_Action_Plan_2021.pdf<\/p>  <p>  In line with my commitment to report biannually on progress under the Justice Plan, I published a mid-year report in August this year.

Justice Plan 2022 will be published in the New Year, alongside the end of year progress report on Justice Plan 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, I am pleased to set out for the Deputy some of the key policy and legislative developments and achievements to date in 2021. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has made substantial progress on delivering reforms recommended by the Commission on the Future of Policing, including publication of the landmark General Scheme of the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill. <\/p>  <p>  Further key actions delivered to tackle crime include the publication of the General Scheme of the Hate Crime Bill; the publication of the Hamilton Review and implementation plan to tackle white collar crime; Ireland&rsquo;s successful connection to Schengen Information System (SIS II) leading to an increased number of arrests; and enactment of the Criminal Procedure Act 2021 which will improve efficiencies in the criminal trial process, by introducing preliminary trial hearings. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of improving access to justice, the Peter Kelly Report, Reform of Civil Justice in the State has been published, an implementation group has been established and an implementation plan has been prepared for submission to Government in the coming weeks. <\/p>  <p>  We are also progressing work to reform the family justice system. Last September, I published the General Scheme of the Family Court Bill which will restructure the family justice system to enable jurisdictions in appropriate Courts. Drafting of the Bill is ongoing while we await pre-legislative scrutiny of the General Scheme, with a view to publication of the Bill by the end of February 2022. In parallel, the Family Justice Oversight Group are working to develop a new family justice system.<\/p>  <p>  We have also published the General Scheme of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill which will replace the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board with a new Commission, and established a Judicial Planning Working Group to work on judicial numbers over the medium term.<\/p>  <p>  The General Scheme of the Gambling Regulation Bill was published recently, bringing us closer to the establishment of a Gambling Regulator. <\/p>  <p>  We have introduced strong measures to tackle the cost of insurance, including bringing into operation new personal injuries guidelines and enacting the Perjury Bill to establish a statutory criminal offence for perjury.<\/p>  <p>  Strengthening the safety of all communities is a cross-Government priority. We have established three pilot Local Community Safety Partnerships (in Dublin&rsquo;s North Inner City, Longford and Waterford) which will inform the roll-out of the new Community Safety model nationwide. We have also established an implementation plan and Board to deliver on the recommendations of the Drogheda Scoping Report, to improve community safety and wellbeing in Drogheda.<\/p>  <p>  We are making strides in providing greater supports to victims of crime, and combating domestic, sexual and gender based violence. We are driving implementation of Supporting a Victim&rsquo;s Journey, our plan to implement the recommendations of the O&rsquo;Malley Review.   <\/p>  <p>  We are currently drafting legislation to put the recently published revised National Referral Mechanism for victims of human trafficking on a statutory footing. We have put in place additional practical supports for victims including additional grant supports for relevant NGOs. The Criminal Justice (Smuggling of Persons) Bill was also enacted which strengthens the laws around human trafficking. <\/p>  <p>  We have enacted Coco&rsquo;s Law, the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act, and published draft legislation to strengthen the post-release monitoring and management of sex offenders. <\/p>  <p>  We have established the new statutory parole board and commenced the parole act, which increases the time for those serving life sentences from 7 years to 12 years before they are eligible to be considered for parole.<\/p>  <p>  To support young people and divert them away from crime, a new Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027 was launched and is being implemented; we have established an Anti-Social Behaviour Forum to bring forward proposals to tackle the issue of anti-social behaviour (including subgroups examining the misuse of scramblers and quadbikes, and knife crime) and have published the General Scheme of the Criminal Justice (Exploitation of Children in the Commission of Offences) Bill.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of developments in the immigration area, an end-to-end review of relevant international protection processes by a multi-disciplinary team from my Department has been completed and published. This is part of the work ongoing to reduce processing times for international protection applications.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I recently announced a landmark scheme to regularise the immigration status of thousands of long-term undocumented migrants and their families who are living in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Of course it is important to note that all the above mentioned milestones and achievements are just a snapshot of the substantial programme of work being delivered on by my Department. We continue to work with our agencies and partners across the sector to receive feedback, ensure that the targets set out in the Plan are met and to inform the development of future Justice Plans. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500067#WRJ04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence","counter":475,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500067#WRJ04300"},{"type":"question","counter":476,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[62374\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021121500067#WRJ04400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she has had engagement with organisations (details supplied) or similar agencies to tackle the increase in domestic violence; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1495","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":477,"content":"<p>Tackling domestic abuse and providing supports for victims is a priority for me and for this Government.

The provision of these beds over the past year has been a significant step in addressing the capacity issue in the Mid West. <\/p>  <p>  This included a 24 single-room bed block which functions as dedicated Haematology Oncology Unit, and a temporary 14-bed single room block designated for confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients. These blocks were initiated in May 2020 under the National Action Plan in Response to COVID-19.<\/p>  <p>  This also included the 60-bed modular ward block, which became operational in November 2020 and which was established to provide a rapid build interim solution to begin to address the bed capacity issue at UHL and improve patient flow.

This will include, amongst other work, continued delivery of measures in Our Rural Future policy; further implementation of the measures set out in the 5 year strategy to support the community and voluntary sector in Ireland &lsquo;Sustainable, Inclusive and Empowered Communities, 2019-2024&rsquo;; collaboration with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to equip Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) with the required knowledge and skills for the preparation of their Local Economic and Community Plan (LECP); continued development of the new Islands Policy; funding for the development of a new pilot grant to support workers who wish to relocate to rural Ireland while availing of the opportunities afforded by the national network of remote working hubs; completion of  the nationwide BCP network; publication of the Charities (Amendment) Bill; the development of the Government&rsquo;s new National Outdoor Recreation Strategy; strengthened engagement on climate matters impacting on communities; and continued engagement with stakeholders as the process of agreeing the design of the new LEADER programme with the EU Commission continues. <\/p>  <p>  Over the lifetime of the new National Development Plan my Department&rsquo;s Capital allocation will grow from &euro;169m this year to &euro;192m next year, &euro;196m in 2023, &euro;200m in 2024 and &euro;205m in 2025 with subsequent years to be added on a rolling basis.
