Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides a new statutory basis for the delivery of affordable housing for purchase.  The Act itself contains significant detail on the new arrangements, reducing the extent to which regulations are required.  Insofar as regulations\u00a0are necessary, the most immediate requirement is\u00a0for regulations dealing with the making of schemes of priority by local authorities.  I will be signing regulations dealing with that issue shortly which will allow local authorities to finalise their schemes of priorities by June, as required.  Further regulations and detailed guidance will issue to local authorities in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  The new affordable housing scheme is targeted towards low to middle income first-time buyer households, with incomes of up to &euro;50,000, and &euro;75,000 in the case of single and dual applicant households, respectively.  The priority areas for the operation of the scheme will be influenced by the economic assessments local authorities were asked to carry out on affordability issues in their areas.  The examination\u00a0of assessments submitted will be finalised shortly.  The new scheme will be set in the context of moderating\u00a0growth in house prices and rental levels in the market and will complement other\u00a0key Government\u00a0affordability initiatives.  These include the Rebuilding Ireland\u00a0Home Loan, which has seen 575 loans to a total value of some &euro;107 million drawn down to date, and the Help to Buy scheme, under which there have been nearly 10,000 applications, to a value of some &euro;142 million, approved.<\/p>  <p>  The affordable housing\u00a0scheme will be open to applications as projects are delivered.  In that regard, significant delivery is to be achieved through the &euro;310 million serviced site fund, SSF, under which at least 6,200 affordable homes are to be supported over the next three years.  An initial ten projects have been approved for &euro;43 million of funding under the first call for proposals under the SSF.  A second call will issue shortly and\u00a0the first homes are expected to\u00a0be delivered\u00a0next year.  In addition, some 2,350 affordable homes will be delivered on mainly publicly-owned lands being supported through the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, while 5,600 further homes will benefit from a LIHAF-related cost reduction.  The work of the Land Development Agency will also be of crucial importance in delivering more affordable housing.  The initial portfolio of sites the agency has access to will have the potential, over the short to medium term, to deliver 3,000 affordable homes in line with the Government policy of achieving 30% affordable housing on State lands generally.<\/p>  <p>  In parallel with this, the Dublin local authorities continue to progress a number of other significant housing\u00a0projects on publicly-owned lands, including the redevelopment of\u00a0O'Devaney Gardens and a site at Oscar Traynor Road in Dublin city,\u00a0yielding some 250 affordable homes,\u00a0and 380 cost rental homes to be delivered between\u00a0projects at\u00a0the former St. Michael's Estate in Inchicore and at Enniskerry Road in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  The timing of delivery under these projects is contingent on the completion of planning and procurement in the first instance, but the local authorities are working to achieve delivery as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Poolbeg West strategic development zone, SDZ, the\u00a0planning scheme for the area included provision for approximately 550 affordable homes.  Delivery of these homes was to be arranged by agreement\u00a0between Dublin City Council and\u00a0the landowner and I understand that discussions in this regard, although not yet complete, are at an advanced stage.\u00a0 As Deputies will be aware, there is currently an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in relation to the planning scheme for the SDZ.\u00a0 Progress on development of the site\u00a0is therefore dependent on the timing of the board's decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000004#B01200","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1550659200,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Last year, the ESRI, in conjunction with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, published important research on housing affordability.  While it was found that overall 32% of renters and mortgage holders were having affordability issues, in the bottom 25% of income earners, it was found that 75% of those households were struggling with rent and mortgages.  That demonstrates the scale of the problem.  The research also clearly identified that this was not a recent phenomenon but something in place since approximately 2002, the date to which the research dated.  We need to hear as well when these units will be delivered.  For example, could we start to have annual targets, as we already have with social housing, for cost rental and affordable purchase?  Could that also be broken down by local authority?<\/p>  <p>  We need to start knowing the prices as well.  For instance, we are hearing the price for Enniskerry Road will be 80% of market rent.  That is nowhere close to affordable for the income brackets outlined in the new affordable housing scheme.  The Minister might also clarify another issue I am concerned about.  I welcome the affordable housing scheme the Minister is going to publish.  Will it, however, only deal with purchase and not cost rental?  My understanding is that local authority managers would like some clarity on that matter as well.

I refer to a pipeline similar to what is in place for social housing targets under the Rebuilding Ireland programme.  We are going to do that.  We are going to have targets for local authorities for the delivery of affordable homes to purchase and to rent.  It will draw in the schemes currently in operation.  That is happening now and it is going to be more ambitious than the 29,000 affordable homes currently in the system.<\/p>  <p>  I turn now to cost reduction for renters.  On cost rental we are talking about 15% to 25%, depending on how the scheme has been funded, what land was used, the interest rate at which the finance was secured and other factors that also play a part.  That will be over the lifetime of a person's tenancy, whether that is five, ten, 15 or 20 years.<\/p><p>In our models, the cost reduction with respect the market rent grows to about 40% over time because the market rent continues to increase at market rates while the cost-rental rent does not.

We will work with anyone to deliver a scheme that works, including schemes that have worked in the past but can be improved upon.  I seek a timeframe.  As I said, I will work with the Minister to deliver it and to get this scheme launched this year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000005#C01300","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1550659800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Is Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question similar?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000005#C01400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1550659800,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Perhaps.

First, can the Minister clarify whether the regulations he has been speaking about will cover the cost-rental model, as well as affordable purchase?  I have a genuine concern with the way he is structuring the financing of cost-rental projects.  Because the model involves paying down the loans over 25 or 30 years, the starting rents are simply too high.  Unless people's salaries increase substantially over the first five to ten years of their tenancies, they will not be able to benefit from what the Minister is calling a market price reduction.  It would be much more sensible to extend the use of the capital advance leasing facility, CALF, to approved housing bodies as a soft loan from the Government to supplement the European Investment Bank, EIB, loans.  That would allow the loans to be paid down over a period of 40 or 50 years, which would allow starting rents that would have no relationship with the market but could be genuinely affordable for families with modest incomes according to the Minister's own criteria.  I refer to starting rents somewhere between &euro;700 and &euro;800 per month, instead of what we are going to see; in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, 80% of market rates would mean rents of &euro;1,500 or &euro;1,600, which is not affordable.  There is a facility there already, namely, CALF.  It just needs to be extended to the cost-rental model.  I would strongly welcome annual local authority targets for all the schemes.

This is absolutely not going to work if the rents are not affordable.  We understand that.  At the moment we are doing a lot of financial modelling around the Enniskerry Road site to see what starting rent we can lock in before it grows to a 40% cost reduction over time.  The Deputy is aware of how important the cost-rental model is to me.  It is something I want to see in this country so I am keeping a very close eye on the different schemes we have.<\/p>  <p>  I have the order of priority for access to the scheme.  In the first instance, this relates to affordable purchase.  Once people apply, the first question will be whether the housing is suitable for their needs.  If the applicant is a single person but the houses becoming available are three-bedroom homes, it will not be.  The next criterion will be whether the person has been resident in the housing authority area for the 12 months immediately preceding application.  The next question will be whether a household member is attending an educational facility within a certain distance of the homes concerned, then whether a household member is working within a certain distance of the home concerned.  The next criterion is the date on which the application was made.<\/p>  <p>  That is the current order of priority in the regulations.

The report finds that the combined purchasing activity of property funds, real estate firms and real estate investment trusts accounted for a net 1% of transacted units in 2017.  Ownership of rental properties by large-scale landlords, that is, those who own more than 100 rental units, is also low, accounting for 4.6% of the wider market.<\/p>  <p>  The report acknowledges that the purchasing and ownership activity of such firms can be more pronounced at a local level, particularly in the context of the apartment market.

As Minister, I welcome their much-needed delivery of high-quality, high-density and well-located rental units.<\/p>  <p>  The report highlights that there may be a risk that such firms could scale up over time to develop monopolistic or oligopolistic pricing power.  However, the report also notes that there is currently a diverse range of landlords and property types in the rental market. \u00a0In 2017, approximately 310,000 private rented tenancies were registered with the Residential Tenancies Board,\u00a0RTB, and 86% of landlords owned just one or two rental properties.<\/p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>In fact, 70% owned just one property.

For each property or group of properties, the payment and availability agreement sets out the details of the properties, details in respect of nomination rights of the local authority, the payment that will be made to the AHB, how that payment will be periodically reviewed, how the tenant&rsquo;s rent will be charged in accordance with the relevant differential rent scheme, and the conditions in regard to the maintenance of the properties and the provision of services to tenants.

The level of payment made by the local authority to the AHB varies depending on the type and source of the property, ranging from 80% to 95% of market rent.  The level of 95% is paid in the case of apartments, with the level for other properties usually being 92% or less.

It is a matter for each local authority to set targets for the provision of Traveller accommodation, which they outline in\u00a0their TAPs.  The allocation and recoupment profiles for Traveller accommodation projects can vary across local authorities, given local priorities, circumstances and project timelines as set out in their programmes.\u00a0 The programmes provide a roadmap for local authority investment priorities over the period and form the basis for the allocation of funding from my Department for Traveller accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018 local authorities delivered a total of 107 units of Traveller accommodation.\u00a0 They included 57 refurbishments-extensions, 48 emergency caravans, one group house and one first-time buyer's grant for the purchase of a caravan.  Local authorities are preparing their fifth multi-annual TAPs which will run from 2019 to 2024.\u00a0 I believe the new councils will continue this process in June this year.  The plans will outline details of the\u00a0programmes to be undertaken to\u00a0meet the existing and projected accommodation needs of Travellers in their areas.\u00a0 The TAPs will be prepared by the local authorities in consultation with local Traveller organisations, the local Traveller consultative committees, LTACCs, other relevant community groups and the public in general.\u00a0 They will come into effect from September this year.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the commitment in Rebuilding Ireland, reflecting the disappointing level of overall funding drawn down in recent years, which I agree is unacceptable, and\u00a0having regard to relevant findings in relation to the European social charter referred to, the Housing Agency commissioned a review of funding for Traveller-specific accommodation in 2017.\u00a0 The review had regard to the targets contained in local authority TAPs and the actual\u00a0delivery, the status of accommodation funded and funding provided for accommodation maintenance and other supports.<\/p>  <p>  Following its consideration of the review, the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee recommended that an independent expert group be established to examine and make recommendations on issues regarding Traveller accommodation policy, strategy and implementation.\u00a0 The expert group was established in September 2018.\u00a0 It has been asked to review the effectiveness, implementation and operation of the Housing\u00a0(Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, with a view to examining whether it\u00a0provides a robust legislative basis for meeting current and future accommodation needs of the Traveller community.\u00a0 It has also been asked to\u00a0review other legislation that may impact on the provision and delivery of\u00a0Traveller-specific accommodation, including transient accommodation, which will address a number of the issues raised by the European committee on social rights.\u00a0 I expect the group to provide my Department with a report in April this year.  When we set it up in September or October, I met the group and asked its members to do this work as quickly as they possibly could.  We wanted them to do it within three or four months, but they expressed a preference for a period of six months.  We hope to have the report no later than April in order that we can act on it at that time.

The money is not lost to the housing budget and the Department has proved that it can spend money wisely and get good results.<\/p>  <p>  The only way we have to deal with local authorities is to use existing law.  We can sit down with them and work through specific projects.  I have visited some of the key sites in a couple of counties that are causing difficulty.

This is not about one or two sites, because the Minister of State is absolutely right that there can be two sides to any story, but there is clearly a structural problem here when we have 24 local authorities either not spending or significantly underspending a budget.  That is a structural problem in the system.  I do not accept it is a positive that this money is spent elsewhere.  Traveller homelessness is higher than in any other section of the population.  We are three years and a few months on from the tragic events in Carrickmines where families were living in wholly inappropriate and dangerous conditions.  This budget is not just for new Traveller accommodation, it should also be for upgrades, improvements and fire safety works.  The fact that so many local authorities are not spending or are underspending is a problem.  I am waiting to hear something different that the Government will do this year to ensure the money is spent.

Much of that difficulty is probably with new sites or new accommodation, however.  From what I can see there are certainly plenty of projects that we could refurbish and spend this money on, so we have asked local authorities to look at all existing accommodation that is not up to a satisfactory condition so that this money can be drawn down for those projects.  I am more confident this year that this money will be spent than I would have been last year because we have put a lot more time and effort into doing this.  There is also full engagement from all the stakeholders and we have to recognise that there are responsibilities and rights on all sides here to try to bring this forward.

The refusal of offers can have a serious impact on the efforts by local authorities to manage their social housing letting process effectively and efficiently, lengthening the period ultimately required to complete lettings or relettings and resulting in a loss of essential differential rent revenue for extended periods.<\/p>  <p>  For these reasons, I will soon be proposing to amend the regulations to provide that a household that refuses two reasonable offers in any 12 month period, other than an offer made under the choice based letting procedure, will not receive any further offers from any local authority for a period of five years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000009#G00700","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1550662200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Disgraceful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000009#G00800","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1550662200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>The latter period will not be reckonable subsequently for the purposes of determining the household&rsquo;s relative priority for another social housing tenancy.

I will take one of the administrative areas the Minister is talking about.  My administrative area stretches from Little Bray to Sandyford.  Let us imagine someone has been on the housing list for 15 years, their kids go to school in Shankill and they get offered somewhere in Sandyford.  All their family network, such as their granny who looks after the kids, is in Shankill, and the schools the kids are in are in Shankill.  They are told they are getting an offer of a house in Stepaside or Sandyford.  They say they are desperate for a place but they cannot take that offer because they would have to uproot all their kids, they would not have the family network, they do not have a car and there are no transport links.  This happens all the time.  In many cases, houses are substandard, they are too small and there are real problems but out of desperation local authorities will offer them to people even though they are not suitable for particular families.

There are more than 70,000 people waiting for their home.  These homes are being built now and we want to make sure there are no unnecessary or unreasonable delays for those families to get into their homes.  What we are talking about here are not refusals for legitimate reasons, as the Deputy said.  That is not what we are talking about.  There is great flexibility with the local authorities in terms of working with families and individuals to help them into their social housing homes and in terms of determining what is the best type of home for them.  It is not for legitimate reasons.  It is for reasons that are not seen to be acceptable by the authority which is responsible for helping families into homes and managing that stock of social housing.  We are talking about three areas of choice where people can choose to have their home, and I can provide a detailed map of the geographic size of those areas for the Deputy.  We are talking about a second refusal.  The local authority has offered one house which it deems to be a perfectly good house for that person to move into but that has been refused.  The local authority has then offered a second house which it deems to be perfectly good for that household to move into but that has been refused.  In that instance, based on the feedback I have received from local authorities, they believe that rather than just a 12 month suspension, a five year suspension would be more suitable.  We are not talking about a large number of cases so I do not know why the Deputy is getting so frustrated and concerned about this.  The local authorities deem it necessary to ensure they can more efficiently use their housing stock in the interests of those people who have been waiting too long to get into their homes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000009#G01100","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1550662200,"counter":110,"content":"<p>The Minister is not living in the real world of people who are looking for housing in local authority areas.

By and large, we are talking about families in situations where they do not have their own car and I am not sure about Dublin but in Limerick there certainly are no connecting busses.  They have to get their children to school and there may not be a direct bus.  While I have the greatest of respect for local authority officials, what they might deem to be a fair and legitimate offer may not be practical for the family concerned and it is too inflexible to put people back for five years.  One year can be difficult enough for a family that is in a desperate situation but I genuinely do not believe that people are refusing offers for flimsy reasons.  Maybe there is a very small number who do but certainly when it comes to the people I deal with, generally speaking, if they are refusing an offer of a local authority house, having been on a waiting list for a number of years, they have really genuine reasons for doing so.

They are not going to refuse for spurious reasons.  I urge the Minister to find a way of dealing with this whereby, after two refusals, the local authority must bring the people in and discuss with them why they have not been able to accept the two offers.

There are many examples, which we can all cite from our constituencies, where people turn down offers of accommodation, for example, because they have been offered accommodation outside the catchment area for children who are in schools with special needs, and the local authorities have deemed that to be acceptable.  We have had cases in some local authorities where families with children have been offered one-bedroom accommodation and the local authorities deemed that to be acceptable.  We have had occasions where people have been offered accommodation not only far away from where they currently live but away from public transport networks and vital supports, which is a particular problem for working single mothers who need access to family accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has this wrong.  I have no difficulty if somebody for frivolous reasons rejects two offers and receives a punishment - that is not a problem.  However, there is more to this than the Minister is being told.  I urge him to hold back and to come to committee.  The crucial point is that choice-based letting fixes this problem for the overwhelming majority of offers, yet only 16 local authorities are using that system and many of them are not using it properly.  Rather than punishing families, many of whom in our experience have legitimate reasons for rejecting offers the local authority feels are appropriate, we need to see a different approach.

This was undertaken in association with and supported by Travellers&rsquo; representative groups.  As part of the review process, a working draft of a Guide to Fire Safety in Existing Traveller Accommodation was developed.  The guidance document included fire safety advice and guidance and standards applicable in various types of Traveller accommodation.  Fire safety in domestic settings is a shared responsibility and the guide emphasises an approach to life safety through the prevention of fires, fire safety awareness and early detection and warning of fire through working smoke alarms.  My Department published the report on the programme to review and enhance fire safety in local authority provided Traveller accommodation on 21 September 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The inquest into the tragedy at Carrickmines concluded recently and recommended that the working draft Guide to Fire Safety in Existing Traveller Accommodation be adopted as best practice.  The process of formal approval of the draft document for publication as national guidance is at an advanced stage and expected to be completed at the next scheduled meeting of the management board of the national directorate for fire and emergency management on 28 February 2019.

I have been subject to obfuscation since I first began asking these questions in January.  As a result of that decision, CervicalCheck has an enormous backlog of up to 80,000 people waiting up to 27 weeks to receive reports on their tests, while thousands of women have received letters to tell them to come back in because the tests had expired and proved to be invalid.  We have moved from a situation where tests were provided within four to six weeks to one in which they take between four and six months.  The Minister's decision was the major contributing factor to this unacceptable situation.  Last week, the Committee on Health revealed that the new HPV test has been indefinitely delayed because of the backlog.  We learned from the <i>The Lancet Oncology<\/i>journal today that the new HPV test, combined with an uptake in the vaccine, would have a dramatic impact on the reduction of cervical cancer in this country and beyond, but its introduction has been delayed because of the backlog caused primarily by the Minister's decision last April.<\/p><p>Susan Mitchell wrote in last Sunday's edition of <i>The Sunday Business Post <\/i>that it was her understanding that the CervicalCheck team communicated its opposition to the provision of an additional smear test directly to the Department at a high level in advance of the offer being made.  We now know that Professor Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly, former clinical adviser at CervicalCheck, warned publicly of the inadvisability of this particular move during an interview.  I listened to the Minister's interview last Saturday morning with Brendan O'Connor.  I was taken aback when the Minister chose to launch an attack on the CervicalCheck team, stating that he had lost confidence in the people running CervicalCheck because of decisions on managing the audit, in response to a basic question of whether he had checked with CervicalCheck before making his decision.  The Minister replied that he had not because he had lost confidence in the team over the audit and the communication of the audit.<\/p><p>We now know, however, that the audit decision was shared with the Department of Health.  The CervicalCheck team did not make the decision on its own but rather in conjunction with the Department of Health officials and the chief medical officer.  They were all part of the decision on how to communicate the audit.  Irrespective of one's views on the terms of the decision on the audit, the CervicalCheck team did exceptional work over a decade in building up its programme and saving thousands of lives.  The degree to which the Minister dumped on the team last Saturday morning and attempted to destroy its reputation is unacceptable and mean spirited.  One cannot destroy the reputation and work of people who have committed to the programme for more than a decade.  Many people in the medical world are dismayed at the cavalier dismissal of people who have worked in the field for a considerable time.<\/p><p>Did the CervicalCheck team communicate its opposition to the Minister's decision to someone at a senior level in the Department of Health?  Does the Taoiseach now accept that the decision last May was a wrong decision without any clinical mandate?  When can we expect the new HPV test to be introduced?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000012#K00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1550664000,"counter":163,"content":"<p>All of us in the House will acknowledge and know that cervical cancer is a terrible disease that causes the death of many women and results in life-changing surgery for many others.  We also know that cervical screening works and that the number of women who have cervical cancer has fallen for many years as a result of a successful screening programme and the introduction of the HPV vaccine by the previous Government, of which I was a member.  Our objective over the next couple of years is to make cervical cancer a rare disease and virtually eliminate it in the period ahead.<\/p>  <p>  We will do so in three ways, namely, promoting the uptake of the HPV vaccine by girls; extending the HPV vaccine to boys, as we intend to do this year; and improving cervical screening by moving from the current test to the primary HPV test, which we will do as soon as possible, and we will be among the first countries to do it.  I cannot provide a date for the Deputy and I acknowledge that he has asked the question previously.  The dates I was given in the past by the Department of Health and CervicalCheck were not deliverable and, therefore, I will not commit to a date until I have confidence again that it can be delivered.<\/p>  <p>  The free out-of-cycle smear tests were offered because a large number of women were concerned that their smear tests were wrong.  They sought reassurance from their GPs and the helpline, and a decision was made to offer a repeat smear test out of cycle to give tens of thousands of women who were concerned about the accuracy of their smear tests the reassurance they sought.  It was called for by a number of Opposition Deputies, as the record shows.  When it was decided upon, it was welcomed by some medical bodies, including the National Association of General Practitioners and the Irish Medical Organisation, although it is true that some opposed it and warned of consequences.  I understand from the Minister for Health that the chief medical officer supported the decision to extend the offer.  While it has caused some problems and there is a backlog of slides awaiting analysis, that is due not only to the free tests but also to an increase in attendance for screening, which has continued even though the free out-of-cycle smear tests are no longer on offer and have not been for nearly two months.  While the increased uptake in screening by women is to be welcomed, those two factors have led to a backlog and the HSE is working hard to clear it to return to the previous turnaround time of between four and six weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000012#K00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1550664000,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I asked the Taoiseach whether the CervicalCheck team communicated its opposition to someone at a senior level in the Department of Health in advance of the decision.

Is the Taoiseach comfortable with the Minister's comments in that radio interview?  The Taoiseach has stated he understands that the Minister was supported by the chief medical officer.  We can find no written advice from the chief medical officer, however, and none has been offered.  I tabled a parliamentary question and consulted the Office of the Ceann Comhairle.  There was a consultation with the Department of Health, which replied to me.  Yesterday, I was told that the chief medical officer's advice was reflected in the press release issued by the Minister.  What kind of gobbledegook is that?  Did the chief medical officer recommend the decision or not?  I do not believe that he did; I believe that tracks are being covered.  <\/p>  <p>  We need to learn from the issue.  The spending of &euro;10 million of taxpayers' money, which could be used elsewhere in the health service, on a decision that has damaged the CervicalCheck programme and delayed the introduction of a much-valued, new and better test is something from which we need to learn lessons and which needs to be revealed in its full truth.

This is not the first time this issue has arisen.  Last year, the HSE issued apologies to 49 children in the same region as a result of failings related to paediatric audiology services.  At that time, and now, some of the children affected were left with lifelong impairments as a result of the failings of our health service.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach may have heard the story on \"Morning Ireland\" this morning of 11 year old James from Mayo.  His parents were entirely unaware of his hearing impairment until they received a letter from the HSE in recent weeks apologising for the lack of care.  Six years ago, James was in junior infants and his parents were reassured that his hearing was fine.  He is now in fifth class and in the intervening period, he has had no treatment for his hearing impairment.  We can only begin to imagine the impact that that has had on the child, socially, developmentally and educationally.  It is shocking.  I understand that there is now a look-back review into paediatric audiology services.  This is the second such look-back review.  At this stage, the parents and families in question have received no indication of how long this process will take to complete and, in any event, they have lost faith in it.  They now require an independent inquiry and investigation into this mess.  Will the Taoiseach agree to that?  It is clear that our health services are failing all of us and our children.<\/p>  <p>  Figures provided to my colleague, Teachta Louise O'Reilly, show the disgraceful delays for children in accessing speech and language therapy and occupational therapy.  These waiting lists not only impact on children's lives in the here and now, but they have future implications too.  Some of the worst delays for occupational therapy are in Mayo, where there are 138 children under five who have been waiting for more than a year for basic treatment.  In Cavan-Monaghan, 523 children are on a waiting list.  In Cork, 679 kids over five face delays for care.  The window of opportunity for these therapies is short and the significant delays cause additional problems for children in the future and as adults.  Will the Taoiseach agree to the inquiry as called for by the parents of James and others?  Who is accountable for these waiting lists and delays for our children?  Who is answerable?

It was shared with all 49 affected families in accordance with open disclosure principles.  The report and accompanying documentation sent to families from the HSE included an apology for the failures identified and for the anxiety caused to families and those who may have been affected.  All 49 children who needed a follow-up as a result of the look-back are either receiving or have already received appropriate necessary care.  The HSE has been assisting parents in accessing the necessary health, educational and social protection services, and there has been significant cross-departmental co-operation in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  In December last year, the HSE recalled a further 57 who were identified during the look-back process.  The HSE has indicated that this group had an appropriate audiology assessment and the hearing loss was correctly diagnosed.  However, they were discharged without appropriate follow-up treatment and a management plan.  This group of 57 was not followed up at an earlier stage, as the preliminary risk assessment did not flag them as an area of concern.  The group of 49 was seen as the at-risk group and was recalled as a priority.  The HSE has advised the Department that all those in the additional group of 57, 35 are under 18 and 22 are over 18, and all 57 have been contacted.  To date, 26 have taken up the offer of an appointment.  Some 31 did not attend but are being followed up.  The priority is open disclosure, which is taking place, and making sure that those who need medical care, educational and social protection supports receive them.  We will give an independent inquiry consideration but the priority has to be making sure that affected patients are told and that they receive the medical care and any additional educational and social supports they need.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to other community healthcare areas, only CHO 2 and CHO 5 have had clinical risks identified, requiring a formal look-back review at paediatric cases.

Fianna F&aacute;il is nonetheless happy to allow a Minister and Government to evade accountability for the many failures in our services.  I have raised specific services where children are being let down today and will be let down tomorrow.

It is time for the Government to support small businesses to reinforce the viability of towns for shopping and services.  In that context, it seems incredible that the Minister for Finance is sitting on his hands while a Revenue Commissioners' decision threatens the jobs and livelihoods of those involved in the health food store industry.  Ireland has a range of value added tax, VAT, rates which include the zero rate applied to food.  Historically, Revenue has applied the zero rate of VAT to food supplements, except those associated with sport, slimming and certain cosmetics.  However, it has recently announced a new interpretation of the VAT rules applied to food supplements and that it intends to apply the 23% VAT rate to food supplements from 1 March.  This will happen just four weeks before Brexit for an industry that is already very exposed to the UK market for imports and its supply chain.  How does this represent helping business to prepare for Brexit?  There are 3,600 jobs at stake in the industry.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance has claimed that Revenue only ever allowed basic vitamins, minerals and fish oil products to be subject to the zero VAT rate, but his claim has been contradicted by the previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, who told the D&aacute;il in June 2014: \"A range of food supplements and vitamins that encourage the maintenance of health, through the sustenance derived from a normal, healthy diet, benefit from the zero rate.\"  He then referred to Revenue eBrief 70\/2011 which makes it clear that food supplements associated with sustenance are zero rated for VAT purposes but not those associated with increasing muscle mass or weight reduction.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has advanced a subtle but important change by referring to basic vitamins, minerals and fish oils.  There is a fundamental question of policy.  The Minister has insisted that he cannot interfere with an independent decision of Revenue, but that is not true.  He is the policy maker.  The job of Revenue under law is to implement, not to make, policy.  It is certainly not to change it.  The industry is asking the Government or the Minister to instruct Revenue to halt this interpretation of the new VAT change until a full review has been completed.  That is a very reasonable request to make.  There will be a budget in October and that is the time when we debate tax changes, understand their implications and have democratic oversight of them.  Will the Government undertake to halt the impending change at a most vulnerable time for the industry until the Oireachtas has had a chance to review the matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000014#M00800","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1550665200,"counter":183,"content":"<p>The Deputy is aware that VAT is quite a complicated tax.  It derives not just from the EU VAT directive but also from national legislation.  There are different VAT rates for different foods, for example, fresh foods which are, of course, the healthiest to eat.  There is also a zero VAT rate for oral medicines, but VAT is applied to injectable medicines because there is value added.  VAT is also applied to processed foods.  It is a Revenue interpretation in deciding the appropriate rate to be applied in different circumstances.  It is not a political decision, or a decision of the Government or the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It was not part of the Finance Act 2018 or the budget.  It is a Revenue decision and it is for Revenue to interpret the rules and laws appropriately.

For example, according to the Minister, why are fish oils determined to be basic but not other oils?  Fish oils are a source of Omega 3, a basic nutrient, but flax and other oils which are also a source of Omega 3 are not to be treated in the same way.  They are the oils preferred by vegetarians.

Yesterday the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Chairman of the climate inaction committee yet again held hostage a Bill that was supported overwhelmingly in this House last February.  The Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018 sets out to ban the issuing of further fossil fuel exploration licences off our shores.  It seeks to do so because science has long settled on the understanding that, as people who inhabit the planet, we should leave 80% of known, proven reserves of fossil fuels in the ground.  There is a widespread movement screaming at governments globally to leave them in the ground.  We have seen evidence of this, with young people outside the gates weekly baying at the Government to do something about climate change.  We are to see a global strike of schoolchildren on 15 March.  To cite one very inspiring school student from Sweden, Greta Thunberg: \"I want you to panic.\"  She wants governments to feel the fear young people feel every day of their lives when they wake up because we are stealing their futures, unless we challenge the fossil fuel industry.  The Bill would help to contribute to a global movement, not just in Ireland.  There is no fooling nature.  It understands we are overheating the planet and that we are hurtling towards a global rise in temperature of 2o Celsius.  That is why the Bill proposes radical measures to deal with the issue and this House supported it overwhelmingly for it to move to Second Stage.  In an act of incredible hypocrisy there is procedural trickery taking place at the climate inaction committee.<\/p><p>This trickery is allowing the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, and the Chairman to vote to hold onto that Bill as if it was their little baby, to keep it hostage, and to not allow it to move forward when they already voted for the motion I put yesterday to lay a report before this House and to allow the Bill to proceed to the select committee in order that everybody can come in and amend and change it.  The Bill is about doing something meaningful, courageous and even trailblazing.  When the Taoiseach himself has accused us of being laggards when it comes to climate change, why does he not now use his power and instruct his Minister and the Chairman to let the Bill go and to release it so that we can become a leader in climate action instead of a laggard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000014#M01200","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550665800,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I believe our duty as a Government and as politicians is to make sure that we pass our planet on to our children and grandchildren in a better state than we found it and that means taking action on climate change and protecting the environment.  We have taken a lot of action in recent years.  For example, there is legislation working its way through the House at present to outlaw the use of microbeads and certain plastics.  We passed legislation last year to prevent the Government and Government investment funds from investing in the hydrocarbon industry.  We have taken measures to support renewable energy, to take coal off the grid by the end of the decade and to take peat off the grid.  Other actions under way include the fact that from this summer, all new buses bought by Dublin Bus or Bus &Eacute;ireann in our cities will be low-emission or no-emission vehicles.  We are taking climate action both as an Oireachtas and as a Government.<\/p>  <p>  On this particular issue, the Deputy has it wrong in terms of climate action, energy security and the economy.  The truth is that we will need natural gas and oil as transition fuels for the foreseeable future, whether to fuel aircraft so that they can fly, to produce plastics necessary for medical devices or to power our towns, cities and industries when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining.  Most people who are interested in climate science understand that natural gas is a transitional fuel and that we will need it as part of our energy mix for the foreseeable future if not for decades to come.  The question is therefore, if we have our own natural gas, should we use it or should we import it?  Of course, importing it as opposed to using our own in worse for the environment because the gas we might import from the United States is very often shale gas, which is much more damaging to the environment than our own natural gas from Corrib.  Some of the gas we import from Russia or eastern Europe gets lost along the way, so it is actually worse for the environment to import gas from the US, Russia or Venezuela than to use our own gas.  From a climate science point of view, the Deputy's proposal is wrong-headed.  Second, there is the issue of energy security.

I welcome Donal's wife, Madeleine; our good friend and colleague, Michael; Donal's daughters, Michelle, Madeleine, Suzanne and Louise; and his grandchildren and extended family members who are here.  They are all very welcome to Leinster House this afternoon.  We know that this is a poignant day for them, tinged with bittersweet memories, as they join us in the D&aacute;il Chamber where Donal spent so many years serving his country and the people of his beloved Cork.  As we gather to reflect on Donal's life and political legacy, I hope that the memories shared here in the Chamber will serve to support his family in some small way.  We also pause to remember Donal's daughter, Claire, who passed away a short time before his own death in late 2017.<\/p>  <p>  I did not know Donal personally, but this proud son of Macroom had an electoral record which we experts in this Chamber can only admire.  Serving from 1965 to 1989 was a fine achievement, particularly when constituency reconfigurations created the three-seat constituency of Cork North-West in 1981.  As a Deputy from another competitive three-seater, I salute Donal's enviable achievement.  He served with distinction at many different levels, including local, national and European, and in a number of Ministries of State, as well as in senior positions within the Fine Gael Party.  It must have been a source of great pride for him to see his son, Michael, promoted to the key portfolio of agriculture.  In his 24 years in this Chamber, Donal Creed assisted many people who were experiencing difficulties locally and nationally.  As a hard-working Deputy, he reassured many people and made life better for many of them.  He did this out of a strong sense of public duty.  This public service was clearly supported by a loving family and an enviable political network in Cork North-West.<\/p><p>Today in this Chamber, we salute his contribution to our national Parliament and his family should take comfort in the practical application of honourable patriotism shown by Donal Creed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000015#N03200","speaker":"1371","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550666400,"counter":220,"content":"<p>T&aacute;im bu&iacute;och as an deis seo chun &oacute;m&oacute;s a thabhairt do cheann d&aacute;r mBaill a thug seirbh&iacute;s den ch&eacute;ad scoth sa Teach seo, le 24 bliana.  Ba pholaiteoir iontach &eacute; an iar-Theachta Donal Creed a d&rsquo;oibrigh go dian ar son mhuintir Chorcaigh agus na t&iacute;re, mar Theachta D&aacute;la, mar Aire St&aacute;it, agus mar cheann de na ch&eacute;ad Feisir&iacute; de Pharlaimint na hEorpa.  Mar Aire St&aacute;it, chuir s&eacute; go m&oacute;r agus go suntasach le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; sl&aacute;inte, c&uacute;rsa&iacute; oideachais agus c&uacute;rsa&iacute; chomhsaoil.

If we read what Donal Creed&rsquo;s political opponents said about him, we will find a portrait of a talented, hard working, patriotic politician, who put aside party differences to effect real change for his constituents.  For example, I was struck by something Tom Meaney of Fianna F&aacute;il said about Donal Creed.  Like Donal, Tom was first elected to the D&aacute;il in 1965 for the Cork Mid constituency, and he paid a wonderful tribute to Donal, praising him for his &quot;political brain, his great grasp of affairs&quot; and for his ability to work with opponents to get the best outcome for his constituents.<\/p><p>In Cork, as we all know, the Creed name has a long and proud lineage.  Family members signed the nomination papers for Terence MacSwiney in 1918.  Donal's father, Mick, was a hard-working and respected councillor, and today his son, Michael, continues that proud history of public service as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I remember at Donal's funeral something his daughter, Marcella, said, which has stayed with me ever since.  She said that her father was very proud to have been the driving force behind the establishment of the national lottery, a body that has helped communities all across the country, and that he did do so despite stiff opposition at the time.  He was much more proud of the fact that he had been continuously endorsed by the people of Cork in every election between 1965 and 1989, when he stepped down.  He was proud that the people he cared about so deeply recognised his contribution and rewarded him with their trust and, above all, their votes.<\/p><p>Many in my party remember his kindness in taking new Deputies under his wing, and it was always said that his concern was never for Donal Creed, but for Fine Gael and for Ireland.  His generosity of spirit and party loyalty was always in evidence during an election, when he did everything possible to secure a second seat for Fine Gael in his constituency, first in Cork Mid and later in Cork North-West.  I know his son wants to emulate that task as well.  He also brought the same skills to bear as chair of the parliamentary party.  As we approach European elections, we should recall that Donal was one of our first MEPs, serving with distinction between 1973 and 1977.  He firmly believed that Ireland's future was at the heart of Europe, and that Europe allowed us to escape from the shackles of our past.  As Minister of State in the Departments of Health, Environment and Local Government, and Education, he played a notable role in public life and the national lottery is a remarkable legacy.<\/p><p>Of course, Donal&rsquo;s first love and his true love was farming.  I have heard that after retirement he could often be seen outside with a wheelbarrow and he took a special interest in the new season&rsquo;s potatoes, which he believed were the best anywhere.  A loving family man, in later years he enjoyed spending time with his 25 grandchildren.  I am told he could be found playing in the sandpit with them, or sliding down the bannister, and his wife, Madeleine, could be sometimes heard telling him, &quot;Donal, you are worse than any child.&quot;  That he was &quot;one of nature&rsquo;s gentlemen&quot; is a tribute that was paid on his retirement from public life.  That he was one of Cork&rsquo;s great public figures is the tribute I would like to pay today.  I offer my sympathies and condolences to his wife Madeleine, their children Marcella, Michelle, Madeleine, Suzanne, Louise and Michael, and their grandchildren and extended family.  We also remember their two children who predeceased him, Nuala and Claire.

Without question, he made a very significant contribution to political life in Ireland, building on a strong legacy of public service that was instilled in the Creed family from the earliest days of the Irish State.  In many respects, the D&aacute;il was a home from home for Donal as he served in this House for 24 years.  He contested eight general elections, four in the constituency of Mid Cork and four in Cork North-West.  He was an electoral powerhouse and was successful every time.  He had that capacity to transcend partisan party loyalties, which was evidenced by the wonderful tribute Tom Meaney paid to Donal.<\/p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach said, he was also a pioneering member of Ireland's representation in the European Parliament at the very earliest stages from 1973 to 1977.  He understood early on the centrality of belonging to the then EEC and the European Union to Ireland's future and, in particular, to the well-being of our agrifood industry and farming community.  In many respects, he was a lone Deputy in the Mid Cork constituency but, as the Taoiseach said, when he moved to Cork North-West, Fine Gael was taking two out of three seats there.  The arrival of Deputy Michael Moynihan on the scene changed that; I remember having a role in it at the time.  It is a bit of a bellwether constituency, as we know, and I assure the Taoiseach that we will be keeping a close eye on it in the coming while.<\/p>  <p>  Donal, of course, contested a by-election in 1965 and a general election soon followed that.  On a lighter note, I understand that his first parliamentary question was to ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he would have a letter box erected at Clondrohid creamery, County Cork.  The reply told him that the provision of a letter box at the place in question was not warranted in view of its proximity to the local post office.  Undeterred, Donal Creed came back shortly afterwards asking for two phone boxes.  Having delivered two seats for Fine Gael in Cork North-West, he was made Minister of State in the Department of Health in June 1981.  I remember that period well as I was a student then; it speaks to my commitment to stability in the House in these times.  There were three elections in the space of 18 months.  His stint in health came to an end because of that high degree of political volatility and instability.  However, he did come back in late 1982 and was appointed as Minister of State in the Department of Education with responsibility for sport.  Being a Cork man, that appointment was probably the most natural fit and the most appropriate appointment one could make, given Cork's prowess on the sporting fields.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000016#O00300","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1550666400,"counter":222,"content":"<p>They have great modesty, too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000016#O00400","speaker":"1244"},{"type":"speech","time":1550666400,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I know that Donal took to it with great enthusiasm.

Of course, his key legacy was his work in laying the groundwork for the national lottery, which has had a huge impact in communities throughout the country, particularly sporting communities, in terms of improved facilities.<\/p>  <p>  It is interesting, looking at the issues he raised early on in his political career, that some of them are as pertinent today as they were then.  One of his final contributions in this House was to make the case for the pay and conditions of members of the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>He said, \"We pay tribute to them but it is important that the issue of pay and conditions is resolved.\"  <\/p> <p> Donal was an outstanding family man.

I believe he was reprimanded for sliding down the bannister on occasion, as well as other exploits.  He was a true public servant but he was a gentleman and a very warm person.  While he was a dedicated Fine Gael man, he was popular across the House and was always very approachable and pragmatic.  If he could do something for somebody he would do it.  He helped anyone who approached him.  He was particularly proud that his son, Michael, won the D&aacute;il seat following his retirement, and was more proud again when Michael was appointed as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

I believe Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin made reference to 2,000 grandchildren, which caused a bit of alarm of these benches.  Perhaps he meant two dozen.

He wished for me, on his behalf and on behalf of his mother and family, to let it be known that they will forever be indebted to Donal for assistance that was given to them more than 30 years ago.  That, more than anything, is the mark of not just a great public representative but a great person.  He was accessible and humble, and was a true servant of the people.  <\/p>  <p>  I join with everybody in extending our sympathy and condolences to Madeleine, her family and friends, and of course to our colleague, Michael.

He was elected in 1965 and served until 1989.  In fact, the latter part of his service overlapped with my entering this House; I arrived here in 1987, and I remember Donal well.  I remember the election of his son even more clearly, as well as the contribution Michael has made subsequently.<\/p>  <p>  Before being elected in 1965 Donal unsuccessfully contested a by-election caused some months earlier by the death of the Labour Deputy, Dan Desmond.  In that by-election Eileen Desmond was elected who, remarkably, became only the second woman in modern times to become a Cabinet Minister.  That did not happen all that long ago; remarkable changes have happened in the period since then.<\/p>  <p>  Donal served as one of the nominated Members of the European Parliament in the early days, from 1973 to 1977, at a time when this House selected those who would go.  It was the embryonic stage of a democratic assembly on a cross-European basis.  It was exciting, because it was the antidote to a century of division and war, and is something we should reflect upon in the context of what is happening in Europe now. <\/p>  <p>  Others have mentioned Donal's achievements in this House.  A remarkable job was created for him; he was Minister of State for with responsibility for school buildings and sport between 1982 and 1986.  That would be a great job to have.  One can imagine going around the country opening schools and dealing with sport.  I cannot imagine a greater and more serendipitous combination to have.  As Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin would say, a Cork native would have revelled in that role.  <\/p>  <p>  To be selected as chair of one's parliamentary party is also a unique achievement.  The skill set involved with that, dealing with various factions with various views, entails patience, wisdom, discernment and political judgment.  It involves holding things together, defusing potential rows and making sure that people do not jump overboard.  Delicate balancing is required and Donal's selection by his colleagues to that role bears great testament to that set of skills he obviously had.  <\/p>  <p>  I pay tribute to his son, who picked up the baton and continues to serve with distinction in this House, and to say to Madeleine and the extended Creed family that they can all be very proud of the contribution Donal made to this country and to the constituencies he represented with in Cork.

It is fair to mention two Ps when talking about Donal, namely, potatoes and politics.  I do not know which he would have put in the higher category but everybody who knew of him knew of his love for farming and for vegetables and the great pride he had in potatoes.  He was competitive with other family members and other neighbours on both sides of the border when it came to producing what he classified as the best potatoes that any farmer could grow.  It is important to remember that.  It is always nice to see people who are grounded and down to earth in politics.  Donal certainly was, because he had great interest in what came out of the earth.<\/p>  <p>  On a light-hearted note, every person who wins the lotto can always say, when banking the money, that if it was not for Donal Creed he or she might not have won the money at all.  On a day when someone has received &euro;175 million in the EuroMillions lottery, it should be remembered that there was a man here in Ireland who set up our own lottery.  Charitable organisations have gained much from that.  He was politically very astute and ahead of his time.  It is nice to remember that.  <\/p>  <p>  On a local note, I would like to remember a very sad event for the people of Ireland, particularly those in Cork and Kerry.<\/p><p><i>1 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The Whiddy Island disaster occurred when he was chairman of Cork County Council.

He did so in the very experienced political way that only he could do.  It is nice to remember things like that.<\/p> <p> On behalf of the Rural Independent Group, I acknowledge his political legacy.  He was a person who started out with nothing and progressed to being a good county councillor, Deputy, MEP and Minister of State.  He was able to leave political office after giving such broad service.  I would place as much significance on being a good county councillor as being a good Minister of State.  His son has finished up as a senior Minister sitting at the Cabinet table.  From where he is resting today, he can rest sure in the knowledge that he and his wife Madeleine and their family made an extraordinary contribution to Irish life and Irish politics.  That contribution will never be forgotten and no one can ever take that from any of them.  I think that is a nice thing.  There are 25 grandchildren, and perhaps there will be many more in the years ahead.  They will always remember their granddad and everything he did in a nice and fond way.

These scholarships operated in the US, in particular, and were for basketball, golf and other sports.  He did pioneering work at the time and it has stood the test of time in the sense of people benefitting from it.<\/p>  <p>  While on paper we were political foes, Donal encompassed and gave what was best about Irish politics.  Donal Creed tried every day that he was in politics to advance the case of the people of Cork Mid or Cork North-West to ensure they were better off from his public representation.<\/p>  <p>  While I never served with Donal Creed, I remember a meeting in May 1997 as I was embarking on a canvass of Ballydaly.  I met Donal as we set off for Caherbarnagh.  He said he would go the low road and suggested I go the higher road.  That ended up in a different way for me because I married someone from the high road later on in life.  I remember what he said to me at the foot of the Caherbarnagh Mountain that day.  We were talking about politics and he gave me every encouragement.  While Donal told me it was a difficult life and spoke of the drawbacks of it, he also said to me that there was great achievement in helping our fellow man.  That was exactly the phrase Donal Creed used that day.  I think that is what he wanted to achieve.  He wanted to benefit mankind and to help people.  Everyone who knew Donal Creed would have stories to tell in that light.<\/p>  <p>  His political astuteness, which was rare, has not fallen far from the tree with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed, and the way he conducts his business.

I pay tribute also to the significant role he played on Cork County Council over many years.  Our families would have clashed at election time but would have worked throughout the same community over many years.  While we would have appeared to have been political opponents, there would have always been the same push to make things happen locally.  Donal really pushed the community forwards, and I always heard that when meeting his supporters or opponents.  It would always be said that he was such a gentleman and a person to push things on for the wider Cork Mid and Cork North-West areas.  It is something to be very proud of and something that will always be associated with him.  This would have been in evidence in the clinics as well, where there would have been such a range of colours presenting.  He would never have distinguished one way or the other.  He saw it as his duty to serve whoever came his way and to make every effort.<\/p>  <p>  I would have only occasionally met Donal.  Typically, it would have occurred on the campaigns.  The first time I came across him was during one of my earlier council campaigns.  Mickey Tom and myself were finishing up canvassing on a sunny evening.  We had done what we set out to do in terms of canvassing.  As we were going down a driveway Donal was ahead of us.  There would have been a relaxed atmosphere given the sun and so we stopped for a quick chat.  The quick chat extended into something longer.  Mickey Tom and I knew that we were holding him up and he knew he was holding us up from canvassing.  I am pretty sure he was getting better value from it because he was holding up the candidate and stopping the canvass for the evening.<\/p>  <p>  He was a real gentleman responsible for major achievements.

Cork, like any other part of the country, has many families who have a long history in politics and people who are known as major public figures.  We have the Desmonds, the Barrys and the Coveneys.

I am sure that the Moynihans might dispute that but I am sure that Michael will attempt to reinforce that.  Donal's track record over so many years enforced the strength and popularity he had on the ground with his service on Cork County Council and in the European Parliament.  In the D&aacute;il, his contribution to the national lottery and the various Departments has already been outlined.

I also wish to honour him today because that is what this is really about.  Not many of us in this House can represent constituents for almost a quarter of a century.  That is what Donal Creed did in two different constituencies.  Very few people in this House will have fought eight general elections and won each of them.  Very few of us in this House have the privilege of getting to the very top of local electoral politics, as he did when he was chair of Cork County Council, which believe me one does not achieve unless one is respected across-party as well as within one's own party, as well as having served here for 24 years, and also have been in the European Parliament in what were really the formation years of that parliament.  Not surprisingly, he served on the agriculture committee there.  As ever, he made an insightful contribution to EU political thinking on agricultural, as well as representing Ireland's interests.  He was a Minister of State, in fact, on three occasions, through a very volatile period, as Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin referred to.  I can remember that period as a child, because my own father won a seat, lost a seat, and won a seat again, over the space of three years.  I can remember what that was like in a political family, to deal with such wins and losses.<\/p>  <p>  He was a Minister of State for school buildings and sport, which has been referred to, and at the end of that period managed to get the Government to agree to setting up the national lottery, which was also referred to by a lot of people because it was a significant achievement.  It was not easily done at the time and it took typical Creed steeliness and determination to insist on winning that argument, which he did.  Virtually every town and parish across the country have benefitted from hundreds of millions of euro as a result of this.<\/p>  <p>  He was also Minister of State for housing for a short period of time, and Minister of State for health in 1981, briefly.  These are two pretty tough briefs now, housing and health, but these were no problem at the time to Donal Creed.  He remains a much loved figure across Cork, partly because of the fact that he represented two constituencies at different times, but still, when one canvasses rural parts of Cork, people will talk and tell stories about Donal Creed coming into the farmyard, whether they are Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael people or something else-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000019#R00125","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1550668200,"counter":234,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1550668200,"counter":235,"content":"<p>Okay Sinn F&eacute;in or Labour - given the day that is in it, I did not want to give the others too much recognition.<\/p>  <p>  There are very few people in politics, particularly those in politics for 24 years, who leave politics with absolute respect and who still do not have anybody speaking badly about them.  He was one of those unique figures.  In many ways he was from the politics of a different time.  He was rural, pragmatic but really ambitious for Cork and like all of the Creeds was insightful, really smart and really tough when he needed to be.  That is a trait that we see now in his son, colleague and friend of mine in Cabinet at a tough time for the country, when it comes to agriculture and leadership in that crucial sector for our rural economy and indeed for our economy as a whole.  Donal would be extraordinarily proud of the contribution that Michael is making at a time of potentially great peril for the agricultural industry and family farming across the country, given the links, concerns and vulnerabilities to Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  Like the Taoiseach, I would like to quote Marcella, who spoke about her father at a very sad funeral and at a very sad period for that family, given that seven weeks earlier Claire had passed away in a very untimely way.  She said of her father, first of all that he had a life well-lived.  That is true and is reinforced from all statements here today.  She also said, which really summed him up from everything that I have heard about him, that her father was always at heart a farmer, who loved both the land and nature but also took enormous pride in being elected by the people of Cork North-West to represent them in the D&aacute;il from 1965 to 1989.  In some ways that sums up who he was, which was an incredibly modest man who loved the land, walking the land and cultivating the land, particularly in his retirement with his children and grandchildren.  He was also somebody who, quietly at times but very firmly, made a huge impact on public life.  That is being recognised today. <\/p>  <p>  I say to his family, to Madeleine, of course, but also to Marcella, Michelle, Madeleine, Suzanne and Louise, and of course, to Michael, that they have a lot to be proud of, as indeed does Fine Gael, in the contributions of the Creed family, but in particular of Donal.<\/p>  <p>  There is an interesting political connection with my own family, in fact, because Michelle, Donal's daughter, nominated my father to stand for politics, and the late Claire nominated me at convention as well.

When will people who live in west Cork and who have a disability be able to get a bus to Cork city?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000022#U02200","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speech","time":1550670000,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I cannot give the Deputy a date but recognise that this is a real issue and a point well made.

The relevant emails have been released to us.  Was it only after an awareness of escalating costs emerged in the public sphere that the unit asked for and received updates on cost overruns?  Was there no monitoring or communication in advance of November 2018 on this major health and infrastructural project?

The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection spent &euro;175 million on the rent supplement scheme and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government spent &euro;100 million on long-term leased properties, &euro;143 million on four year rental accommodation scheme leases and &euro;276 million through the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme.  One might argue that this demonstrates the need and demand and is a symptom of the Government's more general failure in the housing area, but spending these very large sums does not represent good value for the taxpayer.  To put it in perspective, the total budget allocation to local authorities to build and buy new homes last year was just over &euro;560 million.  That is almost 20% less than the sum paid to private landlords, which hardly makes sense.<\/p>  <p>  While subsidies for low income households are an important part of any stable housing system, they should be short-term and declining in number and cost.  Instead, the figures highlight the Government's over-reliance on the private rental sector to meet long-term housing need while at the same time underinvesting in social housing.  We should also note the very insecure nature of rental accommodation for people now, due to the Government's negligence.  These policies must be urgently reviewed and a plan must be put in place to reduce the number of subsidised tenancies in the private rental sector.  This will only be achieved through a significant increase in the capital budget for local authorities and approved housing bodies to build and buy permanent social housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000024#W00200","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1550671200,"counter":353,"content":"<p>In the debate later on the motion of no confidence in the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, we will discuss the litany of failures in the area of health.

There was one last Friday and there will be others on 28 February and 1 March.  It would not cost a penny to resolve this, but the Government appears to be totally uninterested.  It is about union recognition and the right of hundreds of ambulance drivers to be in the union of their choice, in this case the National Ambulance Service Representative Association, NASRA, branch of the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA.  Can the Taoiseach explain why he would not wish to act to resolve this by simply accepting people's right to be in a union of their choice and to be recognised in that union in the context of something as critical as the delivery of an ambulance service?<\/p><p>In addition, will the Taoiseach comment on Mr. Owen Keegan's comments in <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>about homeless accommodation acting as a magnet for the homeless?

Over half a million people are waiting for hospital appointments and there are 10,000 homeless people, but the waiting list for special needs assessments is particularly damaging for the children on that list.  We know that early diagnosis can mean more effective early intervention particularly with therapies such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, audiology and speech and language therapy, yet thousands of children are waiting for an early needs assessment and their rights are not being realised.  I raised this in the context of the last budget to get additional posts appointed, but one wonders whether the division in the Taoiseach's Department has alerted him and the Government to the emergency in that area alone.  It is simply unacceptable that parents of young children are at the end of their tethers trying to get an assessment, diagnosis and proper intervention.

However, the monitoring of the capital plan, the national development plan and the implementation and delivery of Project Ireland 2040 is done by both the line Department or agency that is responsible for a project and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which has overall oversight of the delivery of the capital programme.  It is not done by my Department.  We have a system, however, whereby a Department can make me and my office aware of a problem.  That is the early warning system which is carried out at Secretary General or Minister-to-Minister level.  I often receive early warnings of things that may or may not happen through that system, but did not about the children's hospital.<\/p>  <p>  I will have to get an update on the Open Government Partnership for Deputy Howlin.  He was very enthusiastic about it when he was a Minister and we were making progress on it, but I am not up-to-date on it.  When I get the update I will pass it on to him.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's policy on housing is to increase the stock of social housing, and we are doing that.  It is the best way to reduce reliance on rent supplements and HAP into the future.  It has to be scaled up because for a long time very few houses were built by the State.  That is changing.  The figures produced today by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government show that approximately 8,500 new homes were added to the social housing stock last year.  Roughly half of those were built by local authorities and affordable housing bodies such as the Iveagh Trust, Cl&uacute;id Housing Association and so forth.<\/p><p>The other half consisted of voids brought back into use, houses purchased by local authorities or affordable housing bodies and houses that were leased for the long term.  This represents a very considerable increase in the social housing stock.  I do not know when the last time was that the social housing stock was increased by 8,500.  It could be a very long time ago.  Of the 18,000 new houses and apartments built last year, roughly 4,500, or 20%, were built by the State.  Again, I am not sure when the last time was that the State built 20% of the homes in the country but we need to be at that kind of level, going from 18,000 a year up to something closer to 35,000 and increasing our social housing stock by approximately 10,000 homes a year.  Obviously, if the social housing stock is increased by 10,000 homes a year, it will be increased by 100,000 homes in a decade.  This would be a considerable step change in the amount of social housing and public housing we have, and that is what we plan to do.<\/p> <p> In talking about the budget mix, we always need to bear in mind the difference between capital and current.  As a long-term investment, building or purchasing houses and adding them to the social housing stock makes more sense than HAP or rent supplement.  On a very logical and micro basis, however, it must be borne in mind that it may cost &euro;150,000 to build a new home from scratch for a family in need of social housing but that for the same amount of money one could rent ten houses.  For the same amount of money spent in one year, therefore, one could house one family or ten.  When one is faced with huge demand for housing and huge housing need, it often makes more sense to house the ten families rather than the one, even if one takes the 20-year view that it would be cheaper to house the one and not the ten, if that makes any sense.<\/p> <p> Regarding Owen Keegan's comments the other day, I do not believe that anyone chooses to be homeless.  Certainly, I do not think any children are homeless by choice.  There are really two main causes of homelessness, in particular family homelessness: one is family breakdown, which I do not think is a choice; the other is a notice to quit being issued by a landlord who is renovating, moving back into or selling on the property.  Again, that is not a choice made by the tenant in respect of whom the notice to quit has been issued.  Therefore, if there are people who are making themselves homeless to skip the queue or to avail of services, I imagine they are very few and far between and are exceptional cases.  I therefore do not agree with Mr. Keegan's comments.  It was interesting, however, that in the debate that was held there was wide agreement from Owen Keegan to Mike Allen of Focus Ireland that homeless services had improved considerably in Ireland and in Dublin in recent years.  This is happening through the development of the family hub programme.  Hubs are much better for all kinds of reasons than shelter accommodation, bed and breakfast accommodation or hotels.  I refer to the availability of the HAP place-finder, for example, and the additional social and other supports that are provided to people who find themselves homeless.  It was good that while there was disagreement on what Owen Keegan had to say, there was widespread agreement, from NGOs to political parties, that homeless services had improved very considerably in Dublin in recent years.

It really was a consistent approach through the entirety of the leadership of the churches in Ireland and at every stage they pushed a positive agenda of reconciliation and played a very important role as advocates of Border communities.<\/p>  <p>  It is in this context that we must take very seriously their warning about the damage being caused by Brexit and the further damage it threatens.  The political paralysis in the North is a huge concern for them.  Equally, they are deeply concerned about what will happen on the Border in 37 days' time, or whenever Brexit happens, if there is no deal.  Yesterday I asked the Taoiseach for what I believe is the fifth time in recent weeks to say what would happen on the Border, were there to be a no-deal situation in 37 days' time, and yet again he refused to answer.  He repeated what is not being planned or contemplated - I get that - and he then added the remarkable comment that the situation \"will cause a dilemma\".  Is this the best he can do?  Communities and businesses across the country, in the Border area in particular, are crying out for some basic information on what they should be planning for if - and we hope it does not happen - a no-deal arrives in 37 days' time.  It beggars belief that there are no arrangements in place as to what to do on the Border if a no-deal scenario comes to pass next month.  The Taoiseach's entire argument for the proposed deal is that only it avoids a hard border.

A geophysical survey of infant burial grounds will begin today at the site of the former Sean Ross Abbey mother and baby home, near Roscrea, County Tipperary.  Records of deaths at the home show that 269 children died there between 1934 and 1967 but, due to the failure of the order to keep records, the number of children who died there is not known definitively.  In the past two interim reports the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and Certain Related Matters has highlighted its difficulty in finding out more about the burial arrangements for children and women who died in these homes.  The commission has noted that there are significant gaps in the information available on the burial of babies who died in a number of the institutions under investigation and has warned that it will prove difficult to establish the facts.  This statement tells its own story of the State's direct hand in the treatment of children who died, none of whom reached his or her first birthday in the case of Sean Ross Abbey.<\/p><p>As the Taoiseach will know, statutory inspections of maternity homes began in 1934, which means the majority of the children who died in Sean Ross Abbey died on the State's watch.

I suggested to him that one consequence of the result was that we needed to move forward to the complete separation of church and State and he replied that we would leave that conversation for another day.  That day has come and, indeed, well passed.  In the Taoiseach's conversations with church leaders, particularly of the Catholic variety, what has he said to them?  What is he doing to accelerate the divestment programme, which was much lauded by the former Deputy, Mr. Ruair&iacute; Quinn, in 2012 and which was intended to do something about the fact that 90% of schools in the country are controlled by the Catholic Church?<\/p>  <p>  Since that much-trumpeted announcement of the divestment programme, a grand total of 11 schools have been handed over, while there was only one last year and ten in the few years before that.  Divestment, therefore, is not happening.  In this day and age, in the aftermath of marriage equality, the repeal of the eighth amendment and everything that signifies, which the Taoiseach and everyone else in the House knows, the time has well passed to transfer control of schools from the hands of the Catholic Church - or at least from the extent where 90% of them continue to be in its hands.  What is the Taoiseach doing about that and what has he said to church leaders about it?  It is just not happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000026#Y00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1550672400,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin's comments about the vital role that the clergy, the Catholic Church and other churches played in helping to bring about the peace process in Northern Ireland.  I believe they still have a role to play in that regard in the future.<\/p>  <p>  If we end up with a no-deal scenario in a few weeks' time - that is, no-deal without an extension, which I assume is what the Deputy means, although there could be a no-deal with an extension - we will be in uncharted territory and it is not possible for anyone to predict with certainty how matters will play out.  What I can say, as I have stated previously, is that we do not have any proposals or plans to install any infrastructure on the land Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  We are putting in place infrastructure at Dublin Port, Rosslare Port and Dublin Airport to allow us to carry out any necessary veterinary, sanitary and phytosanitary or customs checks etc.<\/p>  <p>  If we end up in a no-deal scenario without an extension, it will create a difficult dilemma for Ireland, the United Kingdom and the EU.  The UK will be bound to implement World Trade Organisation rules and we will have a responsibility to protect the Single Market, which we want to do, given that it is our Single Market and given that our industrial and economic policy, employment and much more are based on our full membership of it.  Above all, there will be our commitment to the Good Friday Agreement.  We would be in a situation where we would have to come to an agreement on regulatory alignment and customs, but that is what we already have.  That is why our efforts are focused on securing the ratification of the withdrawal agreement, including the Irish protocol and the backstop, which is the best and only way to give us an assurance that a hard border will not emerge on our island, whatever else happens as a consequence of Brexit.  As one can see from the events in London today, the situation is unstable and it is hard to predict what will happen in the next couple of weeks.  All we can do is prepare for the different and most likely scenarios.  <\/p>  <p>  I had the opportunity to meet members of the Jewish community in the past couple of weeks with Maurice Cohen, head of the Jewish Representative Council of Ireland, and the Chief Rabbi at a public event.  I hope to find a way to engage with the Jewish community at Passover.  I attended a seder last year, although I do not expect to be able to do that this year.  While I share the Deputy's concerns about rising anti-Semitism around the world, I am not sure that it is really a feature in Ireland.  Nevertheless, it is something we always need to watch out for and perhaps we need some further debate on the matter in the future.<\/p>  <p>  On the divestment programme for schools, parents of preschool children are being surveyed in a number of schools to find out what they want.  I agree that we need to accelerate the programme of divestment but choice is also important.  People have different ideas as to what the separation of church and State means.  I do not think it should go as far as totally banishing religion from the public sphere.  Many people want to continue to have a school under the patronage of the local parish and many people from a Church of Ireland background are very attached to Church of Ireland primary and secondary schools.  The same applies to the Jewish congregation, while many Muslim people also like to have their own school.  I do not believe in a form of separation of church and State that seeks to put away any form of religion and to strike it out of public life.  Religious bodies and bodies inspired by religion, such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and CROSSCARE, do highly valuable work, provide many Government services and receive much Government funding.  I would not like a form of secularism that tried to defund those organisations or banish them from public life because it is a little too extreme.  I appreciate that other people may wish to have all schools divested and those bodies defunded but that is not my view.<\/p>  <p>  On the mother and baby homes, the commission of investigation has informed the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs that it is conducting geophysical testing on the burial grounds located on the site of Sean Ross Abbey in Roscrea, County Tipperary.  The work is being undertaken following the receipt of information from a member of the public.  We were advised today that following initial geophysical testing, the commission began test excavations on Monday, 18 February and they are expected to take approximately three weeks.  The House will be aware that the terms of reference for the commission of investigation task it with examining burial practices at the sites of mother and baby homes and that the commission is independent in the conduct of its investigations.  It has all the necessary power and resources to carry out these investigations but neither the Minister nor the Government has any role in this stage of the process.  The commission is due to deliver an interim report next month on burials at the sites of former mother and baby homes, which the Minister will bring to the Government as soon as she receives it and has the opportunity to review it. <\/p>  <p>  On DNA, a new unit has been established in the Minister's Department to work on the legislation required to implement the Government's decision on the site of the former mother and baby home in Tuam.  Additional staff from other Departments are expected to be assigned to the unit in the coming weeks and scoping of the legislation has commenced.  There is no precedent for this kind of project in Ireland and, therefore, it is vital that we get it right in the interests of the survivors and relatives and the dignity of those buried at the Tuam site.  The approach taken will be further informed by the forthcoming report in March by the commission of investigation on burials at mother and baby homes.  In parallel with the legislative project, work will be carried out on sourcing the appropriate expertise.<\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy McDonald's request to begin collecting DNA samples of survivors and relatives, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, has asked Dr. Geoffrey Shannon to examine whether it is possible to meet the request within the current legislative framework.  This examination will be done in the context of what is scientifically possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000026#Y00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cabinet Committee Meetings","time":1550673000,"counter":371,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000027#Z00050"},{"type":"question","time":1550673000,"counter":372,"qnumday":8,"qnumall":"[6295\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000027#Z00100","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if a meeting of Cabinet committee D, infrastructure, which deals with climate change was held on 31 January 2019.","asker":"1283","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1550673000,"counter":373,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[7984\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000027#Z00200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when Cabinet committee D, infrastructure, last met; and when it is scheduled to meet again.","asker":"1239","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1550673000,"counter":374,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[8084\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000027#Z00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when Cabinet committee D, infrastructure, last met; and when it will meet again.","asker":"1253","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1550673000,"counter":375,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[8225\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000027#Z00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if Cabinet committee D, infrastructure, met on 31 January 2019.","asker":"1353","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1550673000,"counter":376,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[8379\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000027#Z00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee D, infrastructure, will next meet.","asker":"1238","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1550673000,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 to 12, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  Cabinet committee D works to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the delivery and ongoing development of policy on infrastructure investment and delivery, housing and climate action.

In addition, these matters are regularly considered at meetings of Government and in bilateral meetings with the Ministers responsible for the issues.<\/p>  <p>  Significant progress is being made on the implementation and delivery of Project Ireland 2040.  Through the National Planning Framework, it sets out our strategic 20-year vision for Ireland&rsquo;s future, balancing rural and urban development and linking it with capital investment of &euro;116 billion over ten years to meet the infrastructural needs of our growing population.  The four funds launched under Project Ireland 2040 have a total of &euro;4 billion to invest across the areas of rural and urban regeneration and development, climate action and disruptive technologies innovation.  The first round of funding allocations under these funds, amounting to &euro;276 million, was announced last year.  These funds will leverage further private sector investment in innovative and targeted projects that deliver on the aims of Project Ireland 2040.<\/p>  <p>  The Land Development Agency, another cornerstone initiative of Project Ireland 2040, was established on an interim basis in September and is working to ensure the optimum management of State land through strategic development and regeneration with an immediate focus on providing new homes, including social and affordable housing.  Housing continues to be a priority for the Government and we have seen strong growth in housing completions and in leading indicators such as planning permissions, commencement notices and housing registration.  Last year, over 18,000 new homes were built, an increase of 25% on the previous year.  More than 2,500 homes were brought out of long term vacancy and almost 800 dwellings in unfinished estates were completed, meaning the number of new homes available for use increased by more than 21,000 last year.  This does not include student accommodation.  There was also strong delivery of publicly-funded social housing in 2018, with over 27,000 new households having their housing needs met.<\/p>  <p>  We are aware of the significant challenge in meeting housing demand and tackling the ongoing issues in the housing market.  For this reason, budget 2019 provided an increase of 25% in the housing budget.  Delivering on our EU climate commitments for 2030 and transitioning to a competitive, low carbon, sustainable economy by 2050 are also policies.  We are investing &euro;22 billion in climate action through the national development plan to ensure that our future growth is regionally balanced and environmentally sustainable.  Budget 2019 provided for a range of measures to lower carbon emissions and improve sustainability, including more than &euro;200 million for agri-environmental actions through the rural development programme and over &euro;164 million for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is currently preparing an all-of-Government action plan on climate disruption and is working with colleagues across Government to develop new initiatives across electricity, transport, agriculture and other relevant sectors.  The action plan will build on progress to date and set out the steps which must be taken to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000027#Z00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1550673000,"counter":378,"content":"<p>Yesterday, the Taoiseach said that Deputies should go and look at the updates on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's website if we want to know what is happening with national development plan, NDP, projects.

The only underspends noted on the site arise because some projects spent money before the start of the NDP but the Taoiseach wanted to claim that the full project cost was part of the NDP.

I do not know whether he heard George Lee on RT&Eacute; today chatting to P&aacute;draic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust.  The headline on the item was that Irish nature is collapsing.  He went on to describe how 100 of our plants and animals are already extinct and another third of our species are under very serious threat.  He spoke about the deterioration of water quality, the extremely precarious situation of forestry, wildlife and so on and the fact that the Irish Greyhound Board gets as much money annually as the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  They even talked about a beautiful forest in Enniskerry - the Taoiseach should go and walk there - Knocksink Wood, where the environmental education centre is sitting there, empty and derelict, because of Government cuts.

I would argue that we need to balance economic development and social need with climate action.  It cannot be all climate action.  We have to provide for jobs in the economy and for investment too.  We have to take a holistic view of these things.<\/p>  <p>  Derry and Letterkenny developing together as a city region is very much a feature of Project Ireland 2040.  The Government has provided funding already to the North West Strategic Growth Partnership, which involves Donegal County Council and Derry City and Strabane District Council.  I have had an opportunity to engage with them and I imagine we will be able to provide additional funding in the future too.  We would be very keen to continue to support the development of Derry working with Letterkenny as the region for the north west.<\/p>  <p>  On the reprofiling of capital projects, or savings, whatever people want to call them, I am happy to clarify again, roughly &euro;100 million has been reprofiled out of a capital budget this year of more than &euro;7,000 million.  We invest approximately &euro;140 million a week in infrastructure and approximately &euro;100 million of that &euro;7,000 million has been reprofiled.  Thankfully it did not require that any projects had to be delayed or paused.  The money comes from a &euro;25 million payment in respect of the A5 which we do not have to make this year because the project has not started although if it does start, we will make that payment.  It also comes from a deferred payment relating to the forensic science laboratory of approximately &euro;10 million while another &euro;10 million is being provided from the Department of Education and Skills for the school at the new children's hospital.  That has been brought forward and that explains the difference between the &euro;35 million and the &euro;25 million on health.  I think &euro;24 million of the &euro;25 million specifically for health comes out of a fund that is there for refurbishments, minor capital works, replacing equipment and so on.  That fund was &euro;94 million but it is being reduced by &euro;24 million to &euro;70 million but that is still an increase on last year.  There may well be plenty of projects and developments around the country that are delayed for one reason or another but none is delayed as a consequence of the national children's hospital, notwithstanding that people will claim otherwise. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000028#AA00600","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1550673600,"counter":388,"content":"<p>Written Answers are published on the Oireachtas website.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1550673600,"counter":389,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 2.45 p.m. and resumed at 3.45 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Teachtaireacht \u00f3n Seanad - Message from Seanad","time":1550674200,"counter":390,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000029#GG00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1550674200,"counter":391,"content":"<p>Seanad &Eacute;ireann has passed the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2018, without amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000029#GG00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from Select Committee","time":1550674200,"counter":392,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000029#GG00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1550674200,"counter":393,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Health has concluded its consideration of the Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill 2018 and has made amendments thereto.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000029#GG00400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Saincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Debate","time":1550674200,"counter":394,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000029#GG00500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Heritage Sites","time":1550674200,"counter":395,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000029#GG00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1550674200,"counter":396,"content":"<p>As someone who has been lucky enough to visit High Island in recent years, I am a rare breed.  I landed there on a very calm day and it is a spectacular island.  On its southern side are monastic settlements on which very detailed excavations have been done.  The headstones of the monks are incredible.  It is a tremendously interesting and important site.  It is similar to the Skelligs in terms of archaeological and historical importance.<\/p>  <p>  When I landed on the island I also discovered that really important scientific work is going on there.  University College Cork has been doing some really groundbreaking and important ecological and scientific assessments.  Researchers have been tagging and monitoring the very significant populations of Manx shearwaters and storm petrels.  These are very large populations which are hugely important in a European context because of the numbers and rarity of the birds.  The research being done is also very important in a wider context because, in tracking the movements, breeding and ecology of the birds, the whole north-west Atlantic is monitored.  It is hard to believe it considering the size of the birds, but on occasion they fly out almost 1,700 km to feed.  The monitoring, management and assessment of that tells us a massive amount about what is happening in the north-west Atlantic, where climate is changing, where cold water is coming down from the Arctic and where the Gulf Stream itself may be weakening.  These are very large populations of very rare and critical seabirds.  They are one of the birds which are most threatened.  The whole issue of protecting biodiversity is critical to the Minister's Department.  This area of scientific research is of critical international and European importance.<\/p>  <p>  The island has no possible use other than the maintenance and monitoring of the archaeological, ornithological and other ecological sites.<\/p><p>A house could not be put on it because it is not accessible, except on a really calm day.  A helicopter pad or any other landing system would ruin the ecology.  Richard Murphy, the poet, owned it briefly at a time when he sailed in and out of Cleggan to Inishbofin.  He wanted to give it to the State but my understanding, based on his biography and from talking to people who knew him, is that he grew frustrated at the slow response of the State and sold it to a local person.  That person has been very good in supporting the scientific and archaeological research that has been done and has provided an excellent caretaker role.  The island is now for sale and it is important that the State steps up to the mark and purchases the land so that it is protected.  The island is of acute ecological importance and a State purchase would also be an investment in our archaeological heritage and our scientific research system.  It would not be expensive relative to other projects the State engages in but it is important.  It may require further investment, for example, if we were to have some limited tourism capability for visitors to an amazing monastic site.  That might take the pressure of the Skelligs and other locations but we would have to do it very sensitively in respect of how we would get landing and so on.<\/p> <p> We should support UCC in its critical scientific research.  We should make sure we protect these really important populations of sea birds which tell us a lot about what is going on in the north Atlantic.  Doing so would send out a signal to our people and to the wider world that we are monitoring what is happening in the north Atlantic and it is in our care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000029#GG00700","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550674500,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I note his comments on biodiversity.  As he knows, today and tomorrow I am hosting a national biodiversity conference in Dublin Castle.  The Government takes this issue very seriously.<\/p>  <p>  High Island is a spectacular island; there is no doubt about that.  It contains an early medieval monastery dedicated to St. F&eacute;ich&iacute;n.  This is a national monument which is in my ownership as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  The church is located in a small enclosure, which lies in the northern half of the ecclesiastical enclosure on High Island.  It comprises a conserved single-cell church, dedicated to St F&eacute;ich&iacute;n, and is one of the smallest of the Atlantic island churches.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the day-to-day care of this national monument falls under the remit of the Office of Public Works on behalf of my Department.  The OPW works in close co-operation with the national monuments service of my Department, which has overall responsibility to ensure the long-term conservation of the national monument.  In the 1990s, a comprehensive State-funded excavation and conservation programme was undertaken on the monastic site and the results were published in 2014 in my Department's archaeological monograph series.  As a national monument in State care, the monastery as it stands is fully protected under the provisions of the National Monuments Acts.  Any works at or in its vicinity may only be carried out with ministerial consent under section 14 of the Act.  There are also a number of recorded monuments on the property which are protected under national monuments legislation as well.  These monuments are in private ownership.<\/p>  <p>  In the interests of the preservation, conservation, management and presentation of the built and archaeological heritage, the State sometimes may wish to acquire certain heritage properties and monuments.  From time to time, these may come onto the open market, may be bequeathed to the State or may be offered to the State for purchase or free of cost.  I might also add that there have been no recent invitations to our Department to purchase the site from anybody.  In addition, lands surrounding or in proximity to national monuments in State care often reside in private ownership.  In certain cases, improved protection of the monument, or access to the monument, may be possible if the State was to acquire such additional lands.  There has not been any recent approach in respect of this particular monument.  I must inform the Deputy that such acquisition is the exception rather than the norm and that where a monument is already adequately protected and there is no exceptional case for acquisition in order to improve access, the case for purchase may not be pressing.  In the case of High Island, the national monument and the recorded monuments are already well protected, in our view.  Public access, even if the whole property were in public ownership, would continue to be hazardous and the site is unsuitable for large-scale visitor exploration.  Additionally, value for money principles must be carefully considered where any acquisition is proposed. <\/p>  <p>  The national monuments in State care already number some 1,000 sites at over 760 locations around the country and these command considerable resource commitments in terms of both funding and personnel allocation.  In addition, there are in excess of 120,000 monuments listed in the record of monuments and places that are not maintained by the State.  Suffice it to say that while I understand what the Deputy is saying, there is no exceptional case in this instance that would merit an acquisition of this nature.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000030#HH00200","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1550674500,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I believe it is an exceptional case.  There was an approach made by Richard Murphy and he was spurned by the Government of the day, long before either of our times.  I am making the approach now because I believe it is of great archaeological importance.  The State has invested significantly in the restoration and maintenance of the site, which is one of the smallest and not insignificant monastic settlements, which is an important asset for the State.  There is at present a benign ownership system under which the current owner has co-operated and facilitated the management of the site and of scientific research on the island.  That could be lost.  The island is for sale today.  If we do not buy it there is a real risk that someone else will, who may have a different perspective on how it should be managed.  It would be a tragedy if what is exceptional about this island was lost to the State.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has attended a conference and no doubt has spoken very good words on the issue of biological protection.  However, her answer did not refer to the second reason I cited for purchase of the island.  I understand there are up to 3,000 breeding pairs of storm petrels and a very significant population of Manx shearwaters.  The most detailed analysis in recent years has been done by University College Cork to show this is actually a very important scientific site.  What is happening to these sea bird populations, which are the most threatened and most in decline, indicates what is happening not just in the local area but right out to the Atlantic.  It is cheaper for us to buy this island and maintain that scientific analysis than to send ships out with monitoring systems to research what is happening in the north Atlantic.  We can do it here by tagging the sea birds as UCC is doing.  This is very important.  It is exceptional.  I am making the approach to the Minister today to encourage her to buy it and protect the scientific and archaeological sites, allow for access and get it into public ownership.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000030#HH00300","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1550674500,"counter":400,"content":"<p>The Deputy can understand that if there was to be an approach made to the Department, it would have to be done in a formal way, not on the floor of the House, although I appreciate the Deputy's offering.

It is also important to say that the Department will support all initiatives to study ecology, including those of UCC.  The State is only in a position to acquire, maintain, conserve and present a limited number of heritage properties and monuments.  As I said earlier, it is important to stress that any property acquisition by the State should be regarded as an exception rather than the norm.  The Deputy mentioned birds a number of times; protected species are also safeguarded by the Department, as the Deputy is aware.  The National Monuments Acts provide a legislative basis for the protection of archaeology in the State, whether or not the monuments are in State ownership.  Furthermore, the Archaeological Survey of Ireland maps and updates the data on our archaeological resources on a regular basis.  Information on more than 140,000 monuments across the country is currently stored in the Department's sites and monuments record.  The National Monuments Acts allow me to place a preservation order on any other important archaeological site or monument that may be at risk.<\/p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>As such, there is an extensive protection, as I outlined, for archaeological heritage in the State without a need for acquisition of sites, except in the most exceptional of cases.

The planned development will cost &euro;1 billion.  It is four times the size of Croke Park and has an outflow pipe which is located off Portmarnock through a special area of conservation at the Baldoyle-Portmarnock estuary.  According to the plans that have been submitted and which are now with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, sewage will only be treated to the minimum secondary level.  At the very least, my colleague, Deputy Haughey, and I, along with Councillor Eoghan O'Brien and the 14,000 residents of the area, insist that the highest levels of modern treatment are applied.  I note that the size of the plant has been reduced from around 800,000 or 900,000 personal equivalent, PE, to 500,000 PE.  This is due to the fact that there have been over 14,000 observations through the public consultation process, which has actually been useful.<\/p>  <p>  I held a meeting with Irish Water last June in which I was informed that its priority is the continuing upgrade of the Ringsend facility, bringing new technologies to that plant and increasing capacity there.  Does the Minister of State have an update on that?  I, along with many residents, are particularly opposed to this type of development and believe that a series of localised plants is the way forward.  There are already 15 plants in Fingal which process the waste where it is actually generated.  We do not want to go down the road of a &euro;1 billion to &euro;1.4 billion project, with an orbital sewer with a massive regional wastewater treatment plant.  Our main objections are on the grounds of environmental damage and potential damage, damage to the quality of life for residents in Clonshaugh, Portmarnock and the surrounding areas and damage to the fishing and horticultural sector in the area.  The cost to the taxpayer is also fundamental.  I have repeatedly asked for a cost-benefit analysis on this project.  Well before Deputy English became the Minister of State I asked Deputy Howlin, who was Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to carry out a cost-benefit analysis on this plant.  He promised that would be done.  My understanding is that has not been done.  I know that the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is not here today, but I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy English, is here as a representative of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Can he inform the House how much has been spent on this project to date?  It is important that we keep an eye on large capital projects.  The Government will understand how important that is when we take into account the debacle of the national children's hospital.  We want to ensure that, whatever happens with the development of additional wastewater treatment plant facilities in the area, be it the large regional plants we do not support or the smaller, localised ones that would serve 80,000 or 90,000 PE, we have a handle on the costs.<\/p>  <p>  I would be greatly obliged if the Minister of State could advise what has been spent to date and what the Government's plans are for the Irish Water strategic funding plan 2019 to 2024.

I do not have them, but I can try and get them at a later stage.<\/p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local level.  Irish Water, as a single national water services authority, takes a strategic, nationwide approach to asset planning and investment and meeting customer requirements.  Irish Water delivers its services in accordance with its water services strategic plan published in October 2015.  This sets out a high-level strategy over 25 years to ensure the provision of clean, safe drinking water, effective management of wastewater, environmental protection and support for economic and social development.  The first national water services policy statement, prepared in line with the Water Services Acts, which the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, launched on 21 May 2018, outlines a clear direction to strategic planning and decision making on water and wastewater services in Ireland.  It identifies key policy objectives and priorities for the delivery of water and wastewater services in Ireland over the period to 2025.  It provides the context within which necessary funding and investment plans by Irish Water are framed and agreed.<\/p>  <p>  On 7 November 2018, the Minister, Deputy Murphy, approved Irish Water&rsquo;s strategic funding plan for 2019 to 2024 which sets out Irish Water&rsquo;s multi-annual strategic funding requirement of &euro;11 billion to 2024.  This comprises &euro;6.1 billion investment in infrastructure and assets and &euro;4.9 billion in operating costs.  This significant multi-billion euro investment programme is to ensure the continued operation, repair and upgrading of the country&rsquo;s water and wastewater infrastructure to support social and economic development across the State and continued care of the water environment.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Water's strategic funding plan is also subject to economic regulatory review by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, which will consider the efficiency of its investment proposals.  The strategic funding plan sets out the financial plan for capital investments to support Irish Water&rsquo;s strategic objectives in order to deliver improvements to water services.  I understand from Irish Water that it made an application for strategic infrastructure development for the greater Dublin drainage project to An Bord Plean&aacute;la on 20 June 2018.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la then held a period of statutory public consultation and it is anticipated that the board will commence an oral hearing on the project shortly.  I gather that the Deputy has been involved in that process and is participating fully on that.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy references a cost-benefit analysis.  I assume that will be part of an oral hearing discussion.  Generally, when these projects are brought forward, alternative options have to be considered.  Costs and environmental impacts are considered in that, so I imagine that issue will be dealt with there.  I will certainly pursue that further for the Deputy in the meantime and provide any extra information I can on that too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000031#JJ00400","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1550675100,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I know the Minister of State is not the direct line Minister for this project, but I have to say with respect that the question has not been answered at all.

I remain absolutely opposed to this type of development and I really do believe that the Government should go back and look at what it has proposed.

The model we are proceeding with is flawed.  Thousands of residents in the area agree.  These people are not approaching this matter from a \"not in my back yard\" position, but rather as residents who already have 15 wastewater treatment plants in the area.

It is monitored through the Irish Water strategic plan which is presented to the Government and the regulator.  I know from dealing with the regulator and different utility organisations that have brought forward proposals during the years that regulators are fairly strict when it comes to costs which they monitor quite well.  Often they reduce the initial asking costs also.  There is a fairly good system and protocol in place to deal with that aspect.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is looking for particular figures.  I will see if I can get them for him from Irish Water.  It is the body responsible and it is not something the Department deals with on a day to day basis.  Irish Water has statutory responsibility for planning and decision-making on the type of project that will proceed.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy has raised questions about whether this is the best way to proceed with the treatment facility.  That is something we can certainly look into for him.  I am not familiar with the details, but I will certainly get the details because, to be honest, the Deputy has raised my interest in the matter now.<\/p>  <p>  It is also part of the planning process Irish Water is going through.  I have been attended many oral hearings during the years.  The details will be dealt with and come out.  It is an important part of the decision-making process.  Often on a project of this nature the first step is for the organisation responsible to prove that the project is necessary and that there is no better way of doing something.  Irish Water will be given the job to use taxpayers' money effectively to ensure the best treatment facilities are built to the highest standards and available within a certain budget.  The company will have to manage that process and ensure value for money, as well as ensuring the best environmental decision is made.  I presume it will all be teased out during the oral hearing and the planning process.  If there is any information I can obtain for the Deputy in the meantime, I will get it.  I will be happy to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000032#KK00200","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","time":1550675700,"counter":408,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000032#KK00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1550675700,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I assume the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Stanton, is taking this matter.  As a Deputy from Cork, he will be familiar with the constituency I represent &ndash; Cork South-Central.  It is primarily an urban constituency and takes in the south side of Cork city.  It includes some large suburbs that are growing rapidly such as Douglas, Carrigaline and Passage West.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda district headquarters is located in Togher.  It is the only 24-hour station in the Garda district.  When the other Garda stations in the district are closed - that happens to be most of the time - all telephone calls are diverted to Togher Garda station.  Stations in the other densely populated parts of the constituency such as Carrigaline and Douglas Garda stations have limited opening hours.  They are not always open, even during the designated hours when they are meant to be open.  That is because the garda&iacute; who are on duty and meant to be in the station may be called away to an incident elsewhere in the district.<\/p>  <p>  The general public draws confidence from a Garda station being open, ideally on a 24\/7 basis.  Garda management often tells me that it prefers to use resources for patrolling, rather than having garda&iacute; within a station.  I accept that is an operational decision for Garda management.  However, I absolutely believe we need longer station opening hours within the Togher district in the main population areas and the suburbs about which I have spoken.<\/p>  <p>  In the area I represent there have been a spate of burglaries.  We have had organised gangs roaming through housing estates checking to see if cars are unlocked.  If they are, they are stealing whatever they can from them.  There has been damage caused to private and public property such as playgrounds in the area.  Many people have captured footage on their private closed circuit television systems of people trying to open their vehicles or walking around to the side or the back of homes.  A serious assault took place on the main street of Carrigaline last Saturday night and a man was seriously injured.  I wish him well in his recovery.  Many people have since been in touch to express real concern about the lack of a Garda presence in the area.<\/p>  <p>  Garda management openly tells me that it simply does not have the resources to provide foot patrols.  The days of garda&iacute; walking along the streets in my area and perhaps elsewhere throughout the country seem to be gone.  In Carrigaline where I live there is one community garda who is visible and out and about a good deal.  The other garda&iacute; simply do not have the time or resources to do so.  They are stretched to breaking point.  This has had a direct impact on morale within the force.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of resources is key.  Let us consider Carrigaline as an example.  There are five units with two members each.  There are three detective garda&iacute; and three sergeants.  On any given weekend night one unit of two garda&iacute; may be serving the town.  The reality is that they could be called away at any point.  Frequently they are called away to another part of the Garda district to deal with an incident.  We could as a result actually have no Garda presence within the town.  We absolutely need longer station opening hours and more garda&iacute;.  People should not have to call to a Garda station on multiple occasions to have a form signed, yet that is the practice in my area which is rapidly expanding and experiencing high population growth.  <\/p>  <p>  I understand a new policing divisional model is being prepared.  Extra resources have been requested for the area by Garda management.  The Minister of State is the person responsible.  I call on him to take up the issue with Garda management - the top brass within the Garda - and deliver extra resources to the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000032#KK00400","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1550675700,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality who is spending a good deal of time in the Seanad dealing with the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill.  He asked me to stand in for him because he was unsure whether he would be able to make it and did not wish to delay proceedings.  He has asked me to reiterate to the House that the deployment of Garda resources, including personnel, to specific areas is solely the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner and his management team.  I imagine the Deputy appreciates this and that we can all appreciate we cannot interfere with that decision in any way.<\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner has spoken publicly about issues such as protecting the most vulnerable.  He has highlighted that his priority is a policing model that will provide the best outcomes for communities.  The distribution of Garda resources is constantly monitored and a distribution model is used that takes into account all relevant factors, including population, crime trends and overall policing needs at local level.  It is then a matter for the divisional chief superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her, having regard to the profile of the area and its specific needs.  This applies equally in both rural and urban areas.  I imagine the Commissioner and his management team will be noting what is said in this debate in the Chamber.<\/p>  <p>  I emphasise that is not appropriate to simply determine the allocation of Garda resources on the basis of population size alone.  This fails to take account of, among other things, the fact that crime levels and types can vary significantly in communities of similar population size.  The Deputy will appreciate that an increase in the opening hours of any Garda station would necessitate the deployment of additional Garda personnel to indoor administrative duties.  These garda&iacute; may be employed more effectively on outdoor policing duties.  The Deputy alluded to this point in his contribution.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has advised that the matter of opening hours of sub-district stations is subject to continual review and alteration by Garda management in the context of policing priorities and the resources available.  The Commissioner has informed the Minister that on 31 January, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the strength of the Cork city division was 703, with 128 garda&iacute; assigned to the Togher Garda district.  There are also 38 Garda reserves and 80 civilians attached to the division.  When appropriate, the work of local garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the armed support units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.<\/p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  A total of 62 were assigned to the Cork city division, including 15 probationer garda&iacute; assigned to Togher Garda station.  The Commissioner has informed the Minister that it is his intention to recruit a total of 600 trainee garda&iacute; in 2019, with a net total of 600 Garda staff.  The recruitment of the additional Garda staff will allow the Commissioner to redeploy this year a further 500 fully trained garda&iacute; from administrative duties to the front-line duties for which they were trained.  The injection of this large number of experienced officers into the field, with the new recruits, will be beneficial in protecting communities.<\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner has been provided with an additional &euro;100 million in 2019, bringing his total budget to almost &euro;1.8 billion.  This substantial investment will allow the accelerated recruitment programme to continue in tandem with the deployment of new and leading edge technology to support front-line garda&iacute; in carrying out their work in delivering a visible, effective and responsive police service to communities across all Garda divisions, including the Cork city division in 2019 and beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000032#KK00500","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1550676300,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

Some 62 out of 2,400 mean that less than 3% of the newly qualified garda&iacute; have been assigned to the whole division of Cork which includes to the Togher district, and that includes places like Douglas and Carrigaline.

There is no doubt that the Togher district, which includes those very large suburbs, is not getting a fair deal as to resources.

I assure him that he will find that that district is not getting the resources it should be getting.  I accept population is not the only determinant but it is certainly a significant factor.

I also assure the Deputy that working with communities to tackle public disorder and reducing anti-social behaviour remains a key priority for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Garda visibility is very important and the Government remains committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen the community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  The joint policing committees have a big role to play in this as well.  They facilitate consultation, co-operation and discussion and they bring matters to the attention of garda&iacute; at a high level locally, local authorities and elected local representatives.  This active and constructive engagement is very important and should be encouraged and supported.<\/p>  <p>  At the heart of the concerns expressed by the Deputy is the relationship between the communities and the local garda&iacute;.  That is very important.  The Programme for A Partnership Government underlines the importance of community policing in responding to the concerns and expectations of urban and rural communities.  The Government is fully committed to implementing that commitment and over the last few years, unprecedented resources have been made available to ensure that the Commissioner and his management team have the resources necessary to deliver a modern policing service to communities throughout the country, including the Togher district.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy can rest assured that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will have noted to debate this evening, as it notes all these debates, and will make its decisions independently, as it is mandated to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000033#LL00400","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Inquiries","time":1550676300,"counter":415,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000033#LL00450"},{"type":"speech","time":1550676300,"counter":416,"content":"<p>N&iacute;l ach seal gairid agam.

We must have regard to the constitutional separation of powers where the courts are concerned.

This is a reasonable and responsible approach to take.  There are various precedents of scoping exercises being carried out prior to the setting up of inquiries or tribunals.  It is good governance to allow a scoping exercise by a legal expert to determine the net issues that might require further examination.  Indeed, the exercise on the part of Judge Haughton will also be charged with responsibility for reviewing changes that have already been made to the law, practices and procedures in respect of the administration of bail and bench warrants and the extent to which those changes have or have not addressed gaps in the systems since the death of Shane O'Farrell.<\/p>  <p>  I am acutely conscious that at the heart of this tragedy is a family in pain.

To try to claim credit for the decades of hard work by pro-choice campaigners is more than a little bit sad.  Even his most ardent supporter could not defend his record in good conscience.  How can anyone defend record-breaking levels of patients on trolleys?  How can anyone defend failed scoliosis action plans?  How can anyone defend chronically understaffed child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS?<\/p><p> How can anyone defend a 27-week wait for the results of cervical smear tests?  How can anyone defend record-breaking waiting lists totalling 1 million patients?  How can anyone defend forcing nurses and midwives onto the streets to strike for safe staffing?  How can anyone defend the Minister's role in the CervicalCheck scandal?  How can anyone defend the recruitment and retention crisis across the front line of the health service?  How can anyone defend thousands of children waiting years for speech and language therapy or for occupational therapy?  How can anyone defend hundreds of older people waiting months for home support services?  How can anyone defend the crisis created in general practice?  How can anyone defend the spending of &euro;2 billion on agency staff in eight years?  <\/p> <p> How can anyone defend misleading the D&aacute;il?  How can anyone defend knowing of a catastrophic overrun on a capital project and doing nothing about it, saying nothing about it, and actively keeping it from colleagues?  How can anyone defend the withholding of and the drip-feeding of information to Deputies and D&aacute;il committees?  How can anyone defend reappointing a board which was presiding over the meltdown of the children&rsquo;s hospital project without seeking any advice on the performance of that board?  How can anyone defend an expected cost overrun on the national children&rsquo;s hospital of &euro;450 million?  I could go on but I only have five minutes, not five hours.  The simple fact is that nobody can defend it - no one except the Minister and the opportunistic cowards in Fianna F&aacute;il.<\/p> <p> It is incompetence and a lack of ability which have brought us here today.  Past performance is, I believe, an indicator of future performance, but the Minister's past performance makes me certain that he is not up to the job of being Minister for Health.  He is out of his depth.  How can we, in good faith, in addition to all the other failures and the gross level of incompetence and impotence displayed by him as Minister in his handling of the national children&rsquo;s hospital, say that we are confident that he is the person to lead the health service?  We cannot and we will not.<\/p> <p> The overrun at the national children&rsquo;s hospital materialised on his watch and under his nose, but there was another person involved further back in this project whose role in this cannot be ignored.  Who agreed to the doomed two-stage procurement strategy just for political expediency so that he or another Fine Gael Minister could cut the ribbon?  It was the Minister's predecessor in health, the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar.  In 2014, it was recognised in a procurement strategy report that this approach was untested in the State and that it carried significant risks.  That report stated that added pressure would be put on the project&rsquo;s design team which could lead to a poor quality price.<\/p> <p> All the available evidence pointed out that we would be where we are today, yet the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, the politician who governs by optics, took a decision so the ribbon could be cut early.  He did not do this for the children of this State; he did it for himself and for Fine Gael, and on the Minister's watch, he continued in exactly the same vein.<\/p> <p> If the tables were turned and if I or any other Opposition Deputy who was in his shoes and had presided over the litany of scandals he has presided over, would he vote confidence in us?  There is not a snowball's chance in hell that he would and there is not a snowball's chance in hell that we will vote confidence in him. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000034#MM00800","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550677500,"counter":430,"content":"<p>Our healthcare system is in crisis as every day brings new headlines which tell of the litany of failures inherent in the system.  We have had a series of scandals, including that of CervicalCheck.  Over the course of that debacle, the bravery of women like Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na has shone a light directly on the incompetence of the Minister for Health.  That scandal continues with the backlog of tests and a wait time of seven months for results.  We have a children&rsquo;s hospital with run-away costs, up to &euro;0.5 billion over budget, money that will have to come from taxpayers and from other capital projects.  For this Minister, this Government and Fianna F&aacute;il, patients on trolleys is the norm.  It is acceptable to them.  It is so acceptable that the Minister deemed it appropriate this afternoon to take to Twitter to puff out his chest and declare: \"Bring it on\".<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is failing.  That is very clear.  Every day Deputies from across the Chamber get to their feet to set out the latest crisis.  Even Fianna F&aacute;il does it, even Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin does it, albeit to throw shapes and play to the camera, but when the camera is off, it is business as usual for Fianna F&aacute;il.  <\/p>  <p>  Supply and confidence has undermined and discredited the political process.  The essential role of the Opposition is to hold the Government of the day to account, to advocate for those without a voice, to call out failing Ministers and failing policies and to demand better, but Fianna F&aacute;il, in its supply and confidence agreement, has abdicated responsibility and betrayed the electorate.<\/p>  <p>  The simple fact is that the Minister is incapable of doing his job, yet he remains in office.  He believes he is untouchable.  The crisis and scandals mount and hardworking people pay the price, quite literally.<\/p>  <p>  The leader of Fianna F&aacute;il has listed the failings of the Minister for Health but by his actions, he will support him, he will protect him and Fianna F&aacute;il will protect Fine Gael.  The leader of Fianna F&aacute;il says he will support the Minister in the national interest.  Let me tell him that it is never in the national interest to keep a failing Minster in place.  The price is too high not only in terms of the children&rsquo;s hospital but in hospitals and doctors&rsquo; surgeries across the State.<\/p>  <p>  The leader of Fianna F&aacute;il tells us that this is done to avoid an election as Brexit looms.  The Taoiseach has said there will be no election before Brexit.  There is no threat of an election, yet the Minister remains, and all this because of so-called supply and confidence, a deal that covers the blushes of a Fianna F&aacute;il leader for giving the Government a blank cheque while pretending to act as an Opposition.  Sleeveen politics is now the order of the day in the D&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000035#NN00300","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1550677500,"counter":431,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1550677500,"counter":432,"content":"<p>This is a coalition in all but name.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach certainly has the measure of the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il because he knows that Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin will fall into line once pressure is applied.

The national interest is not served by retaining a Minister who is clearly failing.<\/p>  <p>  Today, supply and confidence is exposed.  It is not about stability; it is about stagnation.  It is a grubby deal by the political establishment to control both Government and Opposition at the same time.  Its legacy is seen on waiting lists, on trolley counts and in families struggling to make ends meet.<\/p>  <p>  The question to Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin is a simple one.

Fine Gael said this in 2011 in its five point plan.  It said it would eliminate long waiting lists and end the unfair public-private two-tier system to replace it with universal health insurance system.  Eight years later these words ring very hollow for all those who have suffered, are suffering and will continue to suffer in this shambolic health system.

The Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies will cry \"Brexit prevents us from doing anything,\" even though practically every statement they make implies that the Minister should go.

That is what Fianna F&aacute;il and Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin are facilitating here.  By rights the Taoiseach should recognise the failings himself.<\/p>  <p>  It is the role of the Opposition, and it appears all the Opposition parties agree, to hold Government to account as Fine Gael used to do when it was in opposition.

During his 14 years as a Minister, time and again, he ducked and dived, avoiding accountability at every turn.  When asked if he bore any responsibility for the illegal nursing home charges scandal, which cost the State &euro;486 million, he said \"No, I do not\".

He is getting things done, including a successful referendum on the eighth amendment, the Public Health (Alcohol) Act and, after years of little investment, three national hospital projects under construction with a fourth due to go to tender in the foreseeable future.  Free GP care has been extended to all carers and medical cards have been provided to all children with a severe disability, regardless of their parents' incomes.  The HPV vaccine for boys and improved patient outcomes in cancer, stroke, heart attack and cystic fibrosis are other developments.  Even in the toughest areas, such as the number of patients on trolleys, the Minister has made measurable progress.  While there are still far too many, the number is at its lowest in three years in 2019 thus far.  In January, the number of patients waiting more than three months for an operation or procedure - the Sl&aacute;intecare target - was at a four-year low.  While we have lost some ground due to the recent strikes, we will regain it.  The Minister has handled difficult and emotive issues, such CervicalCheck or securing funding for cystic fibrosis treatments like Orkambi, with the utmost sensitivity.  He invests enormous time and energy into gaining the confidence of patient representatives and, if supported, there is much more he can do in his post.<\/p>  <p>  I also have confidence in the national children's hospital project.  Major errors were made in calculating the true cost of building a hospital of this scale and complexity and, as Head of Government, I take collective and personal responsibility for that.  However, I do not accept that it is wasteful expenditure.  It is a project which is well under way.  The first phase involving the satellite centre in Blanchardstown will open to patients this year while the satellite centre in Tallaght will begin construction this year and open in 2020.  At the St. James's site in Dublin 8, stage 1 is almost complete and stage 2 has commenced.  After decades of promises and false starts, the children's hospital is finally being delivered.  Of course, we will do all we can to ensure the project gets back on track and is delivered on time and in line with the revised budget.  We will work to ensure the hospital is commissioned no later than 2023.<\/p>  <p>  I also have confidence in Project Ireland 2040.  One year after its launch, many projects are coming in on time and on budget.  Shovels are in the ground and the work is being done.  All over the country, one sees the vision of Project Ireland 2040 being realised.  Last week, we turned the sod on the new runway at Dublin Airport, which is our gateway to the world.  The runway was promised for decades but it is now under construction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000037#PP00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1550678700,"counter":481,"content":"<p>Will that take long?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000037#PP00400","speaker":"1303"},{"type":"speech","time":1550678700,"counter":482,"content":"<p>On Friday, I will be in Sligo for the sod-turning to mark the construction of the N4 Collooney to Castlebaldwin road, another project which was promised for decades and is now under construction.

I have seen him bring people together on one of the most divisive political issues we have ever had to face and successfully pass a referendum proposal.  I have seen him bring people together around an alcohol Bill and achieve the necessary compromises to get a majority in the House.  I have seen him manage scandals with compassion, professionalism and unbelievable energy and dedication.  I have seen the victims of those scandals praise him for it and wish him well in his future political career.  I have seen him build cross-party support and consensus around the kind of future health reform we need in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare.  I have seen an extraordinary commitment from him as a politician and Minister for Health to making that happen.

Some 78,000 women are now waiting for results.  The Government announced that the HPV test would be in place by last September and then by January, but last week the HSE told us that there was no longer a date.  The Minister was asked repeatedly to stop the free test.  That is documented.  Last week he said in the House that at no point was he ever given advice not to proceed with the test.  The day before the test announcement was made the clinical director of CervicalCheck was on the national airwaves advising against out-of-cycle repeat smear tests, except in exceptional circumstances.  Last Sunday Susan Mitchell wrote in the <i>Sunday Business Post<\/i>that CervicalCheck had advised against a free smear test and had done so before the Government made the offer.  If that is true, we need to know if the Minister has misled the D&aacute;il for a second time.<\/p><p>Then there is the issue of the national children's hospital.  In 2016 it was due to cost &euro;650 million in total.  It is now &euro;1.7 billion and counting.  The two most expensive hospitals ever built in the world are in Adelaide and Stockholm.  The cost per bed at these two hospitals came in at &euro;1.6 million and &euro;1.8 million.  At current costs, before they potentially increase, the cost per bed in the national children's hospital will be approximately &euro;3.6 million, or twice as much as in the two most expensive hospitals ever built.  When I pointed this out, the Government responded that they were not children's hospitals and that I had to look at children's hospitals.  Let us do that.  Four years ago the Alder Hey Children's Hospital was completed in Liverpool.  It has 309 beds and the cost came in at &euro;270 million.  That gives a cost per bed of approximately &euro;900,000.  The public money of the taxpayers of Ireland is being used to provide beds in a children's hospital that will cost four times more per bed than the NHS was able to deliver for children in Liverpool.<\/p><p>The Government's response has been extraordinary.  First, it kept the information to itself.  While the development board hired a PR firm to gauge the public's reaction to the bad news, this House was kept in the dark.  When the facts began to emerge, the first line of defence was that it was due to inflation.  It was unfortunate, but inflation is what it was and what could one do?  In fairness to the Minister, last week in the House he accepted that inflation was not driving the increase.  The Government has an extraordinary line to the effect that it is not really a cost overrun but that it underestimated the cost at the start.  Underestimating the cost is regrettable, but it is obviously less grievous than just letting costs spiral completely out of control.  Defying all credibility, the Government's current position is that, at &euro;1.4 billion, plus another &euro;300 million to open it, it still represents a reasonable cost to the State.<\/p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il does not have confidence in the Government when it comes to healthcare.

Each and every one of the Departments over which it has presided has at one stage or another seen unfulfilled promises, overspends and poor management.  Behind the Minister and the Department of Health are all the officials who were engaged in this, and they have turned around to the Oireachtas committees and told us they will not appear before us.

I ask Fine Gael Deputies not to behave as Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies do.  The situation in the health sector is the greatest example of the intolerable state of affairs.  It is intolerable for everyone - for the Government, the Opposition and the public.  Votes have little or no meaning any more.  The Government loses multiple votes every week and struggles to bring through legislation, while the main Opposition party abstains or votes for legislation and motions in which it does not believe.  It is ridiculous and cannot continue.<\/p>  <p>  To be fair to the Minister, he has had some successes in his Ministry.  Repealing the eighth amendment, along with all of us, was a notable achievement that will stand rightly beside his name, as will the restructuring of the HSE, on which I support him.  At the initiation of the current D&aacute;il, however, it was decided to set up a special Committee on the Future of Healthcare, in which we spent 11 months preparing Sl&aacute;intecare.  The Minister endorsed the report but he should have slipped into its slipstream immediately.  In political terms, the Government was provided with serious political cover.  While it is true the report was endorsed by the Government with platitudes, the funding has not been provided and the timelines are already out of date.  The best present a Minister for Health in Ireland could ever receive was not embraced and one must ask why.  Was it because the Minister could not get the Department of Health to cede some control to the new Sl&aacute;intecare initiative or because the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was not supportive or simply because the Government did not believe the current D&aacute;il would last long enough for the programme to be relevant?  I think it is a combination of all three.<\/p>  <p>  I am sick and tired of people referring to the Department of Health as \"Angola\" and saying every Minister who goes in there tries to live to see the day when he or she will get out of it.  For all of us, this should not be the case.  Bad politics for generations has destroyed the Ministry of health.  Bad politics of well over 30 years has turned the Ministry into that which the Taoiseach of the day gives to his naughty pupil whom he needs to bring down a peg or two.  The same applies to the current Taoiseach with his predecessor.  This is not sustainable and we are not doing our public duty.  The Department of Health should be a Ministry for which all of us strive.  It is a Ministry that can effect dramatic change and affect and transform people's lives.  We need to grow up as a Parliament and political institution in how we manage the politics of health.  The Minister's tweet this morning was not wise and did nothing for him.  Some 30 years of continual policy change, counter-change, inconsistency in approach and funding and political arse-covering has not served the people well, which I say while acknowledging that there are many good people working in the administration of health in the country.  If it was possible for the Department of Health and the HSE to be in an even larger disaster zone than previously, that has happened in the past three years.<\/p>  <p>  I could speak for hours on various issues, such as waiting lists; overcrowding; the lack of children's assessments for autism; the catastrophic delays in orthodontic treatment; that there is no national drugs or medicine strategy, genetic strategy or a coherent policy on biosimilars or offering drugs; the scandalous lack of residential care for people with disabilities, which will soon arise again; or that our primary community care strategies are not aligned.  I do not have time to spend on all the issues about which I wish to speak and, therefore, I will concentrate on two in particular.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of the CervicalCheck scandal, the women and their families have been badly let down by rushed decisions and commitments that simply could never be met.  Dr. Scally's initial report was good but the analysis of the laboratories and the detail of what happened therein have not transpired.  We were told last week that Dr. Scally's new report was imminent.  Where is it?  Its delay is worrying.  The report was supposed to have a full quality assurance analysis done on the contracts and the laboratories.  The Committee on Health was told this last week and it was verified.  The analysis is a central plank of the doctor's work.  Why has it been delayed?  Will the Government publish the terms of reference given to Dr. Scally for the module of work and indicate when and how those terms of reference were given to him?  If the report is not published this week, it will be clear that something is afoot.<\/p>  <p>  The review by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, which was to be carried out within months, is unlikely to be completed this year.  Mr. Justice Meenan's tribunal will not even begin this year because legislation needs to be brought through the Houses.  There is the national scandal of Ruth Morrissey having now gone through 15 days of proceedings in the High Court, despite the Taoiseach promising on live national television that such a situation would never happen.  Furthermore, the administration of the HPV vaccine has been delayed, there is a large backlog of 78,000 women waiting for screening results and the system cannot prioritise more vulnerable cohorts of women over others for their results.<\/p>  <p>  I have read hundreds of pages about the children's hospital overrun, of which a significant number of people were aware for some time.  It is simply amazing that since August, many of them were more worried about how it would look and sought public relations advice rather than examining the details of the overrun.  The public now believes that the issue was buried because of the needs of a general election, but the matter is not yet finished.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's utter dysfunctionality and circular 12\/10 need to be further explained.  Are we to believe that no one in that Department for more than a year and a half ever asked one simple question about the largest capital project in the history of the State while one of its own was sitting on the board?  It is insulting to our intelligence.  In addition, the Government has not been honest about which capital projects will be affected by the cock-up.  The Taoiseach has stated that none will be affected but that is a laugh.  It is Trumpesque in its preposterousness.  A minimum of &euro;450 million in cash must be found and some &euro;100 million will have to be reprofiled from other health projects this year, which means the public will not benefit from them.<\/p><p>The new 60-bed unit in Limerick hospital is the greatest example of this.  While it was promised for next September, it will not be in place until at least a year later despite repeated assurances from the Minister as late as last week.  At least the HSE in the mid-west had the decency to be honest with me, Deputy Harty and others in coming forward with the timelines.  The politicisation of the health service and some of the institutions in it has to stop.  I say that with great fear for where it has gone.<\/p> <p> I believe the Minister is a decent person operating in a bad Government in a completely dysfunctional D&aacute;il.  He will survive today because of political convenience but the political management of healthcare in this country needs a complete overhaul for future generations.  We all need to make sure that happens immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000040#SS00800","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550681100,"counter":590,"content":"<p>\"Bring it on.  Walking away is not in my DNA.\"  These are like cheesy lines from a bad Clint Eastwood movie.  I wonder what a woman who has been caught up in the CervicalCheck scandal would think of them.  What would an old person who has spent a night on a trolley think of it?  What would a young person who is suffering as a result of the Government's neglect of mental health services think of it?  What would they think about the idea that Deputy Harris should resign as Minister for Health?  I think many of them would support that.  The country recently witnessed the second national nurses strike in the history of the State, on the Minister's watch.  There is a crisis in recruitment and a crisis in retention, staring the Minister in the face, but he paid no real heed until three days of national strike action woke the Government up and forced the Labour Court to make a recommendation on the issue.<\/p>  <p>  While Deputy Harris is the second Minister for Health to provoke a nurses strike, he is the first in the history of the State to have a national ambulance strike take place on his watch.  Paramedics took to the picket lines on 22 January and 15 February but there was not an inch from the Minister's Department.  He has effectively forced them to declare for strike again on Thursday or Friday of next week.  The issue here is trade union recognition.  The Minister could solve it with a stroke of his pen.  He says he cannot recognise the union in question as he already recognises three unions in the National Ambulance Service.  This union has more members than two of the other three put together and the Minister knows it.  He cannot run from this issue.<\/p>  <p>  The costs at the national children's hospital skyrocketed on the Minister's watch.  The tender for electrical systems was &euro;98 million.  It rose to &euro;157 million.  The tender for mechanical systems was &euro;107 million and rose to &euro;177 million.  The tender for the main construction project was &euro;432 million.  It rose to &euro;556 million.  Overall, costs ballooned by &euro;450 million.  The Minister knew the companies that he was dealing with.  He knew that BAM had overshot its cost estimates at the port of Cork by &euro;12 million.  He knew that BAM had overseen a &euro;21 million increase in cost estimates at the Cork event centre.  Bidding low, winning contracts and then submitting increased cost claims is nothing new in corporate Ireland.  Bring it on.  It brought it on and the taxpayer will be forced to pay again on the Minister's watch.  We will vote no confidence in the Minister but another Fine Gael Minister would most likely do no better, nor would a Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  We have no confidence in Fine Gael or Fianna F&aacute;il, nor do we have confidence in the capitalist market, which continues to play a major role in our health system and which rips the taxpayer off on key construction projects.

For Fianna F&aacute;il to refer to national sabotage for voting no confidence in a Government and Minister that has presided over those failures with all the hardship and suffering that has resulted from it is ridiculous.  Is it not a form of national sabotage of our health system to leave people suffering on trolleys, on waiting lists, and in need of medicines that they cannot get, or to force strikes by healthcare workers who do not want to go on strike but have to because of unsafe staffing levels with chronic staff shortages in the health service?

Who underestimated it?  Was it BAM?  The contract was awarded on foot of a competition.  BAM told the Government what it would cost.  If there was a scope change, then the price would obviously go up, but if the scope was not determined, why did the Government go for a fixed price contract?  It did not give the price to BAM.  BAM gave the price to the Government.  It is not an issue of underestimating the true cost of the project but an issue of awarding a contract at a fixed price and letting it escalate because the Government used the wrong contract.  The T&aacute;naiste said that we must recognise that a significant mistake was made in this process when costs and quantities were being estimated.  Who estimated them?  Did the Government do a public benchmarking analysis prior to tenders going out to contractors?  If so, who did it?  Do they have insurance and will they be held to account?<\/p><p>The Minister said a solid and explicit rationale had been put forward as far back as 2015 and that this was the right way to go.  Was it?  Who put it forward and will they be held to account?  I have said before that we are not at the point of no return; we are only starting and right now the Government does not have a clue where the price is going to end up because of the form of contract being used.  Unless it re-tenders, it will not know where it is going to finish. <\/p> <p> The Taoiseach talked about other big contracts coming in within budget and on time and said we had done this before.  What the Government forgets is that FIDIC, an international document, was used for those contracts but not for this one.  We used a very poor Irish contract, the capital works management framework, in this case and only God knows why.  The Taoiseach said it was not an issue of taxpayers' money being wasted.  It is - hundreds of millions of euro.  If the wrong form of contract is in place, costs are going out of control and the Government refuses to change the contract, I say it is wasting taxpayers' money.  The legal advice on locating the children's hospital on the Mater hospital site was to stay away from the capital works management framework.  Why, therefore, did McCann Fitzgerald advise the board to use the wrong form of contract on the James's Hospital site?  Can the Government answer that question?  Will anyone be held to account?  Did the Government have no problem with the fact that there was a conflict of interest, that a member of McCann Fitzgerald was on the board?  Was that okay?  Why did the Government appoint PwC to review the fiasco?  Was it procured and were procurement rules breached in its appointment?  PwC is not independent.  Does the Government know that it partially drafted the capital works management framework, the framework we are saying that is causing all of the problems?  It had its paws on it and was involved in drafting it.  Is it going to turn around and state its work was poor?  We look forward to that one.  I am sorry to say the truth is the Government has failed with the children's hospital project.  It is losing hundreds of millions of euro because it failed to manage the process properly.<\/p> <p> The notion that this is all the Minister's fault and that he should be held personally responsible is nonsense.  I do not buy that, but I do think the Government should be held to account.  How that is to be done, I am not sure, but the Government is calling for elections in Venezuela. There were elections held there last year and the opposition decided to boycott them because it knew that it would not win.  Now President Trump is organising a coup there.  We are the ones who need an election.  Perhaps we are the ones with the dysfunctional democracy, not Venezuela.  <\/p> <p> I do not expect the Government to understand everything about contracts for construction, but I would expect it to hire the right advisers and do the right thing when problems arise.  However, it is not doing so, at great cost to the people of Ireland.  It is making a huge mistake in not re-tendering.  It is a massive mistake.  By the looks of it, the Government will carry on regardless.  It is unfortunate that it has been given the opportunity to do so by the main party in opposition, which is really disappointing.  While I might not agree with it, I understand the argument made about Brexit and that it cannot go there, but Deputy McGuinness' point is not the worst I have heard.  Why do we not agree now to dissolve the Government at Easter and have an election afterwards?  The manner in which the Government has failed on the children's hospital project is demoralising.  It should not think it is good enough and it should re-think, although it might not look like the right thing to do.  It is politically difficult to make that U-turn, but it is the right thing to do and it should do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000041#TT00400","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550681700,"counter":594,"content":"<p>If the Minister asked the questions Deputy Wallace has asked and sought the answers to them, we would have an exercise in public accountability far better than anything we have done in our terms here.

This morning I was with front-line staff in the CervicalCheck unit in the Rotunda Hospital.  They are fantastic people who provide a world class service.  The Minister will not be surprised to hear that they are not waiting for Deputy Donnelly, me or anyone else here to come and clear the backlogs.  What they would like is for the politicians to allow them to do their jobs, resource them adequately in order that they can do them and then listen to the advice and back off.  If the Minister had listened to the advice of medical people, he would not have provided for the re-test and would have avoided all of the subsequent problems.  I have been very balanced in my dealings with the Minister in terms of his responsibility for it and do not blame him personally or solely for it, but, contrary to his protestations that he did not know and did not act against medical advice, there is information in the public domain to say that statement is not true and in that sense that he may have misled the D&aacute;il.  <\/p>  <p>  I take great offence at the Minister's statement that as one of his gestures to us, he is to provide for mandatory open disclosure, perhaps next year.  We heard that last year from the Taoiseach.

We could have had it in place.  At its heart, the CervicalCheck crisis is one of open disclosure.  I do not think the Minister is the only one to blame, but he is the one at the helm and the national children's hospital project will go down as one of the biggest scandals in the history of the State.

His understanding of the causes of that health service dysfunction has been poor and, unfortunately, not improved in those two and a half years.  His failure to engage with front-line staff is the core reason for his failure to understand the dysfunctional health service.

Another tough job is that of the women and families who have been so desperately affected by the cervical smear scandal.  There is also the matter of the reports of failings in audiology services.  There has been scandal after scandal, week in, week out.  Deputy Harty mentioned the hospital in Limerick, in my local hospital, South Tipperary General Hospital, a total of 35 unfortunate patients are on trolleys.  The front-line staff are under appalling pressure, as they are every day.  They do a great job.  There were 57 patients on trolleys in Limerick, which means there was a total of 92 between the hospitals.  What is the Minister going to do about it?<\/p>  <p>  He could only insult the nurses with his pedantic childish tweeting when they were out on strike.  Some 94% of the 2,000 GPs in the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, do not have confidence in the Minister.  How dare he put out an insulting, childish, and condescending tweet, as he did at 12.45 p.m. today?  Did he think he was in \"High Noon\" or \"The High Chaparral\" and that he was John Wayne, Rambo, or Joe Kidd?  The guys in here are sitting on their hands and letting him away with it week in, week out.  They can talk about the Brexit baby.  Some day it is going to fall and shatter into smithereens and they and the Minister will all be caught under it.  Brexit is serious but it is not serious enough to allow the Minister away with this scandal in respect of the children's hospital.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister would not listen to Dr. Jimmy Sheehan, Dr. Finn Breathnach or Dr. R&oacute;is&iacute;n Healy.  Last week the Minister had to apologise to the D&aacute;il for misleading the House.  I do not know where the Taoiseach has gone; he defended the Minister and ran.  That is what he will do when the Minister is in real trouble.  He will not be at his side, he will be gone.  The Taoiseach said yesterday that he met Dr. Sheehan and Dr. Breathnach.  He never met them.  He has to apologise to the House.  He did not meet those people because they know how to build hospitals and have a track record.  He must apologise to this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000043#VV00200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1550682300,"counter":599,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Ferris's party for tabling this motion.

The other half of the population are faced with mounting costs in terms of health insurance and additional costs for accessing every single service.  As others have said, this Minister was offered an opportunity to address those issues.  Never before has a Minister been offered a cross-party, fully-costed blueprint for the reform of the health service which would achieve a single-tier health service.  This Minister has squandered that unique opportunity.<\/p><p>The final straw, by any standard, is the handling of the national children's hospital.  We know that the Minister was kept informed about the spiralling cost of the children's hospital but another very interesting thing has come to my attention this evening.  Last week, the Taoiseach made the completely false statement that Mr. Paul Quinn, head of the Office of Government Procurement, was precluded from informing anybody about the ballooning costs of the children's hospital.  That statement was, of course, not true and it still needs to be withdrawn.  I was curious as to whether Mr. Quinn had informed the Minister for Health or the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I posed that question to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, this evening.  I asked what contact there had been from Mr. Quinn in respect of the cost overruns.  The Minister said that he met the individual concerned on 5 February and:<\/p><blockquote>At this meeting we discussed his role as a member of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  I am satisfied that he met all of the responsibilities that he had as a member of the board and that the information regarding the project was being shared by the Board with the Department of Health.  I am satisfied that happened. <\/blockquote><p>I also put a question to the Minister for Health.  His reply said: <\/p><blockquote>There were no contacts made by the Office [...] in relation to cost overruns in the National Children's Hospital.  I am advised that the Secretary General of my Department arranged a discussion with the individual concerned [...] on 18 October 2018, relating to the completion of [this process.]<\/blockquote><p>Both things cannot be true.

If we were really implementing Sl&aacute;intecare I do not believe we would have had the nurses' dispute because they would be central to the advance of our health system, as they should be.

That created chaos for CervicalCheck, flawed as it was and granted that the reporting of the misdiagnoses should have been done differently.  It was an occasion for the Government to stand up for the things that sometimes worked in the system.

It is crystal clear that the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance were fully aware of the huge hospital overrun at the time of the last budget.  The Minister for Finance had the chief Government procurement officer on the board of the hospital who was involved at all levels, including financial sub-committee level.  The cover-up included confidentiality pledges to ensure the Government would not be formally or officially informed until after the budget.  That was because it wanted to continue to give massive tax concessions to its super-rich backers.  There is no justification for the Government delaying health and other capital projects and using the excuse of the cost overrun on the children's hospital project.  The hospitals serving my constituency of Tipperary, South Tipperary General Hospital and University Hospital Limerick, are the most overcrowded in the country.  No cancellation, no suspension, no long-fingering and no delaying of capital projects will be tolerated.  I include the completion and opening of the 40-bed modular unit at South Tipperary General Hospital, the building of a new 50-bed unit at the same hospital, the building of a new 100-bed unit at St. Patrick's Hospital in Cashel and the building of a 60-bed unit at University Hospital Limerick.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish super-rich are dripping with wealth and gaining more by the day.

It should bring forward an emergency budget to claw back the &euro;250 million worth of tax concessions given to the super-rich in the last three budgets, including those given to the 25,700 individuals with incomes ranging from &euro;200,000 to in excess of &euro;2 million.<\/p>  <p>  It is time for the Minister for Health to go and to take the Minister for Finance with him-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000044#WW00200","speaker":"1348"},{"type":"speech","time":1550682900,"counter":605,"content":"<p>Here he is now.

Over 700,000 people are waiting on waiting lists for a hospital appointment and the Government is happy to stand over this.  Urgent referrals for child and adolescent mental health services across the State, including County Louth, face a waiting time of three months and there is no out-of-hours service available, over which the Government is happy to stand.  Hospital consultants are working for far fewer hours than they are contracted for in the public system.  As a result, patients are waiting forever to be seen.

The Minister brought a blend of passion, empathy and logic to the campaign to repeal the eighth amendment, successfully making the case for repeal, and contributed significantly to the outcome of the referendum.

That bank, of course, was Anglo Irish Bank.  That is the definition of squandering public money.  By contrast, the Minister, Deputy Harris, has invested one fifteenth of the money wasted in Anglo Irish Bank in a hospital that will serve our nation's sick children for 100 years to come.  This is an investment of which I, as a Fine Gael Minister of State, am extremely proud.  I also remind members of matters historical.

These people are saying that they should act as Minister for Health.  I challenge anyone who is against vaccines to lead public health for the population and be Minister for Health.  The Minister has moved to expand the roll-out of vaccination.  This move will save lives.  The move was not popular initially.  The Minister is someone who took on a fight and faced down critics.

For the past hour, this debate has followed a strange but predictable path.  We have people on my left acting like tour guides, trying to bring us from Belfast to Brussels and then to London.  Let us get back to what this motion of no confidence is about.  It is about the Minister for Health, his record and his capacity to manage his Department.<\/p>  <p>  The cost escalation of the national children's hospital is a story of policy failure, from the design of a flawed two-tier procurement process to a &euro;450 million overrun as a result of the inaction and ineptitude of the current Minister for Health.  In 2016, touting a price of &euro;650 million, the national children's hospital was described by the then Minister, Deputy Varadkar, as the single biggest capital project in the history of Irish healthcare.  It is now the costliest project in the history of Irish healthcare.<\/p>  <p>  I agree this shambles has many faces, and those questions need to be asked into the future.  The matter of who signed off on the procurement process and why is only one of those questions.  From the consultant documentation that has been drip-fed to those of us on Oireachtas committees during recent weeks those failures have become more and more clear.  This was all under the stewardship of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris.  In 2014, the procurement strategy report presented to the development board of the hospital stated that there were advantages and risks to a two-stage process.  They were clearly outlined.  The process saw contractors chosen, contracts signed, cement poured and money paid before a final price had been agreed.  This was all under the stewardship of the current and former Ministers for Health.  Among the risks was the pressure this approach would put on the design team, which, in turn, could lead to cost escalations.  Another risk was that this sort of contract was completely untested and untried in this State.  This was acknowledged in the documentation.  Both these risks have come to pass under the stewardship of the Minister, Deputy Harris.  This was a high-risk strategy that sacrificed value-for-money and cost certainty for a quick build at whatever the final price would be.<\/p>  <p>  According to the report, another advantage was that if the maximum price became too costly to the taxpayer, then a strategic change could be made to change course and lower costs, but this did not happen.  Again, this was decided under the stewardship of the Minister, Deputy Harris.<\/p>  <p>  Strategic change is not the business of civil servants.  It requires the leadership and the engagement of a Minister.  Otherwise, what are Minsters for?  Regardless of the public relations being spun by this Government, the facts are quite simple.  In July 2018 the members of the development board, in the midst of these escalating costs, requested that the Minister, Deputy Harris, reappoint them in the interests of maintaining stability.  I will quote from a response I received from the Minister yesterday.  He said he reappointed the whole board.  This was not done by Fianna F&aacute;il or Sinn F&eacute;in or the taxpayers.  It was the Minister himself who did it.  Before doing so, the Minister said, in reply to a parliamentary question, that he had no conversation with the development board, that he did not assess the performance of the board and that he did not see whether it was doing a good job.  The Minister got a request, signed off on it and asked no questions.  For me, that is a direct failing on his part.  It should be looked at and, obviously, has consequences.<\/p>  <p>  The next issue is the overrun of the project of at least &euro;191 million and as much as &euro;400 million dating from 27 August.  This information was given to no one.  The Minister for Health withheld it from his own Minister for Finance and from the Cabinet.  Three days later, the sub-committee dealing with the matter asked everyone on the board to sign a confidentiality agreement.  Maybe those involved asked the Minister to sign a confidentiality agreement as well given that he did not tell anyone about it.<\/p>  <p>  There are many reasons - I do not have time to go into all of them - the Minister is not up to this.  We are spending &euro;11 billion in the coming years - thanks to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe - on health capital projects.  We need a Minister who will have his eye on the ball in respect of those capital projects or that &euro;11 billion could easily become &euro;13 billion or &euro;15 billion.  That is our money &ndash; taxpayers' money.  The Minister is not fit for the job and he should go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000046#YY01400","speaker":"1280"},{"type":"speech","time":1550684700,"counter":655,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, agus molaim an r&uacute;n m&iacute;mhuin&iacute;ne seo san Aire Slainte, an Teachta Simon Harris.

What this motion has at its heart is political accountability.  It is about taxpayer accountability and ensuring the answers for which people are yearning are given to the questions they are asking.  <\/p>  <p>  We are told by Fianna F&aacute;il that accountability has to be suspended because of the issue of Brexit, that no matter what, its party will not vote no confidence in any Minister in this Government and that it is handing over a blank cheque to each and every Minister no matter how badly he or she runs his or her Department.  This is form for Fianna F&aacute;il, a party which has handed out many blank cheques in the past, whether to bankers or to developers. <\/p>  <p>  The reality is that accountability cannot be suspended, and no matter what, even if this motion of no confidence succeeds tonight, it will not precipitate a general election.  Let us be clear about that.  The Taoiseach will not run to the park and ask the President to dissolve the D&aacute;il if a motion of no confidence in Deputy Harris is passed here today.

Hundreds of patients are lying on hospital trolleys every single day and scoliosis plan after plan are not being implemented.

Deputy Simon Harris spoke at his Ardfheis and called on Fianna Fail to stop this nonsense where its members were going into his Department and checking the figures and all the rest of that.  He told Fianna F&aacute;il to get on with it and to recommit to the confidence and supply agreement.  He knew of the hundreds of millions euros of overspend in his Department on this project.  The Minister did this because he knows that Fianna F&aacute;il are completely impotent and incompetent at holding the Government to account.  <\/p>  <p>  We have been patient with the Minister because we could have put down this motion on many occasions in the past number of years, but this is the straw that broke the camel's back.  This is about political accountability.  I say to Members who genuinely believe this Minister has failed sick children, has failed our elderly, has failed our vulnerable and failed the taxpayer in his handling of the national children's hospital that they have only one thing to do and that is to vote no confidence in the Minister.  If they fail to do that, they are the people keeping this incompetent Minister in his job in the weeks and months ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000047#ZZ00700","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1550685300,"counter":662,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1550685300,"counter":663,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il divided by electronic means.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1550685600,"counter":664,"content":"<p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>As a teller in the previous vote, and given the enormity of sums involved, I propose we give some of those Deputies who abstained or voted confidence in the Minister another opportunity to vote.

In total, there is an amount of &euro;66.6 billion in gross voted expenditure allocated in the REV.  The vast majority of this provision relates to day-to-day current expenditure, amounting to &euro;59.3 billion, with a further &euro;7.3 billion allocated to capital expenditure.<\/p><p>The current expenditure allocations in REV 2019 reflect Government priorities.  Funding for the key day-to-day public services of social protection, health and education combined amounts to almost &euro;47 billion.  These three sectors together account for almost 79% of total gross voted current expenditure.  A total of &euro;7.3 billion is allocated to capital investment in 2019.  This represents an increase of &euro;1.3 billion, or more than 22%, on last year&rsquo;s outturn.  This will play an important role in delivering public infrastructure across Ireland, especially in areas such as social housing, education, including for schools and higher education, healthcare, and transport.  Additional funding is being provided for enterprise supports to support economic growth and promote jobs growth in both the domestic and foreign owned sectors.  Increased funding is also provided to support investment in areas, including flood defences and climate change mitigation.<\/p><p>I will now turn to some of the key areas.  The allocation for health for 2019 is more than &euro;17 billion, reflecting our commitment to supporting our health sector.  This represents an increase of more than &euro;1 billion on the amount spent in 2018.  Given this level of resourcing, we must continue to ensure that increased resources are matched with higher levels of accountability and transparency.<\/p><p>Housing has also been prioritised for 2019, with an overall allocation to the Vote of &euro;4 billion.  This represents a 19% significant increase in year-on-year terms.<\/p><p>This year's allocation to education amounts to &euro;10.8 billion, an increase of more than 5%.  This will allow for the recruitment of additional teachers and special needs assistants, and enable a more targeted investment in higher and further education to meet the skills and education needs of the labour market.<\/p><p>An allocation of &euro;20.5 billion has been made to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  This allocation includes provision for the &euro;5 changes in the weekly working age payments.  These increases will be implemented over the coming weeks.<\/p><p>In accordance with the revised budgetary timetable introduced at European Union level as part of the two-pack the Estimates for 2019 were required to be published before the end of 2018.  In the period since the publication of the REV, my Department has been engaging with the Department of Health and with other Departments on how the increased costs of the national children&rsquo;s hospital project will be managed within the overall capital allocation for 2019 of &euro;7.3 billion.<\/p><p>The process concluded with the Government deciding last week to make some reallocation decisions.  These decisions were made with a view to minimising any disruption in the roll-out and delivery of key projects.<\/p> <p> I am presenting Further Revised Estimates to reflect an additional allocation of &euro;75 million in gross capital expenditure for the Department of Health.  The increase in the net voted health Estimate is &euro;65 million, as the Department of Education and Skills has agreed to pay in 2019, &euro;10 million of an existing &euro;17 million commitment to higher education facilities in the national children's hospital.  As this funding is to come from within the existing overall amount allocated to the higher education capital subhead, it does not give rise to a Further Revised Estimate for the education Vote.  The increase in the net voted expenditure amount for health of &euro;65 million is offset by reductions across a number of Departments and includes a rescheduling of &euro;27 million arising in relation to the A5; a rescheduling of &euro;10 million arising in relation to the National Forensic Science Laboratory; an updating of the scheduled draw-down of &euro;16 million from two Project Ireland 2040 funds which are being profiled for expenditure throughout the course of 2019 and 2020, without delays in project planning, design and delivery.  There will be a re-profiling of payments of &euro;4 million under certain programmes of investment in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment; a sum of &euro;3 million from the re-profiling of investment under the flood risk management programme of the Office of Public Works, and a revision of the schedule for the draw-down of funding in the public expenditure and reform and finance groups of Votes, totalling &euro;3 million.  There will be &euro;2 million through changes to the timing of payments related to certain capital works by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  The changes outlined in the Further Revised Estimates amount to less than 1% of the original 2019 capital budget presented in December.<\/p> <p> In recent years Ireland has made much progress in delivering projects on time and within budget.  In particular, recent years have seen major progress in improving delivery of water and wastewater, roads and public transport projects.  Reforms are being considered which are designed to extend the same levels of professionalism and performance across the public capital programme more broadly.  In that regard, it is important to note a number of measures which are under way.  They are specifically focused on avoiding a repeat of sudden increases in costs associated with the very largest projects.  New procedures are being developed in the context of the ongoing review of the public spending code and the new medium-term strategy for the Office of Government Procurement.  In particular, I draw the attention of the House to revisions to the public spending code in the following areas.  The Government will not pre-commit to the very largest projects until there is clarity on the final tendered cost.  Two-stage procurement processes with parallel working will be avoided in most cases and a better premium for risk will be built in for bespoke projects.  Consideration has also been given to carrying out external expert reviews to test cost estimates, as well as to linking advisory firm payments with performance.<\/p> <p> Over the course of Project Ireland 2040, there will be total investment of approximately &euro;116 billion in key State infrastructural projects.  It is important, therefore, to put in place and strengthen structures to mitigate the risk of capital cost overruns in the future.  Adopting these measures will help to ensure the right high level of discipline, professionalism and performance in the allocation of the resources of the taxpayer and the provision of capital projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000050#CCC00200","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550686500,"counter":670,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Thomas Byrne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000051#DDD00200","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1550686500,"counter":671,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

They are the result of the Government's mismanagement of the process to deliver the national children's hospital.  We are well aware that there are many outstanding questions about how we arrived at this sorry state of affairs, as indicated in the Minister's apology to the House last week.  When was he first informed of the potential for an overrun which, in the Government's words, crystalised some months thereafter?  There have been many meanderings, as well as a great deal of secrecy.  Attempts have been made to hide behind freedom of information protocols in relation to unanswered questions.  I expect the same procrastination not to be in vogue when PwC looks for information which was not forthcoming when I asked for it recently.  There will be ongoing and continued scrutiny by the relevant Oireachtas committees.  The Secretary General of the Minister for Finance's Department will appear before one of the committees in the coming days which will provide an opportunity for further attempts to be made on the part of Members of the House to establish if it was the case that in rushing the project in order to maximise political gains from it, the Government took its eye off the ball in the approval process and the contracts associated with it.  Obviously, the contracts as negotiated have proved to be porous.<\/p>  <p>  While the information the Minister for Finance has provided says a lot, unfortunately, it does not say enough.  The Minister said he was bringing forward proposals on how best to provide for contracts such as this.  That pre-empts and is not exclusive from the Government's perspective because it may well be that the further recommendations will be made on foot of the information that will emanate from the investigation.  The Minister will be conscious of the questions asked and the answers that will flow back from officials in his Department and others.  For example, I asked him last week about the &euro;500 million made available for the project by the European Investment Bank, but I have yet to receive a reply.  I expect that a process was entered into with the bank, as that is predominantly the case, and that there is a reporting mechanism between the Government and the bank in respect of its investment.  It must be borne in mind that when the bank made the offer originally, it amounted to approximately 50% of the total cost of the project, albeit at this juncture, it is no more than 30%.  We will be seeking to establish in the coming weeks and months whether there is a handle on the costs.  Have they been arrested and can the Government assure the public and the Members who represent them that it will not bring forward Further Revised Estimates on top of the &euro;100 million in the Estimates before us?  It does not stop at that because there is &euro;450 million to be made up.  The Minister says that in the spring statement he will give us details of the effect on capital expenditure under the national development plan next year and in subsequent years.  I hope that information will be forthcoming.<\/p>  <p>  I have perused some of the detail in the Minister's script.  He said &euro;16 million was being taken from the Department of Community and Rural Development and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  It is explained as \"an updating of the scheduled draw-down of &euro;16 million from the two Project Ireland regeneration funds which are being profiled for expenditure throughout the course of 2019 and 2020 without delays in project planning, design and delivery.\"  To me, that is gobbledygook.  The money is being spent over the course of 2019 and 2020, but &euro;16 million is being taken off.  The Minister went on to say &euro;13 million would be taken off in 2019, but he did not provide the details of where.  That is the information our constituents want.  If the Taoiseach wants to say, as he did in the House yesterday, that we should not scaremonger or give the impression that the knock-on effects of the overruns will be felt in every item of capital expenditure in our constituencies, the Government must prove it to us.  From which rural and community development projects is the &euro;3 million being taken?  What regeneration projects are affected?  Is the &euro;13 million being taken from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in the same area and what exactly does it contain?<\/p><p>Further, there is re-profiling of payments of &euro;4 million under certain programmes of investment in the Department of Communications, Climate Change and Environment.  Insofar as the Minister wishes to enlighten us, that is not enough.  In the coming days I hope and expect to receive further clarification of exactly what is involved.<\/p> <p> There is &euro;3 million from the re-profiling of investment under the flood risk management programme of the Office of Public Works to allow for capacity to be built over the course of the NDP period.  What are the bread and butter details of the projects affected?  Flood relief and flood management works are ongoing - I am told that they will continue in the future - on the River Shannon in my constituency, but what projects are being lost?  What commitments can I maintain when my constituents ask about inclusion of projects or about the knock-on effect?<\/p> <p> There is &euro;2 million through changes to the timing of payments related to certain capital works by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  Again, a commitment was given by the Government to me and my colleagues in my constituency about an arts centre in Tullamore.  It was approved ten years ago, but it has been re-profiled, to use the Minister's word, to cut the cloth to measure.  Extra expenditure is needed which we were told was in the offing, but now we are being told that &euro;2 million is being cut from the budget for it.  My constituents in Tullamore need a commitment one way or the other in that regard.  They have raised between &euro;180,000 and &euro;200,000 for the project.  Will they have to raise the same amount again?  That is what I need to know and it is what I am expected to know from the details put before the House and its elected representatives.<\/p> <p> There are other similar details which we will seek to clarify in the coming days through written applications and confirmations that I would expect to receive from the various Departments or the Minister's Department as the lead Department because ultimately it was his decision based on his consultations with his colleagues in the Cabinet that led to this.  Make no mistake, however, this is something that could have been taking place if the information had been brought to us last September.  Despite the fact that the Minister did not say something during his consultations with the Department of Health on current expenditure - I accept his word in that regard - I cannot understand how he never asked at any stage how the Department was getting on, whether capital expenditure was on target and within profile or whether he would have to go before the D&aacute;il to rectify the position in the coming year.  That question was not asked and in the absence of it being asked we are only now debating the revisions before us.  Because of the delay and procrastination I mentioned we do not have the specific details.  Therefore, I will insist on receiving and expect to be given minute details in order that we can be straight with our constituents on various projects throughout the country, which is no more than they would expect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000051#DDD00400","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550687100,"counter":674,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Cowen for sharing his time with me.  <\/p>  <p>  I question the &euro;10 million prepayment related to the Department of Education and Skills which the Minister has said is not part of the Further Revised Estimates.  My understanding of the Estimates process is that the D&aacute;il is required to consider the Estimates for each financial year.  We have not considered the Estimate from the Department of Education and Skills for the national children's hospital.  How is it possible for a Department, without having the Estimate considered by the D&aacute;il, to prepay for something that will be a liability at some point in the future?  Will the Minister explain that liability?  It was not explained to me in the reply to a parliamentary question I tabled on the issue.  What is the liability?  What is the contract the Department has entered into that requires the payment of &euro;10 million now?  What authority has the Department to prepay taxpayers' money for something it has not received?  I have never heard of a Department prepaying for services or capital projects.  Should we not have a separate Estimate to consider the issue?<\/p>  <p>  More importantly, because one can always get around the technical details in some way, what are the &euro;10 million worth of education projects that are not going ahead because of the prepayment to the Department of Health?  That is a key issue.  I believe they are in the third level sector.  The Minister will say the money is within the third level sector and can be moved to deal with another issue at third level, but this is being moved to pay for something in the future at third level.  God only knows when the children's hospital will be built, given the way the Government is behaving.  We must know what projects are losing out because of this and whether the Minister has the authority to move the money which was considered by the D&aacute;il for expenditure this year to meet expenditure next year.  Therefore, Members of the D&aacute;il and taxpayers are entitled to assume that the &euro;10 million is being used for projects this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000052#EEE00200","speaker":"1225"},{"type":"speech","time":1550687100,"counter":675,"content":"<p>I will not take the full ten minutes allocated to me as most of the nitty-gritty of this issue will be discussed at committees.  It is unfortunate that we still have not received the details of projects, if any, such as flood relief schemes that will be delayed.  We do not know if any of them will be put back.  Some &euro;3 million is coming from the Office of Public Works.  When the Minister of State appeared before the finance committee last week, he stated it would come from the funding for flood relief schemes.  It is worth noting that when he was questioned about the figure of &euro;3 million and whether he thought there were savings he could make in the Department, he was non-committal.  However, he did say the figure of &euro;3 million was just given to him by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and that there had been no consultation on whether the amount could be re-profiled for particular projects.  I presume it was the same with other Departments, that the Minister drew up a list of moneys which were needed to meet the overspend of &euro;100 million on the national children's hospital project.  Will he confirm whether his Department decided on the figures and just presented them to the various Ministers or if there was consultation with them on the figures that were presented to them?  Certainly, my understanding having listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Boxer Moran, is that the figure was just presented to him and that he was told to cut his cloth accordingly.  Perhaps the Minister might confirm if that was the case in all Departments.<\/p>  <p>  I am inclined to vote against sending the Further Revised Estimates back to the committees, unless we receive a commitment tonight that the details will be made available when we discuss the Further Revised Estimates at the committees.  Like every other Deputy, I have tried to get details of the projects that will be affected, but I have been unsuccessful to date.  I am sure they are available to the Minister; I presume he knows what projects will be delayed.  In the case of the Office of Public Works and flood relief schemes, has the Minister of State, Deputy Boxer Moran, given the Minister a list of the projects that will be delayed?  Who knows the details?  Unless I receive a commitment from the Minister that the committees will receive these details, I am reluctant to send the Further Revised Estimates back to them.  The last thing I want to do is send back the Further Revised Estimates to the committees only for our spokespersons not to receive that information.  Obviously, there is a majority on the committees to pass the Further Revised Estimates and send them back to the D&aacute;il for approval.

I am sure the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, feels it is not his fault.  After all, he gave the Minister for Health &euro;600 million from the back of the sofa for current spending.<\/p>  <p>  The country is now seriously questioning the competence of this Administration.  The Government has spent a great deal of time engaging in spin, rather than in managing and problem solving.  To some extent, it has come back to bite it and only time will tell for how long it will persist.  There are serious problems with current and capital spending in the Department of Health.  As others said, the health budget is an omnishambles which is making a shambles of the Government's overall budget.  The Government inherited a situation where the previous Government had done much of the heavy lifting and made many of the difficult decisions.  The Government was sailing.  It is deeply regrettable that this has happened and that ordinary people throughout the country will face the consequences.<\/p><p> The Taoiseach claims that the additional &euro;100 million in expenditure allocated to health in 2019 will not lead to any projects being cut or delayed.  This is possible if the Government increases the allocation to capital spending from &euro;7.3 billion to &euro;7.4 billion, but the opening part of the Minister's speech does not indicate this.  This is not what is proposed.  The Taoiseach is using smoke and mirrors to claim that as the Government is spending &euro;7.3 billion this year, which is &euro;20 million per day, &euro;100 million is only five days' worth of spending and the figures can therefore be massaged in such a way that we do not need to look too closely at where the &euro;100 million will come from.  However, we do need to look closely at where the Government is spending money and we need clarity as to where it will cut money that it had promised to spend on other projects.<\/p> <p> We see in the Further Revised Estimates some indication as to where the extra &euro;100 million for the children's hospital will come from.  Health is being allocated a net additional &euro;65 million.  This means that the Department will have to cut &euro;35 million from other investments to make up the extra &euro;100 million that must be spent on the children's hospital this year.  I think the Minister can confirm that we are right about this.  Where will this &euro;35 million come from?  The briefing note we have received does not make this clear, and the Government must provide this information before we can endorse these Further Revised Estimates.  I know that it is &euro;1.5 million in respect of the Department of Finance capital Vote and minus &euro;1.5 million on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Vote, plus the &euro;3 million referred to in respect of the Office of Public Works and flood risk management.  Where will the Government cut &euro;65 million in allocations across other Departments?  The Government claims it will reschedule the A5 motorway to save &euro;27 million.  Let us call a spade a spade: the A5 motorway is being delayed.  The national forensic science laboratory will also be delayed, saving &euro;10 million.  Money to be spent on Project Ireland 2040 regeneration funds will be drawn down in 2020 rather than 2019, saving &euro;16 million in 2019, as referred to by the Minister.  To be clear, though, this will add &euro;16 million to the capital budget in 2020.  While there might be no delay to delivery in 2019 by simply postponing the payment, this does not conjure money out of thin air.  Any delayed payments from 2019 will displace other capital spending in 2020, so when that &euro;16 million is spent in 2020, some other project will be delayed or cut by &euro;16 million to make up for that.  This is why we need these Further Revised Estimates - in order that we can call a spade a spade and be clear as to what is being delayed and what is being cut in order to cover the cost overruns on the children's hospital and the shambles the project has become.<\/p> <p> I will acknowledge that on page 6 of the Minister's script, he pretty much makes an apology.  It is not couched as an apology because his Government does not do apologies or acknowledgements.  The spin is that \"New procedures are being developed in the context of the ongoing review\" and so on.  The Minister wants to draw our attention in his nice little speech to the revisions in the public spending code and procurement practices.  This is the Department of Finance's polite way of saying, \"Lads, we got it wrong, and this is what we are changing.\"  What is the Department changing then?  The Government will not pre-commit to major bespoke projects \"until there is clarity on final cost\", after tenders have been received and evaluated.  This is not what the Government did the first time.  The script continues: \"Two stage procurement with parallel working will be avoided in most cases - preliminary works will not commence until there is full approval of the project.\"  The Minister, with two or three Ministers working alongside him, is saying his Department, over which he has responsibility and oversight, is not doing the blatantly obvious.  The script continues: \"The budgets for large bespoke projects will include a significant premium for risks so that these indicative costings more adequately reflect the holistic total for the entire project over its lifecycle.\"  I have heard about adding and subtracting but I have not heard about \"holistic totals\" before.  Is this some kind of new karma that Fine Gael has found, that instead of simple adding and subtracting, which gives people the right figures, we are into \"holistic totalling\"?  It also states \"Consideration is also being given to carrying out external expert review to rigorously test cost estimates and linking Advisory firm payments to performance.\"  Whatever civil servant came up with this page-long quasi-apology for making a total mess of things, the Department of Finance needs some kind of group discussion, group hug or whatever it is the Department is doing these days and it needs to try to get its act together.<\/p> <p> I think the public has caught up with the Government.  Right around the country, wherever I go, people are talking about the disaster of the children's hospital.  The Government is now viewed as not being competent in spending money.  The Minister of State sitting beside the Minister gets on the radio every couple of days to explain why he cannot really do much about insurance costs.  He just wings his way through various interviews telling us that whatever he thinks he is doing is working, while the rest of the country knows it is not.<\/p> <p> When the Minister comes before the committee - tomorrow, I think - will he actually deal with the figures honestly?  We know the children's hospital is a shambles and we know he has made plans to continue it as is.  On page 6 of his script, he has offered this four-point change of policy, which is just finance gobbledegook.  It is meant not to be understood by ordinary people.  What ordinary people do understand, however, is that they and their children cannot buy houses, cannot afford rents if they are in the rental market and are often in precarious work on very low pay.  In the meantime, the Government is throwing around significant sums on a mismanaged project on an historic scale.  It does not even have the grace to apologise to people who faithfully pay their taxes and to businesses that pay their taxes and make their contributions.  They do not pay these taxes or contributions in order that the Government can mess up and then produce a litany of gobbledegook here that is unworthy of both the Department of Finance and those who have the honour to serve as its Ministers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000052#EEE00400","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550687700,"counter":678,"content":"<p>I asked at the Business Committee, of which I am a member, for this debate on the Revised Estimates, which were going to be just pushed straight to the individual committees.  This was according to the Government's proposed schedule of business.  I objected to this for the same reasons that the Government very much needs to be held to account for what has happened with the children's hospital.  I was not willing to let these Estimates go through on the nod down to the committees, but that is what the Government wanted.  It could be argued that the individual line items would be dealt with in the committees but so doing is only one aspect of this process.  It was wrong for the Government to propose that Members not debate how it would handle the overspend in the context of the whole picture for this year.  The Government should not have proposed this, and I wonder why it did.  It wanted discussion to go down to the line items because it would potentially be embarrassing for the Government to talk about how it would manage the overspend in the context of this year's budget.<\/p><p>That is part of the problem that has led us to the mess of the bigger issue of the hospital.  There is too much public relations management and not enough scrutiny of detail, of the management of public money or of its importance.  We all have a responsibility to scrutinise these matters.<\/p> <p> Now that we are discussing expenditure, there a few issues we need to consider.  It is not credible for the Government to appear in the Chamber week in, week out, while we appeal for often much smaller sums for this or that project.  I sought &euro;400,000 for a service, provided by the Cottage Home, for children suffering from emotional difficulties in Shankill to keep three people employed to serve 50 families.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, however, stated the Government just could not find &euro;400,000.  While she agreed that the service should not be cut, she stated she could not find the money.  I asked whether there could be a Revised Estimate to find the &euro;400,000 for a service that she knew should not be cut but she replied that she could not do that.  Lo and behold, the Government can come up with a Revised Estimate for &euro;65 million for next year and, apparently, it will affect nothing at all.  We cannot find &euro;400,000 but we can find &euro;65 million and it will affect nothing.<\/p> <p> Could the Minister for Finance honestly blame us for being a bit sceptical about that, given what has happened with the hospital?  Could he blame us for finding it somewhat incredible?  We then hear speeches and explanations from the Government in the past number of days and weeks using words such as \"rescheduling\" and \"reprofiling\".  That is spin.  The money must come from somewhere.  If it does not, the Government must have a load of money hidden down the couch which it can pull out at any stage, or is it a matter of accounting tricks?  The Government should tell us the truth.  Is it playing around with accounting without consequences?  What the Government is saying is not credible.<\/p> <p> As for the bigger picture, before the committees get down to the line items, what will be the knock-on consequences for the next number of years?  That is not being factored into what the Government tells us about the consequences of the overspend.  For this year, it says the overspend will be &euro;100 million, although we have not heard the details of what that will mean for the health sector and we have heard only general explanations of what it will mean for a whole number of Departments.  Perhaps the details will become clearer at committees, but what will it mean for multi-annual commitments that will be necessary to deliver on a whole series of capital infrastructure projects that, by their nature, are multi-annual and long term?  We do not know but there is not a shadow of a doubt that it will have consequences.  Projects that would have received money either will not receive it or will be significantly delayed.  If the Government manages the immediate crisis, however, perhaps it can deal with the problem further down the line.  That is political management rather than just telling the truth about the consequences of this disastrous overspend.  That is the problem.<\/p> <p> One can trace the scandal all the way back to the public relations imperative to announce the project and have ribbons cut, which is doubtless what was happening.  As a result, the Government does not keep its eyes on the detail.  Fine Gael always speaks about financial prudence, fiscal management, responsible management of the public finances and so on, but the public relations imperative overrode the need for basic scrutiny.<\/p> <p> Incidentally, I think the Minister is hardworking and I accept that much of the problem predates him.  Circumstances have improved, not just because of Fine Gael but also because of pressure from the Opposition.  We recently discussed billions of euros in tax expenditure.  While it was largely due to pressure from the Opposition, I accept the Government has started to consider it.  Every year, billions of euros are spent that nobody examines.  Nobody has examined these decisions and they are taken on the nod.  In the case of the hospital, the public relations political imperative overrode good governance.<\/p> <p> Many questions remain unanswered.  What happened to the &euro;35 million that was invested in the design brief before the project was moved to the St. James's Hospital site?  I was speaking to an architect who said the basic problem was that the brief was not tight enough.  He could not understand how the &euro;35 million that was invested in the brief, which outlines the main components of the project, just disappeared.  Some &euro;35 million of the &euro;39 million that was invested in the brief was written off - poof, it was gone.  We then heard the figure of &euro;450 million and the contract was signed with BAM.  Is it not just bad governance, a lack of scrutiny and a lack of focus on detail that allowed BAM to be awarded the contract?  I would like to know which Ministers are responsible for overlooking these matters because there will be consequences for other capital projects.  It is the business of Ministers if in the largest infrastructural project in the recent history of the State, or even in its entire history, there is a difference of &euro;175 million between the lowest bidder and the next bidder, particularly when that lowest bidder has a history of significant overruns in this country, the Netherlands and Britain.  I cannot believe that nobody knew about it, that nobody was concerned or that nobody examined all the line items and asked serious questions about how the gap could exist.<\/p> <p> The Minister referred to the two-stage process.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith tabled a parliamentary question asking why it was chosen and so on.  In reply, we received a load of gobbledegook about competition and that the Government believed it would improve the tendering process by making it more competitive.  Did the ideological mantra of competition, to which Fine Gael is committed, turn out to be more competitive?  No, it turned out to be a disaster.  It was nonsense, fake competition by bidders which had a history of underbidding.  In the Minister's speech, he indicated that the Government would be more cautious about the two-stage process, that there would be external expert reviews, that there would be a premium for risks and so on.  We need to have a serious discussion about what all that means and about what it will mean in practice to avoid these issues.<\/p> <p> What about profit?  The Minister might give a little information about the profits being made by BAM and the other contractors.

The allocation for capital spending since then has shown a welcome return to investment in public infrastructure.  For nearly a decade since 2008, the Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Governments kept capital spending below the 2% depreciation rate, which was an utterly disgraceful policy.<\/p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The health capital envelope this year is &euro;667 million out of a budget of &euro;17 billion.  The resumption of urgently needed spending on national infrastructure makes it even more critical that spending be closely invigilated and accounted for.  The escalation in costs at the national children&rsquo;s hospital is shocking and evidence of a systemic failure by the Ministers for Health and Public Expenditure and Reform.  In 2013 the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, sold the National Lottery licence for &euro;405 million which we thought would be the cost of the national children's hospital.  During the Taoiseach's time as Minister for Health, the cost shot up to &euro;890 million.  By the autumn of 2017, construction and additional costs had escalated to &euro;1.26 billion.  If we are to believe the Minister for Health, by 28 August, the cost had ballooned to more than &euro;1.7 billion.<\/p> <p> A few weeks ago the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, informed me about the role of his Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform under the public spending code, the capital works management framework, the chief procurement officer and the Government contracts committee in closely invigilating capital projects.  The Minister refused, however, to answer my questions about how and why the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board had sought and obtained a derogation from national procurement rules to permit a two-stage procurement process for the hospital project.  He just would not deal with them.  That disastrous decision was made in May 2014 and I understand it was reiterated in January 2016 because there was a January 2017 time limit.  Given the projected size of the earlier estimates for the hospital project, was that decision approved by the then Cabinet, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and the four person steering committee of the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach and other Ministers in the 2011 to 2016 Government?  That is what we would like to know.<\/p> <p> The astonishing decision made by the Minister for Health not to inform his Cabinet colleagues clearly would be a resigning matter in most democracies, despite the vote earlier today.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, could not explain why his management board with its quarterly agenda item of high level risks had not picked up on the cost explosion for the national children's hospital.  I looked at the minutes of meetings of his management committee and it is unbelievable that he would not have known what was happening in August and September 2018.  We have been following politics at Westminster closely in the past couple of years and there is no question that, if this was the Westminster Parliament, both Ministers, Deputies Harris and Donohoe, would have had to go.  Unfortunately for them, they would have had to resign.<\/p> <p> Constituents suspect that the Taoiseach and his colleagues intended to call a general election last November.  The call was with the Taoiseach before Christmas and it was clearly the intention that the fact that spending was out of control on the children's hospital project would not be revealed until after the general election.  My constituents in Dublin Bay North are deeply concerned about further delays and the failure to progress major capital projects in the constituency.  A few weeks ago Dublin City Council approved the long hoped for 20-bed cystic fibrosis unit at Beaumont Hospital, but now there are fears that there will be further delays.  When we were both in opposition, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and I met the management and staff of Beaumont Hospital to discuss the urgently needed new modern emergency department at the hospital.  After three years of sitting in the high chair at the Cabinet table, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, has been unable to get the project beyond design stage.  Designers were to be appointed.  There are other long promised primary care centre projects in the north fringe, in Belmayne, Clongriffin and Raheny, which are not happening.  We heard the itemisation of current expenditure and about what had happened.  The Parliamentary Budget Office has been very critical of health spending and accountability for it.  The Further Revised Estimates represent a disgraceful failure by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe's Department.  Unfortunately, both Ministers should go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000054#GGG00600","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550688900,"counter":686,"content":"<p>Fine Gael is very creative when it comes to finding money and especially justifying the removal of &euro;100 million from other capital projects by using words such as \"rescheduling\", \"re-profiling\" and \"adjustments\".  Let us call them what they are: cuts.  If one reschedules funds for a project, essentially one is delaying the provision of funding for that project for at least another year.  That is a cut.  Not only is it a financial loss, it is also a loss of time dedicated to the project.  The people who were to benefit are directly affected by the delay and, economically, when a project is delayed, the economic development of the region is also affected negatively.  I would not even call them cuts but daylight robbery.  My constituency of Donegal will be affected disproportionately by the removal of &euro;100 million from capital project funding.  It was targeted disproportionately during years of austerity and is still reaping the consequences.  The trend of targeting the county continues today.  The so-called rescheduling of &euro;27 million from the A5 motorway project in Northern Ireland is a dramatic blow.  With many others, I have been campaigning for the project for a number of years.  The upgrade was badly needed years ago and we cannot afford to have it rescheduled, as the Minister calls it.  Will he tell us what the new schedule will be and if a guarantee will be put in place to ensure no further rescheduling will take place, although we cannot know what those guarantees would be worth?<\/p>  <p>  My other concern is the mysterious cuts or rescheduling of &euro;24 million to be spend on other health facilities in County Donegal.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has not yet specified which health projects will be affected by the need to reschedule the spending of this money.  Some have raised concerns that Sheil Hospital in Ballyshannon might be affected, but we do not know for certain.  I pay tribute to the board in Limerick board for coming out and indicating what was happening, whereas, unfortunately, the HSE in County Donegal was playing the game and covering up the cuts for the Government.  I am concerned about other long sought after projects such as those at St. Joseph's community hospital in Stranorlar and the community hospital in Ramelton.  People cannot deal with the uncertainty which the cuts have fuelled further.  The list goes on.<\/p>  <p>  County Donegal will also be affected by the proposed re-profiling or cutting of &euro;3 million from investment under the flood risk management programme in the Office of Public Works.  Constituents are worried that funding will be removed from the flood relief scheme plan for Buncrana which is sorely needed.  If it is flooded this year, will we tell them that it was not cut but that the funding was just re-profiled?  The Minister has not been able to tell us how the re-profiling of payments of &euro;4 million under certain programmes of investment in the areas of communications, climate action and environment will affect the meeting of Ireland's climate action obligations, both internationally and domestically, and its overall transition to a low carbon economy.<\/p>  <p>  It is always baffling how easily the Government can find &euro;100 million in Departments when it wants to do so, but when it is asked to fund mental health services, the recruitment of nurses or increases in homeless services, suddenly there is no money available.  The saddest thing of all is that Fine Gael is taking the money from other projects to cover its inability to manage large-scale projects.  That shows an incredible level of incompetence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000055#HHH00200","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1550688900,"counter":687,"content":"<p>Language takes on a new meaning in the Minister's and the Minister of State's speeches on the Further Revised Estimates.

They can put up with waiting if things are done in a just and fair way.  The Minister for Finance has said there are no cuts.  He used words such as \"rescheduling\", \"revising\" and \"re-profiling\" and told us that they did not mean cuts.  If they do not, it begs the question why he did not come in before now, not with reference to the national children's hospital but to address the issue of there being so much scope for re-profiling, rescheduling and revising.  Why did he not come here to use that money?  My colleague Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned money.  A lot less money, &euro;70,000, is needed for the Galway Autism Partnership which will go under if it does not receive it.  I do not have time to go into the details, but it begs that question.  The Minister talked about putting procedures in place.  We were told at the Committee of Public Accounts that all procedures were in place.  We were told that as we could not rely on the public service, something with which I do not agree, private people were brought in because of their expertise.  It beggars belief the Minister is coming forward and telling us that this will not happen again.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015, before my time, the board appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts and stated there had been \"learnings\", the lovely word we keep using here.

Quite simply, some of the revised figures are astonishing.  I note, in particular, the health Estimates.  In 2015 the health budget was &euro;13.2 billion; in 2016 it was &euro;14 billion; in 2017, &euro;14.8 billion; and in 2018, &euro;16,051 billion, while this year it is &euro;16.953 billion.  On that basis and with that level of expenditure, a person would think we would see some value for money and accountability.  Earlier we debated a motion of confidence in the Minister for Health who arrogantly tweeted today, thinking he was John Wayne or someone else riding into the High Chapparal.  He is just punch drunk.  He has no experience and is not accountable to anyone, but he will be accountable to the people of County Wicklow, where, please God, he will get his just reward.  He is responsible for almost &euro;17 billion in expenditure, for which there is zero accountability.<\/p>  <p>  I thank all of the front-line workers, nurses, doctors, paramedics and cleaners, who go into work every day to try to do an excellent job and a fair day's work for a fair day's pay.

It is just unbelievable, but there will be a day of reckoning and it might not be that far away.  When the Brexit baby falls from the cradle and shatters like a little vase, the Government will have no place to hide.  I am not diminishing the importance of Brexit or how serious it is, but the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il are hiding behind the Brexit baby.  When it grows up, they will have nothing to hold in terms of the confidence and supply agreement.  As I said last week, it is all supply and no confidence, as we saw again tonight.

You have three hours to come up with a decision.  Back us or else.\"  Unfortunately, some people did back them, but it will prove to be expensive because it is not possible to write a blank cheque for anyone.  However, that is what happened.<\/p>  <p>  People want houses, but the Government will not allow the people who want to build for themselves to do so because of its 2040 plan.  They cannot build houses in the countryside.  There are at least ten couples in my small area in south Tipperary who could build their own house and received planning permission with great difficulty, but they cannot receive a mortgage.  The Government will not let people who want to do it for themselves to do so and if they cannot help themselves, the Government will not help them.  It could not be written in a fiction film.  It cannot be done for the want of trying.  Is this supposed to represent value for money for the taxpayer?<\/p>  <p>  I have mentioned health and housing, but let us look at another Vote, that for the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC.  Out of a total budget of &euro;6.662 million, &euro;5.6 million went on salaries - pay the lads and promote them also - wages and expenses, while another &euro;500,000 was spent on office expenses, probably on tea and coffee.  A total of &euro;300,000 was spent to pay consultants.  I ask, in the name of God, how can the Minister sit there and allow this charade to continue?  There are consultants for everything and enough advisers.  The Government might as well get them to make the tea and coffee because they would be more useful doing that, rather than giving advice because they give the Government the advice it wants them to give.  It is the same in the case of the national children's hospital.  The Government should bring in forensic construction contract consultants &ndash; I hate using that term &ndash; from Switzerland or somewhere where they have real teeth, who would be fair and not connected or contaminated, unlike most of them here, to give us some results.  Instead, it pays a certain company, the name of which starts with a \"P\" and ends with a \"C\", &euro;450 million, a figure which will grow because the Taoiseach told us that he has expanded the terms of reference.  Therefore, we can be sure it will be &euro;600 million.  They are to tell it what it wants to know, what it thinks it can pour down our throats.  <\/p>  <p>  Ministers may think the people are fools, but they are not.  Thankfully, we have an educated electorate which is waiting for the Ministers.  It is waiting for them in the long grass, with a peann lu&iacute;, a pencil, in polling booths.  This is a democracy and the people have a right to put the Ministers out of their cosy bunkers, from which they will be run out quicker than snow off a ditch.  Last year the snow came quite late in March and was gone in two days.  The Ministers will be gone in a couple of hours.  They will melt and wilt away, as they deserve to.  I warned them about this in 2011 when Big Phil the Enforcer, the gang and the cabal were here terrorising people.  They told us all in rural Ireland that we had dirty septic tanks that were polluting the water supply.  He got his answer and fled to the European Union.  The Ministers had no place to run or hide.  It is worse now because they were given a fair warning and should be a little contrite, but they did not listen, na cluaisa&iacute; d&uacute;nta.  My God, they will be made to listen and will not be back here.  They will come back in a minibus which will not be a big one; it will be a 20-seater at most and they deserve no better.  Is the IHREC not supposed to be the Government's consultant on human rights?  The Ministers do not respect rights, whether human or otherwise.  That has many connotations and the disrespect shown is so intimidating.  What on earth is going on?  When it comes to spending public money, there seems to be no end to it for consultants and it started several Governments before this one.  We pay Ministers enough to do what they are supposed to do.  They are either able to do it or they are not.  If not, they should not hire consultants and spend money like confetti.  Last week I called on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to review its instructions to personnel officers in respect of ministerial appointments and cut out the consultants.  It followed information provided for me in the replies to several parliamentary questions which showed that at least &euro;6.5 million had been paid for the retention of special advisers and press officers in all Departments since 2017.  Are Ministers not able to spell, read or listen?  Are they not able to work?<\/p><p>What jobs did members of the Government have before they came in here?  They were elected on promises.  Surely to God they know something.  They have advisers, press secretaries, spin doctors and the whole shebang.  They will need more than that when they go to meet the public.  They will need skin massagers because the public will unleash vengeance on them for their reckless spending, their disgraceful arrogance, and their inept control.  I did not even mention the children's hospital because everyone knows about that.  It is a big black hole.  It is barely out of the ground and the Government is continuing in the same vein.  The Government should listen to the people.  It is the wrong decision, the wrong place and the wrong site.  The Minister should listen to the sick children because he may have grandchildren himself and they may fall sick.  No sick child from any part of rural Ireland will ever go into that black hole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000056#JJJ00900","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550690100,"counter":698,"content":"<p>I was only pointing out, as is put down before me, that debate should be relevant to the terms of the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000057#KKK00200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1550690100,"counter":699,"content":"<p>Was it not?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000057#KKK00300","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1550690100,"counter":700,"content":"<p>Some of it was not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000057#KKK00400","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1550690100,"counter":701,"content":"<p>I believe it was all very relevant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000057#KKK00500","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1550690100,"counter":702,"content":"<p>The Deputy has used his ten minutes.

I will provide some figures that did not get mentioned.  I will make reference to some of the Government Departments that have been touched on.  The capital allocation for the Department of Education and Skills for this year will be &euro;941 million.  Last year it was &euro;745 million.  The allocation for the Department of Rural and Community Affairs for this year is &euro;138 million.  Last year it was &euro;87 million.  The capital budget for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is increasing from &euro;1.75 billion last year to &euro;2.1 billion this year.  Finally, the capital budget for the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in increasing by more than a third.  As I emphasised in my speech, we are seeing a very large amount of overall additional capital expenditure for this year, an increase of &euro;1.4 billion.  This represents an increase of more than a fifth on last year.  The changes being made in these Revised Estimates have to be seen in the context of that increased spend.  The amount of money involved in the changes is a really small percentage of that increase and an even smaller percentage of the total amount of money that will be spent on capital projects this year.<\/p>  <p>  I was asked why I would ask the House to support the passage of these Revised Estimates to committees.  Deputies Thomas Byrne and Cowen asked me the details of projects that might be changed.  To answer both Deputies, and other Deputies, the reason I believe we will still be able to honour our commitments in respect of key projects is that as we move through every year we experience underspends in our capital programme.  That is even more likely to happen this year because our capital programme has grown by so much.  Normally the money arising from those underspends is used across the summer period to respond to other issues or priorities.  I am doing that now.  If I told the House that I was going to increase the value of the Estimates, the charge made by Deputies Boyd Barrett and Pringle that I am able to find money out of nowhere could have real effect.  In effect, I would be saying that, at this point in the year, a further &euro;100 million is available that was not available to me when I put the budget together.  If I did that the charge put to me regarding pulling money out of nowhere would have real potency, but that is not what I am doing.  The total amount of capital spend for this year will be unchanged but we will reallocate that spend far earlier in the year than we normally do.<\/p>  <p>  The reason I am asking the House to bring these Estimates to committee is that the level of detailed questioning some Deputies will have on the matter can best be handled there.  The amount of money many different Government Departments are contributing to deal with this difficulty represents a really small portion of their overall capital expenditure.  My experience suggests that it is only as we move through the year, and particularly as we move into the summer as that is when our capital expenditure significantly increases, that the reprofiling, towards which some colleagues are derisory although they would be equally venomous if I was to use the language of cuts, and some of the changes that could happen in respect of when payments are made will become clear.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett is right.  As I have said to all Deputies, I am glad that this debate has happened because it has allowed me to point to the fact that the overall levels of expenditure in these Revised Estimates are far higher than we have had in previous years and that they respond to the needs for investment that Deputy Boyd Barrett and other Deputies continually champion.  If we did not manage capital money within the figures about which I talked on budget day, the Deputies would now be laying the charge at Government that we are able to pull money out of nowhere in order to respond to issues such as that of the national children's hospital, where I have acknowledged things went wrong.  We are not able to pull money out of nowhere and, because we are not, we have to make choices.  This is why we have brought Revised Estimates before the House.  Deputy Burton was right when she put her question to me.  I wish I did not have to do this.  If I did not do it however, I would face the charge from Deputies who understand this process, as I know all of the Deputies present do------<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000057#KKK00900","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1550690100,"counter":706,"content":"<p>It would also be a breach of the Constitution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000057#KKK01000","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1550690100,"counter":707,"content":"<p>-----that there is not integrity in the figures I have put before the House this evening.

As I have told the House already, the legislation is key to delivering on our public service reform commitments to expand the digital delivery of services and to make greater use of data to plan, deliver and evaluate public services.  The Bill also provides for stronger governance and transparency by the public service in the way it shares and manages data.  I look forward to the support of the House in passing the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  I propose to take amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.  Amendment No. 1 proposes to delete section 7(6) of the Bill.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 2 seeks to amend the text of section 13(2)(a)(ii)(I) and amendment No. 3 will have the effect of removing section 37(5) of the Bill.  The amendments all concern the use of the public services card and the public service identity.<\/p> <p> These amendments reverse previous amendments made by this House during Committee and Report Stages.  The House inserted provisions into the Bill that require that presentation of a public services card or access to a person's public service identity may not be the exclusive basis by which the public body may verify a person's identity and that public bodies shall provide alternative means for identity verification.  I opposed these amendments at the time for the following reasons.  The public service identity is essential to the provision of services to the public and comprises the following: PPS number; surname; forename; date of birth; place of birth; sex; all former surnames, if any; all former surnames, if any, of the person's mother; address; nationality; date of death, if applicable; certificate of death, where relevant; a photograph of the person, where required, unless deceased; the person's signature, unless deceased; any other information that may be required for identification purposes that is uniquely linked to or is capable of identifying the person; and any other information that may be prescribed, which in the opinion of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection is relevant to and necessary for the allocation of a PPS number. <\/p> <p> The Attorney General has advised that if any of this information is collected by a public body, it is considered to be public service identity data.  This applies whether the data is collected by a public body directly from the person or through data sharing.  Accordingly, the consequence of retaining these provisions is that Government would have to provide services to citizens who choose not to provide basic information like their name, address or date of birth.  The question before the House is how this could possibly be done.  There is no way to provide services to people who refuse to provide this level of information.  This would place an impossible obligation on public bodies to provide an alternative method of identity verification which does not involve the public services card or the public service identity.  The problem is that there is no possible alternative way to identify people without using a public service identity because, by definition, this alternative identity data becomes public service identity data also. <\/p> <p> People would be able to use the legal loophole created by these provisions, for instance if they were to refuse to co-operate with essential but unpopular public services like the recouping of overpayments or jury duty.  The Seanad, on consideration, has accepted these arguments and has accordingly amended the Bill to remove these provisions.  I ask the House to support these amendments from the Seanad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000057#KKK01700","speaker":"1267","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550690700,"counter":715,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, seek to overturn amendments which were submitted by Deputy Clare Daly and myself and successfully passed on Committee and Report Stage in the D&aacute;il with the support of Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il and others.

If by chance Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies were to do a U-turn on it, it might not look great on their record when the trouble hits the fan at a later stage.<\/p><p>The State is storing up problems for itself by pursuing a data sharing programme that fundamentally contravenes EU law.  In the Seanad debate on 6 February, the Minister of State said our amendments would mean that the entire public service would grind to a halt.  I think he was being a little bit over-dramatic.  He said that the advice of the Attorney General in respect of our amendments is that any of these data that are collected are public service identity data.  If the Attorney General actually said that, we will have to disagree with him.<\/p><p>The public service identity is a very particular dataset.  It has a specific definition under section 262 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, which states: &quot;&quot;public service identity&quot;, in relation to a person, means the information specified in subsection (3) and the person&rsquo;s personal public service number&quot;.  It is not the case that one's name, date of birth, address, nationality or other data parts that make up the public service identity dataset exist only as part of that public service identity dataset, which is the logical extension of the Attorney General's argument.  He is saying, at least according to the Minister of State, that data elements that make up the public service identity dataset do not, indeed cannot, exist independently of that dataset.  That is a bit scary.  The State does not have a monopoly on these pieces of data.  The Attorney General's definition of the public service identity here is bordering on authoritarian.  <\/p><p>Our amendment provides that a specified body, such as the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection or the Passport Office, must provide an alternative to the public services card as a way for a person to verify their identity.  These amendments also go further, precisely because the public services card itself is not the problem.  It is merely the manifestation in plastic card form of the large-scale data sharing to which, at present, one simply has no choice but to agree in order to access basic public services.  We added the clause in respect of providing an alternative to accessing one's public service identity dataset to strengthen the protection for those who do not want to agree to <i>ad hoc<\/i>sharing of their data and do not want to be coerced into doing so.  Our amendments provide that a person has an alternative means to verify his or her identity with a particular specified body, other than that body accessing his or her public service identity dataset via the single customer view.<\/p><p>If the only ways to verify a person's identity to access services are via the presentation of a public services card, or by accessing that person's public service identity via the single customer view, then public services and welfare payments will be denied to those who do not agree to the sharing of their data.  Our fundamental point is that withholding such services in order to coerce consent to such data sharing is not permitted under the GDPR or under pre-existing EU law.  I appreciate that this is administratively difficult for the Government and relevant specified bodies.  I appreciate the obvious need to verify people's identities.  I appreciate the need for cost-saving measures and the need to increase efficiency.  Of course all that is a good thing, but that does not solve the legal conundrum I have outlined repeatedly during debates on the Bill.  The public services card may well turn out to be the most expensive administrative error in the history of the State when GDPR fines and compensation are factored in on top of the &euro;60 million we have already spent on the card.  It is a ticking time bomb.<\/p><p>Even if only one person in the entire country wants to avail of an alternative to this sharing of his or her data, legally we have to provide that one person with an alternative.  I fail to see how something like a combination of a birth certificate, utility bills or a passport could not be used to verify identity for those who do not want to consent to the kind of data sharing we are talking about.  One can get a driver's licence without a public services card.  After wasting more than &euro;2 million on the project to make the card mandatory, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport realised it had no legal basis to coerce consent to data sharing and abandoned the project.  The Government and the Minister of State's Department in particular are engineering a situation where access to a person's public service identity dataset is the exclusive way to verify one's identity but there are clearly other options that do not require consent to <i>ad hoc<\/i>data sharing.  Various public bodies are already using those alternatives and have been using them for decades.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000058#LLL00400","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1550690700,"counter":718,"content":"<p>February seems a little bit early for flip-flops but we have another one tonight from our good friends in Fianna F&aacute;il.  I am absolutely sickened but not surprised.  This follows what bordered on abuse that was meted out to Deputy Jack Chambers the last time around.  Having fully engaged in all of the discussions around this issue, he listened to the arguments and convinced his party to vote with us.<\/p><p>In the aftermath he was effectively surrounded by a mob.  The position held for the night, but in the intervening period the powers that be have been at work and Fianna F&aacute;il has done yet another flip flop.  This is not the first time it has pulled this type of stunt and it is not the first time it will be embarrassed by it either.  In June 2017 we received its support at the Select Committee on Justice and Equality for a scheme of mandatory open disclosure in our health services that would have provided that, where serious mistakes were made in hospitals, the person injured as a result would get an explanation as to what had happened and why.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies on the committee listened to the arguments and the evidence and accepted that it would make the health service happier and better for all concerned.  That was on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p> Over the summer, the Government and the Department of Health got to them, and the party machine swung into action so that by Report Stage those Deputies had yet another Damascus-like conversion and decided to vote against us.  Of course, six months later the scandal over the failures of open disclosure around the cervical cancer issue broke and mandatory open disclosure then suddenly became the flavour of the month.  Everyone wanted it then.  The Minister of State was speaking about it earlier; he still wants to bring it in.  The point is that we had it then, with Fianna F&aacute;il's support, on Committee Stage, before it rolled over again and voted against us on Report Stage.  The Deputies looked pretty ridiculous, yet the same thing is going to happen again.  <\/p> <p> I want to put this on the record of the House, because I know the way this vote is going to go.  Whether it is Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner or a European court, the State coercion that our amendments tried to do away with will not be allowed to stand.  We do not want to be like Cassandra, coming into the House to point out obvious problems, but sometimes that is the role that is handed to us.  We have to point to the road we are going down.  <\/p> <p> In the Seanad the Minister of State made a very strange argument.  He suggested that our amendments would mean that organisations could not ask for a person's name or address in order to verify one's identity.  That is absolute nonsense.  The argument is based on the idea that once one's name goes into the public service identity dataset it is no longer one's own.  It is supposed that it belongs to the dataset only.  This is clearly utter nonsense.  The end point of that argument is that the only way for an organisation to get access to one's address is through the public service identity dataset.  If that was the case every organisation on earth would have to be signed up to it.  They are not signed up to it at the minute, meaning that many organisations are able to verify people's identity without exclusively using the person's public service identity to do so.  The Minister of State's argument would make sense if our amendment to section 7 said that a specified body may not make presentation of a public services card or access to any given element of a person's public services identity the exclusive basis by which a person may verify his or her identity in order to conduct a transaction or access a service.  It does not say that.  It says: \"A specified body may not make presentation of a public services card or access to a person's public services identity the exclusive basis by which a person may verify their identity in order to conduct a transaction or access a service.\"  By our amendment I mean the amendment that was accepted in the D&aacute;il and which is now being taken out by the Seanad.  We want it to be upheld and re-inserted into the Bill to undo that situation.  <\/p> <p> A person's public services identity is actually a collection of specific pieces of information held together in a specific database that has particular characteristics.  It is something that, when created, may be shared between one public body and another, whether the person involved likes it or not.  It is quite a distinct thing, with its own characteristics and functions.  It is not just a name and address.  Notwithstanding that point, if the Minister of State really had genuine concerns about our amendment, which was adapted by the D&aacute;il, it was entirely open to him to use the huge resources at his disposal in the form of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Office of the Attorney General to come up with a different wording.  If he was worried about the avoidance of any doubt as to what our amendment applied to, there was nothing stopping the Minister of State using those offices, but he did not do that.  To me, that shows that the whole argument made in the Seanad was totally disingenuous and redundant.<\/p> <p> The issue here is not that the Minister of State is worried that our amendment could have unintended consequences.  We should be honest and say that the Minister of State or, no disrespect, the civil servants want to maintain the powerfully coercive elements in the public services card.  They want to maintain a situation where people have no choice whatsoever but to get a card and have no choice but to consent to their data being shared around between organisations even if they do not want to or strenuously object.  They want to coerce people in this way.  It is illegal and the Government will find that out in due course.  Fianna F&aacute;il knows that.  Vast sums of money have been wasted and more will be wasted clearing up this mess.  Despite this, it is really clear that the Government's approach to this issue is exactly the same approach it took to our illegal data retention regime.  It will keep operating illegally until a court somewhere stops it.  We have done that before in issues such as this, and we are being frog marched into doing exactly the same thing all over again.  It is an absolute disgrace, and even at this late hour I would appeal to Fianna F&aacute;il to save itself from further embarrassment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000058#LLL00500","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550691300,"counter":720,"content":"<p>I can put the previous speakers out of their misery by confirming that we did initially have concerns about the public services card being the sole means to identify oneself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000059#MMM00200","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1550691300,"counter":721,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il does not have those concerns any more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000059#MMM00300","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1550691300,"counter":722,"content":"<p>That is not the case.

A story was carried on the front page of <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>, Ireland edition, in which all of the details of an asylum seeker's stay in Ireland, various applications made and travel between Ireland and other countries were disclosed in detail.  This information may have emanated from a public body.  I have honestly never seen such a disclosure of information before.  It should be borne in mind that staff in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, for example, and perhaps staff in other Departments, have actually been brought before the courts, charged and found guilty of breaching the privacy of individuals.  That this has happened in the wake of the GDPR legislation is really shocking.<\/p><p>The Minister of State is responsible for data matters and I am surprised that the Department of Justice and Equality, which is the line Department for people in the asylum process, has not mentioned this matter.  I have been waiting all week for the Minister for Justice and Equality to announce an investigation into this story.  It is actually a disgrace.<\/p><p>It concerns an asylum seeker who is standing for the local elections in the north inner city, something she is perfectly entitled to do having been resident in Ireland for a long period while her case is being addressed.  From the story, she appears to be still in direct provision.  All of the details of her movement between Africa, Ireland and the United Kingdom over many years are set out in great detail in a way I have never seen before.  I am simply astonished.  I want to ask the Minister of State in the House who is responsible for data protection about it.  It cannot have escaped the attention of the civil servants and of members of the Government who read newspapers that this is an extraordinary story of a data breach relating to an individual.  Will the Minister of State have an inquiry carried out into this story?  Will the Minister of State ask his colleague in government, the Minster for Justice and Equality, to undertake the inquiry?<\/p> <p> As a matter of confidence it is really important for people to know that their data is treated with seriousness, respect and confidentiality.  That is vital and it should always be the case.<\/p> <p> I am unsure where the story came from, but it is extraordinarily detailed in a way that indicates some of the details must have come from files held somewhere about this individual.  I believe she is owed an apology in this regard.  Otherwise, the matter needs to be clarified in light of all the rhetoric of the Government about data protection and the protection of the rights of individuals under the general data protection regulation.  I find it astonishing and I would like the Minister of State to address the matter.  He must be aware of this story about a woman called Ellie Kisyombe.  Apparently, she is originally from Malawi but has been an asylum seeker in Ireland and in direct provision for a period with her family.  She is running for one of the political parties in this House &ndash; the Social Democrats &ndash; in the north inner city in Dublin.  Her personal data has been disclosed in the article.  I simply cannot believe that this could happen.  There is no point in all this talk about data protection and data respect and so on unless some kind of explanation is forthcoming.<\/p> <p> As a matter of correction, I wish to point out that when the public services card was introduced it was brought in by the then Department of Social Protection.  It is not an identity card.  There was no requirement in law on anyone to provide it under a range of circumstances.<\/p> <p> When the current Minister came to office in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection she decided it may be required.  It was never required previously.  Let us consider this.  The people who use the public services card most are those over 66 years of age who use it for free travel.  The public services card has allowed people who use free travel privately to get on a bus, train or any other form of public transport that qualifies.  They can use their card without anyone else on the bus being aware of the person's private details.  That is as it should be.  It allows significant numbers of retired people, pensioners and people who have travel passes because they are ill or have long-term illness conditions to move around on public transport in Ireland with a great deal of personal dignity and privacy.  That was not always the case previously when other arrangements were in place.<\/p> <p> A particular idea seems to be creeping in to the effect that the public services card is some kind of identity card.  I agree with the comments made by previous speakers to the effect that this is not its legal function.  It seems some people are trying to pretend that since the Department of Expenditure and Reform has taken over the card, it can basically be a catch-all card for everything and anything in the State.<\/p> <p> Obviously, passports or driving licences are used for identity purposes.  All I can say is that common sense should prevail in how people are asked to use and register for the card.  For example, there are many people who have various illnesses or conditions or who may be of advanced years.  They may wish to deal with the difference offices in a particular way and there is nothing wrong with that.  The card has to be used by public consent.  There should be no coercion of people.  Other identity mechanisms have been referred to.<\/p> <p> The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform took over the card.  It may be better left to Departments that deal with large amounts of public data, for example, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection or the health authorities.  They probably have far more experience of the range of citizens and other people who present for different services and how their needs should be dealt with by public officials.  They know this should not be done in a coercive way but in an inclusive way.  The approach should provide them with the services that, as citizens of the State or people living here, they are entitled to access.  Respect is the key point in that regard.  There should be some consideration by the Minister of State of how respect for citizens is made clear and is at the core of how citizens are dealt with by public bodies, especially when it comes to use of their data.  There is a long tradition of this approach among those in the Revenue Commissioners and in Departments like the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.<\/p> <p> This may be something that the staff taking over this function might like to consider.  There are many people in Ireland who have no access to their data.  I am referring to people who are adopted.  They cannot access their data.  They are not allowed to access their data by law.  We are one of the few countries in the world that does not have an access policy for adopted people to access to their own information.  The Government should be a little less preachy and a lot more practical in terms of demonstrating respect for citizens and their data, their rights to access data and how public bodies and authorities approach people and share data.<\/p> <p> I am glad to see an oversight board is provided for in the Bill.  That is a good development.  In any event, I hope that ordinary citizens with a range of qualifications and ages are on that board so that they can give voice to how people should be treated properly when they approach public offices for services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000059#MMM00700","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550691900,"counter":727,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Deputy Burton.

My officials advise that as this matter is not pertinent to the Bill, it referred to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Rather than me discussing an issue with which I am not familiar - this is the first I have heard of it - my officials will refer it to the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  On the point made by the previous speaker, this Bill relates to data sharing and governance.  It is about the sharing of information between public bodies.  We have had a great deal of interaction on the legislation in this House, at the relevant committee and in the Seanad.  My officials were available to discuss the Bill long before it was brought before the D&aacute;il.  It was discussed at length with Opposition spokespersons and other Members, including Deputies Cowen, Calleary, Jonathan O'Brien, Wallace and Clare Daly.  I am unsure whether Deputy Burton availed of the opportunity to be briefed on the Bill.  We have not had any interaction with her on the floor of the D&aacute;il in respect of it.<\/p>  <p>  To be clear, I am not taking responsibility for public services cards.  That matter is not dealt with in the Bill.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is not assuming responsibility for public services cards.  Responsibility for these cards remains with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, as was the case when Deputy Burton was Minister.  We are making no changes in respect of public services cards.  These cards are not referred to in the Bill, with the exception of a reference in section 7 to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  We are not changing the latter either.<\/p>  <p>  As to some of the other contributions, the Bill does not dilute the GDPR in any way.  As I have stated in both Houses previously, the GDPR is specifically acknowledged and referred to in a number of sections.  In any event, everything that we do in the context of data sharing must have regard to the GDPR.<\/p>  <p>  I am amused in some ways by Deputy Wallace's summation of my powers and what I, like Mystic Meg, might have been able to do in the context of bringing the Bill back to the House.  My powers do not extend to what he was referring to a while ago when he stated that it is somehow miraculous that we are here again.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a great deal of interaction and engagement since the previous occasion on which the Bill was debated in the D&aacute;il.  That is a good thing because it provided me with an opportunity to go through the implications of the amendment to section 7 to which Deputy Clare Daly, who obviously read the transcript of the debate in the Seanad, referred.  Section 7(6) states, \"A specified body may not make presentation of a public services card or access to a person&rsquo;s public service identity the exclusive basis ...\".  We had to take the advice of the Attorney General on that matter.  The Deputy acknowledged previously that some people may not choose to engage with the system.  As I informed her at the time, if a person chooses not to engage with the system - for example, in the context of interaction with the Revenue Commissioners, matters relating to penalty points or accepting jury duty - I have to be confident that the system which will come into place upon enactment of this Bill will not have a negative consequence in respect of any other service for which there is a necessity to verify people's identities.  If I would to allow the Bill to proceed in its current format, I could not do that.  I have to take cognisance of the impact it could potentially have on the delivery of services, whether that is in the calling up of a jury - where a person may not choose to engage with the system - or in the delivery of basic social welfare payments.  There was acknowledgement in the Seanad that the Attorney General's advice, which is predicated on section 262(5) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 and which I have relayed to the D&aacute;il and the Upper House, is based on that.<\/p>  <p>  The reason we are bringing forward this Bill is because of the data regime and the potentially illegal way in which data is currently handled.  We did not want a situation where there would be any question of illegality or any semblance of an issue where the Government or the State would not be able to stand over it.  As I pointed out previously, data is currently being shared between organisations but there is not legal basis for this.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also provides for the data portal whereby people can access their data to see how it is being handled and who else has accessed it.  This matter was discussed in detail on Committee Stage and on Report Stage.<\/p>  <p>  The public services card is still the same today as it was yesterday; there is no change to it whatsoever.  Responsibility for public services cards has not migrated to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>  <p>  I have covered most of the points raised.  The final comment I wish to make relates to the basis upon which we have made our decision - this is extremely important decision, in respect of the specified bodies that are referred to.  We must ensure that what we are seeking to do is not in conflict with the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 in any way.  We have been very clear that this is not our intent.  As stated previously, both here and in the Seanad, the Bill does not specify how Departments or agencies should do their business.  It is a matter for them and their line Ministers, in the context of individual items of legislation, to decide how they will collect information in the future and to address how they collected it in the past.  The Bill is purely about dealing with how that information, when it is collected, is relayed from public body A to public body B, the level of oversight that will be in place and how people can access their data in order to see what is being done with it.  The Bill does nothing other than that.  It does not change the position relating to public services cards.  It does nothing with regard to altering responsibility for those cards, diluting the position in respect of them, specifying their use in the context of the free travel scheme or anything of that nature.<\/p>  <p>  Having reflected on the matter with the Attorney General and taken soundings from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, it has been necessary for us to make these amendments.  I have had a lot of engagement in respect of the Bill.  The officials in the Department have opened their doors to everybody.  Some have chosen to engage while others have not, which is their prerogative.  I have nothing further to add.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000061#OOO00700","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"speech","time":1550692500,"counter":738,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is right because the only point on which I would agree with him is that this has been a long road.

The fact is that all he has relied upon is the Attorney General's advice, which we cannot see.  The latter is a bit &quot;old hat&quot; now and is the perennial excuse for absolutely everything.  It is the great opt-out to allow the Government to get whatever it wants.  That is not really satisfactory at all.  Nothing that the Minister of State said has changed my mind, no more than anything that I have said has probably changed his.<\/p><p>The other matter on which I will agree with him is that our amendments would not mean the end of the public services card.  He is 100% right.  It would not be the end of the public services identity.  All of those things will continue to exist.  Our amendments would just provide a simple opt-out.  That is all that is involved.  It is not something that is desirable, it is something that is necessary.  Without it, the whole system is illegal.

A key element of the available databases is the database that is acquired via the public services card.  Prior to there being such a card, data were acquired in different ways through the direct collection of information and multiple uses of the data were allowed.  However, this Government has been different in its desire to utilise the card for a whole set of other transactions and interactions with bodies and data.  The point that was made in the debates months ago and, indeed, when the public services card first came into operation was that there would inevitably be people who, for various reasons such as incapacity, might not be able to utilise the card.  Therefore, some of the controversies have been downright silly.<\/p>  <p>  On the principle of ensuring data protection for citizens to the maximum extent, particularly post GDPR, the Minister of State is receiving sensible advice from Deputy Clare Daly regarding the card and this data sharing Bill, which utilises the card and other potential sources of data, including from other Departments.<\/p>  <p>  I brought to the Minister of State's attention a notorious case but, if I may say so, the Government is allowing itself to become arrogant concerning an horrific story that the Minister of State, whose remit covers data sharing, should make it his business to find out about and perhaps raise with his colleagues, for example, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Justice and Equality.

We were told at the time - Deputy Daly might back me up on this - that these guidelines would be put into the definitions section of the Bill.

If the EU intends to change Directive 2002\/49\/EC to take account of the WHO guidelines, which is what we all want to see, will we then have to issue a new statutory instrument?  Will we be left behind in this regard?  I think the Minister refers to this in amendment No. 78 as well.  There is concern that there is not explicit reference to SI 549 of 2018.  The Minister has locked us into this until it is replaced by a future statutory instrument to take account of changes to Directive 2002\/49\/EC.

Given that we are legislating for such an important aspect of the airport's operation and given that we want to adhere to the latest WHO guidelines, is it not incumbent on the Minister to spell out the matter carefully?

Part 2 of the Bill clearly relates to the \"Process of Aircraft Noise Regulation\" but the amendment will insert the new, up-to-date statutory instrument, which will be of benefit to residents who live in close proximity to the airport because it refers to the newest and most up-to-date regulation.  The section also refers to the appropriate assessment of the environment in accordance with the habitats directive.  Importantly, the amendment which we requested in deliberations between Committee Stage and Report Stage will insert, \"In this Part, health aspects shall be assessed in accordance with the Environmental Noise Directive and the European Communities (Environmental Noise) Regulations 2018\".<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister clarify that the amendment is of benefit to the Bill, that it is an improvement to the Bill and, most importantly, that it will alleviate the concerns of the residents who have genuine fears that the health aspects of the Bill have been somewhat diluted?  At the previous session in which we debated the Bill, the Minister's defence of many amendments that he had submitted was quite poor.  There needs to be greater clarity and assurance.  The Minister must take the opportunity during the debate to answer some of the questions I have asked about the resources, openness and transparency as to why he has opted for Fingal County Council.  Unfortunately, at the previous session the Minister tried to play silly party politics and take pot shots at Deputy Mattie McGrath rather than answering serious questions that I had raised.  Will the Minister take the opportunity of this debate to address not my concerns but those of many residents?  He should forget about the silly politics of his public spats with his former friend and colleague, Deputy Mattie McGrath.<\/p>  <p>  I wish also to set out my party's rationale for supporting Deputy Clare Daly's amendment in respect of the WHO.  To be fair, the Minister's officials have led the debate on the matter and have been more helpful.  Sometimes I wonder how much understanding of the legislation the Minister has.  In our discussions with the officials, it was noted that the final page of the EU regulation states, \"Based on work the WHO is currently undertaking regarding the methodology to assess health implications of the noise impact, the Commission intends to revise Annex III to Directive 2002\/49\/ EC\".  It is up to Deputy Clare Daly to explain her rationale but my understanding is that her reason for using a carbon copy of those words was the Minister's indication that he could not change anything that was not stated in the regulations.  I recently informed the Minister that it was stated in the regulations and that, therefore, we would support Deputy Clare Daly's amendment to include it in the definitions.<\/p><p>The Minister gave an undertaking to me on the night that he would have that revisited and see whether he is able to do that.

Amendment No. 53 ensures that the onus is on the authority to report on the effect its decision had on local residents and how their requirements were taken into consideration.  From the start, local residents felt completely left out of the process and have legitimate concerns about the planning issues.  These amendments encourage consultation with local residents.  Trust in the noise regulator and other related authorities has taken a battering and there are serious concerns about retrospective changes to planning for flights and other developments at the airport.  That is the main fear of residents with regard to retrospective changes that will be made hereafter.  The health of local residents is being put at risk and it is imperative that consultation takes places with them and that their health and wishes are taken on board by the competent authority, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the airport.  The amendment will provide for that input from residents and I hope that other Members will support it.<\/p><p>I understand that the Department and its lawyers are saying that health is covered by EU regulations and it is not required to include it again.  The Minister said that including it in legislation would somehow give it precedence over other matters but at the end of the day, it is entirely appropriate for health to be given that precedence.  The health of people in the vicinity of the airport is given precedence.  We should ensure that human health is a priority in the legislation, given all of the concerns about residents.

We have to be honest that the directive provides for consideration to be given to health implications.  Nobody on this side of the House has ever denied that that is the case.  It is provided for and there are references to the 2018 guidelines and so on.  However, we have to be cognisant that there is a significant trust issue.  Spelling it out is necessary in the context of some other decisions that the Minister has taken.<\/p>  <p>  Sadly, those are decisions such as the one taken last week to appoint Fingal County Council as the competent authority.  People believe that their interests are jeopardised by that decision.  Their confidence is not strengthened by the reports that they read in the media during the week of the release of communications between the director of services and planning in Fingal County Council with the Minister and his Department, spelling out to the Minister that they did not feel they were best-placed for the gig.  We made the point here that Fingal County Council did not want it but the director of planning there was in communication with the Minister's Department last November, after his decision to appoint the council as the authority, and she stated: \"[We have] an extensive remit in both shaping and determining the strategic direction of Dublin Airport through its land-use planning and associated functions.\"  She said that the council was also responsible for determining applications for planning purposes.  She stated: \"In light of the existing complex and varied role that Fingal County Council plays as outlined above, it is considered that the council may not be best placed to act as the competent authority.\"  She said that the council does not have the requisite competencies available in areas of aviation operations, noise and economic feasibility assessments.  She suggested that other bodies would be better for the job.  We found out that it will have to contract in specialist services to monitor noise at an approximate cost of &euro;1 million per year, in a council &euro;200 million in debt, with no idea where the money to fund this regulation will come from other than the reference to collecting a levy from the DAA, an organisation which has similarly borrowed hundreds of millions to fund the next runway.  Taking all of that into account, one can understand and realise that those who will do the monitoring will be private consultants who are outside the scope of freedom of information and Oireachtas scrutiny.  It is then pretty understandable why residents would be concerned and would say that they need to be sure to have a reference relating to health, because past performance does not give much confidence.<\/p><p>While I fully accept, and it is totally true and I have no problem in saying it, that health is referenced in the directive it is a directive brought in to mitigate the dangers of noise and by implication to benefit human health.  The hazards of noise and its implications in early deaths, sleep disruption and heart and cancer issues - all of the research on its impact - mean we have to have a robust system in place.  If the only reason these amendments cannot be included, and they have not been ruled out of order so they are obviously valid, is that we do not need them because it is already covered I have no problem supporting them to give that extra layer of assurance.  I have tabled an amendment specifying that the World Health Organization, WHO, decibel guidelines should be the denominator for the competent authority.  That also will protect human health because the guidelines as set out by the WHO are based on scientific research, best medical practice of the health implications.  We need to have that quantified.  There is merit in it.  That is why it needs to be included.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000069#WWW01600","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550697600,"counter":876,"content":"<p>As we debated on Second and Committee Stages we are left with a Bill very late in the day that had been flagged for nearly two years.  We are dealing with an imperfect situation.  On Committee Stage I spoke to an amendment tabled by Deputy Troy, our transport spokesperson, about a separate unit within Fingal County Council, to try to find a mid-point.  We could not use the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, because of legal advice the Minister said he had received.  The Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, was resisted.  We got a briefing document to say that if my mid-point suggestion was moved the Government would withdraw the Bill.  We are trying to find a balanced approach, recognising the fact that I and many residents live in close proximity to the airport and want to make sure that any development of the airport will not have an adverse effect on residents, while also recognising that the airport is an important economic driver for the region, employing over 20,000 people, providing over 100,000 indirect jobs, and is worth approximately &euro;8 billion to the economy.  It is not a question of stopping any development but of a balanced approach.  When we are left with the imperfect scenario of having Fingal County Council it is even more important at that stage to ensure that additional assurances are given.<\/p>  <p>  We have further amendments to take noise insulation away from DAA which is a sensible approach and to make sure the independent regulator actually has an independent function.  When Deputy Munster talks about the likely effect of noise mitigation measures and operating restrictions I am happy that they will be a matter for An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We sought this on Committee Stage and it is very specifically mentioned in the Bill.  I do not think anyone in this House questions An Bord Plean&aacute;la's independence particularly given our experience of it.  The board is crucial.  I and my party would be completely and utterly opposed to unrestricted night flights.  Last week was the first time we heard the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, give an idea of what it was considering.  Whoever the noise regulator is those flight restrictions and noise amelioration measures will end up with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  A noise regulator and the EU Directive are good for the future development of the airport.  If that happens to be Fingal County Council it should be a separate unit within the council, at the very least with a separate chief executive officer, CEO.  The different items that the noise regulator should have regard to should be added to the Bill along the lines of Deputy Munster's amendment. <\/p>  <p>  Any future changes will go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I am better assured now by the insertion of WHO 2018 noise guidelines.  That is crucial.  That is a big step forward.  The clarification given this evening is important because it may have been lacking before now.  The noise regulator must have regard to WHO 2018.

There is a real sense from people that Fingal County Council should not be the competent authority.  As we debated amendments last week about who that should be we all had a sense that Fingal County Council did not want the gig.  Deputy Clare Daly alluded to a report by Jennifer Bray in yesterday's <i>The Irish Times<\/i>which quotes a letter from AnnMarie Farrelly to Mr. Towey explaining that the council has &quot;an extensive remit in both shaping and determining the strategic direction of Dublin Airport through its land-use planning and associated functions&quot;.

It is a pity we were not in possession of this letter that the Department officials received at the time we were debating those amendments.  In proposing this to Cabinet did the Minister bring this letter from Ms AnnMarie Farrelly to the attention of the Taoiseach, who is in a neighbouring constituency to the airport and whose constituents will be affected by all of these issues?  Did he bring it to the attention of other Cabinet members?  Were they aware of this letter which says, to quote the headline on the article  &quot;Council warned Government it could not be noise regulator for Dublin Airport runway&quot;.

If we had known about that letter last week, the debate in that regard would have been even more vigorous.  Obviously there were issues about the resources the council would have but, as I said last week, clearly the officials in Fingal County Council, whom I hold in high regard, had great reservations about the course upon which the Minister is embarking because of issues down the line and the possibility that the council would be left open to legal challenge.   <\/p> <p> A report released only today or yesterday told us that the airport had its busiest January ever this year with more than 2 million passengers passing through.  We are heading towards the cap as an annual figure of 40 million passengers might not be far away.  There were many reports involved in the Fingal County Council consultation.  In June 2016, RPS Group produced the environmental impact statement scoping report on the north runway proposal.  Chapter 3.3 of that report is entirely devoted to human health and the impact of aviation noise thereon.  It noted issues such as potential changes in concentration exposure to ground-borne emissions, airborne emissions, community disruption and the potential for bad health outcomes.  It also lists annoyance, academic performance, sleep disturbance, risk of injury and so on as issues.  <\/p> <p> The evidence raised in the Fingal consultation with regard to environmental noise, including aircraft noise, which includes evidence from the European Environment Agency, EEA, and the World Health Organization, lists a wide range of medical conditions and other issues.  These include cardiovascular disease, including hypertension, coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction; cognitive impairment, including impacts on children's reading and education; the deep impacts sleep disturbance can have on people's daily lives; tinnitus; hearing loss; the sheer annoyance of being bothered by relentless aircraft noise; and impacts on quality of life and well-being.  That is the other side.  That is why amendment No. 60 in my name, echoing what colleagues have said, seeks to introduce an absolute requirement, under the EU directive or otherwise, for a longitudinal study over a number of years on the impacts of noise on residents.  The amendment proposes to include this requirement in the legislation in black and white, as I know my colleague, Deputy Clare Daly, has done in respect of the 45 dB and 40 dB levels.  It should be specified in the legislation.  <\/p> <p> The balanced approach is in the directive.  People talk about a balanced approach which would include quieter aircraft and all kinds of noise abatement measures but, as I said the last day, one of the problems we have in our legislation is that there is no comprehensive noise legislation regime or national regulator.  We have not established one so far.  Local authorities have to deal with the matter day in, day out.  In that context, I ask the Minister to try to address this by including this specific measure in the legislation.  Such a measure is laid out very clearly in amendments Nos. 6 and 53.  The Minister could also provide for some version of my amendment No. 60, which would make abating and ameliorating health impacts arising from noise a high priority for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000070#XXX00400","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550698200,"counter":880,"content":"<p>Anybody who represents residents of areas close to Dublin Airport will know that the airport is critically important to the economic life of the area and the whole Dublin region.  It is one of the major factors in the region's growth.  It is also a major cash cow for Fingal County Council in terms of the rates base it constitutes.  Anybody who was a member of Dublin County Council, as it was known, and subsequently Fingal County Council will know that much of the council's economic strategy is based on the development of the airport.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know how familiar the Minister is with Dublin Airport or its economic progress and plans.  For some time, it has been making itself into a hub, particularly for people from the United Kingdom but increasingly for passengers transiting from many different parts of the world.  People are catching a flight to Dublin, hopping off and then travelling onwards on a second flight.  The consequence of this is that for some years now Dublin Airport Authority has been keen to increase the number of hours during which flights in and out of Dublin Airport are allowed.  Everybody here knows that one of its objectives is to commence flights much earlier in the morning, perhaps two hours earlier, with perhaps one additional hour of flights at night.  As the Minister knows, the DAA is allowed to breach the current times in a number of exceptional circumstances and has availed of these to the maximum.  Many residents believe it has exceeded the maximum.  That has consequences in a country in which there is little or no protection against noise pollution.  It is a very poorly served area in Irish law.  Anyone who has been on a county council will be aware of that, even in respect of relatively simple problems people have with noise.<\/p>  <p>  It also has to borne in mind that all of the medical evidence shows that bad noise pollution is a very serious health issue for a cohort of people.  Noise affects people in different ways.  It does not bother some people that much while it can turn other people's lives upside down and make their lives a misery.  If the Minister was reading newspapers, magazines or books over Christmas, or if he visited any bookshops, he will know that bookshops are loaded with books about the necessity of a good night's sleep for people's health.  <\/p>  <p>  Fingal County Council has a vested interest in the success and expansion of Dublin Airport.  Over a long period it has, in its role as a planning authority, sought to facilitate the airport.  We all understand that.  The Minister is now appointing that entity to be the regulator of noise, which is a significant problem for a number of communities around the airport.  Over the past ten to 20 years there has been some noise mitigation, for instance, soundproofing measures have been implemented.  In many cases, people have had triple glazing installed which has significantly reduced the noise problem, without eliminating it.  It appears the game plan is to extend significantly the hours of flying at the airport.  In its letter to the Department late last year the council basically said it was not equipped to perform the noise regulation function.  It was right.  What will it do now?  Will it simply appoint consultants and outsource this function to some commercial organisation?  That would not be a satisfactory outcome.  This function should be carried out by a public body.  While Fingal County Council has many very good attributes - I was a member of the council several times - it is not suited to this particular role.<\/p>  <p>  As many others have advised the Minister, if he proceeds with this proposal without listening to the people who represent areas near Dublin Airport, he will ultimately end up in the courts here and in Europe.  I have no doubt about that.  It is to be hoped that the courts will eventually provide for proper regulation.  On many occasions, both as a journalist and in his political career, the Minister has noted the requirement that Ministers and others act with probity, concern and care where the rights of individual citizens are at stake.<\/p><p>What is at stake here is people trying to deal with noise, trying to get a good night's sleep because they have to go out to work the next day or simply need a good night's sleep if they are retired.  The Minister is being foolish in deciding to persist with a course of action on a proposed regulator that does not fit the bill for proper regulation in any ordinary sense of the word.  I support the amendments tabled by Deputies Clare Daly and Munster.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong but I believe there is very little legislation in Ireland that really deals with noise pollution as it is dealt with in many of our counterpart countries.  It just does not exist in Ireland.  It is all over the place in different little bits of legislation and planning regulations.  When somebody is seriously affected by noise it can literally destroy his or her life.  I ask the Minister to take that into account and to accept some of the very sensible amendments that are being offered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000071#YYY00200","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1550698800,"counter":882,"content":"<p>It is very regrettable that the information from Fingal County Council was not available last week when we were having this debate.

There is serious concern among local residents.  Those of us who represent them have spoken to them and they have told us they have concerns.  Their concerns relate to the health and safety of the people who live in the environs of the airport.  They are deeply concerned about the appointment of Fingal County Council as the regulator.<\/p>  <p>  It turns out Fingal County Council is also deeply concerned about this.

Given what we know about the impact that noise has on people and their capacity to be healthy, I am not sure there is going to be any difficulty with recording that.  I do not know how the Minister would be able to argue against it.  Perhaps he has a good argument in his notes that he is going to share with us but I doubt it.  What they are looking for are protections that the Minister says he is willing to give anyway.  There is no harm in being belt and braces about it if the residents are concerned, as they genuinely are.  They are not foolish.  They live beside the airport and are accustomed to it as their neighbour.  They are equally aware of the contribution that Dublin Airport makes, not just to the local economy but to the broader economy as well.  Nobody is trying to argue against that.  We are simply proposing amendments that will assist in ensuring that the health and safety of the people who live in the environs of the airport is protected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000072#ZZZ00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1550698800,"counter":883,"content":"<p>I am speaking in my capacity as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I could not be here last week.  The committee's approach has been to work with the Minister, the Department and all the parties and Independents who attended our meetings.  Our whole objective was to get the best deal for the residents and to make sure the regulator was properly appointed.<\/p>  <p>  I expressed concerns about the capacity of Fingal County Council to take on the regulatory role but we went with what we were advised.  We had two meetings with officials and a long committee meeting.  Everybody wanted to facilitate the best possible outcome for all.  However, the fact that the letter was not disclosed to us was wrong.  It should have been disclosed.  I ask the Minister why it was not disclosed.  It was a germane point.  A lot of people raised it.  It is not about the letter itself; it is about the trust that people have in regulation itself, the trust I want to have in the regulator.  Fingal County Council will not actually be doing it; I presume it will be providing the envelope, buildings, facilities or whatever.  However, we need to get it spelled out.  It creates questions in my mind.<\/p>  <p>  At the very least, notwithstanding whatever views they may have at the end of the day, I want the residents to be happy that everything is totally above board and that nothing has been willingly kept from this Oireachtas committee.  I would like to know why we did not see that letter.  It would have required the Minister to make a different argument because knowledge of it would have informed people's opinions.  It is very late in the day to be looking for it now but we have a right to ask that it be given to us, perhaps by way of a briefing note as to what arrangements Fingal County Council is going to make, what procedures are going to be in place, the expected cost and the location.  We raised this point ourselves during the debate, in respect of the question of firewalls between anything to do with planning and the activities of Fingal County Council and the regulator itself.<\/p>  <p>  A Deputy made a very important point about freedom of information and being able to get at the truth.  People are entitled to know the full facts.  They are entitled to have fair, objective and transparent regulation.  I am not saying the matter is under a cloud.  I will be voting for the legislation but the Minister needs to explain a bit more to us in the interests of transparency and accountability.  It is an important point.  I am thankful for the journalist who found it out because we were not told about it.  There is a fundamental issue of trust here between Oireachtas Members and the Minister.  There is no conflict.  Even tonight nobody is saying they do not recognise the issues.  That needs to be repaired and built on.  I ask the Minister to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000072#ZZZ00300","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1550698800,"counter":884,"content":"<p>I will try to address the issue of health first.

The noise regulator will be required to ensure that any noise assessment is in line with that legislation, which makes specific reference to the impact on human health.<\/p>  <p>  My reservations about the Opposition amendments put forward in respect of health are not on grounds of principle but simply on grounds of legal drafting in respect of what we are allowed to do and what we are not allowed to do when giving effect to EU regulations.  For that reason, regretfully, I will not be accepting amendments Nos. 47, 48, 53 and 60.  Interested Deputies have been talking to my officials about what is possible here.

I believe these amendments, when taken with the assurances that the 2002 directive and 2018 environmental noise regulations will apply, will allay any fears that health aspects are being ignored.<\/p>  <p>  I thank all of the Deputies for their contributions on this matter this evening, last week and on Committee Stage.  In particular, I know that Deputies Troy, Darragh O'Brien and Clare Daly followed up with my Department after Committee Stage to reinforce the importance of this Bill clearly referring to health as a part of any noise assessment.  Those Deputies pushed hard for a solution.  We sought legal advice and found the best way forward.  We have a much better Bill as a result of this engagement.  I thank those Deputies, and indeed all Deputies who contributed to the Bill.  It has improved specifically in the health area.  We have all been pushing in the same direction.

It was delivered at a very early stage, in 2017.  The Deputy said it was last year, but it was not.<\/p><p>I am aware of the recent report in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>on issues raised by Fingal County Council in 2017 around its suitability for the job of noise regulator.  To be clear, these concerns were raised during the exploratory process undertaken by my Department to identify a suitable State body to be the noise regulator when it became clear that the IAA was not suitable.  There were initial concerns, all of which were addressed.  I understand that the very same matter was reported by RTE last October following the pre-legislative scrutiny stage of this Bill.  To my mind it simply reveals that there was a process which included exchanges of views, discussions of key issues and risks and, importantly, legal and policy advices on these issues.  It also reveals that many of the issues raised in this Chamber and on Committee Stage about the suitability of Fingal County Council as the noise regulator were discussed and fully worked through before any firm proposal was put to me and before the Government was asked to make a decision on the matter.  Moreover, I advised this House during the same period that the work to identify a suitable body to act as the noise regulator was going on behind the scenes at official level. <\/p><p>It is interesting that, in the context of this Bill, I have been accused of making it up as I go along and not thinking things through.  The record actually shows that issues such as suitability, resources and potential conflicts of interests surfaced early on and were examined and addressed.  There were no surprises.  It is already a matter of public record that Fingal County Council had concerns at the outset.  It shared those concerns, which is healthy.  It certainly counters any suggestion that this was some sort of ready-up or that Fingal County Council has some hidden vested interest in being the regulator, which has been the undercurrent in some contributions to this debate.  This regulatory function is being assigned to Fingal County Council because of its experience of and existing responsibilities for environmental regulations, including environmental noise for planning and development, and in respect of managing large and effective public consultations, as I have outlined many times before.  Due diligence was carried out by my Department and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Fingal County Council and the Office of the Attorney General.  This was the correct approach.  All issues were aired, analysed and examined in an objective, evidence-based manner.  There is no issue of conflict - that has been legally tested -  and the resource issue has also been addressed.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019022000073#AAAA01700","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1550699400,"counter":904,"content":"<p>I find the response of the Minister to be really disappointing.  The Minister, in this Oireachtas, has railed against the Judiciary and described appointments to it as not being appropriate, yet he is now talking about a regulatory situation where the regulator, appointed and selected by the Minister, is absolutely mired in conflicts of interest.  It is responsible for planning and for being the local authority partner of a major airport, which is of enormous significance to the economy and of the country.  The Minister has railed against everybody on the matter of judicial appointments, but he is now proposing something similar for the noise regulator.  This is something that is really important in people's lives, and important to the life of the airport, which is important economically to the whole country.  The level of conflict of interest is unbelievable, and he has not explained to us why the letter was not released.  He sat on it while all of the discussions were taking place.  If any of this had happened in a judicial context we would not hear the end of it, because the Minister would rail and roar and shout against it.<\/p><p>The Minister is famous for his forthrightness.  Most public servants in his previous books were wasters.  That was the title of one of his books relating to the public service.

Now, we are pointing out to the Minister in a reasonable way on behalf of residents in the area that there are major unsustainable conflicts of interest, but he has simply decided to ignore them.  Alternatives have been put forward by the Labour Party and other parties.  They are before the House in the form of amendments.

I have asked about this on several occasions.  I have acknowledged that the appointment of Fingal County Council is imperfect.  We have facilitated the process by abstaining to allow the provisions through.  We have worked tirelessly in and out of committee with the Minister and his officials to try to improve this legislation.  I thank him for acknowledging that.<\/p>  <p>  I am keen for him to clearly outline in one of his contributions the additional resources that will be allocated to Fingal County Council to ensure that the council can hire in competent capable staff who will be able to deal with this in an efficient manner.  What measures will be taken to ensure that there will be robust transparency?  Following our intervention, the Minister agreed that external consultants would be brought in to ensure the work of the competent authority was being done right.  Certainly, that is not something he had advocated beforehand.  That is something we have achieved now.  It is important that we get this right.  It is important for the people who do not have confidence in this authority at the moment.  It is important that their confidence in the authority can be built over a period.<\/p>  <p>  It is timely to appoint a competent authority.  What some Members do not seem to think about in any way is the economic growth of the region and the country.  They do not seem to think about the &euro;8.3 billion that our airport contributes on an annual basis, the 117,000 jobs that the airport supports directly and indirectly and the thousands of families who rely on the airport in Fingal.  Some people think that if the airport grows it is somehow wrong.  Why are we building a second runway if we do not want the airport to grow?  Surely it is good for our economy if we bring in more tourists and have greater connectivity between our country, mainland Europe and the world.  I would have thought that was better.  However, we have to do that in a sustainable manner.  We have to ensure a balanced approach.  That is why I have worked on this since the beginning, at a time other Deputies were not present for Second or Committee Stages and were mute in recent years on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  This has been going on since the previous Government was in office.  The EU regulation has been in force since 2014 but there had been no advancement until now.
