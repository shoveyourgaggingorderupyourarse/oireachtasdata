I act as chair of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group and was a founding director of St. Vincent's Holdings.  I am joined today, as the Chair eloquently outlined, by Dr. John Holian, Ms Imelda Reynolds, Professor Janice Walshe and Mr. DonaI O'Raghallaigh.<\/p> <p>  Everyone at St. Vincent's Healthcare Group believes that Ireland is on the verge of an historic decision about the future of women's healthcare.  It is historic with regard to infrastructure development with all the positive and badly needed new facilities that will be delivered with it.  The relocation of the National Maternity Hospital to the Elm Park healthcare campus is a key part of the Government's maternity strategy.  We are proud to be a partner and play our part in what will be, when operational, a complete transformation of maternity and neonatal care, not only in Dublin but also as a national care centre.  From our perspective, the transformation of maternity care services, of which the proposed transfer of the National Maternity Hospital to our Elm Park campus is one part, coincides with and is in part facilitated by the complete transformation of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group after over 175 years of ownership by the Religious Sisters of Charity, RSC.  The April 2022 transfer of the RSC's St. Vincent's Healthcare Group shareholding to St. Vincent's Holdings, our new shareholder, was the last formal step in the reaching the board's objective of becoming a truly secular organisation free of any religious influence.  The board was determined to achieve this objective and we have done so.<\/p> <p>  St. Vincent's Holdings is the new owner of SVHG and is a registered Irish charity.  It is a not-for-profit company governed by Irish law.  It is not a public juridic body and there is no vehicle in the registered constitutions of either company by which any religious authority or control can be exerted.  That is a fact.  It is also a fact that the RSC transferred its shares to St. Vincent's Holdings without any conditions requiring the practice of any Catholic ethics or any other religious ethos.  SVHG is also a registered Irish charity.  It is a not-for-profit company governed by Irish law.  Our purpose and vision are to be a valuable part of an Irish healthcare system that achieves the best outcomes for patients and their families, to be known for the highest standards of patient care, clinical excellence, medical research and staff education, and to remain a voluntary, independent group that invests all our funds in the treatment and care of our patients.  As a not-for-profit company with charitable status, all our funds are reinvested in the treatment and care of our patients.<\/p> <p>  St. Vincent's Healthcare Group is a secular organisation.  The hospital has no religious ethos.  Services have been and will continue to be delivered in accordance with best international medical practice, compliant with the laws of the Ireland and to people of all faiths and none.  Multiple protections are in place to ensure no religious authority or control can be exerted.  Our founding values are dignity, compassion, justice, equality and advocacy.  These values are found in many institutions across the world and cannot be interpreted as any attempt to directly or indirectly impose a Catholic ethos.  There were many references to our culture in committee meetings last week.  Culture in all three of our hospitals is driven by a single focus, namely, to provide the best possible care for all of our patients.<\/p> <p>  We were approached by Government to become a partner with it and the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, in the relocation of maternity services to the Elm Park campus.  The opportunity to assist in the provision of world-class maternity and neonatal healthcare, together with our long-standing working relationship with Holles Street, informed our decision to support and partner on this 21st century project.  The new national maternity hospital facility will be located in the centre of our campus and will be physically integrated with our university hospital to ensure the best and seamless care for high-risk and pregnant women.  The seamless care to national maternity hospital patients will be provided by ready access to over 250 consultants covering more than 50 healthcare specialties.  The lands at the Elm Park campus have been owned outright by St. Vincent's Healthcare Group for 20 years.  Two landowners, and thus two separate independent hospitals, would make it very difficult, if not impossible, to manage the Elm Park campus and would also present significant risks to patient care.  The Mulvey agreement, which was a mediation agreement between all three parties, noted this important principle.<\/p> <p>  The important decision about to be made about the building of the national maternity hospital on the Elm Park campus is a political decision but involves the essential co-operation and agreement of the two voluntary hospitals involved.  We hope our presence today will assist members as legislators.  St. Vincent's Healthcare Group has embarked on a new course.  It is lay and secular.  It is a healthcare organisation which will hopefully soon welcome the national maternity hospital to our Elm Park campus.  It is a place that culturally and ethically fully upholds the values and laws of our Republic.  I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051600002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Menton"},{"type":"speech","time":1652655600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Menton for his opening statement and I welcome the witnesses.

He stated that after 175 years of ownership by the Religious Sisters of Charity, the order announced that it was ceasing to own the hospital in 2017.

That journey took seven and a half years and the final steps were concluded in April 2022.  It is important from the point of view of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group that, having regard to social and other change in modern Ireland in the 21st century, we become a secular organisation.

The board's decision-making frame from the very beginning, quite apart from 2017 - it goes back probably ten years - was four things.  The first is there could be no impediment to the efficient and effective delivery of patient care and that in no way would the delivery of patient care on our campus be adversely affected; second was that our ability to develop our campus into the future would not be in any way impeded by the relocation of the maternity hospital to the Elm Park campus; third, that while we would be contributing other forms of consideration we would not be expected to make any financial contribution to the project cost; and fourth, we wanted an overarching system of clinical governance on the campus to ensure it was run to best international medical standards.  From that we had a partnership from the beginning.<\/p> <p>  We engaged in the Mulvey mediation that gave rise to the Mulvey agreement.  From our perspective, what we brought to this particular arrangement was a substantial site, access to an integrated care system by virtue of the fact the proposed hospital will be integrated with our university hospital, access to provide patients with not only the excellent medical care our partners in the NMH will bring when they relocate to the campus but access also to more than 250 of our consultant cohort and 50 specialties.  All that combines to ensure patient care for women in Ireland comes into the 21st century on a seamless basis.  Also, it was very important for obvious reasons that do not need to be stated that we evolved into a secular organisation free of any church influence or religious ethics, in the same way, ironically, that when Holles Street moves from its current constitutional framework to that of the NMH at Elm Park DAC, it will also leave behind any association with church influence in the form of the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin being, or being entitled to be, the chairman of Holles Street.  There is also other Catholic representation and former Catholic representation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051600002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Menton"},{"type":"speech","time":1652655600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Menton for that.

Maybe I will start that answer and Ms Reynolds and Mr. O'Raghallaigh might want to comment.  Indeed, all of us might want to comment.  In the first instance, the legal arrangement for the transfer of the shares was into St. Vincent's Holdings CLG, which is a not-for-profit registered charity under the laws of this country and its constitution is an Irish company under the laws of this country.  We were absolutely determined there would be no restrictions placed in the constitution of that company, or indeed in its now subsidiary, or proposed subsidiary, St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, that would have any influence of Catholic ethics, the imposition of religious influence or Catholic ethics.  Anybody who has read those constitutions can clearly see that goal has been accomplished.  We also ensured specific parties bound under confidentiality agreements had access to our share purchase agreement and the other legal document indemnity which again contains no conditions of what I have just described.

Looking at the appendix, it is clear in relative terms that when you get to the net surplus of the disposal of assets, however that may arise, the proceeds go through a cascading but eventually go back to the Vatican.  That is the position in very simple terms.  No such construction has been put on the share purchase agreement of the other legal documentation in terms of the Sisters of Charity transferring their shares to SVHG.  I cannot speak for the motivation of the Sisters of Charity other than that it wanted to cease their involvement in Irish healthcare.  We want it to be a secular organisation to respond to the needs of our patients in modern Ireland.  There was a mutually inclusive objective there satisfied.  We have our motivation; they have theirs.  We did not question theirs and they did not question ours.

Like other Catholic organisations, the membership of the Sisters of Charity would have been falling consistently over decades now.  Was it not inevitable that it would be pulling back from direct involvement because there are too few of them?  I believe previous constitutions allowed for the Sisters of Charity or its nominees to make appointments and carry out functions on the boards.

My appointment in 2010 predated the departure of the Religious Sisters of Charity by several years.  Although it is possible to argue that, in theory, a Catholic ethos obtained until their departure, that is not what applied in practice.  The ethos that applied then and still applies now, as seen in our mission statement, revolves around our core values of dignity, compassion, respect, quality and advocacy, while striving to maintain excellence in clinical care, research and medical education.  These are the values we would expect of any major academic medical institution, whether here or elsewhere in the world.  While I fully understand the genuine concerns people have, the assertion that St. Vincent's hospital or the new national maternity hospital at Elm Park might be vulnerable to influence of a Catholic nature does not relate to a hospital I recognise, nor one in which I would wish to work.  Personally, and I speak on behalf of the medical board of St. Vincent's, which includes more than 250 physicians, I have never had to explain or justify a clinical decision to a religious person or body.  The culture at St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospital is, very simply, one committed to offering excellence in clinical care to our patients and their families and that is why we see this venture as a necessary step, but also as a natural step given the close collaborative links that exist between our two institutions in allowing us to deliver state-of-the-art medical care in a world-class facility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051600002#H04000","nonspeaker":"Dr. John Holian"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652655600,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I might add that, like Dr. Holian, I have been in position for ten years and wrote the cancer submission that contributed to the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013.

I will then lift the phone to the obstetrician who has a specific interest in that and gain information as to where the procedure will be performed.  The registration of terminations of pregnancy is completed centrally for patient confidentiality reasons and we know that the vast majority of those terminations are completed before 12 weeks' gestation.  In terms of where the termination will take place, that is very much guided by the consultant obstetrician.  The more complex terminations will take place in our hospital because they require the multidisciplinary involvement of different physicians.

The HSE found that while technically no rules were broken, it was not appropriate to be using State assets to fund a private institution.  This is not so much a question about the fear that this could happen again because things have changed and the rules are much more stringent now but regarding the land that is currently in question, which is part of the overall land bank, is that still the subject of some form of charge or lien as security for the bank debt?  Is this particular piece of land involved in that?  One of the conditions of the bank debt is that the debtor shall not sell, gift or dispose of any assets against which the debt is secured.

I believe it was mentioned by one of the speakers today that this related to ensuring that this would be a maternity hospital.  However, as there is language which refers to \"legally permissible healthcare services, including research, by a maternity, gynaecology, obstetrics and neonatal hospital\", there is a line within permitted use that makes it very clear what kind of hospital it is.  The question has been what exactly does the phrase \"clinically appropriate\" add.  As an example of the interpretative dangers, we have had one legal advice, I think to the NMH, that they had first heard it as \"all clinically appropriate and legally permissible healthcare services\" and others have said \"all clinically appropriate and legally permissible\".  It is an example of an ambiguous sentence.  I mean the sentence could be seen as giving a double test of \"clinically appropriate\" and \"legally permissible\".  Crucially, it places that test in legal documents such as leases and, thereby, effectively gives a responsibility to the landlord, the tenant, and the boards of both the landlord and the tenant in terms of interpretation.<\/p> <p>  I apologise in advance if I am incorrect about the following but I have heard, during the course of this meeting even, that Mulvey has said that it could be removed.  I know that the National Maternity Hospital has said that it should be removed or defined and, similarly, the Government has indicated that it is looking in that regard.  I require a clear answer as to whether St. Vincent's Healthcare Group is open to the removal of the phrase, \"clinically appropriate\" even, as we have just heard, that clinical decisions are made on the ground to an extent by the Master due to the Hippocratic oath and all of that, so why are we putting the phrase into a document that requires board interpretation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051600002#L03100","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652655600,"counter":382,"content":"<p>To touch on an earlier response, this was a request of the HSE in terms of the drafting of \"clinically appropriate\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051600002#L03200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal O'Raghallaigh"},{"type":"speech","time":1652655600,"counter":383,"content":"<p>My time is limited so I am not interested in hearing the history of the phrase.

We then come to another question of interpretation.  In his opening statement, Mr. Menton indicated that the values of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group could not be interpreted as relating to a different ethos but values are, of course, interpreted.  That is the nature and it is the job.  I note that Professor Deirdre Madden and others specifically stated that boards do have an impact on ethos.  One of the ways they do so is through how values are interpreted.  One of the values listed by the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group is human dignity.  In fact, it is the number one value listed.  There are multiple interpretations of that in the world.  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights talks about human beings who are born, so from the point of birth, being free and equal in dignity.  The Dignitas Humanae Institute in Rome, which has a universal declaration on human dignity, states that human dignity applies to every single human being without exception from conception until natural death, and that the most effective means of safeguarding this recognition is through the active participation of the Christian faith in the public square.  Those are two interpretations of human dignity.  I could give multiple examples but I will only give two due to time limitations.  What is the interpretation of human dignity by the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group?  Another of its values relates to the voice of the voiceless.

One of the witnesses before the committee last Thursday has now decided to describe freehold and leasehold as freehold being like owning a car and leasehold like owning a caravan.  Therefore, when someone owns a caravan they cannot set out the direction they go in.  Taking this, it means there are now more than 300,000 people living in houses who technically, in accordance with this interpretation, are living in caravans.  Will the witnesses set out the difference with regard to a leasehold?  As I understand it, a leasehold is a separate legal entity from a freehold.  In other words, there is a freehold legal entity and a leasehold legal entity.  The leasehold is taken from the freehold interest.  Therefore, someone with a leasehold interest of 299 years has full control of the property.<\/p><p>I think there is a misinterpretation out there on that.  For instance, the person goes on to state: \"Another control lost over the asset through the leases&rsquo; terms, which would not apply if the state owned the freehold, is that St Vincent&rsquo;s can mortgage the new NMH building.\"  That is what is up there.
