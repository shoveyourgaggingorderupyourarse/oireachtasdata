Previous rounds were the subject of considerable public disquiet as the allocations between counties did not have a clear rationale.  Between 1998 and 2010, a total of &#8364;136 per person was provided in sports capital funding across the country.  However, the allocations to individual counties varied significantly.  While the best performing county received &#8364;196 in sports funding <i>per capita<\/i>, other counties received a little over\u00a0half of that amount.  However, in order to ensure fairness, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, has decided that funding will be allocated on a <i>per capita<\/i> basis to each county, with a weighting for past performance.  Based on their historical performance since 1998, a weighting of between 90% and 120% will be applied to the <i>per capita<\/i> allocations to determine how much funding should be provided for each county.  This is, of course, based on there being sufficient eligible projects within each county.<\/p><p>  With regard to allocations within each county, every valid application is initially assessed and then receives a score based on a set of published criteria.  These criteria are published on my Department&#8217;s website and include the extent to which the project will increase the levels of participation or improve performance, especially among women and older citizens; the level of socio-economic disadvantage in the area; the technical merits and financial viability; the extent to which applicant will be able to maintain the completed project; whether the facilities will be shared; and the level of sports capital programme or other Government funding previously received.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.<\/i><\/p><p>Two criteria have been added since 2008 - those relating to the sharing of facilities and previous Government funding.

They are priority as identified by the relevant national governing body of sport; priority as identified by the Irish Sports Council; the location of the facility within the network of national, regional and municipal multi-sports facilities; and linkages with the local authorities' swimming pools programme.

Responsibility to develop, procure, implement, operate and maintain the integrated ticketing system in the greater Dublin area became the function of the National Transport Authority, NTA, with effect from 30 September 2010 in accordance with section 58 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.  The Leap card scheme continues to prove popular with public transport users.\u00a0 I encourage ever Member to have one.  It is imperative that we show leadership.  To date, more than 175,000 cards have been issued and, in October, 1.5 million journeys were completed using Leap cards.\u00a0 The scheme has now handled in excess of 10 million journeys since launch\u00a0and turns over approximately \u20ac2.5 million per month.<\/p><p>  I\u00a0understand from the\u00a0NTA that Dublin Bus\u00a0equipment has not been designed to handle tag-on tag-off. Adding this function would involve significant time and cost and could well require replacement of the full ticketing system\u00a0on buses.  Generally, it is considered impractical to require that passengers\u00a0tag off as they leave\u00a0buses, and\u00a0particularly\u00a0where buses are single door vehicles.\u00a0 Tag-on tag-off would slow down journey times because passengers would be tagging off on the same machines that boarding passengers are using.  For single door operations, this would increase the dwell time significantly for passengers and be a bad experience.  I understand there are few examples internationally of tag-on tag-off smart card schemes on buses in metropolitan areas and none using single door vehicles.  In other major cities using an integrated ticketing system, \u00a0they operate either a flat fare system or they use two-door bus vehicles.  I understand the authority is undertaking a study to prepare a business case for the national roll-out of the Leap card.\u00a0\u00a0However, this would\u00a0require additional funding outside of the current capital programme.\u00a0\u00a0It is also my understanding that difficulties regarding availability of top-up facilities have been resolved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700009#G01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"speech","time":1354027800,"counter":72,"content":"<p>The Leap card has been a good move for Dublin.

The question is whether there should be changes to the taxation regime to support sporting organisations and clubs.  The sports capital programme is an area delegated to the Minister of State, Deputy Ring.  Deputies will be aware that the Department has received 2,170 applications for funding under the 2012 sports capital programme, seeking \u20ac229 million in funding for projects with a total value of \u20ac374 million.  This is the largest number of applications ever received under the programme.  I have approval from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to allocate \u20ac30 million.  I believe this shows the value the Government places on sport.  Approximately \u20ac26 million of this amount has been earmarked for local projects, including community sports clubs and organisations.  Departmental officials are processing all applications and this process is almost complete.  I expect to be able to announce the list of successful applicants later this year.<\/p><p>  The Government has also committed to a further programme during its lifetime.  When the current programme is finished, with the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, I will examine the successes and failures of the current round of applications.  As the 2012 process is unfolding, one aspect of particular concern to me and the Minister of State is the high number of ineligible applications.  In some counties assessed to date the majority of applications have been ineligible.  In designing the next scheme we will need to take account of that.  I note that the Irish Sports Council's sport monitor report for 2011 shows that active participation in sport increased from 34% in 2009 to 46% in 2011 among adults.  The 2012 sports capital grants will improve facilities in every county and provide increased opportunities for more people to engage in sport to the best of their ability.<\/p><p>  With regard to wider supports for sporting organisations, the Deputies may be aware that the Revenue Commissioners have a scheme that provides tax relief for donations to certain sports bodies.  It is important that sporting organisations can secure alternative sources of investment,\u00a0including private donations.  The current tax relief scheme for donations to sporting organisations is restrictive because it applies only to donations for capital purposes.  Taxation issues, including the amendment or introduction of tax relief schemes, are\u00a0a matter for the Minister for Finance.  However, I wrote to the Minister for Finance\u00a0in October outlining possible amendments to existing tax relief schemes which would\u00a0allow relief for\u00a0non-capital\u00a0donations to\u00a0sporting organisations as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700011#J01900","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1354028700,"counter":100,"content":"<p>On top of the commitment and the funding sought, amounting to approximately \u20ac220 million, sports organisations have given a commitment to spend up to \u20ac145 million of capital to get these projects off the ground.

Those working in the voluntary sector are engaged in preventive work in tackling obesity, low self-esteem and depression among young people.  It is hoped the Government will in this and future rounds of the sports capital programme provide a greater proportion of funding for small local voluntary organisations in all sports codes, rather than give a disproportionate amount to the larger organisations which have been surviving adequately for many years.

It is the policy of Government to favour local grants heavily over regional and national grants, although there is also a strong argument for the opposite approach.  Certainly, people in local communities very much favour spreading the funds as widely as possible to different sporting organisations, but often that means that facilities are duplicated, with two clubs not very far apart from one another getting the same facilities.  The national governing bodies argue that we should split the money the other way and put more into regional and national facilities, which is an area in which we fall down quite badly as a country.

Its ability to set its own charges again, if it is separated, will assist it in securing new business, which will be a positive for the airport.  The 2004 Act, which was introduced by Fianna F\u00e1il, always envisaged that Aer Rianta International would remain part of what was then the Aer Rianta Group, now DAA.  That remains the case.  The Act also requires that whatever happens, both entities must be viable.  Shannon must be viable and the remaining DAA must be viable.  For Shannon Airport to retain Aer Rianta International and have its debt written off, would bring the viability of both Dublin Airport and Cork Airport into question.  It was never going to be a case that Shannon would get both a debt write-off and retain Aer Rianta International.

We have had growth from everywhere else but that has been pretty much cancelled out by a fall-off in numbers from Britain.

I am not sure if the &quot;Escape the Madness&quot; campaign has been reviewed yet but it would be the normal process for that to be done.  While we accept the hoped-for tourism growth did not materialise, the industry has noted that it came at a relatively modest cost and still managed to raise the profile of Ireland within Britain.

As I have already made a statement to the House on the outcome of this meeting, I will give a summary of proceedings to the House.<\/p><p>  The main focus of our discussions was the strengthening of economic and monetary union.  In this regard, President Van Rompuy presented his interim report.  It was agreed that he should continue his consultations with member states and others before bringing forward his final report to the December European Council.  That report will set out a specific and time-bound road map for strengthening economic and monetary union.<\/p><p>  President Van Rompuy will be following up on the possibility of having a fiscal capacity for the euro area and possible contracts between member states and the EU institutions, including covering the country-specific recommendations made in the European semester process.  These ideas need to be elaborated on further before we can judge whether they might have a substantial contribution to make.  For Ireland's part, the Government will continue to engage in these consultations constructively and with an open mind.  The European Council reaffirmed the commitment made last June to break the vicious circle between banking and sovereign debt.  In addition, the European Council agreed to move forward as a matter of priority on the single supervisory mechanism for euro area banks, with the objective of concluding its legislative framework by the end of the year.  Work on operational implementation is to be carried out during the course of 2013.  The European Council has also tasked the Eurogroup of Finance Ministers to draw up the exact operational criteria that will guide direct bank recapitalisation by the ESM, as it termed, &quot;in full respect of &quot; the June decisions. <\/p><p>  With regard to the compact for growth and jobs, the European Council reviewed progress on its implementation and set a number of additional orientations to promote growth and employment.  This was a welcome follow-up on implementation of the compact.  <\/p><p>  The European Council also discussed relations with the European Union's strategic partners, particularly China.  The meeting further adopted conclusions on Syria, Iran and Mali.  Ireland contributed to the conclusions of the meeting of the European Council in October in the usual way, including through the submission of written proposals on the range of issues covered.<\/p><p>  While I had no formal bilateral meetings at the October European Council, I met all my colleagues at the meeting.  I raised the question of Ireland's legacy bank debts and the specific circumstances that had brought about our current situation.<\/p><p>  On Sunday, 21 October, following the European Council meeting, I had a telephone conversation with Chancellor Merkel.  On foot of that discussion, we issued a joint communiqu\u00e9 that makes it clear that the commitments made to Ireland at the end of June stand and that the vital work involved in examining the situation of the Irish financial sector will be taken forward by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and his colleagues in the Eurogroup, with a view to improving the sustainability of our programme.  In Ireland we moved early.  We put very large amounts into the banks in the interests of wider stability in Europe's banks and those of our common currency.  The Chancellor was pleased to record her recognition that Ireland was a special case and that this would be taken into account during the discussions ahead. <\/p><p>  I travelled to Paris on 22 October for a bilateral meeting with President Hollande.  Our discussions focused on the outcome of the European Council; negotiations on the multi-annual financial framework and, in that context, the Common Agricultural Policy; eurozone issues; Ireland's forthcoming Presidency; and bilateral relations.  Significantly, President Hollande added his voice to the appreciation of the special situation which Ireland faced, an acknowledgment that these circumstances will need to be taken into account as the Eurogroup takes this work forward.  While in Paris, I also addressed a business lunch organised by the State agencies.  I visited SIAL, the largest food and agribusiness fair in the world, and launched Origin Green at this international forum.<\/p><p>  I travelled to Berlin on 1 November for a bilateral meeting with Chancellor Merkel.  We had an in-depth discussion about the Irish reform programme.  The Chancellor reaffirmed her conviction that Ireland was a special case and should be treated as such in the work being taken forward by the Eurogroup.  We both welcomed the recent comments by the troika on Ireland's delivery of its programme commitments and the troika's willingness to look at the various ways in which Ireland could be assisted in resuming sustainable, full market borrowing.  We both agreed to work together to ensure dealing with Ireland's unique banking and sovereign debt crisis was given due priority within the Eurogroup.   <\/p><p>  The Chancellor and I also had a very useful discussion about events in the wider euro area.  We agreed to work constructively to bring stability and confidence to the euro area as a whole.  In addition, we discussed the strengthening of economic and monetary union; the multi-annual financial framework; priorities for the Irish Presidency; and a range of foreign policy matters.  While in Berlin, I also attended the launch of The Gathering in Germany and met Irish community organisations and key business partners.<\/p><p>  On 8 November I travelled to Budapest for a meeting with Prime Minister Orban and to Vienna for a meeting with Chancellor Faymann.  Discussions at both meetings focused on priorities for the Irish Presidency, in particular, the Single Market; negotiations on the multi-annual financial framework; and developments in the eurozone.  These topics were also the subject of my discussions with Prime Minister Gonzi of Malta when he visited Dublin recently.  I saw both Prime Minister Katainen of Finland and Prime Minister Rutte of the Netherlands at the special European Council meeting on Thursday and Friday of last week.  Prime Minister Rutte's new government took office on 5 November.  I am in regular contact with Prime Minister Cameron.  I spoke with him by telephone in advance of last week's meeting.<\/p><p>I also spoke to President Hollande in advance of the Council meeting. <\/p><p> I attended the special meeting of the European Council last Thursday and Friday in Brussels.  As I will be making a statement to the House on this meeting tomorrow, I will just give a summary of its proceedings now.  The meeting sought to reach agreement on the Union's multi-annual financial framework for the period 2014 to 2020.  However, following productive discussions, President Van Rompuy concluded that a little more time was needed to bring positions closer together.  The European Council mandated President Van Rompuy, together with the President of the European Commission, to continue the work and pursue consultations in the coming weeks to find consensus among the 27 member states.  President Van Rompuy believes our discussions at the European Council show a sufficient degree of potential convergence to make an agreement possible early next year.  While we did not reach agreement last week, we did move forward in identifying common ground.  I remain hopeful it will be possible to build on this in the period ahead.  <\/p><p> With regard to Ireland, I put the case strongly for a strong Common Agricultural Policy and also expressed our firm view that Europe needs a budget that, in size and orientation, is more reflective of challenges we face as a union, including in respect of growth and jobs, especially in tackling unemployment.  More can and should be done to give a real focus to the budget.  Of course, as ever, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  We need to protect the progress made and continue to work to close the remaining gaps.  I have assured President Van Rompuy that Ireland, especially in its upcoming Presidency, will do everything it can to support him in his work.<\/p><p> A copy of the employment contract of the person appointed as spokesperson for the EU Presidency in my Department, which sets out in full the terms and conditions of her employment, was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 19 November and is available for the Deputy's inspection in the Oireachtas Library.<\/p><p> While the costs of my visit to Rome on 21 September are yet to be finalised, I expect the cost to my Department to be \u20ac1,011.71.  This figure includes official transport, accommodation and travel and subsistence costs.  While in Rome, I was accompanied at my meetings with Prime Ministers Monti, Rajoy and Samaras by the Second Secretary General with responsibility for EU affairs and co-ordination, the Irish ambassador to Italy, my chief of staff and an official from the Irish Embassy in Rome.  As I had no official engagements in Bucharest, there were no costs to my Department in that respect.<\/p><p> I will attend the meeting of the European Council to be held on 13 and 14 December in Brussels.  Discussions at the meeting will focus on President Van Rompuy's final report on strengthening economic and monetary union.  The European Council will also assess progress made on the single supervisory mechanism and other key legislative proposals and, if necessary, set further orientations in this respect.  With regard to the compact for growth and jobs, the European Council will assess progress made on the priority proposals of the first Single Market Act and set further orientations as regards the second Single Market Act.  In addition, the European Council will touch on defence matters, enlargement and foreign policy issues.<\/p><p> I intend to engage positively with colleagues on each of the issues on the agenda to ensure the best possible outcome for Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700020#T06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354033800,"counter":332,"content":"<p>There is a large number of questions in each Deputy's name.

The fact that 55 questions have been taken together gives the lie to any claim that we have witnessed a democratic revolution in how we do business as politicians.  It illustrates how nonsensical it is to suggest there has been radical reform of the Oireachtas.  We all agree that the European Union is by far the most important issue facing us as a country, yet we have grouped together 55 questions covering all recent contacts and meetings involving the Taoiseach and other European leaders.  The questions cover Council meetings, bank debt, budgets and a range of other issues.  It is not tenable to take all of them together.<\/p><p>  I am receiving letters in response to queries stating I cannot ask the Taoiseach questions about his policy for the Irish Presidency of the European Union.  These questions are being sent to the office of the T\u00e1naiste, despite the fact that the Taoiseach took control of the EU section of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at the very beginning.  The bulk of EU activity is now covered by the Department of the Taoiseach.  One would have believed, therefore, that it was quite legitimate to ask the Taoiseach questions about the EU Presidency.  The Taoiseach heads up the EU section which was taken from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, yet we are told we cannot ask questions on the policies he may be pursuing and the principles he may be espousing on the Presidency.  This is somewhat farcical.<\/p><p>  As I will not be able to follow up on all of the questions asked, I will address just a few.  It has been confirmed that Ireland has led moves to ensure nothing will happen regarding the banking union proposal that requires a change to the treaties.  How does the Taoiseach justify this?  We support the banking union.  Does the Taoiseach support it?  Does he accept that banking union will necessitate change to the EU treaties?  Will he explain why he has objected to or opposes establishment of a banking union that would require a change to the EU treaties?  By not changing them, he may be supporting the weakest proposal or a possible suggested variant.  What is his specific policy on banking union?<\/p><p>  It is five months since we were told the June summit was a big game-changer that had single-handedly changed the game on bank debt by securing a package for Ireland that had been promised to everybody else.  I refer to the famous Monti-Rajoy intervention in June.  We still do not know what is actually being sought on the issue of bank debt.  I would appreciate it if the Taoiseach outlined to the House what exactly we are seeking.  In June everybody took from the meeting and the comments made by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and the T\u00e1naiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, that the decisive move meant the ESM was open to fund recapitalisation of our pillar banks, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland.  Despite this, last week the Minister for Finance questioned the wisdom of this approach and said it might not now be a good idea to use the ESM to deal retrospectively with the equity the State took in the pillar banks.<\/p><p>  When we say there is a retrospective dimension to the June deal, what do we actually mean by this?  How does the Taoiseach envisage the ESM being used to deal with Irish debt in the context of the pillar banks?  Will he define the minimum deal acceptable to secure sustainability?  How does he define sustainability in regard to debt?<\/p><p>  We were originally told a deal would be struck in October.  When does the Taoiseach expect a deal to be struck in regard to our debt?  He is now saying it could be months away.  Will it be before March next year?  There are two dimensions, namely, the ESM and the promissory note.  The latter has been dealt with via the European Central Bank.  Is the Taoiseach seeking a deal to change the terms attached to the promissory note or replace the promissory note with a standard debt?<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach has indicated that Chancellor Merkel reaffirmed that Ireland was a special case.  Does he accept, however, that neither the Chancellor nor any senior Minister or official in the German Administration has yet revised the official German position that no retroactive measures will be allowed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700021#U00300","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1354033800,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.

I made the point the other day that if a conclusion had been reached on the budget for 2014 to 2020, it would have allowed Ireland's Presidency to focus on the consequences of that, which is CAP reform, sectoral reform in a number of areas and 68 Bills before the European Parliament.  Even if a deal were struck, the Government and its officials would have had a great deal of work to be involved in.  The fact that a deal has not been struck adds to that workload.  While it is important to note that the question of resolving the budget for the Union is one for the Council President because it is on his desk and while Ireland's Presidency will work closely with him, it is a matter for him to define when he believes there is agreement to put a deal together.  Ireland, as holder of the Presidency, will work closely with him in dealing with different leaders but we do not have the imprimatur to say &quot;This is what is going to happen here&quot; because that is a matter for the 27 member states.  I assured the Council President that we will work closely with him and with other leaders to see that he is ready to call the meeting at where he hopes we can get a conclusion on this.  My view is that the quicker it can be done, the better.  It may be the end of January or February; I cannot say yet.<\/p><p>  We support banking union.  The question has always been asked about whether we support this only in respect of major banks or for banks throughout Europe and I have made the point repeatedly that the bank which brought this country over the edge was not a major bank in European terms and that is why it is necessary that banking union and the supervisory role should cover the spread of more than 6,000 banks involved.<\/p><p>  The question of treaty change impacts on our people and it is nothing new for Ireland to have to deal with but it is important to understand that after 2014 there will be a new European Parliament and a new Commission and the question of treaty change, in my view, should be considered during the term of that Parliament and that Commission.

I recall saying that I did not think that was possible and, clearly, that did not become a reality.  We are conscious that there is a real understanding from both a political and a leadership point of view and among the IMF, the Commission and the Parliament, of the need for a deal to be done for Ireland but this is a matter for discussion between the Government, through the Department of Finance and the Minister, and the European Central Bank, which comprises the central bank governors of the 17 different countries.  Many of them have their own views.  We need the deal on that end and the other end will follow through from the legal framework and the discussions at the other side where the decision was made to break the link between sovereign and bank debt.  As I said in reply to Deputy Ross earlier, what I would like to see out of that is that this would be re-engineered similar to the replacement of an overdraft with serious challenges by a long-term low interest mortgage.  It is in that area that the discussions are taking place and I hope that the Minister will be able to bring that to a conclusion before the next payment due date in March 2013.<\/p><p>  When I discussed the question of the view of the ESM with Chancellor Merkel and others, the decision on 29 June was that the vicious circle between sovereign and bank debt should be broken and once that happened, the banking union with the supervisory role would be set up, which would allow for potential recapitalisation of banks from the ESM.  The issue then was whether a country had responsibility for legacy debt or not and, obviously, different comments were made about this by different people.  That is why it was important to be able to explain to other leaders that, in the case of Ireland, the recapitalisation had taken place because when the Administration of which the Deputy was a member made its decision in respect of the bank guarantee, the banks were then recapitalised but the taxpayer was required to pay for them.  That is a fact that happened and the nature of these discussions is how creative we can be with the ESM in dealing with this when it is now accepted that Ireland has particular circumstances arising out of that historic decision.  Its case, therefore, is special and different from countries that may go into a programme or those that are in a programme, which will find themselves with a need for funding.<\/p><p>  The joint communiqu\u00e9 that we issued was clearly of that understanding and the agreement at the meeting of the Heads of Government was that this particular situation would be taken into account in the discussions that take place at the Eurogroup between the Ministers for finance.  That does not mean that we have to wait for the end of the structure - the banking union and supervisory role - to be completed before Ireland's particular circumstances and special case can be considered.  That is something, I believe, that can proceed in parallel with that work.  I cannot say when that will happen.  When will the banking union and supervisory role be effective?  Mr. Draghi was clear on this when he spoke at the meeting and there was general agreement that, given the range of banks involved, the requirement for national supervisory capacity to be restructured and the need to recruit personnel from Frankfurt and so on, it certainly could not be done in the first half of the year.  People will read into this that it was never going to happen before the federal elections in Germany next autumn.  Be that as it may, Mr. Draghi was confident that they could get a great deal of work done in the first six months once the legal framework was set in position.<\/p><p>While there have been comments from different financial people and various elements of different governments, it is clear that there is an acceptance and an understanding that our circumstances are different and that, due to the fact that bank recapitalisation had already happened, the matter needs to be treated as a special case.  It will require some creative thinking to bring about a reduction in terms of our capacity to meet that debt.  That is understood.  The question for negotiation and discussion is how one does it.  Deputy Martin may have views that are helpful in this regard.  It is in the country's interest that we get a deal on this, following the decision of the European Council to break that link in the first place.  The Deputy will recall that people said - not just in here but outside the House - that this would never happen, no more than they said there would never be a permanent bailout mechanism in Europe or a European financial stability facility, yet all of these things have come to be a reality.  We will continue to press the case for a reduction in the level of debt arising from the decision made on 29 June, and I hope we can be successful in that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700022#V01100","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354035000,"counter":347,"content":"<p>To tease this out, it is unclear how the ESM will apply to AIB and Bank of Ireland and the funding injected into them.  The recapitalisation of the banks was not through the bank guarantee but was a key part of the programme with the troika, as was the clear policy of the European Central Bank that no bank should fail and no senior bondholder should be burned.  That was the essential position of the European authorities at the time, which they imposed on Ireland in the troika deal.  The Taoiseach accepted this when he emerged from his meeting with the French President, Mr. Hollande, recently.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach is now saying that the way to deal with the promissory note is essentially to get it into a long-term mortgage, which will make the repayments easier.  There are some benefits to this, but it does not mean a write-down.  The Taoiseach is basically saying the promissory note's terms will be lengthened and put out into the distant future so there will be a greater capacity to deal with it.  Where is the retrospective application arising out of the separation of sovereign debt from bank debt in so far as it applies to AIB and Bank of Ireland?  How does the Taoiseach envisage that occurring?  Will the ESM take over AIB and our shares in Bank of Ireland?  If so, at what price?  Is this is what is being discussed?  The Minister for Finance seemed to be suggesting that last June but now he is saying he is not so sure we want the ESM owning our banks.  From the Taoiseach's reply, I am getting the sense that this is not on either.  It is unclear how this so-called retrospective dimension to the June deal will apply to our pillar banks.  Will the Taoiseach clarify this?<\/p><p>  Will the Taoiseach confirm, on the banking union, that we are not opposing a solution which may involve treaty change?  I want a strong banking union.  If it involves treaty change, I am prepared to support that and persuade the people it is in our best interest.  I hope we are not negotiating on the basis that the last thing we want is another referendum on a treaty change, which seemed to be the position on the fiscal treaty.<\/p><p>  Is the whole agenda of the banking union slipping?  After the October Council meeting we were informed there had been major advances and we would have the heads of an agreement by January.  Earlier the Taoiseach spoke about the first half of the year.  The sense out there is that it will be well into 2013, if at all, before there is agreement on a banking union across Europe.<\/p><p>  The EU budget looks to be in trouble, with significant reductions proposed.  The European Council President, Mr. Van Rompuy, has proposed a significant reduction in the budget with a consequential reduction in the overall size of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, envelope.  This would be serious for Ireland.  In January, we will take over the EU Presidency.  Will the Taoiseach outline his recent discussions with the French President, Mr. Hollande, on the CAP and how Ireland, France and others can work to ensure Irish farmers are not disadvantaged by the rather petulant approach adopted by the British Prime Minister and others who want to reduce the size of the European budget?  It is incomprehensible for those outside Europe who feel that if anyone can do a stimulus programme it is Europe on a pan-European level.  Despite the fact that the EU budget amounts to only 1% of Europe's overall GDP, it is actually going to be cut back, which sells the European citizen short in this crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700023#W00200","speaker":"992"},{"type":"speech","time":1354035000,"counter":348,"content":"<p>The decision on the ESM was made back in June and then fleshed out further at the next Council meeting.  It was decided the legal framework would be put in place by the end of the year so that the details of the conditions, the modalities and the mechanics of it could be worked out during 2013.  I listened to the explanation given by Mr. Draghi, the Commission and the Presidency.  This is obviously a massive undertaking.  Everyone was of the understanding that a banking union with a supervisory element would not be up and running in the first half of 2013.  I cannot say what it will be like in the end until we see what shape emerges.  If it is an issue that requires treaty change, then we have to accept that.  At this stage I cannot say - nor can anyone else - whether this will require treaty change.  If it does, then so be it.  That would be an issue to be dealt with in any event by the European Parliament elected after 2014 with the new European Commission.  There is a strong feeling emerging in Europe that while we have had the Union for some time, we never had the capacity for a monetary union in the sense of having banking supervisory responsibilities, and these things will never happen again.  The remit has been given to the finance Ministers, and the sort of structure envisaged will emerge fairly quickly.  At the end of it, if it means better regulation, better transparency, better accountability and better responsibility, then I am not averse to having to deal with future treaty change.  However, I cannot confirm whether it will be necessary, and nor can anyone else at this stage.<\/p><p>  The detail of how it will work out remains to be seen.  It is fair to say hindsight is a wonderful thing.

However, it is history now, and we are into this business.<\/p><p>  Last weekend's meeting was a good-spirited one with no descent into the personal rancour which often breaks out at these events, of which Deputy Martin is well aware.  There was no wish to divide the European Council between contributor countries and receiving countries.  The large contributors such as Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, Germany and Britain were not saying they wanted to move off on their own and leave the rest behind.  This is a recognition of the importance of keeping the 27 member states together.  It is also interesting that the discussions I had with the French President, Mr. Hollande, the European Council President, Mr. Van Rompuy, and the Commission President, Mr. Barroso, about the CAP and the agri-sector were replicated by many others.<\/p><p>Strong opinions were also voiced about the Cohesion Fund and Pillar 2 and the importance of rural development.  We are not alone in this regard.  Chancellor Faymann of Austria, which has the highest <i>per capita<\/i>income in the Union, referred to Alpine farmers and their difficulties.  Prime Minister Gonzi from Malta spoke about the importance of the Cohesion Fund to his small country.  The same applied in the case of Hungary and others.  It was interesting that the majority of contributions made by the funding countries expressed a wish for a reduction in the overall level of the budget such that the agri-sector could be protected.<\/p><p> Deputy Martin will be aware that we get 85% of our income in Ireland under the direct payments system and others elements of the Common Agricultural Policy.  We mounted a strong defence of this, as did President Hollande and others, as well as of the Cohesion Fund and rural development.  It is important to remember that the greatest number of jobs being created in Europe comes through the food manufacturing sector and the agri-economy.<\/p><p> I thought it was positive because in the contributions made on the reduction of the overall ceiling of the budget the contributor countries did not try to reduce the importance or the understanding of the CAP and what it offers.  At the end of the meeting there was an understanding that there is clear potential to put together a budget from 2014 to 2020.  As the incoming holder of the EU Council Presidency, we need to work with President van Rompuy, but we also need to protect the Common Agricultural Policy and Ireland's national interest in it and we need to fight for nothing less than what we have already in the rural development area and the Cohesion Fund.  These are important elements for the regions in this country and for the type of developments that have taken place in recent years, in respect of which we have used the money well and few penalties have been imposed on Ireland as a result.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700023#W00500","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354035600,"counter":352,"content":"<p>Deputy Martin's earlier concerns about An Taoiseach answering multiple questions have been confounded by his capacity to answer 55 in one batch.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700024#X00200","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1354035600,"counter":353,"content":"<p>Deputy McDonald is on now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700024#X00300","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1354035600,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I am curious to know more because the term special case has been used.  The Taoiseach tells us that Angel Merkel, Mr. Hollande and all the others recognise us as a special case.  Will the Taoiseach set out for us what they understand by this?  It is a turn of phrase the Taoiseach has used regularly but there is no clarity to what is meant by it.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach still seems to be placing all his eggs in the retrospection basket on account of last June's agreement.  The difficulty with the announcement as cast some months ago is that it does not have a specific or explicit promise of retrospection or deal with legacy debt for Ireland.  The statement referred to the sustainability of our programme.  I note that in his responses to Deputy Martin the Taoiseach used that turn of phrase.  When he is explaining the meaning of a special case perhaps he will unpick these two elements for us.  The reference to the sustainability of the programme may not mean dealing with legacy debts.  In addition, the Taoiseach seems remarkably confident that legacy issues will be dealt with despite the fact that certain rather influential voices, not least from within the German system, have been categoric in stating that this is not their understanding of the position.  It is by no means a done deal, whether via the ESM or any other mechanism, that retrospection and legacy debt have been signed off and dealt with.  Anyway, the Taoiseach might shed some light on this for us.<\/p><p>  I call on the Taoiseach to refer specifically to the position on the promissory note because there has been a catalogue of statements and public utterances on the matter.  The Taoiseach has referred to the technical complexities involved on the restructuring of the note.  At one stage the troika were working on a paper on the promissory note but it seems to have vanished or at least we never got sight of it.  Will the Taoiseach tell us specifically where this is and in specific terms how much progress has been made?  Specifically, when will all the technical dilemmas and questions be ironed out?  When will the Taoiseach be able to come into the D\u00e1il and announce that an agreement has been reached?<\/p><p>  In a reply to an earlier contribution from Deputy Ross the Taoiseach listed the litany of hardship that Greece and the Greek people are enduring.  It made for sober listening.  There is no question but that their system and society is under the most incredible pressures at the moment.  However, I believe the Taoiseach, perhaps for his own political purposes, has discounted the extent to which Greece has outflanked and outperformed this State in securing a deal for itself, albeit in the most dire of circumstances.  How is it that Greece, in the midst of crisis and in such a weakened position, can secure an agreement?  Whether it will be adequate to ensure an end to its difficulties remains to be seen and I rather doubt it.  However, we know that Greece has consistently achieved some level of recognition and relief while Ireland, also a special case according to the Taoiseach, has thus far had conversations, meetings, side-meetings and summits, but no result.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700024#X00400","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1354035600,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I remind the House that there are only 15 minutes left.

I have outlined some of the decisions that have been taken in terms of restructuring, the dismissal of public service workers and reductions in pensions and pay.  I have also referred to the inability to meet various bills and the necessity to put in place a tax structure that will deliver.<\/p><p>  I listened to all the talk six months ago about Greece defaulting and being driven out of the euro and about the catastrophe facing us.  However, at the meeting there was a recognition by the finance Ministers of a situation whereby after another election the people in Greece elected another Government, which set about trying to deal with the problems.  As a result of the decision taken and agreed last night the Greek debt to GDP ratio will still be at 124% by 2022.  Given their levels of unemployment and the challenges they face, that is absolutely vast.  Greece is in a different place entirely from Ireland.<\/p><p>  Why are we a special case?  What does this mean?  I suppose the circumstances that apply are different.  We are placed in a unique situation because of the fact that on top of the national debt our people were required to shoulder the burden of a recapitalisation fund of more than \u20ac64 billion.<\/p><p>There is a recognition politically and economically of how it is that Ireland finds itself in this situation.  That is the reason the circumstances are different and, therefore, the case is special.<\/p><p> The decision taken on 29 June related to breaking the link between sovereign and bank debt, which could lead to direct recapitalisation by the ESM.  The question that then arose was whether that included legacy debt in banks in other countries.  In Ireland's case, it is all legacy debt in the sense that what is done has already been done.  Our situation is different from that of a banking system in another country which might get into difficulties and require funding from the ESM in the future.  The decision was taken on the basis of its potentially leading to direct recapitalisation.  For us, it was a recognition of our particular circumstances and, as a consequence, a definition of Ireland as being a special case.  The discussions with the finance Ministers are about whether this special case and these unique circumstances can be taken into account.  Ireland's case is different from that of a bank in another country that may experience difficulties in a year's or two years' time.  We have already been, and still are, in difficulty and have had to recapitalise our banks.  The creative discussions and negotiations will be concerned with how we can use the potential of the ESM to deal with that.<\/p><p> I have previously outlined the position with regard to the promissory note, and I will not go into the detail of that matter for Deputy McDonald except to say, as I have already said, that the next payment is due in March 2013.  We would like to be in a position, by that time, not to have to issue another up-front payment of \u20ac3 billion.  As I previously told Deputy Martin, I had the privilege of opening a small school in the west last year which cost \u20ac1 million.  Three thousand such schools could be built every year for ten years for the amount that has gone into Anglo Irish Bank, now IBRC, which is extraordinary.  In any event, it is in that space that the discussions are taking place between the Minister and his officials and officials from the European Central Bank in Frankfurt.  The intention is that by March 2013 the promissory note will have been re-engineered in such a way as to ensure we will not have to fork out \u20ac3 billion.  That is our hope and intent.  As I said, the European Central Bank is governed by 17 governors from the different countries in the eurozone, all of whom have their own opinions on a whole range of issues.  That is where the discussions are.<\/p><p> The Deputy also asked whether progress had been made.  Yes, I would say so.  If the Deputy is asking me for a specific date in this regard, it is hoped the matter will be dealt with by March 2013.  Obviously, the quicker the better.

In this regard, he cited the disastrous consequences of austerity for Greece.  Is it not the case that the reality is the other way around?  Europe was forced to give a write-down to Greece, recognising the disastrous consequences of austerity for the Greek economy and people.  Greece screamed at Europe economically, socially and politically that austerity and imposing that level of debt on the Greek people was a disaster.  When will the Taoiseach and the troika recognise that the same will happen here unless this debt burden is lifted and the austerity linked to it is pulled back from?<\/p><p>When will the troika cop on to how badly our society and economy have been damaged a result of the suffocating debt burden that has been imposed on us and the austerity we are being asked to endure in order to pay the debt back?  It is time for the Taoiseach to change strategy.  He should stop talking up the Irish situation and telling the troika how wonderful things are because the message that is sending to them is that we do not need debt relief and that there is no hurry on debt relief for Ireland.  In reality, however, people are being plunged into poverty, hundreds of thousands are unemployed and people are flooding out of the country.  At what point is the Taoiseach going to put up his hand to the troika and tell them that this is a disaster for our economy?  We do not want to reach the depths that Greece is reaching in order for the troika finally to cop on that we cannot afford to pay this debt.  Next year the interest holiday on the promissory notes is over and 15% of Government expenditure will go on repaying interest on debt.  Does the Taoiseach honestly think that is sustainable?  Does the troika think it is sustainable?  It will absolutely destroy our economy.  I ask the Taoiseach to speak up on our behalf, like the Spanish, Greek, Italian and Portuguese governments have done, and say we cannot do this anymore and the people cannot take this pain anymore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700025#Y07800","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354036800,"counter":436,"content":"<p>In the context of the alleged intention at a previous summit that there should be a breaking of the link between banking and sovereign debt, does the Taoiseach agree that this can only have meaning for the Irish people if the \u20ac64 billion of taxpayers' funds that was used to bail out the banks and the bondholders is paid back to the Irish people?  Does he also agree that the European institutions and the IMF, which were disgracefully allowed to cow an Irish Government into pay the gambling debts of speculators and bond holders, should now take the hit, along with the speculators they were protecting?  Does he further agree that if there is any meaning to this and if it is not implemented in that way, the Irish people are fully entitled to cancel the debt, for which they have no responsibility whatsoever?  Only that would give any meaning to the bone that Chancellor Merkel threw the Taoiseach some time ago, when he begged her to give him political cover, when she said that Ireland was a \"special case\".  If the Taoiseach disagrees with what I am suggesting, I ask him to outline very clearly what is meant by a \"special case\", in the sense of any impact it might have on the lives of the Irish people.

I also draw his attention to the sale of the communications spectrum for over \u20ac800 million to three major telecommunications companies.  While these of themselves do not sort out our problems, they are signs of the confidence of international investors in our country, of which we need more so that jobs begin to flow, money begins to circulate, credit becomes available and people can get back down to business.

Early in the new year and before the D\u00e1il resumes in January the Joint Committee on Health and Children will hold public hearings on whatever option is chosen by the Government.  Deputies will be aware that we changed the rules for committees to allow them to hold public hearings without having to make recommendations on matters of public interest.  It is only appropriate that, for example, the masters of the maternity hospitals should be able to address the joint committee to point to the grey areas which need to be investigated by constitutional and legal people.

thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this issue for debate.  As the Minister is probably aware, this issue is pertinent and has come to our attention again in the past week.  In my constituency, a new long-awaited school building project was interrupted last week when some subcontractors, desperate for some sort of resolution to their problems, went into a school in Kilfinane in County Limerick and tried to remove material from the school.  The issue of whether they were right or wrong to do that is an issue for another forum.<\/p><p>  The situation has caused significant distress among the school community, the parents, teachers, management and pupils, who have been waiting on this new building for a long time.  The situation has also created a momentum with regard to dealing with the issue of subcontractors.  These people entered into contracts in good faith to provide building services for State sponsored buildings.<\/p><p>They have been left high and dry on more than one occasion.  Indeed, the provision of the school in Kilfinane, County Limerick, has been delayed before.  The people have had a previous false dawn.  The stimulus package that was recently announced by the State allows for up to 80,000 new school places to be provided.  I know from reading the Official Report that this is not the first time the House has considered the issue of subcontractors being left high and dry after working on schools or other public facilities like council houses and State buildings.  I am aware that the Construction Contracts Bill 2010 is about to be considered on Committee Stage.  I suggest that the Department of Education and Skills could set out provisions to be applied during the tendering process.  For example, it would be simple to require a bank account to be opened for the sole purpose of the project at hand.  That would enable us to ensure that cheques and moneys from the Department of Education and Skills or the school's board of management - it depends on whether it is a devolved grant - are lodged into the bank account of the project in question.  The only invoices that should be drawn on that bank account are those relating to the project.  The problem at the moment is that contractors are getting paid by the State for work being done by subcontractors.  The contractors are using that money to pay for other work that has already been done and that other people are waiting to be paid for.<\/p><p> There are no winners in this instance.  The subcontractors did not want to do what they had to do.  The parents did not want to do what they had to do.  At the end of the day, there is a community in the middle of this.  When due diligence is being attached to the awarding of these contracts by the Department of Education and Skills or by local boards of management, there needs to be a greater level of input from quantity surveyors to ensure the race to the bottom, whereby a contractor submits a price which we know in our hearts and souls is below the cost at which the project can be delivered, is not successful.  It is also hugely important for consideration to be given to anecdotal evidence of the history of these companies.  I am familiar with cases - for example, in the south east of the country - in which contractors have left subcontractors high and dry and local authorities are making retention payments in the full knowledge that the subcontractors have not been paid.  The State has an obligation to intervene in such cases.  I appreciate that the Construction Contracts Bill 2010 is ready to be debated on Committee Stage.  There are things we can do in the short term to ensure subcontractors and, ultimately, school communities are protected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700028#BB03800","speaker":"1058","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354038600,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I am responding to the Deputy on behalf of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Quinn.  I will convey the suggestions made by the Deputy to the Minister.  The Deputy will be aware of the context in which decisions on meeting the accommodation needs of schools must be considered over the coming years.  Total enrolment is expected to grow by approximately 70,000 students between now and 2018.  This equates to more than 45,000 students at primary level and 25,000 students at post-primary level.  Second level enrolment is expected to continue to increase until at least 2024.  The five-year programme that was announced last spring by the Minister, Deputy Quinn, will provide more than 100,000 permanent school places, of which over 80,000 will be new school places.  The rest of the places will be provided by means of the replacement of temporary or unsatisfactory accommodation.<\/p><p>  Although the Department of Education and Skills is the primary funding agency, it is generally not the contracting authority on school building projects and therefore has no legal authority to intervene in legally binding contracts involving third parties.  A school building project is a complex arrangement of contractual relationships between the client, the main contractor, specialist subcontractors, domestic subcontractors, suppliers of materials and suppliers of plant etc.  In general, all subcontractors employed on school building projects are employed directly by the main contractor or indirectly by the main contractor through other subcontractors.  It is a matter for all subcontractors to agree terms, conditions and payment schedules with main contractors as their direct employers.  As contracting authorities such as schools and VECs have no control over the subcontracts entered into by main contractors, they hold no information relating to those subcontracts.  As such, no responsibility or power rests with them to resolve contractual issues relating to those subcontractors.<\/p><p>  With regard to the recent cases highlighted in the media, the Minister for Education and Skills is satisfied that all moneys due to be paid under the terms of the main contract on each project have been paid to the main contractor.  If an allegation of non-compliance with pay and conditions of employment arises, the allegation should be reported to the appropriate statutory dispute investigation and resolution mechanisms provided by the State.  The main statutory agency charged with this function is the National Employment Rights Authority, which has the remit, resources, experience and statutory powers to investigate and resolve these matters in the most efficient and impartial manner.  If serious breaches are alleged, it is possible to refer the matter directly to the Labour Court.<\/p><p>  The main aim of the Construction Contracts Bill 2010 is to address the issue of non-payment to construction sector contractors, subcontractors and subcontractors of subcontractors who have completed work to the required standard on construction projects.  As currently drafted, the Bill seeks to address these issues by providing statutory arrangements for payments under construction contracts, including interim payments, thereby reducing a payee's exposure to non-payment.  It also proposes to introduce a new mechanism for the swift resolution of payment disputes through a process of adjudication.  I assure the Deputy and the House that departmental officials will continue to liaise with the school authorities and are monitoring progress on these projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700029#CC00200","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1354038600,"counter":519,"content":"<p>The Minister of State said in her reply that \"the Minister for Education and Skills is satisfied that all moneys due to be paid under the terms of the main contract on each project have been paid to the main contractor\".  I suppose that is the problem.  I think the Department of Education and Skills should be required to retain the final payment until it has sought and received certification from the subcontractors that they are happy for that payment to be made to the main contractor.  This could be done very easily.  I do not think the final 30% or 40% of contract moneys should be paid to the main contractor until all of the subcontractors have signed off on it in this way.  I do not doubt that the Department is committed to this approach.  If the problem in Kilfinane is replicated all over the country, there will be no winners.  This is a particular problem for children and teachers.<\/p><p>  I accept the Minister of State's assertion that the Department &quot;has no legal authority to intervene in legally binding contracts&quot;.  However, I remind the House that the Department has a role in the formulation of those contracts.  As I have said, the race to the bottom means that the Department is not prepared to consider the previous history of these companies.  There are characters in the wild west that I would not compare to some of those involved in these companies.  The people in question have no interest in providing a decent level of service.  They are trying to undermine everybody else as part of the race to the bottom.<\/p><p>  I urge the Government to introduce a system whereby 20% or 30% of the final payment is retained pending a certification process to be invoked by the Department.  The last tranche of finance should not be paid until the Department is satisfied that genuine subcontractors - plumbers and electricians, etc. - have been paid.  In his initial statement, the Minister said that these school projects would stimulate local economies.  The local economy in south and east Limerick has been left absolutely devastated by this difficulty, which is being dragged into the public arena for a second time.  The Minister of State knows the areas in question.  I am sure she knows some of the people concerned.  Neither the subcontractors nor the parents wanted to do what they had to do.  In the middle of the whole thing is a contractor who has just walked off.  The whole thing stinks to high heavens.  We need to make sure it does not happen again.  As a way of going forward, I have suggested that we provide for a process of certification, with a suitable amount being retained.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700029#CC00300","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speech","time":1354038600,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I am familiar with the situation in Kilfinane.

I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to deal with it.  She will be aware that I raised this issue at an Oireachtas joint committee meeting some weeks ago.  I mentioned that people in local authority houses have just a few weeks left to submit applications under the tenant purchase scheme.  The Minister of State should give those people more time to buy out their houses.  The 1995 tenant purchase scheme has enabled 10,000 families to purchase their own houses over the past ten years.<\/p><p>I understand the number has fallen but people are still very interested in this scheme.<\/p><p> It is important to point out there was up to a 30% discount under the 1995 scheme and up to a 45% discount under the 2011 scheme, which had certain attractions.  A new scheme will be introduced in the new year but it will contain changes in that it will not refer to the length of tenure in houses, as in the current system, but rather the discounts will relate to family income.  That is a little vague and perhaps the Minister of State will provide more information.<\/p><p> The Minister of State will need to bring in new legislation next year if these changes are to come about.  There is talk of an incremental purchase scheme which will incentivise families to remain in the community following the purchase, and I make the point that this is equally true of the present scheme.  The Minister of State is to extend the terms of the new scheme to all housing authority stock.  Will she consider extending the terms to, for example, the voluntary housing sector, given many in that sector have applied to purchase houses although that is not available at present?  Perhaps a new scheme will be considered in this area.  I hope the Minister of State will address these issues, namely, the extension of the present scheme and when the legislation will be introduced.<\/p><p> It now appears tenants should apply both under the current scheme and also when the incremental purchase scheme is announced and published in legislation.  What is very clear is that information should be made available to those who want to avail of this opportunity.  If the date is not being extended, people will want to know they now have only one month to apply under the old scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700029#CC00600","speaker":"1040","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354039200,"counter":524,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Kitt for raising this important issue, in which he has previously expressed an interest in the committee.  I want to set out the Government's position.  The 1995 tenant purchase scheme, as it is commonly known, has been a major success, enabling more than 32,000 local authority tenants to purchase their homes.  However, take-up on the scheme has dwindled in recent years and there were only 195 purchases across all housing authorities in 2010.  The time is right to look at other tenant purchase options.<\/p><p>  In this context, in June 2010 my Department requested housing authorities to notify all eligible tenants of the decision to wind down the 1995 scheme over two years and replace it with a new tenant purchase scheme along incremental purchase lines.  I decided in June of this year to extend the closing date for applying to purchase under the scheme and I have recently signed regulations prescribing 31 December 2012 as the last day for applying to purchase and 31 December 2013 as the last day for selling houses under the scheme.  That gives one year in which the applications can be processed.  By the closing date, tenants will have had two and a half years to decide whether they wish to apply to purchase under the existing scheme or to await the new replacement scheme.<\/p><p>  The Government is committed to retaining an option for local authority tenants, who are in a position to do so, to purchase their homes.  My Department is currently developing the heads of a housing Bill which will provide, among other things, for a new purchase scheme for tenants of existing local authority houses.  I intend to seek Government approval for the drafting of the Bill as soon as possible so enactment can proceed without delay.<\/p><p>  The new scheme will be based on the incremental purchase model, involving sales price discounts for tenants related to household income, and a corresponding local authority charge on the property that will dwindle away over a period unless the house is resold or the tenant purchaser fails to comply with certain conditions of the sale.  These provisions are in line with the terms of two tenant purchase schemes introduced in recent years, one for designated new local authority houses and one for local authority tenants of apartments.  I look forward to introducing the new scheme as quickly as possible after the existing scheme ends in December 2013.<\/p><p>  We have signalled for quite some time that the scheme is coming to an end.  People have until the end of the year to apply but there is then a full year for processing, which gives a significant amount of time.  In addition, as Deputy Kitt suggested, we will be bringing forward legislation next year in regard to a new scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700030#DD00200","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1354039200,"counter":525,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact legislation is to be introduced.

In the past loans were available from local authorities but they are now very difficult to access in regard to the purchase of houses.

I appealed to him to have another look at the submission made by the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association, RDFRA, back in 2010 and the innovative proposals within that before a final decision would be made.  I am outraged to learn the representatives of the Reserve Defence Force were given just hours to prepare a response to this 110 page document, although they had been assured they would have at least a week to make a response.  As a result, they have not endorsed the report or the recommendations.<\/p><p>  What is to happen?  Essentially, the Government is going to halve the budget for the Reserve Defence Force and halve the numbers within it.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, knows, rural parishes throughout the State will lose their outposts, which are being centralised to a number of locations and main camps.  There has been an awful lot of pride in these organisations over the years.<\/p><p>They are the umbilical link between the Permanent Defence Force and the communities they represent.  It is not just about St. Patrick's Day parades.  They are involved in fund-raising and other initiatives.  Most important, they help young people to establish a civic and patriotic connection with the country.  It is a huge tragedy that the Minister has decided to agree to a so-called value for money report that saves \u20ac11 million.<\/p><p> I will outline to the Minister of State how \u20ac11 million could be saved based on Sinn F\u00e9in's budget proposals.  The Government would save \u20ac11 million if it cut payments to political appointees to State boards by 25%, cut the salaries of Ministers to \u20ac100,000 per annum and cut the salaries of Deputies to \u20ac75,000.  The Government has a choice.  It could halve the resource of the Reserve Defence Force, take away the connection with local communities across the State, radically deplete the mostly civic and voluntary service that gives considerable value for money - despite the recommendations in the report - or it could cut the pay of political appointees, Ministers and Deputies.  It is all about choices and that is what the Minister has chosen to do.  That is a disgraceful way to treat the representatives of the Reserve Defence Force.  They were only given hours to look over the report and it was published without giving them any chance to give feedback in response to the recommendations of the report.  It was a serious mistake not to take on board their ideas in terms of the final outcome of the report.  What is the response of the Minister?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700030#DD00600","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354039800,"counter":530,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the reorganisation of the Reserve Defence Force.  That is a key element of the response to the findings and recommendations of a value for money, VFM, review of the Reserve Defence Force, which was recently completed and published.  The value for money review was undertaken by a steering committee with an independent chair.  The steering committee comprised representatives from the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The steering committee concluded that the current Reserve organisation required radical reform.  The review found that the current effective strength of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve at 4,500 personnel is less than half that of the 9,692 personnel for which the organisational structures were designed.  The Permanent Defence Force, PDF, support framework, was designed for a Reserve of 9,692 and the retention of existing numbers of full-time PDF personnel assigned to Reserve duties was both inefficient and no longer sustainable within a PDF strength ceiling of 9,500 personnel.<\/p><p>  In addition, there were significant issues with regard to the uptake of training in the Reserve over the period of the review.  In 2011 less than half of the effective strength of 4,554 participated in seven days paid and unpaid training.  The details for other years are outlined in the review.  The central recommendation from the VFM steering committee is for the retention of the Reserve with 4,000 personnel spread countrywide to be based in barracks and in 16 other locations.  That requires the consolidation of existing Reserve units throughout the country into a smaller number of full strength units.  The retention of all locations was not a viable or sustainable option.<\/p><p>  I accepted the steering committee's recommendations and directed that proposals for new organisational structures be prepared, taking account of the VFM report and the major reorganisation of the PDF.  The Chief of Staff and Secretary General submitted an agreed report which set out detailed reorganisation proposals, including unit structures and the location of Reserve units.  The Minister accepted the proposals.<\/p><p>  A new &quot;single force&quot; concept will see PDF units having Reserve components, rather than a parallel Reserve as at present.  Reserve units within barracks will be supported by their parent PDF unit and the 16 units outside of PDF installations will be supported by dedicated full-time PDF personnel.  This concept offers significant potential advantages in terms of training and development of the Reserve.  The initiative of locating Reserve officers within the Defence Forces management structure will likewise underpin the future Reserve.<\/p><p>  These steps create a viable structure while addressing the inefficiency caused by having too many widely dispersed and under-strength units.  Direct expenditure on the Reserve will reduce from \u20ac22 million in 2012 to \u20ac11 million in 2013.  The cut in the number of PDF support staff accounts for the bulk of the reduction, while the money available for training activity by the Reserve is being maintained.  In order to ensure sufficient paid training for a strength level of 4,000 personnel, gratuities will be withdrawn and the budget redirected to increase the overall number of paid training man-days.  Modest savings will accrue over time from a reduction in Reserve property but is not the key driver of the reforms.<\/p><p>  Deputy Mac Lochlainn will appreciate that the smaller number of full-sized units, outside of PDF installations, must cover the entire country.  Among other considerations, the selection of locations for these units sought to ensure continued opportunities for people throughout the country to serve in the Reserve.  These changes to the current Reserve organisation are in response to a compelling case for reform and will dovetail with the significant changes that are occurring in the PDF organisational structures.  They are intended to ensure a better Reserve and enhance overarching defence capabilities.  The service of all members of the Reserve is very much appreciated by Government and I hope that all personnel will continue to serve within the new organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700031#EE00200","speaker":"1098"},{"type":"speech","time":1354039800,"counter":531,"content":"<p>The Minister of State stated \"the service of all members of the Reserve is very much appreciated\".  That is not really the case because if he appreciated the service of all members of the Reserve Defence Force he would have adequately consulted with them and given them a chance to have a real input into the so-called value for money report and he would have provided them with a chance to examine the submissions that they made in 2010 and compare them to the findings of the report.  The so-called value for money report took 33 months to complete.  The representatives of Reserve Defence Force members were given a 90 minute presentation literally hours before the report was published.  That is no way to treat people who serve on the ground in communities.<\/p><p>  The number of cadres in the Permanent Defence Force has been reduced dramatically and members are being reallocated to various other posts as we speak.  I urge the Minister of State to examine the practical reallocation of personnel in terms of where they reside, the previous location of their base of operations and where they are asked to go.  Issues in those regards must be examined.<\/p><p>  I am a Deputy for Donegal North-East.  The Inishowen Peninsula, which has a population of 40,000, has lost its base which is being centralised.  I will focus on one geographic location.  I could give more examples but this is the area I know best.  If one limits their training capacity then young people from the north Inishowen Peninsula will not be able to participate in training opportunities during the week.  That is where one gets the statistics on the number of Reserve personnel that are unable to participate.<\/p><p>  I urge the Minister of State to re-engage with the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association and to listen to its feedback and concerns.  As we speak, the Reserve Defence Force is engaged in consultation across the State in its brigades and that will feed in centrally and will come to the attention of the Minister.  I have no doubt it will bring many issues to the attention of the Minister which he has not considered.  A grave mistake has been made in haste after such a long process in an attempt to publish the report and go for the headline figure of halving the budget.  The mistake that has been made is that disrespect has been shown to those who serve us and the organisation representing them and we must see whether we can change some of the decisions and address the concerns of members of the Reserve Defence Force.

There is a view, which I believe is sustained by the facts, that the cover up of that murder was aided and abetted by an <i>omert\u00e0<\/i>-style collusion between the most powerful forces in the State - the senior political establishment, the Judiciary, the Catholic Church, senior medical personnel and the Garda.  For that reason alone, it is imperative that the Minister accedes to the request being made by me and Deputies Phelan and McGrath that an independent commission of inquiry be established.  The Minister may well reply that the case is the subject of an ongoing investigation by the Garda cold case unit.

It is very difficult in two minutes to do justice to the degree of mismanagement and the miscarriage of justice inherent in this case, but I urge the Minister to act.

I reiterate what Deputy Creed stated.  I have examined this case for a number of years, ever since it came back into the public domain.  Our system of criminal justice is based on fundamental principles of fair procedures but such procedures are a two-way street.  There must be fair principles for both those accused and those who are the victims of crime.  In this case, the family of Fr. Molloy have been seeking justice for almost 28 years.<\/p><p>  Fr. Molloy was murdered in July 1985.  A series of events occurred, both on that day and in the time since, which are really extraordinary.  I am not one who is taken by conspiracy theories but all evidence as presented seems to suggest clearly that more than merely freak events are in question.  There was some level of collusion and cover up by very powerful influences in our society.  There was the failure of garda\u00ed on the day in question to retain vital evidence, failure to identify blood and fingerprints at the scene, and inconsistencies identified in the statements given by people to garda\u00ed after the event.  There was the declaration afterwards that the judge in the trial had been very familiar with the suspect in the case.  Garda files were stolen from the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, a fire in the coroner's office destroyed files and there was a burglary at Fr. Molloy's house two weeks before he was murdered.  There were attempts by the accused to cash in an insurance policy on Fr. Molloy's life.  There was the alleged involvement of very serious figures associated with crime in this country in the past 30 years.  All these factors present an unanswerable case for the establishment of a commission of inquiry into this event soon as possible, in order that justice for Fr. Molloy and his family may be finally achieved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700032#FF00900","speaker":"966"},{"type":"speech","time":1354040400,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman and the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise the serious and urgent matter of the murder of Fr.

The original investigation team committed errors of negligence and incompetence.  There was a failure to retain vital evidence found at the murder scene.  There was a broken watch which would have determined the time of the killing.  There was a failure to identify blood and fingerprints at the scene, and a failure to interview important witnesses.  There were glaring inconsistencies in the Garda statements at the inquest.  The judge knew the accused.

Niall Molloy left to die over five hours?  <\/p><p>  These are just a few of my concerns.

I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality who is unable to be present as a result of business in which he is involved elsewhere in the Houses.<\/p><p>  The Minister is fully aware of the concerns that have been expressed concerning the death of Fr. Niall Molloy and he sympathises greatly with the Molloy family.  I am sure Deputies will join me in expressing sympathy to other families whose loved ones were also killed and where the perpetrators have not been brought to justice.  The Minister has previously set out for this House the background to the Fr. Molloy case and the most recent developments with regard to the Garda examination of the issues raised by Fr. Molloy's family and others, particularly Ms Gemma O'Doherty who writes for the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>.  <\/p><p>  On foot of the concerns raised, the Garda Commissioner arranged for a detective superintendent to meet Ms O'Doherty, as well as members of the Molloy family.  The purpose of this was to facilitate an assessment of whether there is any evidence which was not available to the original investigation team and if further investigation is required in this case.  Shortly after his appointment, the Minister inquired into the steps being taken by An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and was advised of the position.  He has at all times emphasised the importance of all relevant matters being thoroughly examined and investigated.  The position is that this examination remains ongoing.  The Garda authorities have indicated that during the course of the examination additional information has been provided to the investigating officers and that this identifies further lines of inquiry which have had to be followed up.  The Garda Commissioner has assured the Minister that each and every one of these lines of inquiry is being or will be pursued.  The Minister also understands that the officers carrying out the examination are continuing to keep Fr. Molloy's family members updated on progress.<\/p><p>  The Minister is well aware of the many issues of concern which have been raised in the public domain in respect of the circumstances surrounding Fr. Molloy's death and the context in which some form of inquiry has been considered desirable.  However, what needs to be considered, first and foremost, at present is that the matters at the heart of the Garda examination relate to potential criminal liability and, in that context, possible charges.  The best form of justice for the Fr. Molloy's family would be for anyone who has any criminal liability in respect of his tragic death to be brought to account through facing charges.  In the Minister's view, it would be deeply inappropriate to do anything which could prejudice the possibility of that happening.  It is also of crucial importance that the Garda receive the fullest co-operation from any individual who can provide any information of relevance to the inquires being conducted.<\/p><p>  In any case where criminal behaviour is suspected, it is only through a Garda investigation, and where evidence of criminal wrongdoing is available - through the submission of a file by the Garda to the Director of Public Prosecutions - that persons can be brought fully to account before the courts.  A commission or judicial investigation or journalistic inquiries cannot do this nor can any other type of review, no matter how thorough or independent.  Whatever questions there may be about the original investigation, people should not prejudge the outcome of the current Garda examination.  In the Minister's opinion, that examination must be allowed to proceed unhindered and he has been assured by the Garda Commissioner that all relevant evidence, wherever it may lead, will be fully pursued.  The House will appreciate that, ultimately, a criminal prosecution has to be based on hard evidence, not rumour, speculation or conjecture.  The Garda examination has not been completed and, accordingly, any media or other reports of its findings are, of their nature, speculative.<\/p><p>  In making these points, I wish to make clear that the Minister's commitment to reviewing the situation when he receives a final report from the Garda Commissioner remains firmly in place.  Against that background, I hope the House can accept that we all share the desire to see justice done to the greatest extent possible in this case.  The Minister has tried to set out why, in the first instance, the best chance to achieve this lies with allowing the current Garda examination to proceed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700033#GG00100","speaker":"1098"},{"type":"speech","time":1354041000,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the reply he provided on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Shatter.

This Bill proposes the reduction by eight of the number of Members.  I do not see the point of this proposal.  A reduction in the number of Members by eight will not save a significant sum.  The offices and staff provided to Members cost the Exchequer just shy of &#8364;300,000 a year.  Contrary to much of the rhetoric, Independent Members are the least expensive at just over &#8364;240,000.  Ironically, Fianna F\u00e1il Deputies are the most expensive at in excess of &#8364;370,000 - about &#8364;130,000 more per Deputy than the Independent Members.  The reduction by eight will not save the Exchequer a significant amount of money; it will be a saving of less than &#8364;2.5 million; neither will it make the D\u00e1il more effective, which is badly needed.  One could remove 20 Deputies from the House tonight and no one would spot any difference tomorrow morning.<\/p><p>  This Bill could have been a radical initiative.  We are supposed to have a parliamentary democracy but it does not exist in any meaningful sense.  Political scientists agree that we have the most centralised Cabinet control of any democracy in the western world.  This is a damning finding.  D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann is constitutionally tasked with holding the Cabinet to account.  The Minister was formerly in opposition and he is now a member of the Cabinet.  He knows that the party leadership controls its party and controls the voting.  Therefore, the Cabinet controls Parliament, something it is not meant to do.<\/p><p>  This control is seen to act every day in this Chamber.  At Leaders' Questions the Taoiseach regularly avoids giving direct answers to questions posed by the Opposition.  This is sometimes legitimate and sometimes not.  Ministers are no better much of the time when dealing with questions.  Members of the Cabinet use obfuscation on many occasions - although I do not include the Minister, Deputy Hogan, who is present.  Private Members' business is one of the only opportunities for Members on this side to table legislation and meaningful motions.  However, we can only vote on the Government counter-motion.  The Topical Issue debate was initially welcomed.  A few months ago the State paid &#8364;2.25 billion euro to unguaranteed bondholders in AIB yet I was unable to raise this matter on the agenda of the House that week.  I imagine I was not the only Member trying to raise the matter in the House.  If I remember correctly, we had a Topical Issue debate about sheep-worrying up a mountain somewhere.<\/p><p>  Second Stage debates on legislation are much like this one where people like me make speeches to empty rooms like this one.  No Opposition amendments are allowed on Report and Final Stages because the legislation is about to be passed; the Opposition amendments have not been cleared by the Office of the Attorney General; and the D\u00e1il does not have access to similar legal expertise.<\/p><p>  Voting is arguably the most important part of a Deputy's work in that it is an expression of parliamentary democracy.  Government backbenchers and, indeed, Opposition party backbenchers, have no choice about how they vote.  The X case is on the agenda for very tragic reasons.  Proposed legislation will be debated tomorrow and I imagine every Government Deputy will vote against it, even though many of them probably agree with it.  The Taoiseach said he would not allow a free vote on this, the most sensitive and personal of issues.  He said that Fine Gael does not work that way and that he would not allow Fine Gael Deputies to vote according to their conscience on this most sensitive of issues.  However, he said that he wants everyone to have his or her say.  That is a farce and a parody of parliamentary democracy.<\/p><p>  This does not happen in other countries.  I refer to a recent report in <i>The Economist<\/i>  which stated that this year in the House of Commons, Government MPs voted against the UK Government in 40% of votes.  This is also a common occurrence in the United States Congress.<\/p><p>  It is said that the real legislative work takes place in committee.  I acknowledge I have seen bouts of co-operation break out at meetings of the finance committee and the justice committee.  However, this is not normal and the committees are not independent.  They do not hold the relevant Minister to account in any meaningful way.  I question the point of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann and its 166 Members.  Last week I asked the Minister, Deputy Howlin, if the Government would consider a referendum to remove the clause that only a Minister is permitted to table an amendment to any legislation that incurs a charge on the Exchequer.  This is a preposterous rule.  Imagine a multinational corporation instructing its senior management team to find a way out of financial trouble but that no one is allowed to suggest any solution that costs money.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, replied, in essence, that the Government would never allow Members to make suggestions that cost money because this would result in a collapse of the system in a flurry of populism and nonsense.  If the Government is not willing to accept that Members of this House could potentially act responsibly, then why have a D\u00e1il?<\/p><p>  Article 28.4.1<sup>0<\/sup> of the Constitution states: &quot;The Government shall be responsible to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.&quot;  Article 28.4.4<sup>0<\/sup> states: &quot;The Government shall prepare Estimates of the Receipts and Estimates of the Expenditure of the State for each financial year, and shall present them to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann for consideration.&quot;<\/p><p>  Members of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann do not consider the budget.  In 2006, a report gave zero out of ten for time given to the Parliament to consider Estimates and zero out of ten for data provided to the Parliament to allow it to interrogate Government proposals.  This year sees a crazy situation.  The so-called economic management council is even keeping members of the Cabinet in the dark.  There is no consideration of the budget by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, which the Constitution decrees is meant to happen.<\/p><p>What is the point, therefore, in spending so much money, \u20ac50 million, on all of us if we do not get to do what we are elected to do and that which, to be fair, we all came here to do?  The truth is that after the Chamber elects a Taoiseach and he or she appoints a Cabinet, that is pretty much it; the Cabinet runs the show for the next few years with the Departments.  For the rest of us, there is a very limited meaningful role to play.  While Members put in their time and try to become Ministers of State and, ultimately, Ministers, there is no meaningful legislative role for most of them to play, despite how good or smart they are or how much they want to serve their country.  It does not matter how hard one works.  Therefore, what is the point in reducing the number of Members of the D\u00e1il from 166 to 158?  I accept that the Minister is constitutionally constrained, but, bearing in mind the wider picture, the reduction is window-dressing.<\/p><p> Ireland has one Deputy for every 27,640 people.  In the United Kingdom there is one Member of Parliament for every 96,000 people, while in Germany there is one for every 131,000.  Why do we have four times as many Members as the United Kingdom and five times as many as Germany?<\/p><p> I appreciate that my proposal would require a referendum and that it is beyond the scope of the Bill.  I propose radically reducing the number of Members, perhaps to 100.  Perhaps we should halve the number, to 83.  This would allow for a meaningful legislative role for every Member to play.  It would force us all to think very carefully about who we send here.  A referendum would be required.  Every Member receives considerable criticism from the public for a wide variety of reasons, some justified and some not.  Let us ask the people whether they would prefer to have 100 Deputies or half the current number?  There are arguments on both sides.  I suggest a radical reduction to 100 or lower.<\/p><p> The people pay a lot of money for 166 Members of the D\u00e1il.  Despite the considerable criticism, every single Member does his or her best to represent his or her constituents, but we must ask how many legislators are actually required in a country the size of Ireland.  A total of 166 are not required.  A reduction of eight is not enough; the turkeys need to vote for Christmas.  It is time that this House examined in a very serious way how it is run.  We should ask the population the type of D\u00e1il it wants to have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700034#HH00500","speaker":"1107","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354042200,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  It is often said constituents in Ireland are over-represented and that the country is, therefore, out of line with other countries.  If, however, one examines reports by political scientists, one will realise we are fully in line with international norms.<\/p><p>  While I agree with much of what Deputy Stephen Donnelly has said on how business is done in the House, I disagree fundamentally with the suggestion there should be a significant reduction in the number of Members.  A significant reduction would mean a lack of democracy and a very elitist and exclusive Chamber.  The Chamber would be almost like a vocationally representative Chamber such as the Seanad.  It certainly would not allow for proper representation or the very strong contact Members have with their constituents and the public.  The link between individual Deputies and their constituents is a very significant strength.  It is anything but a weakness and ensures Members do not become out of touch with their constituents or constituencies.  It is a considerable strength of the proportional representation and single transferable vote system.  I fundamentally agree with and support our electoral process.<\/p><p>  The Bill arises from the census findings in 2011.  Let me outline the input of Independent Deputies Catherine Murphy and Finian McGrath whose involvement in the case Murphy and McGrath <i>v<\/i>. the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government ensured constituency reviews would take place very quickly and linked with the publication of preliminary census figures and the constituency review report arising therefrom.  The report must be submitted to the Minister within a three month period.  The process has been strengthened and this has ensured timely implementation of the Constituency Commission's recommendations.<\/p><p>  Since 1980 there have been 166 Deputies elected.  In the intervening period the population has increased significantly, from approximately 3.3 million to 4.5 million.  The Joint Committee on the Constitution, in its review, did not recommend a change to the number of Deputies elected.  It indicated that serious difficulties would arise from a reduction in the number of Members of the D\u00e1il.  It stated a reduction in the number would affect the proportionality and representative nature of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.  I agree.<\/p><p>  Political scientists internationally have examined this matter.  In general, Legislatures in small European countries have more Members of Parliament per head of population than in larger countries.  Nine countries - Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Sweden - have Members who represent between 15,0000 and 35,000 people.  There are four countries - Cyprus, Estonia, Luxembourg and Malta - in which Members represent fewer than 13,000.  If one makes a calculation using the cube route of population size, as political scientists do, one realises that people in Ireland are neither under-represented nor over-represented; one actually arrives at a figure of 166 Members.<\/p><p>  The average number of seats per constituency, or what political scientists call the average district magnitude, should be as high as possible.  There has been an average of four since 1980, but it should be higher.<\/p><p>In other words, the number of seats per constituency needs to be higher to ensure proportional representation in this House.  Political scientists have found that larger constituencies give better proportional election results.  I believe, as do many political scientists, that five, six or even seven seats per constituency would give a much more proportional result.  PR-STV has been hugely advantageous in limiting the effect of a low number of seats per constituency.  A higher number of seats results in greater proportionality, greater representation of smaller parties and Independents and better representation across the political divide.<\/p><p> I refer to the terms of reference of the Constituency Commission, apart from the one which states &quot;not less than 153 and not more than 160 seats&quot; for D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.  They include:<blockquote>&quot;The breaching of county boundaries shall be avoided as far as practicable. ... Each constituency shall be composed of contiguous areas. ... There should be regard to geographic considerations, including significant physical features.&quot;<\/blockquote>The commission's report breaches a number of these terms of reference.  County boundaries have been breached in a number of constituencies, particularly in Tipperary.  Both the county boundary and physical infrastructure terms of reference have been breached.  In the south of the county, part of Waterford county that skirts the Comeragh Mountains, which has traditionally been in Tipperary South because it is contiguous with south Tipperary and is dependent on Clonmel as its main centre of employment, social activity, health services and education, has been transferred.  That area should not have been removed from Tipperary South.  There was a more significant breach in Tipperary North, with 11,000 people being transferred to Offaly.  This area is contiguous with two of the main towns in the county, Nenagh and Roscrea.  People living 500 yards outside both towns are now in the Offaly constituency.  However, all of these people look on both towns as their centres for education, health services, employment and social activity.  It is clear that the commission, in respect of both Tipperary constituencies and a number of other constituencies, has breached its own terms of reference.  Will the Minister seriously examine the position in Tipperary and revert to two three-seater constituencies?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700035#JJ00200","speaker":"960","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354042800,"counter":556,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Healy that PR is probably one of the most progressive electoral systems in the world; it is much better than the first-past-the-post model used in other countries.  I would argue strongly that it be maintained.  The issue is what Members do when they are elected.  We are seriously lacking in two areas in trying to change the way we work.  The first is the use of the Whips, which Deputy Donnelly addressed, and the second is accountability.  There is no accountability to the electorate over the five-year electoral cycle and that is a significant issue for ordinary people.  They feel they elect Members on a particular programme or agenda but when they get into government, that all changes.  Citizens do not have the ability to recall party representatives, and this must be addressed.  In America, where the first-past-the-post system is used, accountability is easier with the use of petitions through which, once a threshold of constituents is reached, a politician can be recalled.  This is crucial to the our form of parliamentary democracy, which is not something I support.  I favour more power for local government.<\/p><p>  Deputy Donnelly referred to the tabling of amendments and Ministers having the sole right to bring in legislation that has the potential to impose a cost on the State.  I tabled an amendment to the personal insolvency legislation which provided for the introduction of the Norwegian model, which was a progressive way of dealing with insolvency.  It was ruled out of order without debate.  What are we here for if we cannot propose and debate alternatives?  The amendment was struck off the agenda and we were not allowed to speak on it.  That is a failure in our parliamentary system.<\/p><p>  Deputy Healy mentioned the boundary issue.  The boundaries were changed prior to the 2009 local elections.  Previously, the Ballyfermot ward comprised Bluebell, Inchicore, Chapelizod and Ballyfermot, while the Crumlin-Kimmage ward comprised Drimnagh, Walkinstown, Crumlin, Kimmage and Terenure up to Harold's Cross, and the south west inner city ward comprised Kilmainham, Christchurch and one side of Clanbrassil Street, including the Tenters.  These were natural boundaries, but they were changed and 4,000 out of 5,000 households in Drimnagh were unilaterally cut off and transferred to the Bluebell area.  The natural boundary for this part of Drimnagh was cut off and people were given a new area office to deal with.  The same happened in my area with the boundary for Dublin Bay South and Dublin South Central.  An unnatural line has been imposed on Parnell Road, meaning the area along one side of Clogher Road into Rutland Avenue and up Sundrive Road has been taken out and put into Dublin Bay South.  It is an unnatural alliance for the community.  I have been asked by the people in the area to strenuously point out in the House that these changes should not happen and natural boundaries should be looked at first.  These issues should be addressed, and it is a little late to debate them after the fact.<\/p><p>The deal is done.  We cannot make any amendments to this legislation, only speak to it which is another serious flaw of this Parliament.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700036#KK00200","speaker":"1032","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354043400,"counter":558,"content":"<p>I call on Deputy Olivia Mitchell who I understand is sharing time with Deputy English.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700037#LL00200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1354043400,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this short Bill.  Often it is the shortest Bills that carry the biggest punch.  This certainly carries a punch for politicians, although I suspect the public is less than interested in what we are saying on this or indeed in the constituency changes.  I welcome the Bill as far as it goes but I do not believe it goes far enough.  I welcome the fact it has been introduced in line with commitments in the programme for Government and election promises.  It follows up on other D\u00e1il reforms which have taken place such as the reduction in the pay and pensions of Members, the removal of increments, the reduction of expenses and the longer working hours as well as shorter holidays.  These appropriate reforms were needed and no one would think otherwise as we cannot ask of others what we will not do ourselves.  I refer to them because they seem to have been written out of history entirely.  As a result, they are not reported by the media and, for that reason, are not acknowledged by the public which seems to think none of these reforms has taken place.<\/p><p>  The reduction in the number of Deputies is not large but it is significant.  A referendum would have been needed to go below a total of 153.  In a broad reform that may have been desirable.  However, when people claim we are over-represented here, they are comparing us with much larger countries such as Great Britain, the United States and Germany where, of necessity, the level of representation per head of population has to be less because of the sheer numbers involved.  In a small country, a minimum number of Deputies is needed in order to be able to choose a government and reflect the diversity that exists in society, even if it is in a small country.<\/p><p>  This new dispensation will apply from the next general election and must apply before 10 March 2016.  Even if we are all alive in 2016, we know for the first time not all of us can be re-elected.  We have never gone into an election before where this was the case.  Again, I suppose this is only of interest to politicians, however.<\/p><p>  Of more interest to me is the question of the number of constituencies recommended.  A reduction has been proposed in this legislation but it is so miniscule I do not know why it is there.  Maybe it is to facilitate the reduction in Deputies.  If we want real political reform, we should be looking at a more radical approach.  I realise the Minister is constrained by legislation and a referendum would be needed to go further in reducing the number of Members.  However, as we are planning a referendum on the Seanad, why should we have this piecemeal reform?  We need to examine fundamental changes in how we implement and administer our democracy.  With all that has happened to us, no one believes the multi-seat constituency with all its wasteful competition, its pandering to local and special interests, its clientelism with its need to put short-term interests before long-term considerations has not served us well.  Just because the problems have changed, does not mean the system will serve us any better.  Real radical reform rather than deciding whether young people should have the vote at 17 should be decided at the constitutional convention.<\/p><p>  We should be examining a single-seat model with or without a list system.  An electoral system is needed that has a better chance of producing Deputies that can put the broad public national interest before local interest.  No matter how loud local or individual groups shout, no matter how worthy their causes may be for local politics, they should not be dictating national politics.  Society, as well as the economy and political landscape, have changed.  It is increasingly recognised in all areas of life that the old ways are not working and it is time to change to them.  It is also time to grasp the nettle of electoral change.  While it may be outside the scope of the Bill, with a constitutional convention and a referendum planned on the Seanad, we should be seeking a wider debate on a complete overhaul of the electoral system.<\/p><p>  After the next general election, apart from having fewer Deputies and constituencies, we will also have gender quotas for candidates.  Smaller numbers will make it more difficult for parties in their individual constituencies to comply with this aspect of the legislation.  I have said before that I do not like gender quotas as I believe they demean women.  Women levered into the D\u00e1il by virtue of a quota system and, perhaps, supplanting better candidates or individuals who get more votes in selection processes will never command the kind of respect they would get if they were elected on their merits, no matter how deserving they may be, and women tend to be more deserving in general.<\/p><p>  Countries which have successfully introduced gender quotas also have list systems.  Our approach is shoe-horning gender balance into small constituencies.  In my constituency, Dublin South, Fine Gael has three seats out of five.  If these were all men, one of the Deputies would have to stand down because otherwise we would have to run five candidates to achieve the quota which would fracture the vote.  In Mayo, Fine Gael has four seats.  As it is becoming a four-seater, I anticipate with interest how the party will achieve the 30% gender quota unless somebody is driven out of the constituency, which is probably what is planned.  In the next election we are going to see many Independent candidates running, candidates from the large political parties who failed to be selected in the normal way through party conventions.  The smaller parties will also be badly hit because they will find it extremely difficult to comply with the legislation as many of them will have to run two candidates, split their vote and lessen their chances of getting either elected.  Difficulties will arise with gender quotas in multi-seat constituencies, many only with three seats.  An unintended consequence of these gender quotas might be that it will produce a much fractured D\u00e1il which is not their intention.  While I recognise moving to a single-seat constituency or a list system cannot be effected by legislation, will the Minister examine it in the longer term in the context of the constitutional convention?<\/p><p>  I want to make a final plea for the name of Dublin South.  As well as butchering my constituency's boundaries, the name is also to be changed.  Rarely does a Dublin constituency's name have any resonance with its citizens.  Rarely does it give its citizens a sense of place or belonging.  The name of Dublin South, however, actually does mean something to people.  Outside of Dublin, citizens can easily identify with their county as a constituency but this does not happen in Dublin.  People know what one is talking about when one refers to the constituency of Waterford.  In the rare case when we actually get a sense of identity from the name of an urban constituency, it is a shame to let it go.  The new name chosen, Dublin-Rathdown, is utterly meaningless.  It does not even identify the location of the constituency.  At least the other name-changed constituency, Dublin Bay South, identifies where it is even if it does sound like a television soap opera.  Maybe in 20 years time Dublin-Rathdown will mean something to people but now no one in Dublin South wants to lose the name.  I know that since the commission was established 20 years or so ago, we have always accepted its recommendations.  While I accept the arrangement of the constituencies, I do not think there is any real necessity to slavishly follow the commission's selection of a name.<\/p><p>I am unsure whether much thought went into it but certainly it is not resonating with the people of Dublin South.  They simply do not like it and it is something they are reluctant to relinquish.  I am reluctant to table an amendment to this effect but perhaps the Minister could indicate in his reply if he would consider an amendment in his name.  I know the people of Dublin South, for as long as we have the name, would welcome it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700037#LL00300","speaker":"1026","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354044000,"counter":561,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Electoral (Amendment) (D\u00e1il Constituencies) Bill 2012.

Local government reform is being planned and an associated document has been produced.  Major changes are planned and a timescale has been set out.  Some consultation is still required but major change is under way and this represents reform of local politics.  Public sector reform is taking place as is reform of the committee system.  The way we do business in the House is being reformed and this is why I wanted to raise the matter with Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  I have been embarrassed on many occasions while sitting here during the time of previous Governments when the Order of Business would take between two and three hours while we were acting like children, shouting and roaring and voting up to ten times simply on the Order of Business or the D\u00e1il schedule for the day.  It was lunacy.  I do not blame anyone for it but the system was ridiculous and needed to be reformed.  I accept that some people may believe that the Order Business is somewhat short now and they do not get a chance to intervene, but at least it has some more order to it than before.  We can get on with the real business of the day.  The Order of Business now takes half an hour and it is not embarrassing to sit here because generally we deal with our business in a more efficient and proper way before we move on to the rest of the business of the day.  This represents proper reform.<\/p><p>  There are Friday sittings now and this change gives any Member a chance to bring forward his or her own Bill.  One need not use the time on a Tuesday or Wednesday evening but at one time that was the only opportunity one had to bring forward one's own Bill and have it debated.  Now that has changed and there is a full Friday sitting of three hours to introduce a Bill.  Not everyone turns up on that day and often the Chamber is not full but at least the opportunity is there to present one's own Bill and one's own thoughts, whether one is an Independent, a member of Sinn F\u00e9in, Fianna F\u00e1il, Fine Gael or the Labour Party.  The opportunity is there but it was not always there in the past.<\/p><p>  We have established the Fiscal Advisory Council, a major reform.  I accept it was part of the last IMF deal but it was also something Fine Gael and the Labour Party had called for well in advance of the last election and well in advance of the direction to create it.  I strongly believe that if the Fiscal Advisory Council had been in place we might not be in the budgetary position we are in now.  Everyone in the country refers to the banking crisis and the bailout and many suggest that this is what caused all our problems but it has not caused all our problems.  I have said it before and I will say it again - if we never had a banking crisis we would still have a crisis in this country in respect of the budget and the deficit because the short-term money made from housing and construction during the boom was invested in long-term decisions, but that money was not guaranteed in a long-term sense.  I have no doubt that an independent advisory council would have helped us to prevent that from happening.  This is the reason we have a deficit of \u20ac15 billion or \u20ac16 billion this year, which must be addressed in the next three or four budgets.  It is not simply because of the banking crisis.  People should understand this a little more.  It is hard to accept all the cuts and changes in our budgets and services and the extra taxes if we do not fully tease this out.  That was the big mistake of the last Government.<\/p><p>  Let us check the figures of every Department from 2001 to 2008.  Expenditure ballooned completely and utterly out of control and this is the reason we have had tough budgets in recent years and why it will continue in the years ahead.  It is not only because of the banking crisis.  D\u00e1il reform could have helped to prevent this and thankfully we are getting such reform now with some of these changes.<\/p><p>  The Minister is bringing forward other reform relating to the funding of politics.  This is badly needed to help repair the damage that has been done to our reputation as politicians.  Politics needs these changes.  The introduction of gender quotas is another positive development.  I realise there are many in the House who are unsure whether we need them or whether they will work, but they are needed as a temporary measure.  We may not need them in ten or 20 years time but they could be reviewed at any stage.  Anyway, they are needed to try to correct a wrong that exists now.  There is an imbalance here and there is no harm in bringing in quotas to try to address this in the short term and to get a fix on it.<\/p><p>  There has been a good deal of reform.  I accept that more reform is needed with regard to the way the House does its business.  I was part of the Opposition for almost ten years and some days I was pulling my hair out because of the way the House worked.  The Government has a fair say in how Parliament works but eventually we might get to a situation where the Parliament has more powers.  That is probably something we all aspire to.  I agree with the comment on tabling amendments.  It is embarrassing for Ministers.  There is a serving and a former Minister in the House at the moment.  It is embarrassing when one cannot even debate an amendment because it might result in a charge on the State.  That is crazy.  We should all put our heads together and sort that out.  It does not suit anyone.  A Minister need not accept a given amendment after the discussion but at least we should be able to discuss it.  This happens on Committee Stage but it does not suit anyone and it is something that several people have raised.  This too could be addressed as part of the reform.  Each step of reform is a step in the right direction and I congratulate the Minister on this Bill, among other things.<\/p><p>  The need for the political system to reform and renew itself for the challenges and opportunities of 21st century society has been evident to many for some time but sadly not acted upon.  The great global recession of recent years has produced a challenge to the broad political class here and abroad, among many other players, with regard to their role in what happened and their ability to act quickly and decisively to stem the crisis.<\/p><p>  Despite the failures and challenges of recent years we should remember that politics is important and it can and does work.  We cannot risk a further erosion in the standing of politics and political participation, whether from the perspective of local or national elected representatives, political volunteers or party activists, canvassers or voters.  To query the need or role of politics is to query the existence of democracy and the personal freedom it brings, a freedom that many billions in the world do not enjoy today and would gladly die for in order to bring about a better future for their children or grandchildren.<\/p><p>  I accept that democracy can be costly and time consuming and that it can lead to slower decisions, but there is no better way.  Democracy is fair and right.  It may not be the quickest system of governance but it is fair and right.  Good politics practised by well-intentioned politicians has brought many enduring achievements in the country which will last long after newspapers gather dust and Internet discussion boards go out of date.  Among these, peace in the North and increased contact between both parties on this island and between Britain and Ireland stands out.  Many former taoisigh and Ministers from many parties are to thank for nurturing that process over 30 years.  The common sense of John A. Costello and Sean Lemass in taking on board the recommendations of a young T. K. Whitaker to reform and open up our economy to Europe and the world in the bleak 1950s shows that political vision and decisions are important and that power does not always rest in the permanent Civil Service, as cynics of politics often claim.  The work of the United Nations and the European Union, institutions dreamt up and operated by politicians, has prevented a third global war for more than 60 years.  Even with many regional conflicts causing concern this is noteworthy and not often given the recognition it deserves.<\/p><p>  It is important to reflect on why politics matters in the present, past and future.  The education of politics is something we need to get to.  Electoral reform is something we tend to discuss but we need to bring the people with us.  I welcome the move to consider lowering the voting age but there are people of all ages who do not participate in politics because they do not always grasp it.  Before I became a county councillor I had no idea what politics was about or what local councillors did.  I had thought they were people who wrote in newspapers during the week, but in fact they have a very important role.  We also have a role to educate people on the system of local government, national government and European politics and government.  We need to do so at every opportunity.  We could use our libraries or post offices to get information out to people about how it all works.  If one understands the workings then one can appreciate why tough decisions are made sometimes but many people do not always grasp what is behind decision-making.  I have said as much in opposition and I say it again in government.  We have a duty to inform people how the system works and to bring them with us.<\/p><p>  I am pleased the Government is following through on its commitment in the programme for Government to bring about a new politics.  We cannot ask the public or private sectors to be leaner, meaner, more efficient and less costly but not practise what we preach.  This is not easy but change is never easy.  It will be painful for some but many of the changes brought on by the great global recession have been tough on many people and families, including many in my area.  There are people in need in all counties.<\/p><p>  The reduction of the number of Members from 166 to 158 is to be welcomed.  It represents a sensible compromise between the current system and the calls for a more radical cut in the numbers of the House.  The primary purpose of the D\u00e1il is to elect from among its Members a Taoiseach, who will proceed to form a Government from among the Members, with the option of two Senators entering Cabinet as well.<\/p><p>That is the current system under the Constitution.  Any fundamental change to the manner in which we select a Taoiseach and Cabinet would have to be addressed in the Constitution by way of a referendum of the people.  We must, therefore, work within the system we have.  It is important that any future Taoiseach, in forming a Cabinet, have as wide a choice as possible of people in terms of talent, experience, age, gender and geography.  A reduction from 166 to 158 Members, although not as radical as some would have hoped for or suggested, is a good compromise when viewed in this context and in the light of the likelihood of a referendum on the future of the Seanad.  I admit that in the past I was one of a number of people who called for a greater cut in the number of Deputies.  However, following a discussion I had a number of months ago with a wise man, whom I will not name, I now acknowledge the necessity for a critical mass in this House.  The formation of a Government and selection of Ministers and Ministers of State and an Opposition require that a particular number be elected to this House.  It may sound great to say there should be only 50, 60 or 90 Members, but without sufficient numbers, we would not be able to select the people needed to do the job.  I did not always believe that was true, but I have now come around to believing it.<\/p><p> Deputy Stephen Donnelly stated politics did not work.  However, there have been improvements, with more to follow.  People need to be more honest in their politics; there needs to be less spin and they should get down to the nitty gritty.  The committees are the best place to tease out issues, at budget and other times, with Ministers.  The Ministers who have appeared before the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation have always be open to proper discussion, leaving aside officialdom, and teasing out and often accepting amendments.  That is what we need.  In fairness, Ministers in the previous Government were also willing to take on board amendments.  I am glad we have moved on to a position where Ministers actually make decisions.  I recall when sitting on the Opposition benches hearing that owing to partnership talks, decisions on this, that or the other could not be made.  At least, now under the Government we have real reform, with Ministers making decisions and being held accountable for what they do.  That is reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700038#MM00200","speaker":"1078","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354044600,"counter":563,"content":"<p>Fianna F\u00e1il supports the Bill.  The boundary commission has been a feature of the system since before I was elected a Member of this House, which was not today or yesterday.  It is fair to say no Government of any persuasion has ever sought to interfere with the recommendations of a boundary commission, which is good.  With all due respect to all sides of the House, if politicians were to start interfering with independent reports, particularly on the drawing of constituency boundaries, we would be at the beginning of a slippery slope.<\/p><p>  Following the previous revision in 2008, a number of local representatives in my area who were members of the Minister, Deputy Hogan's, party, Fine Gael, suggested to the public press that the commission had been interfered with in some way by the then Government.  That was a gross libelling of members of the commission.  The commission has never been influenced one way or the other by a Government.  There is not a scintilla of evidence to support that assertion.  In fact, the evidence is to the contrary.  With the Acting Chairman's indulgence, I will give the House the benefit of my experience.  <\/p><p>  There have been seven or eight constituency revisions during my time as a Member of the House, all of which, bar one, were introduced by a Fianna F\u00e1il or Fianna F\u00e1il-led Government.  Only one was introduced by a Fine Gael-led Government.  They all had one thing in common, namely, they led to a reduction in the area of my core vote.  On each occasion I lost a loyal cohort of voters and had to work immeasurably harder in the remainder of the constituency to make up for that loss.  The apogee of that process came in the famous constituency revision following the 2007 general election which resulted in my constituency being reduced from a five to four seat constituency and the removal of the remaining part of my home area, an area in which I had received 4,500 first preferences in the preceding election.  That was at a time when Fianna F\u00e1il was in power and I was a member of the Cabinet.  It was not a very palatable change, but there was little I could do about it and I would not have sought to do anything about it either.  I recall being at the Cabinet table when the then Minister for the Environment announced that the constituency commission report was out.  I did not see the report until several hours after the Cabinet meeting had concluded.  The revision being proposed by the Minister in this legislation is the first since I became a Member of the House that actually benefits me in terms of my being able to represent much of my home area again.  When I first saw the report, I was so overcome by excitement and exhilaration that I thought I might vote for Fine Gael in the next general election.  Thankfully, that madness passed as quickly as it had come on me.  <\/p><p>  On the procedure to be used generally, the Minister will know that there are criteria set out in the original legislation to which the commission must adhere, including in considering county boundaries, physical features etc..  I know it is extremely difficult for a commission to adhere to these criteria based on changes in population, given the significant shifts during the past two decades.   I may be wrong but recent revisions appeared to breach rather than observe these criteria.  Perhaps the Minister or his officials might consider examining whether the basic legislation could be amended to ensure these criteria would be taken seriously.  They serve a purpose and the commission is supposed to adhere to them.<\/p><p>  The shape of constituencies is only one part of the overall constitutional jigsaw.  The reality - any objective outside observer would have to admit this - is that the Irish political system is not fit for purpose.  I recall saying this many years ago when giving an interview to a national newspaper.  It was more fit for purpose then than it is now.  I recall being called in by the then Government Chief Whip - Fianna F\u00e1il was in government at the time - and being admonished and having my knuckles wrapped for saying it.  I also recall being given the cold shoulder by some because in their view I had let down the club.  If it was true then, it is even more true now.  I could spend from now until midnight outlining the deficiencies of the system.  The fundamental fault lies in the imbalance between the Executive and the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It cannot be truthfully said both Houses of the Oireachtas are in a position to properly hold the Executive to account and that has been the case for many years.  It has probably been the case since the inception of the State.  The only time during my long career that I saw the Oireachtas have power was when a Government was on its last legs and trying to appease the Oireachtas because it had lost its majority and was struggling to buy time.  Apart from such a scenario, it is one way traffic.  I studied with some respect the Fine Gael and Labour Party election manifestos on which they fought the last general election.  Having done so, I thought a constitutional revolution was on the way.  Following the election, the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government was formed and the two parties sat down to draw up a programme for Government.  That document contains words such as &quot;radical&quot; and &quot;fundamental&quot; and phrases such as &quot;dragging the D\u00e1il into the 21st century&quot; and &quot;significant revamping&quot;.  I suppose it was written in the first flush of enthusiasm.  While I have noted a resiling from some of the manifesto commitments, to which I will return, the enthusiasm remains.<\/p><p>While I recognise that there have been some changes, if one looks at the performance to date measured against the fine words, one sees that terms like radical, fundamental and significant are inappropriate.  Deputy English and others referred to the reduction in the membership of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.  The Fine Gael manifesto was very specific and stated that 20 seats would go but only eight went.  The Minister has said that if he wanted to get rid of any more seats he would have to hold a constitutional referendum because of the 30,000 per member rule.  We have had many constitutional referenda and the Minister could have held one during the Government's honeymoon period when a proposal to the people that we reduce the number of TDs would have been passed with no difficulty.  I welcome the idea of fewer TDs and, indeed, I have seen a Private Member's Bill drawn up by Members of the Minister's own party which seeks to reduce the number of TDs to 100 and to create single-seat constituencies.  Whatever about the latter part of that proposal, I find the first part very acceptable.  While a reduction from 166 to 158 is welcome and is some form of progress, it is hardly radical or fundamental.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700039#NN00200","speaker":"1059","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354045200,"counter":565,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Dea had 14 years to make progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700040#OO00200","speaker":"1053"},{"type":"speech","time":1354045200,"counter":566,"content":"<p>I recognise that but the Government made promises and was elected on the basis of those promises.<\/p><p>  The centrepiece or jewel in the crown of the Government's proposed constitutional reforms was the abolition of the Seanad.

The Taoiseach has said that Ireland is about to take over the Presidency of the EU and the Government will not have time for this sort of referendum for the next six months and I accept that.  However, in six month's time, when Ireland finishes it's stint, two and half years will have passed from the time the Government came to office.  That is half the constitutional lifetime of the Government before we even start and I am willing to bet it will be much more - perhaps two thirds - of the actual lifetime of this Government, if one takes the average life of a Government in Ireland.

I canvassed for the recent children's referendum and was one of very few Deputies who did so.  I went out and knocked on doors because I strongly believed in it.

It seems to me that the longer it goes on, the more difficult it will be for the Government to get any referendum passed, even one which proposes to abolish the Seanad.<\/p><p>  Various commitments were also made on Oireachtas committees.  The Taoiseach, when in opposition, never ceased to talk about &quot;powerful committees&quot;, which he asserted was the mechanism through which the Executive could be held to account.  I ask the Minister, quite sincerely, where are the powerful committees?  What has changed?  The centrepiece of committee reform was to be something called the Investigations, Oversight and Petitions Committee but that, unfortunately, was stillborn because the people rejected the referendum proposal on Oireachtas powers.  That proposal was badly botched and one of the main reasons it was rejected - I know the Minister will not agree with me but he knows in his heart I am right - was because of the overbearing arrogance of some Ministers in response to the slightest criticism, particularly-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700040#OO00500","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1354045200,"counter":569,"content":"<p>Maybe it was rejected because the Deputy did not go out canvassing for it.

Where are we with these powerful committees that were supposed to solve the problem of the imbalance in power between the Executive and the Oireachtas?  We now have fewer committees than before and they are more starved of cash than ever.  In reality, nothing at all has changed.  If what has happened to the committees is a measure of the Government's commitment to address the imbalance between the Oireachtas and the Executive, then it can only be described as a breathtaking failure.<\/p><p>  We were also promised reform on parliamentary questions but again, nothing has changed.  There is a new a rule that Members can appeal to the Ceann Comhairle if they feel a Minister is not giving them the proper information but that is a charade and a fig leaf.  It has been rarely invoked and even more rarely successful.  In fact, I do not think it has been successful at all and I would love to hear of even one example of it working.  Essentially, nothing has changed in this area either.<\/p><p>  We were promised a 50% increase in sitting hours and got a 25% increase.  One might say that is half a loaf which is better than no bread but what does the 25% increase consist of?  It consists of Friday sittings, when there are no votes, no questions to Ministers and no real parliamentary activity taking place.  It is a parody and a mockery of reform.<\/p><p>  In terms of topical issues, the time has changed, admittedly.  Instead of being taken at 8.30 p.m., they are taken earlier in the day which could count as a change.  A few additional minutes have been given to topical issues, which also counts as a change, I suppose.  However, I do not see any real difference between the way topical issues are dealt with now and the old adjournment debates.  They amount to a staid, Civil Service scripted encounter between the Opposition Member and the Minister.  We had hoped, at the very least, that one valid criticism the Minister's party made of the previous Government would be addressed.  During the old adjournment debates there would be three or four adjournment matters and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government might take the first one, for example.  He would then sit there and read out the scripts in reply to the other matters raised.  Unfortunately, that practice has crept in again.  Unrelated Ministers come into the House and talk about things they patently know very little about.  I do not have to dig into the realms of parliamentary history to find an example of this.  There was an example in the House today only an hour and a half ago.  The Chief Whip, Deputy Kehoe, was dealing with topical issues and finished up dealing with a topical issue about the death of Father Niall Molloy.  He read his script and when a few questions were put to him, he went back and read part of the script again.  That is not real reform in any true sense of the word.<\/p><p>  I recall some of the lofty phrases from the Opposition benches during the previous Administration about the overuse of the guillotine.  I do not have time to read some of the comments made into the record but one would be forgiven for thinking that the use of the guillotine by the last Government was as damaging as the machine used in late nineteenth century France.  We were led to believe that the guillotine would only be used in the most extreme circumstances by the current Government, but what has happened?  Ten items of legislation have been guillotined already, including things like the Social Welfare Bill, when the basic income of hundreds of thousands of people was reduced.  That Bill was simply guillotined through the House.  I was taken in by the language and genuinely thought that the use of the guillotine would change.  Again, I am doomed to disappointment because the guillotine is now used as casually by this Government as it was by the Jacobeans in France.<\/p><p>  Other promises remain untouched, unspoken and seem to have disappeared into some sort of Bermuda triangle of lethargy.  Unvouched expenses are still a feature of this Administration.  I do not see anything on the promise of a relaxation of the rules on Cabinet confidentiality.  I do not know what happened to the famous Constitution day.  I know about Bastille Day but I do not know anything about Constitution day, which the Taoiseach was supposed to introduce.<\/p><p>  Looking at the wider picture, we are all familiar with the long-running saga of the Minister's report cards.  The Taoiseach promised faithfully that he would introduce a system of report cards for Ministers.  On &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; he stated, &quot;I am starting the report cards already&quot;.  At Christmas 2011, he promised to keep his Minister's noses to the grindstone by publishing a report on their performance.  Recently, however, his spokesman admitted that there would be no report cards.<\/p><p>That is the saga of the report cards.<\/p><p> The constitutional convention was, again, a good idea in principle but an empty vessel in reality.  Deputies on all sides have called for electoral reform but the convention will not be considering this area during the lifetime of this Government.  It is considering such monumental matters as whether the President should serve for a term of five years or seven years.  Let us be blunt, who cares?<\/p><p> The cost of ministerial cars was supposed to have been halved but I think it has doubled.  The issue of appointments to State boards is interesting because a lot of people voted for the parties currently in Government on the basis that they would make the appointment process transparent and clean.

I do not think the people will put up with that for much longer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700041#PP00700","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1354045800,"counter":578,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which will have a dramatic effect on the electoral hinterlands across Ireland.  As part of this Government's programme of political reform the Bill provides, for the first time since 1980, a reduction in the number of Members of this House.  A number of commentators have argued that it will have little impact but I believe a further reduction in the number of Deputies will have a greater impact on the western seaboard than on the east due to the population imbalance in the country.  The Bill proposes to reduce the number of Deputies from 166 to 158.  There will be 40 constituencies, of which 11 will have five seats, 16 will have four seats and 13 will have three seats.<\/p><p>  The loss of eight Deputies comes largely from the west, including counties Cavan, Mayo, Donegal and Kerry.  Population should always be the basis for determining the allocation of D\u00e1il seats but it is clear that certain constituencies will be formed from large geographic areas.  I welcome the proposal to reunite County Leitrim politically in the new Sligo-Leitrim constituency, which will comprise counties Sligo and Leitrim alongside west County Cavan and parts of south County Donegal.  County Leitrim was divided on two occasions since 2007, which were cruel blows to a county with a population of 30,000.  The divisions deprived the county of a full range of candidates as parties sought to achieve a particular result.  I found that many people in the county grew disillusioned with politics.  The people of Drumshanbo were included with County Roscommon for the 2007 election only to be moved to County Sligo in 2011.  This was unfair and anti-democratic.  The decision of the electoral commission to propose the reunification of County Leitrim has received widespread approval and results in a good day for the people of the county.<\/p><p>  The people of west County Cavan are disappointed because they are now separated from the rest of the county.  I am concerned that the distances from Bundoran to Roosky and Ballina to Ballyconnell are 90 km and 127 km, respectively, which is a huge distance to cover.  That is the downside of reduced representation in the north west and west.<\/p><p>  The terms of reference for the commission will see a reduction of 29 in the number of county council members in counties Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Roscommon and Longford.  This equates to a reduction of 25% in political representation, not counting the proposed abolition of six town councils and one borough council.  When I hear so-called experts demanding further reductions in political representation I ask them to study the impact of such reductions on parts of Ireland with relatively sparse populations.<\/p><p>  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is implementing reform in this Bill and through his proposals to reform local government.  Given that the country continues to run a current deficit of almost \u20ac1 billion per month it is incumbent on us to reduce our cost base in every sector, including this House.  Reducing the number of Deputies was a commitment in the programme for Government, with the objective of reducing the cost and size of government.  Savings of approximately \u20ac2.2 million are forecast as a result of this reduction.  It is also estimated that a further \u20ac420 million will be saved through the putting people first proposals which were recently launched by the Minister.  Much of this saving will be achieved through fewer committees and members across a broad range of political representatives.<\/p><p>  The legislative framework for the next general election will be different to that for previous elections due to the proposed reduction in the number of Deputies and the requirement in the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act 2012 that parties must ensure at least 30% of their candidates are women if they are to receive State funding.  However, with a reduced number of Deputies there may in fact be fewer women Members.  I have no doubt there will be more female candidates but the outcome remains to be seen.<\/p><p>  The Bill proposes to reduce the number of three seat constituencies to 13, the lowest in the history of the State.  It will be interesting to see the political impact of that reduction.  When the current 166 D\u00e1il seats were provided for in 1980 the population of the State was 36% smaller.  In real terms this means the number of seats is being reduced by eight.  Irish people engage more with their local representatives than in other democracies in western Europe.  This engagement allows them to discuss the national and international issues of the day and makes for better engagement between the people and the Oireachtas.  A further reduction in the number of Deputies would be detrimental to that close relationship.<\/p><p>  The Government proposes to put the future of the Seanad to the people in a referendum late next year.  If the people agree to abolish the Seanad, Leinster House will have 68 fewer politicians after the 2016 election and there will be 700 fewer councillors.  This Government's intention to introduce reform can be clearly seen in the reduction in representation.  The much maligned Minister, Deputy Hogan, is to the forefront of this process.  He is the first Minister in many years brave enough to reduce the number of politicians in Ireland.<\/p><p>Rather than continually highlighting what they see as mistakes, his detractors should acknowledge his efforts in both the central and local government area to reduce numbers and introduce real reform.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700041#PP00800","speaker":"1082","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354046400,"counter":580,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Estimates for Public Services 2012: Messages from Select Committees","time":1354046400,"counter":581,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700042#QQ00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1354046400,"counter":582,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has completed its consideration of the following Supplementary Estimates for Public Services for the year ending 31 December 2012 - Vote 32.<\/p><p>  The Select Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality has completed its consideration of the following Supplementary Estimates for Public Services for the year ending 31 December 2012 - Votes 20 and 22.<\/p><p>  The Select Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport has completed its consideration of the following Supplementary Estimates for Public Services for the year ending 31 December 2012 - Vote 31.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700042#QQ00400","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Medical Treatment (Termination of Pregnancy in Case of Risk to Life of Pregnant Woman) (No. 2) Bill 2012: Second Stage [Private Members]","time":1354046400,"counter":583,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700042#QQ00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1354046400,"counter":584,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p><p>I propose to share my time with Deputies Collins, Higgins, Healy and Flanagan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700042#QQ00600","speaker":"1015"},{"type":"speech","time":1354046400,"counter":585,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

We said in April when we introduced legislation on this issue that if the Government did not move on it, we would move on it again, a scenario we hoped would not happen.  Sadly, here we are.<\/p><p>  We had to listen earlier to the fanfare from the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, which was more or less along the lines of the following: &quot;Sure what is the rush?  We have the report now - the media had it a week ago - and we will decide what to do about it before Christmas.  We do not have to do anything before Christmas, but we will decide what to do and then we can sit around and talk about it for three days in the Joint Committee on Health and Children.&quot;  This is put forward as some sort of big concession.<\/p><p>  We must be clear on this.  This issue was on the agenda of the House for discussion this week, but was bumped to next week because of the budget.  Now the Minister tells us, framing it as a concession, that it will be addressed next year.  The Taoiseach talks about more time and the need for consensus and the need to move forward carefully.  The Minister let the word &quot;legislation&quot; slip out in an interview earlier, but he quickly corrected himself.  We know there is no certainty coming from the Government on this.  The same arguments we have been hearing over past decades are being repeated.  We hear the same arguments we heard when we moved our Bill previously: &quot;Give us more time.&quot;  This is not good enough.  The person who does not have time is Savita Halappanavar.  How many other cases must we wait for?  When we moved a version of the Bill earlier this year, this woman was not even pregnant.  Now she is dead.  Must we wait for another such case?  Almost two years ago, the Council of Europe found Ireland guilty of violating the human rights of women by failing to provide for our constitutional right to abortion where our lives were in danger, including the danger of suicide.  This was two years ago.  The response to that and to the requests of the Council of Europe for interim measures was that the Government was looking at it.  This is not good enough.<\/p><p>  The findings of the expert group are no surprise.  They are exactly as we knew they would be and as found by the other expert groups and by the Supreme Court.  In order to secure a woman's right to an abortion in these very limited circumstances, we need legislation.  That is the simple, uncomplicated fact.  Our Bill provides a basis for that legislation.  We do not say our Bill is perfect, but it is a start.  If the Government does not take this start tonight - we are all aware any legislation it plans is only in the commencement stages - the legislative process will not start until at least another four or five months from now.  That is not good enough.  The only negative opinion expressed by the expert group on legislation was that it might take a considerable period of time to bring it forward.  We have saved the House that time by providing the basis upon which to start.  That is all we propose.  Let there be no doubt about it: against the backdrop of increased austerity, the option of the boat or the plane will not be available for sick women in this country in the intervening four or five months.  If we do not begin the process of legislation tomorrow, we will be condemning women and their doctors to the same legal grey area that has been the subject of an outpouring of emotion from women and the medical profession on the airwaves over the course of the past month.<\/p><p>  How could anybody say this Bill is rushed?  For me, the saddest part of moving this Bill is that it does not even begin to deal with the majority of reasons thousands of Irish women must choose abortions every year.  It does not deal with the circumstances of pregnancies arising out of rape or incest, the decisions people must make because they are too young or too old, or many other diverse reasons.  It does not deal with the circumstances of women who have contacted all of us because their foetuses had fatal abnormalities and the State had condemned them to carry them to full term or be exported in secret with stigma and shame.<\/p><p>  It is a scandal that the House cannot move legislation to deal with this - to deal with simple medical procedures that are, in reality, a private and personal matter between women and their doctors.  The reason for this is the eighth amendment of the Constitution.  We will champion the call for the repeal of the eighth amendment, but sadly, that is not the subject of today's debate.  The first vital step we must take is to legislate for the X case.  This Bill is not simply a reintroduction of the Bill we tabled earlier this year.  We listened to what the Government said at that time and have made relevant amendments to the Bill which satisfy the concerns aired.<\/p><p>  The first thing our legislation does is to remove the validity of the Offences Against the Person Act in the area of medical treatment of women who need an abortion to save their lives.  This is a necessary provision.  Second, the Bill lays out clear criteria for doctors in assessing the risks for pregnant women so that where two doctors have an honestly held and reasonable belief that as a matter of probability there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the woman, they are legally empowered to carry out an abortion.  In the case of suicide, it would require the opinion of a consultant psychiatrist or a clinical psychologist or a combination of both of these to make that medical call.  I am aware the expert group has suggested a different combination of medical practitioners, and that is fine.  The Bill can be amended on Committee Stage to take into account the best medical decisions.  We agree with the expert group that these are medical decisions between women and their doctors.  All we can do as legislators is provide the primary basis on which that can be done.  Our Bill allows the option, after that, of a further opinion, either from a medical practitioner of her choice or via a referral from the other doctor.  It also allows for the establishment of an appeals body, the details of which would rest with the Minister for Health in order to give it validity.  That body should operate on a timely basis, coming to its decisions within one day, because we are talking about circumstances in which women's lives are in danger.<\/p><p>  As the Minister can see, by accounting for these issues we have provided a primary legislative basis which can be built upon and added to by regulation as recommended by the expert group.  This is not really that difficult.  Every other jurisdiction manages it.<\/p><p>  Section 7 of our Bill allows for a medical practitioner to object conscientiously to participating in these procedures, provided the woman's life is not jeopardised and provided the practitioner provides information and refers the woman on to somebody else who will carry out the necessary medical treatment.  Conscientious objection should not apply to a hospital or to somebody not directly involved in the medical procedure.<\/p><p>  Two other issues we address in our Bill were ones the Government highlighted earlier as being in need of change, namely the areas of consent and offences.<\/p><p>We are very satisfied with these areas this time around.  In relation to the woman consenting, the normal basis in other laws exists.  We had a problem last time around with pregnant girls under the age of 16 whose lives were in danger but whose parents did not want them to have abortions.  As a result of the Government's success with the children's rights referendum, an emergency provision now allows the State to act as guardian to a child who is threatened.  We think that overcomes the problem in our Bill the last time.  The treatment in this Bill of the final point - offences such as the harassment of people who have secured abortions or facilitated somebody else in securing an abortion - is rooted in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.<\/p><p> This legislation is quite straightforward.  It is not complicated.  It is a simple piece of primary legislation.  It can be built upon and added to by regulation.  We are appealing to the Government not to oppose it.  I am not engaging in cheap political point-scoring when I say that.  Although this Bill has my name on it, the reality is that it is a joint effort with Deputies Mick Wallace and Joan Collins.  It has the full support of the United Left Alliance.  A number of our staff were involved in drafting it.  If we all take ownership of this Bill so that it belongs to the House as a whole, we will send a signal to our colleagues in Europe, to whom the Minister will have to report next week, on what this country has done to protect the lives of women in this State.  If we move this Bill onto Committee Stage, we can assure the women and the doctors of Ireland that we take their concerns seriously, that these grey areas will not continue for another four or five months, that we have heeded their calls, that we have taken note of what happened in the tragic case in Galway and that we have expedited a situation which we religiously and studiously ignored for 20 or 30 years.  It is the Government's choice.  It is really in the Government's court to do something to salvage the reputation of this country and vindicate the rights of women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700042#QQ00800","speaker":"1015","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354047000,"counter":588,"content":"<p>I will follow on from what Deputy Clare Daly has said.  A point that has been made many times needs to be registered in the D\u00e1il.  It is an absolute disgrace that the last six Governments have failed to legislate on the X case.  This Government has not exactly been enthusiastic about introducing legislation.  I believe the establishment of the expert group was a stalling measure.  The Government's grudging acceptance of the need for action came about after a majority of the Irish people demanded action following the tragic death of a woman in Galway.  We know that Irish society has changed dramatically in the last 20 years.  Those attempting to stem the tide of a more liberal, more human, more secular and more tolerant society have to accept that we are in the 21st century.<\/p><p>  This is the fourth time that a review group has called for legislation.  As Deputy Clare Daly said, the Labour Party should take this opportunity to begin the legislative process.  Many eminent doctors have stated clearly in recent weeks that legislation is needed.  In a recent article, Dr. Peter Boylan made the point that doctors need to be able to say with confidence that they can intervene to save the life of a mother.  If the current equivocal position is retained, doctors will continue to be in a difficult position when making 50:50 calls.  Legislation is needed to protect doctors in such circumstances.<\/p><p>  The claim that there is no need for any action because our maternity hospitals are among the safest in the world for women is true to a point.  We have a very good record.  Unfortunately, the anti-abortion lobby has been using very misleading figures on this and other issues.  It persistently uses a CSO figure that underestimates by half the official maternal death rate.  The figure in the Irish maternal death inquiry, which was funded by the HSE, is much more accurate.  It is twice the size of the CSO figure.  It is closer to the British figure at that point.<\/p><p>  Anti-abortion groups have been deliberately trying to move the discussion away from the real issues by focusing on the issue of suicide and abortion.  A perinatal psychiatrist, Dr. Anthony McCarthy, said clearly on the radio yesterday that when the risk of suicide is small, it is nonetheless real and must be addressed.  The view of two eminent psychiatrists is that this is a very serious issue.  We have to remember that this issue was at the core of the X case, which involved a 14 year old girl who had been raped and made pregnant.  She was denied the right to travel to Britain for an abortion.  That right was given on the basis of suicide.  The Supreme Court, under pressure from a huge movement, took the Government of the day off the hook.  Rather than acting by introducing legislation, two Governments attempted to overturn the Supreme Court decision by means of referendum.  Both referendums were defeated when the people voted to uphold the Supreme Court decision in the X case.<\/p><p>  An anti-abortion lobby group has tried to mislead people by arguing that having an abortion contributes to mental health problems.  While this has nothing to do with the X case, I want to make an important point about it.  A key conclusion of a comprehensive review that was commissioned by the UK Academy of Medical Royal Colleges last year was that the mental health outcome for women who have an abortion is the same as the outcome for those who go on to have a baby.  When the American Psychological Association undertook a similar survey, it found no evidence that having a single abortion causes mental health problems.  Unbiased reports, as opposed to those with a clear anti-abortion stance, have found there is no evidence that women who have had abortions are at increased risk of suicide.  However, there is evidence that suicide is associated with unwanted pregnancies where abortion is not available.<\/p><p>  I am proud to be associated with this Bill.  Deputy Clare Daly has gone through it in detail.  I will not repeat what she said.  I remind Labour Party Deputies that this Bill proposes the abolition of section 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, which is one of the most draconian of the Victorian Acts.  It provides that a woman who seeks to procure or bring on a miscarriage herself can be jailed for life, and that any person who assists in the procurement of a miscarriage can be jailed for up to five years.  The same Act was repealed in India in 1971.  It is mentioned in the report of the expert group:<blockquote>The Court emphasised the legal uncertainty caused by current provisions arising from the fact that the 1861 Act had not been amended or clarified, following the adoption of Article 40.3.3\u00b0 of the Constitution... The judgment stated that the criminal provisions still in force would have a significant chilling effect on both women and doctors during the medical consultation process because of the risk for both parties of criminal conviction and imprisonment.<\/blockquote>It is important for the 1861 Act to be dealt with.<\/p><p>  As I said, Irish society has changed fundamentally in recent years.  The United Left Alliance is committed to campaigning alongside all of those who now support a position where issues relating to the health of women should not be matters for the Constitution, but matters to be discussed between women and their doctors.  The evidence of a 2010 YouGov opinion poll is that 78% of respondents - almost eight out of ten - agreed that the termination of a pregnancy should be permitted if the pregnancy is the result of sexual abuse, rape or incest and 62% of respondents - almost two thirds - agreed that the termination of a pregnancy should be permitted if there is evidence of a profound foetal abnormality.  We will be campaigning for the repeal of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution.  That is no justification for not taking immediate action at the end of this debate.  As the T\u00e1naiste has said, inaction is not an option.  By voting in favour of this Bill, the House can start the legislative process.  I hope Labour Party Deputies will support this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700043#RR00200","speaker":"1032"},{"type":"speech","time":1354047000,"counter":589,"content":"<p>The presentation of the Medical Treatment (Termination of Pregnancy in Case of Risk to Life of Pregnant Woman) (No. 2) Bill 2012 is a call to action on an issue of crucial importance to women in this State.  That action is needed to replace 20 years of inaction since the Supreme Court ruled that a pregnancy can be terminated legally when its continuation poses a threat to the life of the pregnant woman.  The report of the expert group that was established to examine the implications of the European Court of Human Rights judgment of 2010 was published today.  It should have been published when it was delivered to the Minister for Health two weeks ago.  Instead, it was cynically leaked to the media in recent days.  It is clear that the report favours legislation.  Tonight, the House is dealing with draft legislation to deal with the issue.  Those who are serious about advancing the needs of women in these circumstances should accept the legislation and move forward with it.<\/p><p>It is important that we deal with the issue now as a matter of urgency.  The courts have spoken on the matter and found that termination is lawful where a woman faces a real and substantial risk to her life.  On two occasions the public supported this view in referendums.  The court case took place in 1992.  The late Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy said at the time that the failure by the Legislature to enact the appropriate legislation was no longer just unfortunate, it was inexcusable.  Some 20 years later it is much more than inexcusable that the legislation has not been placed on the Statute Book.  There is no case for further delay.  The Oireachtas must take its responsibility seriously and legislate on the basis of the Bill before the House.<\/p><p> The Bill would provide interim legislative arrangements, as required by the Council of Europe, for a termination of pregnancy where, as a matter of probability, there was a real and substantial risk to the life of a pregnant woman and make provision for the prevention of any curtailment, hindrance or preclusion of such treatment, again where there was a probability that the life of the mother was at risk.  The legislation might need refinement, but that is something that could be done as it proceeded through the House, particularly on Committee Stage.  There is no doubt that a majority are in favour of introducing such legislation.  The Bill is in accordance with the view of the expert group, the report of which has been published today.

It is what is needed.  It is an improvement on what was brought forward in April as the advice of the Minister has been taken on board.  One would imagine, therefore, that he would vote for it.<\/p><p>  I also welcome publication of the report of the expert group.  As someone who is relatively new to the D\u00e1il, I wonder why we are the last to hear about such matters.  Why do employees of multinational media organisations get to see a report before we do?  I could also ask why the Minister does not listen to Members when they speak, but that is nothing new.  As Members elected to represent the views of the people, we should have got to see the report before anyone in the media.  I do not believe there was a leak but rather that the report was deliberately made available.  The minute there was word of a leak we should all have been contacted and sent a copy of the report.  If one were to do this, it would show respect for us, but obviously the Minister does not have respect for us because if he did, he would have sent a copy of the report to us.<\/p><p>  The atmosphere outside Leinster House last Wednesday night and the previous Wednesday night was intense.  I had never experienced anything like it previously.  It clearly said people needed the Oireachtas to act.  It was clear that they wanted us to act quickly.<\/p><p>  I will not go through the details of the Bill as that has already been done.  Its essence is to provide a framework to make sure what happened to Savita Halappanavar will not happen again.  Pregnant young women have contacted me who are scared at the prospect of going into the specific hospital in Galway to have their child.  The Minister must do something quickly to give pregnant women the confidence they need that they will be safe in our hospitals.  It is difficult to see how they can have such confidence.<\/p><p>  This is the fourth report to be produced.  How many does the Minister need?  He knows what needs to be done.  My worry is that there is something else igoing on; that there is an ideology that says we cannot go down this road because we would be seen as pro-choice or not caring about the life of the unborn.  The reality is that in an area such the one from which I come which is considered to be socially conservative people are in favour of addressing the issue.  One woman who goes to mass every day of the week \u2013 I question why she does, but I respect her for it \u2013 voted on two occasions in such a way as to make the Government legislate on the issue.  Public opinion has moved on.  In fact, it had moved on 20 years ago.  This begs the question of what the Government is afraid of in voting for the Bill which provides solutions.  It means that one would not have a situation where someone who was raped would be forced to have the child of the rapist, which is not on.  Fox News, the most extreme right-wing television news station I have ever seen, is criticising us for being too conservative.  If that is not a message that open one\u2019s eyes, that makes one wake up and listen to what people are saying, I do not know what is.<\/p><p>  At the core of the issue is the fact that there is not enough respect for women in this country.  That one would force someone who was raped to go through with having the child of the rapist proves that fact.  One would think we have moved on at this stage.  I remember my mother telling me that on the day I was born she was in agony, as many pregnant women are, and the nun who had helped to deliver me told her that she had had her little bit of fun and that it was time to take the pain.  some 40 years later I had hoped we had moved on, but the events of the past month show that, ideologically, we are still in the same place.  When I say \u201cwe\u201d, I mean many Members in this House.  The general public has moved on and the Government must wake up to this fact.  It should not have to follow the public like a weather vane.  Tony Benn put it very well - the government is meant to be a signpost to lead the people, but it has failed in that regard.  Now the people are leading the Government and I beg it to follow them.  What happened in the past four weeks was shameful, but if we were to have a repeat, I would not be a proud man come 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700044#TT00200","speaker":"1084"},{"type":"speech","time":1354047600,"counter":592,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Clare Daly for the work undertaken by her in the preparation and publication of her Private Members&#8217; Bill which is before the House.  The debate on the Bill, as Deputies have noted, coincides with the publication today of the full report of the expert group on the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of A, B and C <i>v.<\/i> Ireland.  It is unfortunate that we are debating the provisions of the Bill before Members of the House have had an opportunity to reflect on the report published today and before some Members have had an opportunity to read the full report.<\/p><p>The establishment of the group and the publication of this report fulfil an important commitment in the programme for Government.  For too long successive Governments have failed to address this issue properly.  Over a period of 30 years, since the 1983 referendum, this failure has resulted in a series of difficult court cases for our domestic courts, and also before the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights.  It is the judgment of the latter court which held this State to be in violation of the Convention on Human Rights and starkly detailed both our obligations and our failures as a State.  It is important to place where we stand at present in context, following which I intend to detail what must be done having regard to the conclusions contained in the expert group's report.  I will then address Deputy Daly's Bill and some other matters.<\/p><p> As other Deputies noted, our law in this area starts with section 58 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 which criminalises &quot;a woman...and whosoever...who unlawfully administers any poison or noxious thing, or unlawfully uses any instrument or other means to procure a miscarriage&quot;.  The issue is constitutionally addressed in the amendment to the Constitution, adopted by the people in a referendum in 1983.  The article states: &quot;The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right&quot;.  In the X case the Supreme Court prescribed that under this constitutional provision, where it is established on the balance of probability that there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother, and that such risk could only be averted by the termination of a pregnancy, such termination is lawful.  That case involved a 14 year old girl who had become pregnant as a result of rape and was suicidal.  The court deemed the threat of suicide a real and substantial risk, justifying a termination of her pregnancy.  In the referendums held in 1992 and 2002 propositions were put to the people to exclude a threat of suicide as granting a real and substantial threat to the life of a mother, permitting a termination.  It is right that we recall that both propositions were rejected.<\/p><p> No action was taken at any stage by this House to prescribe the procedure applicable for determination as to whether the continuation of a pregnancy posed a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother, nor was any legislation enacted to amend the 1861 Act to ensure its compatibility with Article 40.3.3\u00b0 of the Constitution, as interpreted by the X case, nor to update its content to take account of modern medical techniques and pharmaceutical advances.  The truth is that for three decades we have had a deeply dysfunctional and obtuse legal architecture that is badly in need of reform.  This is well articulated in the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the C case.  The applicant, C, had been treated for cancer for three years and while in remission became unintentionally pregnant.  She went for a series of follow up tests related to her illness which were contra-indicated during early pregnancy.  She could not obtain clear medical advice as to the effect of the pregnancy on her health or her life, or as to the effect of the medical treatment on the foetus.  She feared the possibility that the pregnancy might lead to a recurrence of cancer and travelled to the United Kingdom for an abortion.  In its judgment the court held that there had been a violation of Article 8 of the European Convention in respect of C.  Referring to Article 40.3.3\u00b0 of the Constitution, the court stated: &quot;While a constitutional provision of this scope is not unusual no criteria or procedures have been subsequently laid down in Irish law, whether in legislation, case or otherwise, by which that risk is to be measured or determined, leading to uncertainty as to its precise application&quot;.<\/p><p> While this constitutional provision, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the X case, qualified sections 58 and 59 of the earlier 1861 Act, those sections have never been amended and remain in force with their absolute prohibition on abortion and associated criminal offences, thereby contributing to the lack of certainty for a woman seeking a lawful abortion in Ireland.  The court continued: &quot;Against this background of substantial uncertainty the court considers it evident that the criminal provisions of the 1861 Act would constitute a significant chilling factor for both women and doctors in the medical consultation process regardless of whether or not prosecutions have in fact been pursued under that Act&quot;.<\/p><p> Both the third applicant, that is C, and any doctor ran a risk of serious criminal conviction and imprisonment in the event a decision taken in a medical consultation that the woman was entitled to an abortion in Ireland given the risk to her life was later found not to accord with Article 40.3.3\u00b0 of the Constitution.  The court found that the lack of an effective procedure in Ireland, which meant the applicant could not determine her entitlement to a lawful abortion in Ireland, caused considerable suffering and anxiety to C, who was confronted with the fear that her life was threatened by her pregnancy.  The court awarded her &#8364;15,000 in damages.<\/p><p> The conclusions of the expert group derive from the A,B,C judgment and are clear and unambiguous.  They are detailed in paragraph 47 of the report, which states: <blockquote>Arising from the judgment Ireland is under a legal obligation to put in place and implement to legislate a regulatory regime providing effective and accessible procedures whereby pregnant women can establish whether or not they are entitled to a lawful abortion in accordance with Article 40.3.3\u00b0 of the Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the X case and, by necessary implication, access to abortion services in the State.<\/blockquote>It would obviously be insufficient for the State to interpret the court's constitution as requiring only a procedure to establish entitlement to termination without also giving access to such necessary treatment.  A pregnant woman essentially now has a recognised constitutional right to have a pregnancy terminated where continuation of the pregnancy poses a real and substantial risk to her life.  This right has existed since 1983 and is the effect of Article 40.3.3\u00b0 of the Constitution, as interpreted by our Supreme Court.  What the State is obliged to do is to put in place measures to enable a woman to exercise such a right and, in the words of the expert group, &quot;regulate and monitor that right to ensure the general constitutional prohibition on abortion is maintained&quot;.<\/p><p> Any measures put in place must not act as an obstacle to any woman legitimately entitled to seek a termination doing so.  The expert group report proposes a variety of procedural options to be put in place for determining entitlement and access to a termination of pregnancy, providing for an initial determination and a review process.  It also addresses the position of the conscientious objector.  It further discusses how to implement the European Court of Human Rights judgment under the procedures chosen.  It gives the options of guidelines, regulations, legislation or a mix of legislation and regulations.  These are the proposals to be considered and discussed by Government and Members of this House.<\/p><p> It was decided by Government today that discussion on the expert group report would occur in the House next Tuesday and that further time would be made available.  The Government also decided it would make a decision on the option to be pursued to implement the judgment of the European Court before the D\u00e1il goes into recess.  It is the intention of the Government to make the necessary decisions to provide the architecture required to fulfil our human rights obligations.<\/p><p> Many of the issues to be dealt with in the report fall under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, and the Department of Health.  However, the Department of Justice and Equality also has an important role.  The context of the European Court judgment is clear that in the criminal law area legislation will be required because of what is described as a &quot;significant chilling effect&quot; of the criminal law provisions in the 1861 Act which impact on both women and doctors during the medical consultation process because of the risk to both parties of criminal conviction and imprisonment.<\/p><p> With regard to section 58 of the 1861 Act and the related provisions of section 59, the expert group states:<blockquote>The provisions are arguably unclear as to their scope and content.  It is not clear from reading the section what sort of conduct would be liable to criminal prosecution and what would not.  Nor is it clear whether the scope and content of the prohibition on abortion is coextensive with the constitutional prohibition on abortion.  It should be borne in mind that the 1861 Act predates the Constitution.  Its provisions are only in force in so far as they are consistent and in so far as they are not inconsistent with the Constitution.  The provisions fail to provided specific protection for the right to life of a woman whose life is at risk due to her pregnancy.  This has been the subject of sustained criticism by the Irish courts and was impugned in the judgment in A, B and C<i>v. <\/i>Ireland.<\/blockquote> The expert group also states it can be argued that the section does not effectively protect the right to life of the unborn.  For example, under current Irish law the life of a baby who is in the process of being delivered is not clearly protected, under legislation pertaining to the offences of murder or of abortion.  The expert group stated this lacuna should be addressed by changing the 1861 Act.  I believe it is absolutely clear that the only appropriate action to take is to repeal and replace the 1861 Act, using modern language which does not criminalise the termination of a pregnancy where its continuation poses a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother.<\/p><p> In her Bill, Deputy Daly attempts to provide a legal architecture to fulfil our human rights obligations and to give statutory expression to the judgment of the Supreme Court in the X case.  The Bill is well intended but unfortunately is substantially defective.  It fails to maintain the necessary constitutional balance and does not address in detail a number of important issues dealt with by the expert group.  While it seeks to provide protections for a woman whose life is at risk it absolves medical practitioners from any duty to consider whether the life of the foetus is also capable of being preserved.<\/p><p>This appears to be a significant flaw in the Bill, which goes to its constitutionality in that Article 43.3 requires the right to life of the foetus to be vindicated if it is possible or practicable to do so without compromising the right to life of the mother.  In seeking, understandably, to protect a medical practitioner from criminal prosecution under the 1861 Act should he or she provide medical treatment to woman where there is a real and substantial risk to her life, section 5 provides a blanket immunity to any such medical practitioner from civil liability should he or she be negligent in the provision of said medical treatment and should such negligence result in either the death or permanent incapacity of the woman involved.  That is a very serious matter which must be addressed.<\/p><p> The provisions in the Bill relating to decision-making processes as to whether a termination should occur are, unfortunately, confused and inexact.  For example, section 5(2) confers an entitlement on a woman to obtain a further opinion from the medical practitioner or practitioners of her choice but does not explain the relevance of such second opinion or what action might be taken pursuant to it.  In addition, the provisions in the Bill which deal with the establishment of an appeals body are either flawed or unclear.  In cases of medical emergency, they could represent a failure to vindicate a pregnant woman's right to life.  By simply conferring a broad power on a Minister to establish an appeals body by order and saying nothing further, this provision is also open to constitutional challenge.  Deputy Clare Daly's Bill also fails to adequately deal with the reforms necessary to sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.<\/p><p> Now that the report of the expert group has been published, we have a clear insight into the issues which need to be addressed.  There is also now a clear statement from Government that the necessary decisions will be made before the Christmas recess and that appropriate action will be taken to implement those decisions without undue delay.  The debate on Deputy Clare Daly's Bill affords Members an initial opportunity to commence discussion on the expert group's report.  In view of the fact that this report has been published and that a commitment has been given by the Government that it will do what is required to address these very important issues, I ask the Deputy to seriously consider not unnecessarily dividing the House by putting her Bill to a vote.  I also ask her to consider withdrawing the Bill and to afford to Members the further time they require to debate the expert group's report.  On the understanding that decisions will be made by Government before the Christmas recess, it is not reasonable that Deputies should be asked to vote on a Bill on a Wednesday having first received a report that was published at 3 p.m. the previous day.<\/p><p> The Government is now committed to doing what no previous Administration has done in the 30 years since Article 43.3 was incorporated into the Constitution.  The steps to be take are within the confines of that constitutional article and its interpretation by the Supreme Court.  I hope everyone in the House will be able to discuss these matters in a common sense, rational and sensitive way, both during the course of the debate on the Bill before us and when the formal debate on the expert group's report commences next week.  In addressing this issue, Members should ask themselves what they would do or what would they want to see done if it were their wife, mother, sister, granddaughter, niece or, for those Deputies who are women, themselves who were confronted with the dilemma of being informed that to maintain a pregnancy would result in a real and substantial risk to life.<\/p><p> It is the real and substantial risk to life that is the central issue here.  Regardless of whatever action the Government takes, Ireland will still have one of the most restrictive laws in Europe with regard to the termination of pregnancies.  The Government and I believe that women and medical practitioners are entitled to know where they stand and what procedures are available to address the circumstances in which a pregnancy is terminable under our constitutional code.  In debating this issue it is of crucial importance that Members do not resort to extreme language.  We should be conscious of the impact of what we say, both in the House and outside, on women who have miscarried or who have had pregnancies terminated where their lives have been at risk.<\/p><p> We should also be clear on what we are not doing.  We are not considering, in any shape or form, abortion on demand as is alleged by some outside this Chamber.  We are not even addressing - nor can we under the current constitutional provision - issues which many outside the Houses believe should be addressed.  For example, whatever decision is taken by Government, we cannot provide in this State for the termination of a pregnancy resulting from rape in the absence of the victim being suicidal.  Neither can we provide for the termination of a pregnancy where there is a foetal abnormality which will, as a certainty, result in the birth of a baby unable to survive.  I personally believe that this is an indefensible cruelty.  The expert group's report documents cases of rape victims and mothers with babies which suffered foetal abnormalities such as encephaly or Edwards syndrome going to Britain in order to effect terminations.  In the absence of constitutional change, there will continue to be a British solution to this Irish problem.  It is also the position that a pregnancy which poses a serious risk to the health, as opposed to the life, of a woman - even where such risk could result in permanent incapacity - does not provide a basis for effecting a termination in this State.<\/p><p> There is no impediment to men seeking and obtaining any required medical intervention to protect not only their lives but also their health and quality of life.  I do not merely have ministerial responsibility for justice and defence, I am also responsible for equality.  It can truly be said that the right of pregnant women to have their health protected is, under our constitutional framework, a qualified right.  This will remain the position.  This is a republic in which we proclaim the equality of all our citizens but the reality is that some citizens are more equal than others.  We should not pretend that the limited measures that must now be put in place to satisfy the terms of the judgment handed down by the European Court of Human Rights ensure true equality for all citizens of the Republic, both men and women.  They are, however, the essential measures necessary to ensure that pregnant women whose lives are at risk will have available to them the medical treatment they require and which is their right.  The Government is committed to ensuring that action will be taken in this regard.  In that context, I ask Deputy Clare Daly to give serious consideration to not putting the Bill to a vote tomorrow evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700044#TT00300","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354048800,"counter":595,"content":"<p>Like the Minister, I also thank Deputy Clare Daly and her colleagues on the work they have done and the effort they have made to ensure that focus has not been lost in respect of this issue.  I know how difficult it can be to draft legislation such as this.<\/p><p>  The Government shares the concern expressed by Deputy Daly in her Private Members' Bill to the effect that pregnant women whose life is at risk should be able to access appropriate medical care, including lawful termination of pregnancy.  As the House was informed last week, the Government is committed to ensuring that the safety of pregnant women in Ireland will be maintained and strengthened and that will be in a position to fulfil our duty of care towards them.  The Government's commitment in respect of this issue is clear and is reflected in the agreed programme for Government, which contained a commitment establishing an expert group to examine these issues and to make recommendations to Government on how this matter should be properly addressed.  The expert group's report was published today, a fact I welcome.  It can be found on the Department of Health's website and will be debated in the House next week.  I urge Members to read the findings of the expert group.  All Deputies should be afforded the opportunity to study the report in detail before being called upon to vote on any legislative proposals on the matter.  A guillotine will not be applied in respect of the D\u00e1il debate and every Member will have an opportunity to add to the discussion.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children will also hold three days of public hearings on the report in the new year, prior to the resumption of the D\u00e1il following the Christmas recess.<\/p><p>  On the day on which the expert group's report was published, I do not believe it is appropriate to be considering or voting on what is effectively an attempt to prejudge its recommendations.  As I stated last week during the debate on the Sinn F\u00e9in motion on the Supreme Court ruling in the X case, we now know that there is a solution in sight and that action will be taken.  The expert group's report, which is now at everyone's disposal, is a detailed and comprehensive document.  It provides very interesting background information on the topic of termination of pregnancy in Ireland.  It lays out, with stark clarity, the current legal provisions governing termination of pregnancy in this country and sets out four options for the implementation of the judgment handed down by the European Court of Human Rights judgment in A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Ireland case.  The report also provides a very clear analysis of the legal, constitutional, ethical, and medical issues to be considered.  Further, it lays out - in a simple and concise fashion - the advantages and disadvantages of each option available to us for the implementation of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Ireland case.  Most importantly, the report is clear, that the option of legislation - with regulations - will satisfy the requirements relating to the implementation process of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights.  In my reading of it, the report provides us with a clear roadmap for action.<\/p><p>As both the T\u00e1naiste and the Minister for Health stated in the House recently, this issue was been with us for 20 years and this is the first Government that has decided to deal with it.  Six Governments in this State have failed to act on the 1992 judgment of the Supreme Court; this Government will not be the seventh.  However, legislating for the X case is a serious and legally complex issue.  As such, every comma and full stop will be subject to intense scrutiny and may be subject to a challenge in the courts.  We all know this is very likely.  Legislation in this area requires the most careful and expert drafting, appropriately the work of the Office of the Attorney General.  While Deputy Daly's Bill is welcome in facilitating debate, it is not appropriate that it should form the legislative basis for this particularly complex issue.  Indeed, the expert group report pointed out that: &quot;Due to the nature of this legislation, the process of drafting and democratic scrutiny is likely to take a considerable period of time.&quot;  This is a sensitive issue and it is proper and right that it be given the attention it requires.  Therefore, I support the Government decision to oppose Deputy Daly's Bill.<\/p><p> The expert group report sets out a number of recommendations and weighs the advantages and disadvantages of each option.  The report's findings state that the recommendation for legislation with regulations would likely satisfy the requirements of the implementation process of the judgment in A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Ireland.  According to the report, legislation with regulations &quot;fulfils the requirements of the judgment, it provides for appropriate checks and balances between the powers of the legislature and the executive, and would be amenable to changes that might arise out of clinical practice and scientific advances&quot;.<\/p><p> The Oireachtas will have the opportunity to discuss and vote on all the relevant details of any proposed legislation in this area.  I hope the Government will be supported by the Opposition, especially by those Members who have been so clear in their desire for action on this issue.  The Government is committed to acting on this report, with a decision to be made before the Christmas recess and implemented in the new year.  However, it is clear that any proposed legislation for the X case will be a complex task.<\/p><p> The expert group report is helpful in that it discusses the various complex issues than can arise and sets out a number of measures that could be implemented to address each issue.  For example, the report states:<blockquote>The Supreme Court in the X case specifically recognised risk of suicide as a legitimate basis for permitting termination of pregnancy where the other criteria were satisfied.  This principle was upheld in two subsequent referendums on the issue.<\/blockquote>However, the report deals with and rejects the arguments often put forward that the judgment in Attorney General <i>v<\/i>. X, establishes a right to abortion at any gestational age.  Even from a cursory analysis, it is clear that the report of the expert group provides a wealth of expertise, both medical and legal, and that this considerable resource at our disposal should not be ignored.<\/p><p> Our responsibility as legislators is not simply to draft legislation, no matter how well-intended.  It is our responsibility to pass legislation which is subsequently enacted.  This will require 83 votes in favour of the legislation.  Deputy Daly introduced this Bill last April.  I spoke on the Bill at the time and I have no doubt of her good intentions.  However, only 20 Members voted in its favour.  This is a far cry from the required number of 83 votes in favour.  There is division among all groupings in this House.  Not one political party or group speaks with a unified voice on this issue.  Fianna F\u00e1il, Fine Gael, Sinn F\u00e9in and the Technical Group are all divided on this issue.  The Labour Party has been the only party with a clear and unified voice on the need to legislate on behalf of the X case.  We stand ready to legislate now.  I am confident this will not be the seventh Government to ignore the need to act on the Supreme Court ruling in the X case.  The Government has committed to have a decision before the Christmas recess.  There is a commitment to implement that decision early in the new year, following the hearings of the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  I have no doubt the report will stimulate an extremely interesting discussion in the House next week.  I trust that, following on from the events in recent weeks, we will be able to have a thoughtful and considered debate on this sensitive issue that has divided Ireland for at least three decades.  For all these reasons I believe that a vote in favour of this Bill is not appropriate at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700046#VV00200","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354049400,"counter":597,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  However, it is not helpful that the report is not available to aid us in a discussion of the broader issues raised by Deputy Daly's Bill.  I wish to express disappointment that the report was leaked extensively over the past weeks.  This is a very challenging debate.  Many individuals and parties have significant concerns of conscience and concerns on religious or ethical grounds.  We are legislators and we are obliged to legislate.  We may need to park our individual concerns to debate the broader issues.  In my view, the leaking of the report was distasteful and unnecessary.  This report was commissioned by the Government as part of the programme for Government and its recommendations were to be made public.  I do not understand why it was thought necessary to leak the report to various media outlets.  I am not sure what this achieved.  The leaking of the report did an injustice to a report which had been supported by all sides in the House.<\/p><p>  There is an obligation on legislators to deal with this very difficult issue which has been with us since 1983.  Many Governments have been blamed for failing to act on this issue.  A referendum held in 1983 inserted Article 40.3.30 in the Constitution.  One could argue that this article is the reason we are debating the issue today.  The X case referendum was held in 1992 to deal with the right to travel and the right to information but it removed the ground for lawful termination of the threat of suicide to the life of the mother.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700047#WW00200","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1354049400,"counter":598,"content":"<p>The last one was unsuccessful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700047#WW00300","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1354049400,"counter":599,"content":"<p>I do not think we need to be made aware of that fact.

The people were again consulted in 2002 and they again concurred with the view of the Supreme Court.  We have an obligation to stand up and be counted and to provide a resolution to this very difficult issue.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch is correct that many parties have varying views within their membership.  This is a matter which will need to be dealt with internally by parties.  However, when we assemble here as legislators - whether as members of Fine Gael, Fianna F\u00e1il, the Labour Party, Sinn F\u00e9in or Independents - we have a duty to the electorate.  We will at times be required to leave aside our personal views - whether pro-choice or pro-life - in an attempt to establish a mechanism that will deal conclusively with the issue of the X case, provide clarification and allow us talk about the other important issues relating to maternity services and access to proper treatments and maternity care for women.<\/p><p>  We must deal with this issue as a result of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights and the case of A, B and C <i>v<\/i> Ireland.  The expert group review has provided a number of options.  I have not read the report in detail but we will have an opportunity to speak with some authority once we have studied and digested the report and consulted our party members and other interest groups from both sides and no side.  We are being asked to divide the House again on this same Bill which was debated last April.  On the night of the publication of the report, we are being asked to debate the issue and to divide the House again.<\/p><p>We must act in the interest of giving everybody an opportunity to determine, on foot of the expert review group's recommendations, what he or she believes will satisfy the majority in the House.  Ultimately, it is the majority in this House who will decide what is required, be it legislation or regulations, in the context of the Government's interpretation of the report.  For all these reasons, the Bill is divisive at this juncture.  I am not questioning the motivation of Deputy Daly, whose views have been made well known publicly.  She has said on numerous occasions that she is pro-choice and that even the eighth amendment, inserting 40.3.3\u00b0, is restrictive.  However, we must deal with what we have.  The bottom line is that the public has spoken and insisted that Article 40.3.3\u00b0 is the basis on which we make decisions in light of the Supreme Court's interpretation in the X case.<\/p><p> Issues such as rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities elicit strong views and people argue for entitlement to termination in such cases, but the current position is that we would actually have to have a referendum to address these particular issues legislatively at a later date if we wanted to.  We must work within the current narrow focus.  The expert review group has, on foot of a cursory examination, arrived at proposals that may meet the needs of the majority in the House.  I refer to the introduction of legislation or a regulation, or both.  I am not sure exactly what the Government's interpretation will be but I am sure it will more or less make a proposal, based on the four or five recommendations, that could be backed by a majority in the House.  Otherwise, we will be debating this issue continually where a matter arises that is contentious, divisive or does not secure the backing of a majority in the House.  For all these reasons, the Bill is not timely this juncture.<\/p><p> Deputy Shatter, as Minister for Justice and Equality with access to support in analysing the Bill and as a solicitor, will have identified some of the flaws in the Bill.  It is evident that it would require considerable work on Committee Stage even if Second Stage is passed tomorrow evening.  We must wait only a few weeks for recommendations from the Government.  The recommendations will be presented to the Joint Committee on Health and Children in January and there will be an opportunity for people of all views to make presentations and submissions on the views of the expert group and judgments A, B and C.  We can then determine whether we can bring society with us.  There is no point in making in the House a decision that has no resonance.  People refer to Mr. Tony Benn's view on leadership.  We must lead but the problem is that if one leaves a divided society behind one, one is not achieving very much in the context of this very sensitive issue.<\/p><p> My party will not be supporting the Bill tonight.  We await the Government's recommendations.  As I stated publicly, including in this Chamber, we want to play a role that will bring finality regarding our obligations in respect of the A, B and C cases, having regard to the reprimand of the Grand Chamber.  Thus, there will be clarity such that women can believe their maternity services are comprehensive and safe and that their human rights will be vindicated daily.  Where there is a substantial risk to the life of a woman using maternity services, a termination is legal, but clarity is required in this respect.  It is necessary on a number of fronts, primarily because of the statement of the European Court of Human Rights.  Masters of various maternity hospitals, obstetricians and clinicians dealing with this matter daily are saying legislative and regulatory clarity is required.  They seek a definitive statute to give them confidence to work in the maternity services.<\/p><p> With regard to the inquiry into the death of Ms Savita Halappanavar, it is important that we await the outcome.  The matter was badly handled.  We raised this a long time ago.  When we heard about the issue first, we stated the inquiry should be fully independent.  There should have been significant discussions with the family, including Mr. Praveen Halappanavar and the extended family.  There is now an inquiry that does not have the confidence of the family; it does not really have the confidence of anybody.<\/p><p> I acknowledge the HSE is obligated to carry out its own clinical investigation.  Running in tandem with that could have been an independent investigation that would satisfy the needs of the family.  Despite this, there was no discussion or engagement.  The T\u00e1naiste brought in the Indian ambassador, and the Irish ambassador spoke to the Indian Government, yet no member of the Irish Government spoke to the husband of the deceased until a couple of days ago.  To say the very least, this is distasteful.  I refer to a high-profile case with a very tragic outcome giving rise to major concerns on the part of the family concerned over the fact that an independent investigation is not being carried out and that instead, an investigation is being carried out by the HSE.  I understand the concerns of the family.  We should have appointed an independent investigative team that could have carried out an investigation in tandem with the HSE.  The HSE has an obligation to ensure that whatever happened in Galway on the day in question will not happen again and it is obliged to address deficiencies.<\/p><p> This debate has done a considerable disservice to maternity services.  People highlight the issue of Savita Halappanavar but we do not know the circumstances.  However, I do know we have one of the best maternity services in the world.  It is staffed by the most eminent and qualified obstetricians, gynaecologists, midwives, nurses and support staff.  Women ought to have confidence in the safety of our maternity services and believe they provide the best quality of care for mother and child.  We must understand that individuals may use certain tragic circumstances to highlight their particular positions but doing so does not do any justice to the thousands of staff who are working week in, week out, in our maternity services and providing some of the best maternity care in the world.  It is important that the language we use to highlight issues be used in a way that is understanding of the concerns of others and what flows therefrom.<\/p><p> The Minister stated we have an obligation regarding the statement of the European Court of Human Rights regarding the A, B and C cases.  This is really why we are discussing this issue: let us be honest.  I have been a Member for a number of years and believe this matter was pushed on us.  It may not have become part of the programme the Government had the European Court of Human Rights not stated quite clearly that there ought to be clarity and that an individual's human rights were not vindicated in respect of her having clarity on whether she was entitled to terminate a pregnancy to save her life.  This is the kernel of the issue.  Nobody has acted on this issue.  Had the European Court of Human Rights not vindicated the human rights of the individual in the C case, we might not have been discussing this at all.<\/p><p>I welcome the fact that, at long last, in the context of the interpretation of the Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights decisions, this issue has been brought to the Legislature, where we can make the points and, more important, the decisions that are now required.  It is evident that we cannot muddle along anymore and we have to try to be brave in how we deal with this, although we must do so in a way that is sensitive to, and understanding of the fact, that many Members will not necessarily support some or any proposals.  My party has not discussed the report because we only received it earlier.  However, unless 83 Members are willing to support this, we can continue to debate this issue forever and a day.  We must be understanding that some Members have strong views at variance with those expressed by previous speakers and they have as much right to vote against the Government's proposals as others have to support them.  Common sense and a consensus may address this divisive issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700047#WW00400","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1354050600,"counter":602,"content":"<p>Since the tragic death of Savita Halappanavar, the issue of abortion has once again become dominant in Irish politics.  It is a double tragedy that it should take the death of a young woman to again focus minds on the requirement to protect women and to address the unresolved legal issues but the need for greater legal clarity has been there for a long time.  Disgracefully, that need has been neglected by successive Governments.<\/p><p>  This Bill seeks to provide legal clarity.  It may not be the required answer but Sinn F\u00e9in believes that it should be allowed to proceed to Committee Stage where it can be amended, as appropriate, and we will vote accordingly.   Legislation can now be addressed in light of the Report of the Expert Group on the Judgment in A, B and C v Ireland, the publication of which I welcomed earlier.  The report reminds us that, in the A, B and C <i>v<\/i>. Ireland case, the ECHR found that Ms C's right to private and family life had been violated contrary to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The court held that there was no accessible and effective procedure to enable her to establish whether she qualified for a lawful termination of pregnancy in accordance with Irish law.  That, in a nutshell, sets out the need to legislate.<\/p><p>  The report sets out options for the provision of lawful termination of pregnancy in circumstances where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother which can only be avoided by a termination of the pregnancy.  This is the core of the matter on which we have to provide as much legal certainty as possible.  From the report&#8217;s analysis of the options, it is clear that primary legislation is required and that regulations alone will not suffice.  The detail of the report will require careful scrutiny in the days ahead, for example, to assess if a combination of primary legislation and regulations would be preferable to primary legislation alone.  A first reading of the report makes clear that what is most likely required is both primary legislation and regulations.  A careful balance will have to be struck between making legislation too prescriptive and leaving too much to be dealt with by regulation.<\/p><p>  It is absolutely crucial that the Government acts speedily on the report.  As an immediate next step, the Government should allow the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage.  That is our sincerely held view.  It will then be up to the Government to determine when Committee Stage will be taken.  This can be done in consultation with all parties and any number of amendments can be brought forward to make the Bill fit for purpose.  We are willing to play our part in all of that.  We should not have to wait another six months for legislation to present and be enacted.  As an Opposition party, Sinn F\u00e9in is willing to co-operate with the Government and all parties and voices in the Oireachtas to achieve the best outcome and the stated outcome, which is the protection of women in all circumstances that can present and the provision of certainty for medical practitioners where legal certainty is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012112700049#YY00200","speaker":"969"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354050600,"counter":603,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1354050600,"counter":604,"content":"<p>The D\u00e1il adjourned at 8.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 28 November 2012.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
