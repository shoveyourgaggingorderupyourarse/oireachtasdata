He is joined today by Ms Josephine Mooney, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Deering.<\/p> <p>  I have not had an opportunity to review the minutes of the previous two meetings.  I propose we hold them over to the next meeting, when we can deal with any matters arising.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. <\/p> <p>  There are three categories of correspondence.  Category A deals with briefing material and opening statements.  Nos. 2249A, 2256A, 2257A, 2258A and 2259A are from Mr. Brendan Gleeson, Secretary General at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  These are the briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.  We will note and publish those.  <\/p> <p>  No. 2255A is from Mr. Allen Morgan and provides an opening statement for this afternoon&rsquo;s private meeting.  We will note this item and discuss whether to publish it during the course of the meeting this afternoon.<\/p> <p>  Category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers, follow-up material from previous meetings of the committee and other items for publication.<\/p><p>No. 2161B dated 10 May, which was held over from previous meetings on 13 May and 13 June, is from Mr. Paul O'Toole, chief executive officer of the higher Education Authority.  It encloses the report regarding the review of the relationship between Cork Institute of Technology and certain named companies and entities undertaken by Mazars.  We have already noted and published this item but it was held over for discussion if any member of committee would like to discuss it briefly.  I know one or two members with a particular interest in this matter are not here.  We have noted and published it but we will hold it over in case any wants to discuss it.  For anybody who is interested in the document, it has already been noted and published.  We might have a further detailed discussion about it at the next meeting.<\/p><p> No. 2201B dated 31 May 2019 is from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  This is the most substantial item of correspondence we have today.  It encloses a minute from the Minister of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform on periodic report No. 5 of the Committee of Public Accounts, which covered our meetings from September to November 2018.  The report was published by the committee in March 2019 and I welcome the prompt response, which we received at the end of May, as I said.  I will go through the comprehensive letter.  I reiterate that organisations present their accounts to the committee after they have been audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We discuss their accounts but that the public meeting of the committee is not the end of the matter.  We proceed to examine the matter in further detail, prepare a report or chapter on each meeting we have and publish the report with recommendations.  We send that to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform who prepares a formal response to our recommendations in consultation with the relevant Departments, which is then submitted to the committee.  We now have the response from the Minister.  We take these responses seriously and committee members will make a number of observations.  I will go through each of the report's recommendation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#A00300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Did we receive a copy of this in our pack last week?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#B00200","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#B00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I did not bring it with me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#B00400","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>We will put it up on the screen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#B00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#B00600","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>There is quite a bit to the report.  I have gone through the report and I do not expect the committee to go through all 20 pages in public session.  I will highlight the key points and if members would like clarification about certain matters, that can be done subsequently.  I would like to clear this today.  There are one or two points that invite follow up.<\/p> <p>  We received this 20-page document before our previous meeting.  I will explain and put it in context.  Our report included chapters on the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, the President's establishment, Teagasc, the Office of Public Works, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Higher Education Authority, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  We made recommendations in each chapter and the Minister has responded to the committee having consulted the various Departments as to whether our recommendations are accepted.  Practically all of the recommendations were accepted and only one or two were rejected.  We want to deal with those issues.<\/p> <p>  Our first recommendation dealt with NAMA.  The agency's lack of systematic and routine verification of declarations under section 172 of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 was unacceptable and we recommended that NAMA put in place a system to verify these declarations for the remainder of its operation.  This was one of the most discussed recommendations.  The Minister of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform rejects this recommendation and has set out his reasons for doing so.  We noted that we were conscious that NAMA had published its annual accounts recently and 95% of its work had been completed.  We noted it was expecting a surplus at the end of its operation in the order of &euro;4 billion and that we were making our recommendation for the remainder of NAMA's work.  The reason given by the Minister for rejecting the recommendation is that providing purchaser compliance with the section 172 agreement would necessitate a comprehensive asset search of every purchaser of NAMA secured assets and would be time-consuming.  He stated the delay could jeopardise any purchase sales and that the process would involve a comprehensive verification of purchaser confirmations and would appear to imply that NAMA does not regard purchaser's written confirmations as having much standing.  He stated the recommendation operates a presumption that many purchasers of NAMA secured assets are willfully breaking the law on this issue.  The committee will write to NAMA about that.  Before Deputy Catherine Murphy speaks about it, I will give my own view on the matter.  By asking for a verification, the committee did not at any stage suggest that NAMA-secured clients were wilfully breaking the law.  That is attributing to us an assumption that we never made.  The Chairman of NAMA was a former chairman of the Revenue Commissioners.  The Revenue has a self-assessment system in place and does spot checks now and again.  That does not mean there is a presumption that all taxpayers are wilfully breaking the law.  We were only suggesting some verification.  We never suggested that everyone was wilfully breaking the law and I reject the implication to that effect that the Minister has thrown back at this committee.<\/p> <p>  The Minister goes on to say that NAMA is taking steps on this matter, in particular to ensure that the purchaser is the same party that executed the contract for sale.  The party executing a contract for sale might not be the same party that completed the purchase agreement.  It was NAMA which spotted that.  The document also notes that NAMA expects new regulations to be in place under the European Union (Anti-Money Laundering: Beneficial Ownership of Corporate Entities) Regulations 2019 on 22 November.  A central register of beneficial ownership of companies and industrial and provident societies will be publicly available at that stage.  Even at EU level, there is acceptance of the need for some verification but that will not happen until the end of November when NAMA will be nearly finished its work.  <\/p> <p>  I want to counter any suggestion that has been attributed to this committee by NAMA that we were even remotely making a presumption that people were wilfully breaking the law.  We never made any such presumption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#B00700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>The Chairman might clarify section 172.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#B00800","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I might ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to help as he did a special report on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#B00900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Please do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#B01000","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>The issue is essentially that there is no connection between the purchaser of the loan-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#B01100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561017600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>It is a legal prohibition on NAMA, which prevents it from selling an asset back to an owner or somebody with an interest in that asset.  I pointed out, in the section 226 report, that it is very restricted legislation.  It only applies to a sale by NAMA, not by a borrower or a receiver.  It only applies to the sale of a property and not the sale of a loan.  There are definitions of connected persons or debtors for the purposes of the section.  Because NAMA sells loans rather than property, what it has tried to do is to extend that principle to loan sales and it is to be commended on that.  That means that, while there is a legal structure there and a potential that, if NAMA were selling property, there would be some infringement or criminal offence, it is not in the same league when it has applied the same approach or looked for the same declarations in relation to the sale of a loan.  It is very complicated.  Any infringement or irregularity in a declaration that was made around the sale of a loan would not, strictly, be an offence under section 172.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#B01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I do not think people fully appreciated the need for a section 172 declaration when the legislation was drafted.

The expectation was that anyone who was the original owner and transferred to NAMA would not become the beneficial owner again at a reduced price.  That is shorthand for how it was presented.  NAMA is probably being blamed for a shortfall in the legislation and in anticipating how things would play out.  The public expectation was that a person would not be able to buy back a loan at less than its face value before the discount.  That was an important assurance that was given.  The criticism may be focused on NAMA and that may be legally wrong.  At least one Garda investigation is under way and it probably relates to the circumstances outlined in a reply I received to a parliamentary question which states NAMA concluded its investigations and is satisfied that no breach occurred.  What it is stating is right from its perspective.  I have not listened to the definition, but the allegation is that a person is back in control of an asset that was substantially discounted.<\/p> <p>  Another aspect relates to SI 110\/2019 under the European Union (Anti-Money Laundering: Beneficial Ownership of Corporate Entities) Regulations 2019.  This information was also contained in the reply to my parliamentary question.  Essentially, we are told that there will be a central register of beneficial ownership information.  I do not think it will be backdated, but it will be of great importance in knowing who are the beneficial owners.  As was identified when we discussed the matter of connected persons, there is a deficiency in the law and a gap in terms of what the expectation was and knowing who is the beneficial owner.  I have no doubt that some people are back in control of their assets.  It may be that the loan was sold and that there was a second transaction.  If examples are being identified, it may be down to a flaw in the legislation.  It is very frustrating to see such practices, particularly where people can point to things that others were able to do that they were not.  That is certainly not the way the public expected the legislation to work in practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#C00400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>The Deputy is correct in that regard.  It is strange that we are almost at the end of the NAMA story and 95% of the issue has been dealt with, but this issue is only coming out now.  When the legislation was being drafted, it was decided to establish the National Asset Management Agency.  I know that the asset was the loan, but people were thinking of properties and the sale thereof when the legislation was being enacted.  The sale of loans was not as common at the time as it is today.  It is only with the passage of time that it has become more widespread.  Financial institutions around the world are no longer buying property assets from each other; rather, they are buying loans that control the assets.  That was probably not envisaged from a business perspective when the NAMA legislation was being drafted.  As these practices became more common, the legislation should, perhaps, have been amended.  We might ask NAMA to comment on this matter.  We accept what it states.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy raised the issue of the European Union (Anti-Money Laundering: Beneficial Ownership of Corporate Entities) Regulations 2019, but they will only apply to companies incorporated here; therefore, there is a limit straightaway in dealing with this issue.  It would be interesting to know how much of the disposal of NAMA's entire portfolio consisted of loan sales which were not covered by section 172 and how much consisted of the sale of assets through receivers or the owners of the assets selling and making good their loans.  Mr. McCarthy may know those details.  In other words, what percentage of NAMA's activity was loan sales by it which were not strictly covered by section 172?  Does Mr. McCarthy have that information or should we seek it directly from NAMA?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#C00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561017600,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Very little of what was disposed of was subject to section 172 because the property sales were mainly carried out by the developer or owner of the property or a receiver.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>They were not captured.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#C00700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561017600,"counter":27,"content":"<p>The loan sales were by NAMA, but loan sales are not included.

When the NAMA Bill was going through the Houses, I was in the Senate and said that this is all new territory and I would not be surprised if, as things evolved, there needed to be a NAMA No. 2 or No. 3 Bill.  There never was.  Perhaps it is my conspiratorial mind, but there is form here.  We are having this exact discussion on the oversight of the IBRC liquidation.  Given the way the legislation is written, history will record that Mr. McDonagh and Mr. Daly and the NAMA team have done an exceptional job.  It is us who did not do such a good job in providing the necessary oversight and agility in that regard.  History will also record that the overall effect of authorities in Northern Ireland extracting the building industry from the NAMA process here, notwithstanding any ongoing criminal investigations, allowed them to do deals all over the place and get back to normality an awful lot quicker than us.<\/p> <p>  Sadly, without the appropriate oversight, the only reflection mechanisms we have in this country are tribunals of inquiry and commissions of investigation.  That is a failing in NAMA, but it is not a failing of the leadership of NAMA, who, under the legislation, has done as good a job as it could.  It was envisaged that it would take 20 years and might make &euro;1 billion; it will now be done in ten to 12 years and will make a profit of &euro;4 billion.  Those are the headline figures but there are a lot of individual stories where people may have gripes about how they were dealt with; the courts will deal with those.  <\/p> <p>  There is form here, however.

There is no doubt goodwill has been shown on the part of the President, as we said at the time.<\/p> <p>  Second, in regard to the committee's recommendation that this allowance be considered under Vote 1, therefore making it subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General, did the Department think we were suggesting it just be shoved into that Vote?

The Department is coming back with the usual statement that it has been noted.  For the Department, \"note\" is just another word for a rejection, because that is what it is doing.  The Department is saying it is not accepting this, and wishing us good luck.  We need to have some amount of money that is available to the President for him or her to do with what he or she wants.  I do not have a problem with that.  It is great that there is an independent internal committee, and I have looked on the website too, but those are broad brush strokes.  I first raised this before the presidential election, and I am not saying that we necessarily want to see what every shilling was spent on, but I would be happy if the Comptroller and Auditor General did.

The next item relates to Teagasc.  The committee recommended that Teagasc ensures procurement processes are complied with, and that has been accepted in full.

However, the Department accepts what we are saying.<\/p><p>We then move on to the Office of Public Works, OPW.  We made a recommendation relating to the new headquarters for the Department of Health, the Miesian Plaza, that there be more engagement and consultation with the staff of any public body.  We felt adequate consultation between the OPW and the Department of Health did not occur in this case.  That is fully accepted and the Minister has informed us that the OPW intends to pilot a changed management consultancy approach for single, large-scale relocation programmes, which will improve the lines of communication.  That is good.Recommendation 8 also deals with the Miesian Plaza and the fact that there was an overpayment of &euro;10 million due to the measurements used in the project.

The OPW further states that, as part of the sanction process, the technical aspects of their cost effectiveness analyses were reviewed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform prior to sanction being given.  On the issue of leasing properties versus purchasing them, the OPW has carried out detailed assessments of two recent major projects.  That matter is being examined and it has started looking at the long-term benefits of buying or building versus leasing.

We had a discussion on the new single public service pension scheme.  We were critical of the fact that the Department had not carried out its work before the legislation was passed, and it has accepted that completely.  The Department says that, due to other pressures, it did not have the resources available to support the implementation of the legislation.  That is dreadful.  It goes on to say that the Department undertook a comprehensive analysis of the public service bodies to be included in the legislation in 2018, which was two years after the legislation was passed.  It says it submitted a report to the Committee of Public Accounts in February 2019 and the only outstanding issue was the Dental Council of Ireland, which we dealt with last week.  The Department has given us a complete update and that matter is now closed, but is only closed because of the committee's close scrutiny of the particular issue.  The Comptroller and Auditor General had highlighted that, so at least that topic is now fully closed and being dealt with as a result of our vigilance on the matter.<\/p><p>The next item also deals with the single pension scheme.  We recommended that consideration be given to investing these pension funds in a fund similar to the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  It fully accepts this recommendation but the Department says it is a complex matter and would be a major change in approach for funding public sector pensions as contributions under the single pension public pension scheme are slightly different from the old arrangement.  The Department further states:<\/p><blockquote>Given the complexity of the matter, a substantial time and resource investment is required in order to ensure that the correct approach is arrived at. Accordingly, while this matter is progressing, it will not be concluded in the short term. The Department can update the PAC on progress, as required.<\/blockquote> <p>If somebody wants to come forward with amending legislation on how that fund is invested, that would be a matter for any Member of the House or of this committee, but not for the Committee of Public Accounts itself.  We have highlighted the issue and the matter is now being examined.<\/p><p>The next item relates to leasing, and again to the Miesian Plaza.  We were not satisfied that the balance between leasing properties and the acquisition of properties was correct and it accepts that fully.  It has commenced a review, and has conducted a detailed assessment on two major projects recently.  That recommendation is accepted by the Department, but we again have to follow its implementation.<\/p><p>The next issue refers to the credibility of the annual Estimates.  We recommended that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should work closely with Departments with a history of requesting Supplementary Estimates, in order to ensure the Estimates presented to the Oireachtas are accurate from the outset.  It notes that and hears what we are saying but does not want to accept that it presented inaccurate Estimates.  I did not expect it to accept that, though we believe it.<\/p><p>It is saying &quot;We hear what you say.&quot;  We will ask for information on what is stated about the Department of Health because the Department of Health requires the biggest Supplementary Estimates each year.  The bottom of page 9 states:<\/p><blockquote>The creation of a new oversight group chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and reform, to monitor spending and act as an early warning mechanism [in respect of the Department of Health Vote].<br \/><br \/>Monthly spending reports from Health to be submitted to the Cabinet Committee on Health each month, and<br \/><br \/>A quarterly health financial management memo to Government, to update Government on the overall health position.<\/blockquote><p>I note the Government is voicing concern over health expenditure overruns at a much earlier stage in the year than was historically the case.  I propose writing to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform asking it to give us the background to this oversight group on the health Vote - who is on it; who chairs it and what its instructions are.  I am pleased to see it is there, but this is the first I had heard of it and we now see it in print.  Let us find out more about it.<br\/><br\/>On the Estimates, we recommended &quot;that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform takes all necessary steps to ensure that the Estimates are approved by the Oireachtas before the beginning of the calendar year to which they relate&quot;.<br\/><br\/>The letter notes this recommendation and states that the Estimates for 2019 were &quot;published before the end of 2018 [on] 19 December 2018&quot;, which is fine.  That is only the first step of the process, however.  There is then the Revised Estimates process, which can include extra matters.  They were published normally in February and go on for debate.  We need to get the exact dates of when the Revised Estimates were published for the past two or three years, what the plan for next year is, and when the debate on the Revised Estimate can take place in the Oireachtas committee.  While the Estimates are published early on, there is no D&aacute;il debate on them until several months into the year when the Revised Estimates come out.  The European Union has set timetables.  We will ask for more specific details on the timetable for discussing and approving the Estimates, including the Revised Estimates by the Oireachtas.<br\/><br\/>On the Higher Education Authority we recommended &quot;that, when drafting Higher Education Authority legislation, the Department of Education and Skills ensures that the Higher Education Authority is granted sufficient powers to allow it to provide effective oversight of the third level sector&quot;.  That came as a result of the investigation into Waterford Institute of Technology.  It fully accepted the recommendation and gave two pages of detailed response, referring to a number of changes to legislation.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>Currently, a Memorandum for Government is being drafted with the aim of submitting this for approval in June 2019.  This Memorandum will seek approval for:- the updating of the Higher Education Act, 1971 and the broad policy approach being adopted,<br \/><br \/>- the inclusion of a review power for the HEA in the legislation,<br \/><br \/>- the publication of the consultation report.<\/blockquote><p>That is important.  We highlighted practical issues over what is happening with spending.  Here we find the legislation was deficient in the first place and it is now being corrected.  Quite a bit of what we are uncovering in terms of following the taxpayers' money has its problems in defective or inadequate legislation in the first place.  It is not for the Committee of Public Accounts to draft the legislation; our job is to highlight it.  It is up to the Oireachtas, any Member of the Oireachtas or the Government to act accordingly.  We have taken it as far as we can.<br\/><br\/>The next issue also relates to the HEA.  We recommended &quot;that the governing bodies of third level institutions acquire and maintain the appropriate skills&quot; etc.  It fully accepts that there should be an appropriate skills mix.  The governing bodies should identify gaps themselves.  There should be an annual self-assessment of the board.  Under the Technological Universities Act 2018, greater emphasis has been given to this issue.  This matter needs to be included in the proposed Higher Education Authority legislation.  Hopefully it will be.<br\/><br\/>We come to the Revenue Commissioners.  We had a recommendation for reducing the threshold at which they deem people to be high-wealth individuals for investigation.  They fully accept the recommendation.  We had a good outcome last week.  They wrote to us last week saying they had done it and increased the number of cases now under this as a result of reducing the threshold from &euro;50 million to &euro;20 million for high-wealth individuals to be examined by the large cases division.  There were 200 cases involved.  This has resulted in another 475 being added, which is a very big increase.  That is now being implemented and we dealt with that in correspondence last week.  That is a very good outcome.<br\/><br\/>We recommended &quot;that Revenue investigates the possibility of developing guidelines regarding out of court settlements for tax avoidance schemes in order to ensure a level of consistency in reaching such settlements in future&quot;.  We discussed this matter.  It is in our report, so people will remember what we are talking about.  The Revenue Commissioners stated that in the majority of cases, like the ones we are talking about, there were out-of-court settlements and they reached settlements of &euro;500 million in those cases.  Maybe we did not delve into the detail.  They say they have detailed compliance notes on that.  The letter states that Chapter 8 of Revenue's &quot;Code of Practice for Revenue Audit and Other Compliance Interventions&quot; deals with that.  We are pleased to see that.<br\/><br\/>On high-wealth individuals, we recommended that &quot;consideration is given to requiring High Wealth Individuals to provide Revenue with an annual statement of assets held in Ireland&quot;.  It states this would require a legislative change.  Here we are.  We highlighted a legitimate issue.  When we delve into our stuff, again the problem is that the legislation does not cover it.  It is not the Revenue's fault.  I am highlighting that if any Member wants to deal with that topic by way of legislation, he or she should feel free to do so.  It accepts the reality that it is a legislative issue that needs to be dealt with.<br\/><br\/>The next recommendation for the Revenue Commissioners dealt with the tobacco trade and the very low level of fines, which we felt were not a deterrent.  They accept the recommendation, which is good.  The response states, &quot;The imposition of these penalties in individual cases is a matter for the Courts.&quot;  Tax represents 80% of the cost of a packet of cigarettes.  The Revenue Commissioners raise &euro;1.4 billion in tax from tobacco products each year.  They estimate that 13% of all cigarettes smoked in Ireland are illegal.  Revenue estimates the loss to the taxpayer at approximately &euro;229 million per annum.  Between January and October of last year when we were doing our work, in the cases they prosecuted they followed up about &euro;23 million worth of cases, which meant that 93% of their estimate of what was illegal was not detected or followed up on.  Fines were issued for &euro;140,000, which is fairly abysmal.  They say it is up to the judges and the fines will be increased.  I feel there is not sufficient detection of the issue if there is that level of revenue loss.<br\/><br\/>The next item also related to the Revenue Commissioners.  We recommended &quot;that the Minister considers whether separate identification of trading losses forward and capital allowances can be provided for in future legislation&quot;.  Under the legislation, any business that has losses from a previous year can carry it forward against future profits to reduce its taxable profits in a future year.  Most people accept that if a company has a trading loss, that is fair enough.  Sometimes, if the losses are as a result of capital allowances relating to capital expenditure, we proposed that these be identified separately so that we can get a measure of all these losses forward.  There is a big gap in knowing how the losses forward are made up.<br\/><br\/>The Minister noted the recommendations but under the scheme of corporation tax, they do not actually do the breakdown.  The letter stated, &quot;The amount of any trading losses... is not broken down between that which relates to capital allowances and that which relates to other trading expenses&quot;.  That is exactly what we asked them to do.  The Minister for Finance looked at this issue in respect of the banks, which is relevant to all corporate entities, in a report published in 2018.  Again people might want to draft legislation on the matter; it cannot be done without legislation.

The report states that the committee recommends that an annual review take place to ensure the new controls regarding overpayments to jobseeker's under 25 are working effectively.  When they introduced that scheme, there were different rates for persons under 21, those aged 21 to 25, and those over 26.  It was difficult for the Department.  It was a new scheme and there were inconsistencies across the Department.  Officials told us at the time there was one person in each office with particular expertise who looked at all of this.  They have acknowledged the work has been carried out.  The most recent review was conducted in February 2019 and all cases reviewed were confirmed as being correct.  A further review is being planned, subject to the outcome being satisfactory and, in line with the recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts, it is proposed to schedule further reviews on an annual basis.  The Department has taken up the recommendation and worked on it.  The recent reports of cases examined means they are fully correct, so at least the recommendation is being carried through and the Department is going to keep an eye on it into the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#H00800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I completely understand that we are making sure this is being properly applied.

The six reports are glorified PowerPoint presentations, which we would have received.  There is not much in them besides a headline figure so they will not give us much detail on that, though we could review them before the private meeting.  It is good that Deputy Catherine Murphy asked about IBRC, but the response was unsatisfactory.  The Minister is obviously a very busy man and these responses are often written on Ministers' behalf by their teams.  We can understand that.  However, in his answer to Deputy Catherine Murphy, which she has shared with me, the Minister clearly sets out that we disapplied normal rules in legislation for this liquidation, which is the biggest in the history of the State.  The Minister says we can go through the six PowerPoint presentations on the website to see the headline figures.  However, we have established here that two people have effectively been put in place in lieu of a committee of inspection, and that was reaffirmed recently.  Based on my own humble experience, having voluntarily liquidated my own company with very modest turnovers and so on, it is just laughable.  The issue here is not that we are not going to get to the end of this, because we will, no matter how long it takes.   We will all celebrate and back-clap and say how well it was done, but we have highlighted that we had no benchmark position because no evaluations were done at the beginning, and so on.  Apart from that, the Government is heading for costs, by its own admission, of &euro;306 million, and we do not know if that represents good value.  The Minister cannot be satisfied, despite what he said in response to Deputy Catherine Murphy's question.  We need to stay on this and keep pushing it because long after we are gone, that reflection mechanism Deputy Connolly spoke of will be no doubt set up, there will be a commission of investigation or a tribunal of inquiry, and we could save the State a great deal of money by just doing a few little bits now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#L00200","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":206,"content":"<p>We have scheduled a private meeting specifically on this topic, which is in our work programme.

This represented a 10% increase on the spend of 1.26 billion in 2016.  The account is presented under four programmes, as indicated in the diagram provided to members.  These programmes correspond to the four key strategic objectives set out in the Department&rsquo;s statement of strategy 2016-2019.<\/p> <p>  Programme B was the largest programme.  This relates to farm and sector supports and controls, and mainly comprises payments which benefit farms and farmers.  Total expenditure charged to the programme amounted to &euro;726 million in 2017 - an increase of over &euro;100 million from the 2016 level of expenditure.<\/p> <p>  The Department provides substantial funding from the Vote each year to a number of State bodies that operate under its aegis.  These include Teagasc, An Bord Bia, the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon.<\/p> <p>  By means of a Supplementary Estimate passed in December 2017, the Department was able to reallocate unspent funds on some subheads totalling almost &euro;50 million to other expenditure subheads.  There was no overall increase in the estimate provision for the Vote through the supplementary process.<\/p> <p>  At year end, net expenditure under the Vote was &euro;24 million less than provided for.  Some &euro;23.8 million in unspent capital allocations - mainly under the farm and sector supports and controls programme - was carried over for spending in 2018.  The remainder of the surplus for the year, an amount of &euro;207,000, was liable for surrender to the Exchequer.  Note 3 provides explanations for the variances in spending and transfers of funding from the various subheads.<\/p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the appropriation account.  However, I drew attention to the Accounting Officer&rsquo;s statement on internal financial control, which discloses non-competitive procurement by the Department of nearly &euro;19 million worth of goods and services in 2017, including a significant level of procurement which was not compliant with public procurement rules.  This is a recurrent issue for the Department.<\/p> <p>  The Department directly manages the six fishery harbour centres, which are accounted for separately from the Vote.  The form of the fishery harbour centres' financial statements was devised many years ago.  Unusually, the financial statements of the fishery harbour centres are prepared on both a cash and an accruals basis.  The day-to-day operations of the centres are funded through harbour dues and charges set by law, and rents from State-owned properties.  The income and expenditure account show a surplus for 2017 of &euro;1.5 million.  In addition, annual capital grant funding from the Department is made available for the development and maintenance of harbour facilities.  Capital funding from the Department in 2017 was &euro;17.5 million.<\/p> <p>  I issued a special report in 2014 on significant ongoing deficiencies in the financial management and reporting for the fishery harbour centres, including significant delays in the timeliness of presentation of accounts.  The report included seven recommendations intended to enhance the financial management of the centres.  The statement on internal financial control discloses the progress the Department has made so far in implementing those recommendations.<\/p> <p>  As Members are aware, the Department manages significant funds provided by the EU.  Where these are applied on schemes that are co-funded by the Exchequer, the funding is reflected in the vote.  However, payments to farmers and market-related expenditure that are almost fully funded by the EU are not accounted for in the Department&rsquo;s appropriation account, even though the Department manages the payments.  Such payments amounted to just over &euro;1.2 billion for 2017.  These are accounted for to the EU in financial statements that are not subject to audit by me.  However, note 6.1 in the appropriation account provides some information about the amounts received from the EU each year.  <\/p> <p>  At the request of a previous Committee of Public Accounts, it was agreed that the Department, in co-operation with the Department of Rural and Community Affairs, would prepare an annual composite account to provide an overview of the funds flowing to agriculture, fisheries and rural communities, and that this would be examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Accordingly, the 2017 financial statements of the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund have been prepared and presented, and are before the committee today.<\/p> <p>  The financial statements present the income and expenditure of these three fund programmes in Ireland, including both EU and Exchequer financing.  They indicate that the combined income and expenditure of the funds was &euro;1.77 billion in 2017, of which &euro;1.5 billion was funded by the EU.  Of course, funds for other, non-agriculture, programmes are also received from the EU, and there are significant annual payments from Ireland to the EU.  These composite accounts before the committee today do not give a sufficiently rounded picture of the transactions with the EU, and so I recently published a special report on Ireland&rsquo;s Transactions with the EU in 2017, which gives a more comprehensive picture.  Members will recall that this was examined with the Accounting Officer of the Department of Finance.  I recommended in that report that there should be annual reporting, on a consolidated basis, of all Irish contributions to and receipts from the EU.  If the Department of Finance takes up that suggestion, the committee may wish to consider if there is a continuing need for the current composite reporting of EU funding to the agriculture and fisheries sectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561017600,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it.

The first is a non-statutory account, provided for the sake of transparency, which shows the interaction between the funding received from the European Union and the Department's Vote.<\/p><p>This funding is accounted for separately under EU rules and audited by the EU institutions.  Because the bulk of it is not matched by national funds, much of it does not appear in the  Department&rsquo;s appropriation account and therefore these financial statements provide a fuller picture of total departmental expenditure at both national and EU levels.<\/p><p> The second is the financial statements for the six fisheries harbour centres owned and operated by the Department.  I will begin with the appropriation account.  The Department&rsquo;s gross Estimate for 2017 was &euro;1.49 billion.  This included a carryover of capital savings of &euro;21.7 million from 2016.  This represented an overall increase of almost &euro;120 million over the gross voted Estimate for 2016.  The gross outturn was &euro;1.387 billion, an increase of &euro;131 million over 2016.  The Department received a technical Supplementary Estimate to further address emerging priorities by the transfer of funds within the Vote.  I will refer to this in my later remarks.  The Department also receives appropriations-in-aid.  These principally comprise EU receipts in respect of rural development and animal disease programmes.  In 2017 these receipts amounted to &euro;258.9 million, some &euro;78 million less than the Estimate of &euro;337 million, largely because EU receipts expected in December 2017 in respect of rural development schemes were not received until January 2018.<\/p><p> The Department&rsquo;s Vote is divided into four programmes, each representing a key policy priority.  Programme A relates to the food safety, animal health and welfare and plant health programmes that underpin our agrifood sector.  These include disease eradication programmes such as those relating to tuberculosis, TB, or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, TSEs, testing for residues in food products, on-farm controls, plant protection controls and other such headings.  Programme expenditure under this heading amounted to just over &euro;80 million in 2017, excluding staff and administration costs.  This is a saving of &euro;5.5 million compared to the budgeted amount.<\/p><p> Programme B covers our major farm support schemes other than basic payments, which are entirely EU-funded.  By and large, these schemes are intended to encourage sustainable agricultural practices and most of them receive co-funding from the EU under the rural development programme.  The final allocation for these schemes in 2017, following a Supplementary Estimate, came to just under &euro;806 million.  This was some &euro;182 million greater than the &euro;623 million outturn in 2016.  In 2017 almost 50,000 people participated in the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS.  More than 24,000 participated in the beef data and genomics scheme and the sheep welfare and knowledge transfer schemes were launched.  Other co-funded schemes included the areas of national constraint scheme, the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, the organics scheme, and the forestry programme, which alone among these schemes is 100% nationally funded.  The eventual outturn was for this programme was &euro;726 million.  This was more than &euro;100 million greater than the previous year but also &euro;80 million short of the available funds.  Key factors in this shortfall were the fact that participation in the new schemes for sheep welfare and knowledge transfer was lower than provided for, and an adjustment to deadlines for certain actions in the knowledge transfer scheme slowed the payment process, with some falling into 2018.  Similarly, our ambitious target for payments to a very high portion of GLAS participants within the calendar year was not achieved.  However, for the 2018 scheme year close to 90% of GLAS applicants were paid their annual advance within the calendar year.<\/p><p> On the capital side, the TAMS investment scheme saw a greatly improved drawdown compared to 2016 with &euro;33 million spent, although drawdown was lower than the provision.  To help with the  financial management of the scheme we reduced the time allowed for applicants to submit payment claims.  The experience in the past 18 months reflects good levels of investment in improved on-farm facilities.  Expenditure on the forestry programme was lower than hoped in 2017, and this remains a continuing but critically important challenge.  The capital carryover into 2018 from 2017 was largely drawn from the TAMS and forestry savings in 2017.  I should say that programme B also includes an element of national funding on EU market support schemes such as intervention.<\/p><p> Programme C, policy and strategy, includes expenditure on research and training and several food support schemes, as well as grants-in-aid to some of our State agencies.  The outturn slightly exceeded the voted allocation of &euro;338 million, due partly to several additional measures designed to help build resilience in the sector to confront the challenge of Brexit.  Those initial measures included an increase in Bord Bia's allocation by &euro;8.6 million to assist it in its marketing and promotion of Irish food overseas.  In addition, the sum of &euro;9 million was provided for the agri-food sector component of the SME Brexit loan scheme.  This scheme was jointly established by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, in conjunction with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  Along with &euro;14 million from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, this provision leveraged a working capital loan fund of &euro;300 million for SMEs at an interest rate not exceeding 4%.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine contribution ensured that at least 40% of the fund would be available for the food sector.  Savings which emerged in other parts of the programme, particularly research, allowed us to respond to a specific request from the World Food Programme for the earliest possible release of the final element of funding under our 2016-2018 strategic partnership agreement.  This resulted in payments of &euro;14 million to the World Food Programme in 2017.<\/p><p> Programme D relates to seafood.  Expenditure under this heading in 2017 included some &euro;21 million for the upgrading and development of fisheries harbours.  Around 88% of fish landed in Ireland now are landed into the six centres owned by the Department.  The value of those landings has increased from &euro;224.3 million in 2013 to &euro;271.5 million in 2017.  Programme D also includes &euro;5.6 million under the seafood development programme and grants-in-aid to the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.  This programme also includes expenditure of &euro;4 million on the commencement of substantive work on the remediation of Haulbowline Island.<\/p><p> I will now touch very briefly on the financial statements of the Irish operations for the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime Fisheries Fund.  This account consolidates financial data on a calendar year basis, incorporating EU and Vote funds.  It was devised in the early 2000s, at the request of this committee, to provide visibility of expenditure across all these funds as some of the expenditure is not Vote-related.  Notable features in 2017 include EU receipts of more than &euro;1.5 billion across the Irish operations of the three funds.  When combined with the national Exchequer funding of &euro;266.6 million, total expenditure under the funds in 2017 amounts to &euro;1.77 billion.  More generally, I know that the Comptroller and Auditor General has prepared a special report on the full range of Ireland&rsquo;s transactions with the EU in 2017.  That report provides a very clear picture of Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with the EU across all funds and all Departments.<\/p><p> Finally, I would like to refer to the account relating to fisheries harbour centres.  The harbours were the subject of a special report in 2014 and we are continuing to address some of the  recommendations.  Turning to the financial performance of the harbours themselves, the higher level of harbour dues and profit on disposal were the main factors behind the increases in receipts and the surplus on the revenue account.  The accounts also show the substantial increase in capital investment at the harbours with substantial projects at each of the six harbours, the vast majority of which is funded through the Department's Vote.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for their attention and I will try to answer any questions that arise. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gleeson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":215,"content":"<p>The lead speaker today is Deputy Catherine Murphy, who has 20 minutes.

We have trained those procurement officers in proper procedures.  The value of those non-compliant contracts has diminished.  I will return to the Deputy with a figure shortly.<\/p> <p>  We had 38 contracts valued at &euro;5.6 million in 2017 and the reasons for those fell outside the exceptions provided in the procurement rules.  While this is not in any way to excuse this, I assume that the people who involved themselves in those procurements felt that they complied with the exceptions provided for in the circular.  That should not happen.  We now have a system of assessment by a senior officer before any procurement exception is allowed and it is also assessed by the central procurement unit.

The IFA representatives I met stated that they are doing a two or three-year survey of people who have been getting this derogation and that it has emerged that it has no adverse effect on rivers, water levels, wells, etc.  Why is this derogation under review?  Is it with a view to cutting it back, excluding people from obtaining it or bringing it to an end?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#S00600","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561017600,"counter":359,"content":"<p>We are involved in a consultation.

There are additional conditions attaching because high-intensity farming needs to be controlled.  All we are saying is that we want to look again at the derogation against the backdrop of all of the information we have, including whatever comes from the IFA, but that we will rely on our own judgment for determining whether any adjustments are required and will have a public consultation about it.

There was a difference of opinion between Ireland and the United Kingdom for many years on where the boundary of the exclusive economic zone fell going north west from Donegal for 200 miles.  The continental shelf and jurisdictions are the business of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and an agreement was reached on the seabed boundary in 1988.  In 2013, there was agreement on the boundary in the water above the seabed.  They are the same single maritime boundary.  The drivers in reaching that agreement were concerns about who had responsibility for maritime pollution incidents and who would respond in different areas.  Some issues arose at the time.  There was also the matter of the development of offshore wind facilities and in which jurisdiction they could be located if consented.  The boundary was set but even when there were two different boundaries in terms of the exclusive economic zone, Rockall was always on the UK side of that boundary.  There was never a point where Rockall was not in the UK EEZ.  The fact that a single boundary was agreed in 2013 and that the continental shelf boundary was agreed in 1988 did not change the Rockall issue.<\/p> <p>  The Rockall issue centres on whether a claim by the UK of sovereignty and its unilateral actions to support that are accepted by the State.  This State, through successive Governments, has never accepted it.  Ireland has never claimed sovereignty of Rockall.  It is a dispute over the UK's creation of sovereignty on that rock and, subsequent to that, the creation of a 12-mile zone that the UK claims for exclusive access around Rockall.  That is not accepted by the State either.  There is detail behind that.  In earlier decades, there was debate as the United Kingdom was seeking to establish a new exclusive economic zone based on Rockall as a starting point, which would have pushed it way out.  The United Kingdom conceded that claim and no longer makes such a claim.  That matter does not arise.  There are other ongoing disputes about the continental shelf involving Denmark, the Faroe Islands and Ireland that are unresolved.  They concern seabed issues.  The 2013 agreement has no relevance to current issues around fisheries rights around Rockall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#T01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cecil Beamish"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":404,"content":"<p>The fisheries organisations would have a different view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#T01300","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561017600,"counter":405,"content":"<p>No.  The T&aacute;naiste answered a priority parliamentary question on this the day before yesterday put down by Deputy Gallagher.

It is a trade negotiation with Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.  To an extent, we have relied for some of our arguments on the Commission's own cumulative impact assessment of the damage that would be done to the European beef sector.  That is now several years old.  The impact would of course depend on the details of the deal, if there is to be one.  We already have approximately 220,000 tonnes of product coming in from South America under other TRQs and the question is how much more would come in under such a deal, over how long this would be phased, the rate of tariff and the quota management system.  We have consistently argued that if this is going to be done - we do not want it done - the quota division should arise from the fall of the carcass.

We then had a toolbox established by Teagasc, namely a marginal abatement cost curve, that lists actions that might be taken to abate and sequester carbon.

That will involve things like reducing the use of nitrogen-based fertilisers and improved breeding of animals.  The second pillar is sequestration.

The committee will return at 2.30 p.m. for a meeting in private session with Mr. Alan Morgan, former valuer with the OPW.<\/p> <p>  Following on on the matter of farm safety, the annual report states that farms were the largest category of workplace fatalities in Ireland.  There were 24 incidents, of which 14 were people over 65 years.  It was mentioned at a previous meeting - I do not recall if it was with Mr. Gleeson or his predecessor.  While he says it is a matter for the Health and Safety Authority, I make a plea to him, as I did on the last occasion, that someone in the Department take a bit more interest in it.  It might be done through Teagasc or another body.  Now that the economy is picking up, people who might otherwise have been available to work on the farm are gone.  It is grandfathers who are doing all the work now.  I look at my county, and most of the farmers are in their 70s because their sons have gone out to work.  They are trying to do the work and maybe their sons or daughters help out in the evening.  I can envisage this getting worse because more people are working on their own on farms.  Years ago, there would have been two or three people working on a farm, but now it is only one.  People are working alone with big machinery and if something goes wrong with it or an animal does something it is a problem.  I know it is a policy issue but in the interest of people working in rural industry, I ask the Department to take some initiative.  I know Teagasc has done something on it, but more needs to be done.  If there were 24 deaths in the health sector, which is the biggest employer in the country, people would be up in arms, or similarly in the construction sector.  Because the fatalities are so dispersed and are one here or there, it is not as visible.  Mr. Gleeson will get the point I am making.  We need more to be done, and I worry it will get worse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#AA01800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561017600,"counter":816,"content":"<p>The Chairman is 100% right.

In summary, the change to the articles is to increase the voting threshold for approval of future capital increases at the IFC.  The Government seeks D&aacute;il approval for this change under Article 29.5.2o of the Constitution as the IFC's Articles of Agreement are an international agreement involving a charge upon public funds.  I will now set out for the committee some background on the IFC and the reasons for this proposed change.<\/p> <p>  IFC is the part of the World Bank which seeks to promote private sector development in developing countries.  It does so by providing loans, investments and advisory services to companies engaged in projects with development impact.  In April 2018, shareholders of the World Bank agreed on a capital increase for the bank.  The agreed financial package includes a $7.5 billion capital increase for IBRD, the World Bank's main lending arm, and a $5.5 billion capital increase for the IFC.  The capital increase for the IFC is a response to the ambition of the sustainable development goals and the increased levels of finance required.  Simply put, the sustainable development goals will not be met through existing domestic resources or traditional overseas aid.  The annual funding gap is estimated to be $2.5 trillion.  It is, therefore, essential to leverage private sector capital to have a realistic chance of achieving the sustainable development goals.  Standing between policymakers and private finance, IFC is well-positioned to bridge this gap and encourage investment in developing countries.  The proposed capital increase has the potential to double IFC investment to $25 billion by 2030.  Under the agreed package, this increased investment will be targeted toward the world's most disadvantaged countries and to address gender equality and climate change.  The capital package also includes reforms to increase efficiencies at the bank.<\/p> <p>  The Government is supportive of the capital increase for the bank which is the largest development actor globally with the scale, expertise and experience to deliver transformative development impact.  The deliverables of the capital increase are closely aligned with Ireland's priorities as articulated in our new development policy, A Better World.  Ireland has the option to take up shares in the IFC under the capital increase which would require a total subscription of $12.6 million over five years.  Our subscription to IFC would count toward the UN target of providing 0.7% of GNP for overseas development assistance.  While we are supportive of the overall capital package, at this stage, a final decision on our take-up of shareholding has not been taken by the Minister for Finance.<\/p> <p>  An essential part of the agreement on the capital package was the proposed amendment to the IFC's Articles of Agreement which we are here today to discuss.  Specifically, this amendment would increase the voting threshold for approval of future capital increases from 80% to 85%.  This change will maintain the veto power of the USA in relation to future capital increases at the IFC.  During negotiations, the USA indicated that while it would not contribute to the capital increase, it would not oppose the increase provided that it did not reduce the USA's voting power below the level at which it could exercise a veto.  This was an essential condition for the final agreement.  The Office of the Attorney General has advised that the proposed change requires D&aacute;il approval.  This is in line with Article 29.5.2o of the Constitution which outlines that the State will not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge on public funds unless the terms of the agreement, including any amendments, have been approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  To be clear, the proposed amendment to the IFC's articles does not in itself result in any new immediate charge upon public funds.  However, as the amendment will ultimately create a charge on public funds, the Government is seeking D&aacute;il approval.  A D&aacute;il resolution to approve the proposed change to the IFC's Articles of Agreement will allow Ireland to vote in favour of the amendment.  This will assist in paving the way for the IFC to complete this capital increase and allow it to progress its important mission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019062000002#B00300","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1560985200,"counter":871,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his opening statement.
