He is joined today by Ms Josephine Mooney, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Deering.<\/p> <p>  I have not had an opportunity to review the minutes of the previous two meetings.  I propose we hold them over to the next meeting, when we can deal with any matters arising.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. <\/p> <p>  There are three categories of correspondence.  Category A deals with briefing material and opening statements.  Nos. 2249A, 2256A, 2257A, 2258A and 2259A are from Mr. Brendan Gleeson, Secretary General at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  These are the briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.  We will note and publish those.  <\/p> <p>  No. 2255A is from Mr. Allen Morgan and provides an opening statement for this afternoon&rsquo;s private meeting.  We will note this item and discuss whether to publish it during the course of the meeting this afternoon.<\/p> <p>  Category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers, follow-up material from previous meetings of the committee and other items for publication.<\/p><p>No. 2161B dated 10 May, which was held over from previous meetings on 13 May and 13 June, is from Mr. Paul O'Toole, chief executive officer of the higher Education Authority.  It encloses the report regarding the review of the relationship between Cork Institute of Technology and certain named companies and entities undertaken by Mazars.  We have already noted and published this item but it was held over for discussion if any member of committee would like to discuss it briefly.  I know one or two members with a particular interest in this matter are not here.  We have noted and published it but we will hold it over in case any wants to discuss it.  For anybody who is interested in the document, it has already been noted and published.  We might have a further detailed discussion about it at the next meeting.<\/p><p> No. 2201B dated 31 May 2019 is from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  This is the most substantial item of correspondence we have today.  It encloses a minute from the Minister of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform on periodic report No. 5 of the Committee of Public Accounts, which covered our meetings from September to November 2018.  The report was published by the committee in March 2019 and I welcome the prompt response, which we received at the end of May, as I said.  I will go through the comprehensive letter.  I reiterate that organisations present their accounts to the committee after they have been audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We discuss their accounts but that the public meeting of the committee is not the end of the matter.  We proceed to examine the matter in further detail, prepare a report or chapter on each meeting we have and publish the report with recommendations.  We send that to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform who prepares a formal response to our recommendations in consultation with the relevant Departments, which is then submitted to the committee.  We now have the response from the Minister.  We take these responses seriously and committee members will make a number of observations.  I will go through each of the report's recommendation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#A00300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Did we receive a copy of this in our pack last week?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#B00200","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#B00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I did not bring it with me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#B00400","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>We will put it up on the screen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#B00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#B00600","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>There is quite a bit to the report.  I have gone through the report and I do not expect the committee to go through all 20 pages in public session.  I will highlight the key points and if members would like clarification about certain matters, that can be done subsequently.  I would like to clear this today.  There are one or two points that invite follow up.<\/p> <p>  We received this 20-page document before our previous meeting.  I will explain and put it in context.  Our report included chapters on the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, the President's establishment, Teagasc, the Office of Public Works, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Higher Education Authority, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  We made recommendations in each chapter and the Minister has responded to the committee having consulted the various Departments as to whether our recommendations are accepted.  Practically all of the recommendations were accepted and only one or two were rejected.  We want to deal with those issues.<\/p> <p>  Our first recommendation dealt with NAMA.  The agency's lack of systematic and routine verification of declarations under section 172 of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 was unacceptable and we recommended that NAMA put in place a system to verify these declarations for the remainder of its operation.  This was one of the most discussed recommendations.  The Minister of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform rejects this recommendation and has set out his reasons for doing so.  We noted that we were conscious that NAMA had published its annual accounts recently and 95% of its work had been completed.  We noted it was expecting a surplus at the end of its operation in the order of &euro;4 billion and that we were making our recommendation for the remainder of NAMA's work.  The reason given by the Minister for rejecting the recommendation is that providing purchaser compliance with the section 172 agreement would necessitate a comprehensive asset search of every purchaser of NAMA secured assets and would be time-consuming.  He stated the delay could jeopardise any purchase sales and that the process would involve a comprehensive verification of purchaser confirmations and would appear to imply that NAMA does not regard purchaser's written confirmations as having much standing.  He stated the recommendation operates a presumption that many purchasers of NAMA secured assets are willfully breaking the law on this issue.  The committee will write to NAMA about that.  Before Deputy Catherine Murphy speaks about it, I will give my own view on the matter.  By asking for a verification, the committee did not at any stage suggest that NAMA-secured clients were wilfully breaking the law.  That is attributing to us an assumption that we never made.  The Chairman of NAMA was a former chairman of the Revenue Commissioners.  The Revenue has a self-assessment system in place and does spot checks now and again.  That does not mean there is a presumption that all taxpayers are wilfully breaking the law.  We were only suggesting some verification.  We never suggested that everyone was wilfully breaking the law and I reject the implication to that effect that the Minister has thrown back at this committee.<\/p> <p>  The Minister goes on to say that NAMA is taking steps on this matter, in particular to ensure that the purchaser is the same party that executed the contract for sale.  The party executing a contract for sale might not be the same party that completed the purchase agreement.  It was NAMA which spotted that.  The document also notes that NAMA expects new regulations to be in place under the European Union (Anti-Money Laundering: Beneficial Ownership of Corporate Entities) Regulations 2019 on 22 November.  A central register of beneficial ownership of companies and industrial and provident societies will be publicly available at that stage.  Even at EU level, there is acceptance of the need for some verification but that will not happen until the end of November when NAMA will be nearly finished its work.  <\/p> <p>  I want to counter any suggestion that has been attributed to this committee by NAMA that we were even remotely making a presumption that people were wilfully breaking the law.  We never made any such presumption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#B00700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>The Chairman might clarify section 172.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#B00800","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I might ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to help as he did a special report on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#B00900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Please do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#B01000","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>The issue is essentially that there is no connection between the purchaser of the loan-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#B01100","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561017600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>It is a legal prohibition on NAMA, which prevents it from selling an asset back to an owner or somebody with an interest in that asset.  I pointed out, in the section 226 report, that it is very restricted legislation.  It only applies to a sale by NAMA, not by a borrower or a receiver.  It only applies to the sale of a property and not the sale of a loan.  There are definitions of connected persons or debtors for the purposes of the section.  Because NAMA sells loans rather than property, what it has tried to do is to extend that principle to loan sales and it is to be commended on that.  That means that, while there is a legal structure there and a potential that, if NAMA were selling property, there would be some infringement or criminal offence, it is not in the same league when it has applied the same approach or looked for the same declarations in relation to the sale of a loan.  It is very complicated.  Any infringement or irregularity in a declaration that was made around the sale of a loan would not, strictly, be an offence under section 172.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#B01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I do not think people fully appreciated the need for a section 172 declaration when the legislation was drafted.

The expectation was that anyone who was the original owner and transferred to NAMA would not become the beneficial owner again at a reduced price.  That is shorthand for how it was presented.  NAMA is probably being blamed for a shortfall in the legislation and in anticipating how things would play out.  The public expectation was that a person would not be able to buy back a loan at less than its face value before the discount.  That was an important assurance that was given.  The criticism may be focused on NAMA and that may be legally wrong.  At least one Garda investigation is under way and it probably relates to the circumstances outlined in a reply I received to a parliamentary question which states NAMA concluded its investigations and is satisfied that no breach occurred.  What it is stating is right from its perspective.  I have not listened to the definition, but the allegation is that a person is back in control of an asset that was substantially discounted.<\/p> <p>  Another aspect relates to SI 110\/2019 under the European Union (Anti-Money Laundering: Beneficial Ownership of Corporate Entities) Regulations 2019.  This information was also contained in the reply to my parliamentary question.  Essentially, we are told that there will be a central register of beneficial ownership information.  I do not think it will be backdated, but it will be of great importance in knowing who are the beneficial owners.  As was identified when we discussed the matter of connected persons, there is a deficiency in the law and a gap in terms of what the expectation was and knowing who is the beneficial owner.  I have no doubt that some people are back in control of their assets.  It may be that the loan was sold and that there was a second transaction.  If examples are being identified, it may be down to a flaw in the legislation.  It is very frustrating to see such practices, particularly where people can point to things that others were able to do that they were not.  That is certainly not the way the public expected the legislation to work in practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#C00400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>The Deputy is correct in that regard.  It is strange that we are almost at the end of the NAMA story and 95% of the issue has been dealt with, but this issue is only coming out now.  When the legislation was being drafted, it was decided to establish the National Asset Management Agency.  I know that the asset was the loan, but people were thinking of properties and the sale thereof when the legislation was being enacted.  The sale of loans was not as common at the time as it is today.  It is only with the passage of time that it has become more widespread.  Financial institutions around the world are no longer buying property assets from each other; rather, they are buying loans that control the assets.  That was probably not envisaged from a business perspective when the NAMA legislation was being drafted.  As these practices became more common, the legislation should, perhaps, have been amended.  We might ask NAMA to comment on this matter.  We accept what it states.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy raised the issue of the European Union (Anti-Money Laundering: Beneficial Ownership of Corporate Entities) Regulations 2019, but they will only apply to companies incorporated here; therefore, there is a limit straightaway in dealing with this issue.  It would be interesting to know how much of the disposal of NAMA's entire portfolio consisted of loan sales which were not covered by section 172 and how much consisted of the sale of assets through receivers or the owners of the assets selling and making good their loans.  Mr. McCarthy may know those details.  In other words, what percentage of NAMA's activity was loan sales by it which were not strictly covered by section 172?  Does Mr. McCarthy have that information or should we seek it directly from NAMA?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#C00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561017600,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Very little of what was disposed of was subject to section 172 because the property sales were mainly carried out by the developer or owner of the property or a receiver.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>They were not captured.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#C00700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561017600,"counter":27,"content":"<p>The loan sales were by NAMA, but loan sales are not included.

When the NAMA Bill was going through the Houses, I was in the Senate and said that this is all new territory and I would not be surprised if, as things evolved, there needed to be a NAMA No. 2 or No. 3 Bill.  There never was.  Perhaps it is my conspiratorial mind, but there is form here.  We are having this exact discussion on the oversight of the IBRC liquidation.  Given the way the legislation is written, history will record that Mr. McDonagh and Mr. Daly and the NAMA team have done an exceptional job.  It is us who did not do such a good job in providing the necessary oversight and agility in that regard.  History will also record that the overall effect of authorities in Northern Ireland extracting the building industry from the NAMA process here, notwithstanding any ongoing criminal investigations, allowed them to do deals all over the place and get back to normality an awful lot quicker than us.<\/p> <p>  Sadly, without the appropriate oversight, the only reflection mechanisms we have in this country are tribunals of inquiry and commissions of investigation.  That is a failing in NAMA, but it is not a failing of the leadership of NAMA, who, under the legislation, has done as good a job as it could.  It was envisaged that it would take 20 years and might make &euro;1 billion; it will now be done in ten to 12 years and will make a profit of &euro;4 billion.  Those are the headline figures but there are a lot of individual stories where people may have gripes about how they were dealt with; the courts will deal with those.  <\/p> <p>  There is form here, however.

There is no doubt goodwill has been shown on the part of the President, as we said at the time.<\/p> <p>  Second, in regard to the committee's recommendation that this allowance be considered under Vote 1, therefore making it subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General, did the Department think we were suggesting it just be shoved into that Vote?

The Department is coming back with the usual statement that it has been noted.  For the Department, \"note\" is just another word for a rejection, because that is what it is doing.  The Department is saying it is not accepting this, and wishing us good luck.  We need to have some amount of money that is available to the President for him or her to do with what he or she wants.  I do not have a problem with that.  It is great that there is an independent internal committee, and I have looked on the website too, but those are broad brush strokes.  I first raised this before the presidential election, and I am not saying that we necessarily want to see what every shilling was spent on, but I would be happy if the Comptroller and Auditor General did.

The next item relates to Teagasc.  The committee recommended that Teagasc ensures procurement processes are complied with, and that has been accepted in full.

However, the Department accepts what we are saying.<\/p><p>We then move on to the Office of Public Works, OPW.  We made a recommendation relating to the new headquarters for the Department of Health, the Miesian Plaza, that there be more engagement and consultation with the staff of any public body.  We felt adequate consultation between the OPW and the Department of Health did not occur in this case.  That is fully accepted and the Minister has informed us that the OPW intends to pilot a changed management consultancy approach for single, large-scale relocation programmes, which will improve the lines of communication.  That is good.Recommendation 8 also deals with the Miesian Plaza and the fact that there was an overpayment of &euro;10 million due to the measurements used in the project.

The OPW further states that, as part of the sanction process, the technical aspects of their cost effectiveness analyses were reviewed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform prior to sanction being given.  On the issue of leasing properties versus purchasing them, the OPW has carried out detailed assessments of two recent major projects.  That matter is being examined and it has started looking at the long-term benefits of buying or building versus leasing.

We had a discussion on the new single public service pension scheme.  We were critical of the fact that the Department had not carried out its work before the legislation was passed, and it has accepted that completely.  The Department says that, due to other pressures, it did not have the resources available to support the implementation of the legislation.  That is dreadful.  It goes on to say that the Department undertook a comprehensive analysis of the public service bodies to be included in the legislation in 2018, which was two years after the legislation was passed.  It says it submitted a report to the Committee of Public Accounts in February 2019 and the only outstanding issue was the Dental Council of Ireland, which we dealt with last week.  The Department has given us a complete update and that matter is now closed, but is only closed because of the committee's close scrutiny of the particular issue.  The Comptroller and Auditor General had highlighted that, so at least that topic is now fully closed and being dealt with as a result of our vigilance on the matter.<\/p><p>The next item also deals with the single pension scheme.  We recommended that consideration be given to investing these pension funds in a fund similar to the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  It fully accepts this recommendation but the Department says it is a complex matter and would be a major change in approach for funding public sector pensions as contributions under the single pension public pension scheme are slightly different from the old arrangement.  The Department further states:<\/p><blockquote>Given the complexity of the matter, a substantial time and resource investment is required in order to ensure that the correct approach is arrived at. Accordingly, while this matter is progressing, it will not be concluded in the short term. The Department can update the PAC on progress, as required.<\/blockquote> <p>If somebody wants to come forward with amending legislation on how that fund is invested, that would be a matter for any Member of the House or of this committee, but not for the Committee of Public Accounts itself.  We have highlighted the issue and the matter is now being examined.<\/p><p>The next item relates to leasing, and again to the Miesian Plaza.  We were not satisfied that the balance between leasing properties and the acquisition of properties was correct and it accepts that fully.  It has commenced a review, and has conducted a detailed assessment on two major projects recently.  That recommendation is accepted by the Department, but we again have to follow its implementation.<\/p><p>The next issue refers to the credibility of the annual Estimates.  We recommended that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should work closely with Departments with a history of requesting Supplementary Estimates, in order to ensure the Estimates presented to the Oireachtas are accurate from the outset.  It notes that and hears what we are saying but does not want to accept that it presented inaccurate Estimates.  I did not expect it to accept that, though we believe it.<\/p><p>It is saying &quot;We hear what you say.&quot;  We will ask for information on what is stated about the Department of Health because the Department of Health requires the biggest Supplementary Estimates each year.  The bottom of page 9 states:<\/p><blockquote>The creation of a new oversight group chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and reform, to monitor spending and act as an early warning mechanism [in respect of the Department of Health Vote].<br \/><br \/>Monthly spending reports from Health to be submitted to the Cabinet Committee on Health each month, and<br \/><br \/>A quarterly health financial management memo to Government, to update Government on the overall health position.<\/blockquote><p>I note the Government is voicing concern over health expenditure overruns at a much earlier stage in the year than was historically the case.  I propose writing to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform asking it to give us the background to this oversight group on the health Vote - who is on it; who chairs it and what its instructions are.  I am pleased to see it is there, but this is the first I had heard of it and we now see it in print.  Let us find out more about it.<br\/><br\/>On the Estimates, we recommended &quot;that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform takes all necessary steps to ensure that the Estimates are approved by the Oireachtas before the beginning of the calendar year to which they relate&quot;.<br\/><br\/>The letter notes this recommendation and states that the Estimates for 2019 were &quot;published before the end of 2018 [on] 19 December 2018&quot;, which is fine.  That is only the first step of the process, however.  There is then the Revised Estimates process, which can include extra matters.  They were published normally in February and go on for debate.  We need to get the exact dates of when the Revised Estimates were published for the past two or three years, what the plan for next year is, and when the debate on the Revised Estimate can take place in the Oireachtas committee.  While the Estimates are published early on, there is no D&aacute;il debate on them until several months into the year when the Revised Estimates come out.  The European Union has set timetables.  We will ask for more specific details on the timetable for discussing and approving the Estimates, including the Revised Estimates by the Oireachtas.<br\/><br\/>On the Higher Education Authority we recommended &quot;that, when drafting Higher Education Authority legislation, the Department of Education and Skills ensures that the Higher Education Authority is granted sufficient powers to allow it to provide effective oversight of the third level sector&quot;.  That came as a result of the investigation into Waterford Institute of Technology.  It fully accepted the recommendation and gave two pages of detailed response, referring to a number of changes to legislation.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>Currently, a Memorandum for Government is being drafted with the aim of submitting this for approval in June 2019.  This Memorandum will seek approval for:- the updating of the Higher Education Act, 1971 and the broad policy approach being adopted,<br \/><br \/>- the inclusion of a review power for the HEA in the legislation,<br \/><br \/>- the publication of the consultation report.<\/blockquote><p>That is important.  We highlighted practical issues over what is happening with spending.  Here we find the legislation was deficient in the first place and it is now being corrected.  Quite a bit of what we are uncovering in terms of following the taxpayers' money has its problems in defective or inadequate legislation in the first place.  It is not for the Committee of Public Accounts to draft the legislation; our job is to highlight it.  It is up to the Oireachtas, any Member of the Oireachtas or the Government to act accordingly.  We have taken it as far as we can.<br\/><br\/>The next issue also relates to the HEA.  We recommended &quot;that the governing bodies of third level institutions acquire and maintain the appropriate skills&quot; etc.  It fully accepts that there should be an appropriate skills mix.  The governing bodies should identify gaps themselves.  There should be an annual self-assessment of the board.  Under the Technological Universities Act 2018, greater emphasis has been given to this issue.  This matter needs to be included in the proposed Higher Education Authority legislation.  Hopefully it will be.<br\/><br\/>We come to the Revenue Commissioners.  We had a recommendation for reducing the threshold at which they deem people to be high-wealth individuals for investigation.  They fully accept the recommendation.  We had a good outcome last week.  They wrote to us last week saying they had done it and increased the number of cases now under this as a result of reducing the threshold from &euro;50 million to &euro;20 million for high-wealth individuals to be examined by the large cases division.  There were 200 cases involved.  This has resulted in another 475 being added, which is a very big increase.  That is now being implemented and we dealt with that in correspondence last week.  That is a very good outcome.<br\/><br\/>We recommended &quot;that Revenue investigates the possibility of developing guidelines regarding out of court settlements for tax avoidance schemes in order to ensure a level of consistency in reaching such settlements in future&quot;.  We discussed this matter.  It is in our report, so people will remember what we are talking about.  The Revenue Commissioners stated that in the majority of cases, like the ones we are talking about, there were out-of-court settlements and they reached settlements of &euro;500 million in those cases.  Maybe we did not delve into the detail.  They say they have detailed compliance notes on that.  The letter states that Chapter 8 of Revenue's &quot;Code of Practice for Revenue Audit and Other Compliance Interventions&quot; deals with that.  We are pleased to see that.<br\/><br\/>On high-wealth individuals, we recommended that &quot;consideration is given to requiring High Wealth Individuals to provide Revenue with an annual statement of assets held in Ireland&quot;.  It states this would require a legislative change.  Here we are.  We highlighted a legitimate issue.  When we delve into our stuff, again the problem is that the legislation does not cover it.  It is not the Revenue's fault.  I am highlighting that if any Member wants to deal with that topic by way of legislation, he or she should feel free to do so.  It accepts the reality that it is a legislative issue that needs to be dealt with.<br\/><br\/>The next recommendation for the Revenue Commissioners dealt with the tobacco trade and the very low level of fines, which we felt were not a deterrent.  They accept the recommendation, which is good.  The response states, &quot;The imposition of these penalties in individual cases is a matter for the Courts.&quot;  Tax represents 80% of the cost of a packet of cigarettes.  The Revenue Commissioners raise &euro;1.4 billion in tax from tobacco products each year.  They estimate that 13% of all cigarettes smoked in Ireland are illegal.  Revenue estimates the loss to the taxpayer at approximately &euro;229 million per annum.  Between January and October of last year when we were doing our work, in the cases they prosecuted they followed up about &euro;23 million worth of cases, which meant that 93% of their estimate of what was illegal was not detected or followed up on.  Fines were issued for &euro;140,000, which is fairly abysmal.  They say it is up to the judges and the fines will be increased.  I feel there is not sufficient detection of the issue if there is that level of revenue loss.<br\/><br\/>The next item also related to the Revenue Commissioners.  We recommended &quot;that the Minister considers whether separate identification of trading losses forward and capital allowances can be provided for in future legislation&quot;.  Under the legislation, any business that has losses from a previous year can carry it forward against future profits to reduce its taxable profits in a future year.  Most people accept that if a company has a trading loss, that is fair enough.  Sometimes, if the losses are as a result of capital allowances relating to capital expenditure, we proposed that these be identified separately so that we can get a measure of all these losses forward.  There is a big gap in knowing how the losses forward are made up.<br\/><br\/>The Minister noted the recommendations but under the scheme of corporation tax, they do not actually do the breakdown.  The letter stated, &quot;The amount of any trading losses... is not broken down between that which relates to capital allowances and that which relates to other trading expenses&quot;.  That is exactly what we asked them to do.  The Minister for Finance looked at this issue in respect of the banks, which is relevant to all corporate entities, in a report published in 2018.  Again people might want to draft legislation on the matter; it cannot be done without legislation.

The report states that the committee recommends that an annual review take place to ensure the new controls regarding overpayments to jobseeker's under 25 are working effectively.  When they introduced that scheme, there were different rates for persons under 21, those aged 21 to 25, and those over 26.  It was difficult for the Department.  It was a new scheme and there were inconsistencies across the Department.  Officials told us at the time there was one person in each office with particular expertise who looked at all of this.  They have acknowledged the work has been carried out.  The most recent review was conducted in February 2019 and all cases reviewed were confirmed as being correct.  A further review is being planned, subject to the outcome being satisfactory and, in line with the recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts, it is proposed to schedule further reviews on an annual basis.  The Department has taken up the recommendation and worked on it.  The recent reports of cases examined means they are fully correct, so at least the recommendation is being carried through and the Department is going to keep an eye on it into the future. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#H00800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I completely understand that we are making sure this is being properly applied.

The six reports are glorified PowerPoint presentations, which we would have received.  There is not much in them besides a headline figure so they will not give us much detail on that, though we could review them before the private meeting.  It is good that Deputy Catherine Murphy asked about IBRC, but the response was unsatisfactory.  The Minister is obviously a very busy man and these responses are often written on Ministers' behalf by their teams.  We can understand that.  However, in his answer to Deputy Catherine Murphy, which she has shared with me, the Minister clearly sets out that we disapplied normal rules in legislation for this liquidation, which is the biggest in the history of the State.  The Minister says we can go through the six PowerPoint presentations on the website to see the headline figures.  However, we have established here that two people have effectively been put in place in lieu of a committee of inspection, and that was reaffirmed recently.  Based on my own humble experience, having voluntarily liquidated my own company with very modest turnovers and so on, it is just laughable.  The issue here is not that we are not going to get to the end of this, because we will, no matter how long it takes.   We will all celebrate and back-clap and say how well it was done, but we have highlighted that we had no benchmark position because no evaluations were done at the beginning, and so on.  Apart from that, the Government is heading for costs, by its own admission, of &euro;306 million, and we do not know if that represents good value.  The Minister cannot be satisfied, despite what he said in response to Deputy Catherine Murphy's question.  We need to stay on this and keep pushing it because long after we are gone, that reflection mechanism Deputy Connolly spoke of will be no doubt set up, there will be a commission of investigation or a tribunal of inquiry, and we could save the State a great deal of money by just doing a few little bits now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#L00200","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":206,"content":"<p>We have scheduled a private meeting specifically on this topic, which is in our work programme.

This represented a 10% increase on the spend of 1.26 billion in 2016.  The account is presented under four programmes, as indicated in the diagram provided to members.  These programmes correspond to the four key strategic objectives set out in the Department&rsquo;s statement of strategy 2016-2019.<\/p> <p>  Programme B was the largest programme.  This relates to farm and sector supports and controls, and mainly comprises payments which benefit farms and farmers.  Total expenditure charged to the programme amounted to &euro;726 million in 2017 - an increase of over &euro;100 million from the 2016 level of expenditure.<\/p> <p>  The Department provides substantial funding from the Vote each year to a number of State bodies that operate under its aegis.  These include Teagasc, An Bord Bia, the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon.<\/p> <p>  By means of a Supplementary Estimate passed in December 2017, the Department was able to reallocate unspent funds on some subheads totalling almost &euro;50 million to other expenditure subheads.  There was no overall increase in the estimate provision for the Vote through the supplementary process.<\/p> <p>  At year end, net expenditure under the Vote was &euro;24 million less than provided for.  Some &euro;23.8 million in unspent capital allocations - mainly under the farm and sector supports and controls programme - was carried over for spending in 2018.  The remainder of the surplus for the year, an amount of &euro;207,000, was liable for surrender to the Exchequer.  Note 3 provides explanations for the variances in spending and transfers of funding from the various subheads.<\/p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the appropriation account.  However, I drew attention to the Accounting Officer&rsquo;s statement on internal financial control, which discloses non-competitive procurement by the Department of nearly &euro;19 million worth of goods and services in 2017, including a significant level of procurement which was not compliant with public procurement rules.  This is a recurrent issue for the Department.<\/p> <p>  The Department directly manages the six fishery harbour centres, which are accounted for separately from the Vote.  The form of the fishery harbour centres' financial statements was devised many years ago.  Unusually, the financial statements of the fishery harbour centres are prepared on both a cash and an accruals basis.  The day-to-day operations of the centres are funded through harbour dues and charges set by law, and rents from State-owned properties.  The income and expenditure account show a surplus for 2017 of &euro;1.5 million.  In addition, annual capital grant funding from the Department is made available for the development and maintenance of harbour facilities.  Capital funding from the Department in 2017 was &euro;17.5 million.<\/p> <p>  I issued a special report in 2014 on significant ongoing deficiencies in the financial management and reporting for the fishery harbour centres, including significant delays in the timeliness of presentation of accounts.  The report included seven recommendations intended to enhance the financial management of the centres.  The statement on internal financial control discloses the progress the Department has made so far in implementing those recommendations.<\/p> <p>  As Members are aware, the Department manages significant funds provided by the EU.  Where these are applied on schemes that are co-funded by the Exchequer, the funding is reflected in the vote.  However, payments to farmers and market-related expenditure that are almost fully funded by the EU are not accounted for in the Department&rsquo;s appropriation account, even though the Department manages the payments.  Such payments amounted to just over &euro;1.2 billion for 2017.  These are accounted for to the EU in financial statements that are not subject to audit by me.  However, note 6.1 in the appropriation account provides some information about the amounts received from the EU each year.  <\/p> <p>  At the request of a previous Committee of Public Accounts, it was agreed that the Department, in co-operation with the Department of Rural and Community Affairs, would prepare an annual composite account to provide an overview of the funds flowing to agriculture, fisheries and rural communities, and that this would be examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Accordingly, the 2017 financial statements of the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund have been prepared and presented, and are before the committee today.<\/p> <p>  The financial statements present the income and expenditure of these three fund programmes in Ireland, including both EU and Exchequer financing.  They indicate that the combined income and expenditure of the funds was &euro;1.77 billion in 2017, of which &euro;1.5 billion was funded by the EU.  Of course, funds for other, non-agriculture, programmes are also received from the EU, and there are significant annual payments from Ireland to the EU.  These composite accounts before the committee today do not give a sufficiently rounded picture of the transactions with the EU, and so I recently published a special report on Ireland&rsquo;s Transactions with the EU in 2017, which gives a more comprehensive picture.  Members will recall that this was examined with the Accounting Officer of the Department of Finance.  I recommended in that report that there should be annual reporting, on a consolidated basis, of all Irish contributions to and receipts from the EU.  If the Department of Finance takes up that suggestion, the committee may wish to consider if there is a continuing need for the current composite reporting of EU funding to the agriculture and fisheries sectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561017600,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it.

The first is a non-statutory account, provided for the sake of transparency, which shows the interaction between the funding received from the European Union and the Department's Vote.<\/p><p>This funding is accounted for separately under EU rules and audited by the EU institutions.  Because the bulk of it is not matched by national funds, much of it does not appear in the  Department&rsquo;s appropriation account and therefore these financial statements provide a fuller picture of total departmental expenditure at both national and EU levels.<\/p><p> The second is the financial statements for the six fisheries harbour centres owned and operated by the Department.  I will begin with the appropriation account.  The Department&rsquo;s gross Estimate for 2017 was &euro;1.49 billion.  This included a carryover of capital savings of &euro;21.7 million from 2016.  This represented an overall increase of almost &euro;120 million over the gross voted Estimate for 2016.  The gross outturn was &euro;1.387 billion, an increase of &euro;131 million over 2016.  The Department received a technical Supplementary Estimate to further address emerging priorities by the transfer of funds within the Vote.  I will refer to this in my later remarks.  The Department also receives appropriations-in-aid.  These principally comprise EU receipts in respect of rural development and animal disease programmes.  In 2017 these receipts amounted to &euro;258.9 million, some &euro;78 million less than the Estimate of &euro;337 million, largely because EU receipts expected in December 2017 in respect of rural development schemes were not received until January 2018.<\/p><p> The Department&rsquo;s Vote is divided into four programmes, each representing a key policy priority.  Programme A relates to the food safety, animal health and welfare and plant health programmes that underpin our agrifood sector.  These include disease eradication programmes such as those relating to tuberculosis, TB, or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, TSEs, testing for residues in food products, on-farm controls, plant protection controls and other such headings.  Programme expenditure under this heading amounted to just over &euro;80 million in 2017, excluding staff and administration costs.  This is a saving of &euro;5.5 million compared to the budgeted amount.<\/p><p> Programme B covers our major farm support schemes other than basic payments, which are entirely EU-funded.  By and large, these schemes are intended to encourage sustainable agricultural practices and most of them receive co-funding from the EU under the rural development programme.  The final allocation for these schemes in 2017, following a Supplementary Estimate, came to just under &euro;806 million.  This was some &euro;182 million greater than the &euro;623 million outturn in 2016.  In 2017 almost 50,000 people participated in the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS.  More than 24,000 participated in the beef data and genomics scheme and the sheep welfare and knowledge transfer schemes were launched.  Other co-funded schemes included the areas of national constraint scheme, the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, the organics scheme, and the forestry programme, which alone among these schemes is 100% nationally funded.  The eventual outturn was for this programme was &euro;726 million.  This was more than &euro;100 million greater than the previous year but also &euro;80 million short of the available funds.  Key factors in this shortfall were the fact that participation in the new schemes for sheep welfare and knowledge transfer was lower than provided for, and an adjustment to deadlines for certain actions in the knowledge transfer scheme slowed the payment process, with some falling into 2018.  Similarly, our ambitious target for payments to a very high portion of GLAS participants within the calendar year was not achieved.  However, for the 2018 scheme year close to 90% of GLAS applicants were paid their annual advance within the calendar year.<\/p><p> On the capital side, the TAMS investment scheme saw a greatly improved drawdown compared to 2016 with &euro;33 million spent, although drawdown was lower than the provision.  To help with the  financial management of the scheme we reduced the time allowed for applicants to submit payment claims.  The experience in the past 18 months reflects good levels of investment in improved on-farm facilities.  Expenditure on the forestry programme was lower than hoped in 2017, and this remains a continuing but critically important challenge.  The capital carryover into 2018 from 2017 was largely drawn from the TAMS and forestry savings in 2017.  I should say that programme B also includes an element of national funding on EU market support schemes such as intervention.<\/p><p> Programme C, policy and strategy, includes expenditure on research and training and several food support schemes, as well as grants-in-aid to some of our State agencies.  The outturn slightly exceeded the voted allocation of &euro;338 million, due partly to several additional measures designed to help build resilience in the sector to confront the challenge of Brexit.  Those initial measures included an increase in Bord Bia's allocation by &euro;8.6 million to assist it in its marketing and promotion of Irish food overseas.  In addition, the sum of &euro;9 million was provided for the agri-food sector component of the SME Brexit loan scheme.  This scheme was jointly established by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, in conjunction with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  Along with &euro;14 million from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, this provision leveraged a working capital loan fund of &euro;300 million for SMEs at an interest rate not exceeding 4%.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine contribution ensured that at least 40% of the fund would be available for the food sector.  Savings which emerged in other parts of the programme, particularly research, allowed us to respond to a specific request from the World Food Programme for the earliest possible release of the final element of funding under our 2016-2018 strategic partnership agreement.  This resulted in payments of &euro;14 million to the World Food Programme in 2017.<\/p><p> Programme D relates to seafood.  Expenditure under this heading in 2017 included some &euro;21 million for the upgrading and development of fisheries harbours.  Around 88% of fish landed in Ireland now are landed into the six centres owned by the Department.  The value of those landings has increased from &euro;224.3 million in 2013 to &euro;271.5 million in 2017.  Programme D also includes &euro;5.6 million under the seafood development programme and grants-in-aid to the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.  This programme also includes expenditure of &euro;4 million on the commencement of substantive work on the remediation of Haulbowline Island.<\/p><p> I will now touch very briefly on the financial statements of the Irish operations for the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime Fisheries Fund.  This account consolidates financial data on a calendar year basis, incorporating EU and Vote funds.  It was devised in the early 2000s, at the request of this committee, to provide visibility of expenditure across all these funds as some of the expenditure is not Vote-related.  Notable features in 2017 include EU receipts of more than &euro;1.5 billion across the Irish operations of the three funds.  When combined with the national Exchequer funding of &euro;266.6 million, total expenditure under the funds in 2017 amounts to &euro;1.77 billion.  More generally, I know that the Comptroller and Auditor General has prepared a special report on the full range of Ireland&rsquo;s transactions with the EU in 2017.  That report provides a very clear picture of Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with the EU across all funds and all Departments.<\/p><p> Finally, I would like to refer to the account relating to fisheries harbour centres.  The harbours were the subject of a special report in 2014 and we are continuing to address some of the  recommendations.  Turning to the financial performance of the harbours themselves, the higher level of harbour dues and profit on disposal were the main factors behind the increases in receipts and the surplus on the revenue account.  The accounts also show the substantial increase in capital investment at the harbours with substantial projects at each of the six harbours, the vast majority of which is funded through the Department's Vote.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for their attention and I will try to answer any questions that arise. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gleeson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":215,"content":"<p>The lead speaker today is Deputy Catherine Murphy, who has 20 minutes.

We have trained those procurement officers in proper procedures.  The value of those non-compliant contracts has diminished.  I will return to the Deputy with a figure shortly.<\/p> <p>  We had 38 contracts valued at &euro;5.6 million in 2017 and the reasons for those fell outside the exceptions provided in the procurement rules.  While this is not in any way to excuse this, I assume that the people who involved themselves in those procurements felt that they complied with the exceptions provided for in the circular.  That should not happen.  We now have a system of assessment by a senior officer before any procurement exception is allowed and it is also assessed by the central procurement unit.

The IFA representatives I met stated that they are doing a two or three-year survey of people who have been getting this derogation and that it has emerged that it has no adverse effect on rivers, water levels, wells, etc.  Why is this derogation under review?  Is it with a view to cutting it back, excluding people from obtaining it or bringing it to an end?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#S00600","speaker":"1368"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561017600,"counter":359,"content":"<p>We are involved in a consultation.

There are additional conditions attaching because high-intensity farming needs to be controlled.  All we are saying is that we want to look again at the derogation against the backdrop of all of the information we have, including whatever comes from the IFA, but that we will rely on our own judgment for determining whether any adjustments are required and will have a public consultation about it.

There was a difference of opinion between Ireland and the United Kingdom for many years on where the boundary of the exclusive economic zone fell going north west from Donegal for 200 miles.  The continental shelf and jurisdictions are the business of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and an agreement was reached on the seabed boundary in 1988.  In 2013, there was agreement on the boundary in the water above the seabed.  They are the same single maritime boundary.  The drivers in reaching that agreement were concerns about who had responsibility for maritime pollution incidents and who would respond in different areas.  Some issues arose at the time.  There was also the matter of the development of offshore wind facilities and in which jurisdiction they could be located if consented.  The boundary was set but even when there were two different boundaries in terms of the exclusive economic zone, Rockall was always on the UK side of that boundary.  There was never a point where Rockall was not in the UK EEZ.  The fact that a single boundary was agreed in 2013 and that the continental shelf boundary was agreed in 1988 did not change the Rockall issue.<\/p> <p>  The Rockall issue centres on whether a claim by the UK of sovereignty and its unilateral actions to support that are accepted by the State.  This State, through successive Governments, has never accepted it.  Ireland has never claimed sovereignty of Rockall.  It is a dispute over the UK's creation of sovereignty on that rock and, subsequent to that, the creation of a 12-mile zone that the UK claims for exclusive access around Rockall.  That is not accepted by the State either.  There is detail behind that.  In earlier decades, there was debate as the United Kingdom was seeking to establish a new exclusive economic zone based on Rockall as a starting point, which would have pushed it way out.  The United Kingdom conceded that claim and no longer makes such a claim.  That matter does not arise.  There are other ongoing disputes about the continental shelf involving Denmark, the Faroe Islands and Ireland that are unresolved.  They concern seabed issues.  The 2013 agreement has no relevance to current issues around fisheries rights around Rockall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#T01200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cecil Beamish"},{"type":"speech","time":1561017600,"counter":404,"content":"<p>The fisheries organisations would have a different view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#T01300","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561017600,"counter":405,"content":"<p>No.  The T&aacute;naiste answered a priority parliamentary question on this the day before yesterday put down by Deputy Gallagher.

It is a trade negotiation with Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.  To an extent, we have relied for some of our arguments on the Commission's own cumulative impact assessment of the damage that would be done to the European beef sector.  That is now several years old.  The impact would of course depend on the details of the deal, if there is to be one.  We already have approximately 220,000 tonnes of product coming in from South America under other TRQs and the question is how much more would come in under such a deal, over how long this would be phased, the rate of tariff and the quota management system.  We have consistently argued that if this is going to be done - we do not want it done - the quota division should arise from the fall of the carcass.

We then had a toolbox established by Teagasc, namely a marginal abatement cost curve, that lists actions that might be taken to abate and sequester carbon.

That will involve things like reducing the use of nitrogen-based fertilisers and improved breeding of animals.  The second pillar is sequestration.

The committee will return at 2.30 p.m. for a meeting in private session with Mr. Alan Morgan, former valuer with the OPW.<\/p> <p>  Following on on the matter of farm safety, the annual report states that farms were the largest category of workplace fatalities in Ireland.  There were 24 incidents, of which 14 were people over 65 years.  It was mentioned at a previous meeting - I do not recall if it was with Mr. Gleeson or his predecessor.  While he says it is a matter for the Health and Safety Authority, I make a plea to him, as I did on the last occasion, that someone in the Department take a bit more interest in it.  It might be done through Teagasc or another body.  Now that the economy is picking up, people who might otherwise have been available to work on the farm are gone.  It is grandfathers who are doing all the work now.  I look at my county, and most of the farmers are in their 70s because their sons have gone out to work.  They are trying to do the work and maybe their sons or daughters help out in the evening.  I can envisage this getting worse because more people are working on their own on farms.  Years ago, there would have been two or three people working on a farm, but now it is only one.  People are working alone with big machinery and if something goes wrong with it or an animal does something it is a problem.  I know it is a policy issue but in the interest of people working in rural industry, I ask the Department to take some initiative.  I know Teagasc has done something on it, but more needs to be done.  If there were 24 deaths in the health sector, which is the biggest employer in the country, people would be up in arms, or similarly in the construction sector.  Because the fatalities are so dispersed and are one here or there, it is not as visible.  Mr. Gleeson will get the point I am making.  We need more to be done, and I worry it will get worse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019062000002#AA01800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1561017600,"counter":816,"content":"<p>The Chairman is 100% right.

In summary, the change to the articles is to increase the voting threshold for approval of future capital increases at the IFC.  The Government seeks D&aacute;il approval for this change under Article 29.5.2o of the Constitution as the IFC's Articles of Agreement are an international agreement involving a charge upon public funds.  I will now set out for the committee some background on the IFC and the reasons for this proposed change.<\/p> <p>  IFC is the part of the World Bank which seeks to promote private sector development in developing countries.  It does so by providing loans, investments and advisory services to companies engaged in projects with development impact.  In April 2018, shareholders of the World Bank agreed on a capital increase for the bank.  The agreed financial package includes a $7.5 billion capital increase for IBRD, the World Bank's main lending arm, and a $5.5 billion capital increase for the IFC.  The capital increase for the IFC is a response to the ambition of the sustainable development goals and the increased levels of finance required.  Simply put, the sustainable development goals will not be met through existing domestic resources or traditional overseas aid.  The annual funding gap is estimated to be $2.5 trillion.  It is, therefore, essential to leverage private sector capital to have a realistic chance of achieving the sustainable development goals.  Standing between policymakers and private finance, IFC is well-positioned to bridge this gap and encourage investment in developing countries.  The proposed capital increase has the potential to double IFC investment to $25 billion by 2030.  Under the agreed package, this increased investment will be targeted toward the world's most disadvantaged countries and to address gender equality and climate change.  The capital package also includes reforms to increase efficiencies at the bank.<\/p> <p>  The Government is supportive of the capital increase for the bank which is the largest development actor globally with the scale, expertise and experience to deliver transformative development impact.  The deliverables of the capital increase are closely aligned with Ireland's priorities as articulated in our new development policy, A Better World.  Ireland has the option to take up shares in the IFC under the capital increase which would require a total subscription of $12.6 million over five years.  Our subscription to IFC would count toward the UN target of providing 0.7% of GNP for overseas development assistance.  While we are supportive of the overall capital package, at this stage, a final decision on our take-up of shareholding has not been taken by the Minister for Finance.<\/p> <p>  An essential part of the agreement on the capital package was the proposed amendment to the IFC's Articles of Agreement which we are here today to discuss.  Specifically, this amendment would increase the voting threshold for approval of future capital increases from 80% to 85%.  This change will maintain the veto power of the USA in relation to future capital increases at the IFC.  During negotiations, the USA indicated that while it would not contribute to the capital increase, it would not oppose the increase provided that it did not reduce the USA's voting power below the level at which it could exercise a veto.  This was an essential condition for the final agreement.  The Office of the Attorney General has advised that the proposed change requires D&aacute;il approval.  This is in line with Article 29.5.2o of the Constitution which outlines that the State will not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge on public funds unless the terms of the agreement, including any amendments, have been approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  To be clear, the proposed amendment to the IFC's articles does not in itself result in any new immediate charge upon public funds.  However, as the amendment will ultimately create a charge on public funds, the Government is seeking D&aacute;il approval.  A D&aacute;il resolution to approve the proposed change to the IFC's Articles of Agreement will allow Ireland to vote in favour of the amendment.  This will assist in paving the way for the IFC to complete this capital increase and allow it to progress its important mission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2019062000002#B00300","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1560985200,"counter":871,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his opening statement.

When I was elected, I promised the people in my constituency that I would try to address their needs in the Oireachtas.  The issue of depopulation in the north west is a long-term and insidious blight on my county of Leitrim and other parts of the region.  There are many reasons for this.  We need jobs, infrastructure and transport, but we also need to fight to hold onto what we have.  This Bill is designed to tackle the situation of young families who want to stay in rural Ireland not being able to get planning permission to build homes there.  The problem lies in the nature of the soil in parts of the region and in parts of the south west and other parts of the country.  It is particularly bad in Leitrim and west Cavan where the soil is very dense.  In these areas, the current code of practice of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has virtually halted construction of one-off dwelling houses in areas of heavy soil.  The nature of the soil is such that the standard T-test, the percolation test, will not be passed.  According to the EPA code of practice, there must be zero discharge of effluent, regardless of the efficiency of the wastewater treatment systems.  The achievement of zero discharge is impossible in these areas and, particularly, in the Irish climate but it is possible in this day and age to install a system which will mean that the wastewater produced will be bathing water standard.<\/p><p>This amendment to the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977 will allow the Minister to design and regulate a discharge licence which would be issued by local authorities for one-off houses where the percolation test fails.  The Government has acknowledged that rural Ireland needs rehabilitation after years of neglect and austerity.  In my own area, I can instance dozens of young families who, for the refusal of planning permission, have not been able to settle in their home place where they wanted to live for the rest of their lives.  If discharge licences of this nature are granted in an appropriate and proportionate way, there is no danger to the environment from this amendment.  I truly believe that this is a good move for rural Ireland and I propose this amendment in that spirit. <\/p><p>Refusal of planning permissions has been a problem in Leitrim for many years, including prior to the introduction of the EPA code of practice.  The council has tried to develop alternative guidelines.  Over the past 20 years, in almost all places where planning permission was sought mechanical treatment systems had to be used.  Usually, they had to go to a percolation area where there was imported top soil or to a raised percolation.  The council was trying to address this problem long before the stringent code of practice came into effect.<\/p><p>A lot of people in rural areas are conscious of the mindset that houses in clusters are good and one-off houses are bad - once described to me as the <i>Animal Farm<\/i>type mindset that all two legs are bad and all four legs are good.  That kind of mindset does not recognise the reality of the world we live in.  It is a closed mindset that we need to open up.  There are hundreds of parishes around the country where there are no towns and people living in isolated rural communities.  In my own parish of Aughavas in County Leitrim there are 600 people living in houses scattered around the countryside.  There is no town or village but there is a small three-teacher school.  For the past ten years, practically no new houses have been built in the community.  There are at least a dozen young people who would like to live in the area but they cannot get planning permission to build.  The aforementioned school will become a two-teacher school next September and will, probably, close within the next ten years.  The situation is similar in all the small rural areas in County Leitrim, including Drumreilly and Gortletteragh.  The response is often that those who want to live in these areas should live in the town.  The nearest town is seven or eight miles away.  People are living in rural communities because it is where they want to live.  In terms of where I live, on leaving the main road, my house is the first house on the left-hand side of the L1511.  There are 2 km between my house and the main road.  There are a couple of hundred metres between my house and the next house.  This is not about wanting to have houses close to each other, cluster developments, ribbon developments or over-development.  Where that is proposed, appropriate planning is necessary.  <\/p><p>In regard to the EPA guidelines, where problems arose in the past with heavy soils, Leitrim County Council and other councils developed other means of addressing them.  I have come across many situations in west Cavan and Leitrim where people got planning permission having put in place reed bed systems to deal with the effluent, which was a natural way of addressing the problem.  Willow beds can also be used.  Willow trees are planted and as the sewage comes through from the septic tank the evaporation from the willows soaks up and deals with all of the nutrients.  This is a very effective way of dealing with the problem.  Mechanical treatment systems have been used in many cases.  Most of them do an excellent job as well.<\/p><p>At the time the EPA guidelines came into effect I was on Leitrim County Council.  The general view was that they would lead to practically nobody in the rural areas getting planning permission.  I think it was former Senator Paschal Mooney who organised a trip of representatives of the council to Leinster House for a meeting with representatives of the EPA and the Department who told us that what happened was an unintended consequence, that they had not foreseen that this would happen and that they would try to find a solution.  Since then, Leitrim County Council and other councils around the country and the EPA have undertaken studies on how to achieve zero discharge.  One of those studies is research No. 161 by Laurence Gill, which outlines the examination process in regard to the systems.  I have a copy of the main findings of the study, which I can provide to members after this meeting, but I would like to go through a couple of them now.  The study examined the evapotranspiration, ET, system.<\/p><p>In such systems, when a septic tank is installed, the percolation area becomes a shallow bed.  A large area in the garden is dug out, an impermeable plastic layer is inserted and the hole is refilled with soil.  The willows are planted and given a year to start to grow before the effluent is added to the bottom of the system.  The system works very well.  In the research paper's conclusions, it is shown that the system of using willow trees is unlikely to act as a zero-discharge system.  The problem is the zero discharge, but why?  The requirement for zero discharge was put in place to achieve zero effect.  We want zero effect that has no impact on the environment.  As is stated in the conclusion of the report, the evapotranspiration or ET system promotes excellent pollutant attenuation, significantly reduces the net discharge to the environment and, therefore, should be considered a viable passive treatment.  The conclusion also states it would require a change to the current consent procedures to allow for such a controlled discharge to surface water.  The conclusion of  the EPA's report states the willow ET system produces an effluent of similar quality to the effluent from a system with no sewage discharge entering it.  The EPA found the system had zero effect.  If that is the case, we need to examine why we have a zero-discharge rule.<br\/><br\/>It was in that context I presented the Bill.  In fairness, Leitrim County Council has since done more work on the ET system and continues to do so.  It has a pilot scheme in place to try to minimise the rainfall entering the system.  It found that it could achieve zero discharge for most of the year except in winter, when there was heavy rainfall, although it was mostly rain escaping rather than any pollutant effluent.  The council is considering building willow beds and sloping it off in order that as little rain as possible can enter, to try to achieve zero discharge.  My argument, which I consider logical, is that if there is zero effect, it will have the same impact as zero discharge.  If one takes water from the river, puts it in a 40-gallon barrel, keeps it until night-time and returns the water to the river, it will have a zero effect on the river, which is exactly what the Bill provides for.  There will be a zero effect.<br\/><br\/>I acknowledge that the Department has raised some issues with the Bill, which I examined.  One such issue is that it appears that the local authority must issue a licence under section 4.  I cannot find the word &quot;must&quot; anywhere in the Bill.  Rather, it states, &quot;Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing nothing in this section shall prevent a water services authority from granting a waste water discharge licence [...]&quot;  That there is nothing to prevent a water services authority from granting a licence does not mean that it must.  Similarly, the Bill provides that the Minister &quot;shall&quot; introduce regulations to provide for the application for a wastewater treatment licence.  He shall introduce regulations to do it but will not insist that it must happen.  It will happen only when a person or agent applies for a licence and meets the standards required.<br\/><br\/>The Bill further states: &quot;The Minister may introduce such regulations as are necessary, incidental, supplementary or consequential for the purposes of giving effect to this section.&quot;  This new section - section 13 - will do nothing to affect any of the other sections in the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1997, and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  The present system of issuing a discharge licence is in place specifically for cases where there is a large number of houses or an industrial-type unit, which is fine.  Provision needs to be made, however, for a different type of licence for single houses where a system is in place that will ensure zero effect and allow for minimal discharge.  That is what we want to achieve.  Others, such as the EPA and many of the local authorities, are working in a similar vein to try to do so but the sole obstacle in the way is the issue of zero discharge.<br\/><br\/>If we wanted, we could try to change the code of practice but doing so is difficult, which I understand because an application has been lodged with the European Commission.  The code of practice states that if a house fails to pass the T-test, it must have zero discharge or a discharge licence.  My Bill will put in effect a means of granting a small discharge licence to deal with that in an appropriate way where all other planning requirements are already met, and assessing how a zero impact on the environment can be achieved, such as with the type of ET system developed by the local authorities in co-operation with the EPA.  <br\/><br\/>I welcome any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019062000002#E00300","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1560985200,"counter":891,"content":"<p>Deputy Pat Casey took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1560985200,"counter":892,"content":"<p>I will support the Bill because I support putting some system in place to address the issue.

Rural people from certain areas cannot obtain planning permission because of the current situation.  We should most sincerely try to bring in a system where people can be allowed to live in their own areas.  In farming communities, when young farmers take over family farms and so on, they cannot build on their own land.  Deputy Martin Kenny's proposal is reasonable.

I accept that the matter has persisted for some time and it is a big issue in many places.  We should try to do whatever we can to facilitate the families affected.

One of its objectives was to achieve a zero discharge.  That was its logic.  It found that, as of yet, it was virtually impossible to achieve a zero discharge, mainly because of rainfall rather than effluent entering it.  In a standard house, less than 1,000 l of wastewater enters the system every day.  TCD found that does not have an impact and was being addressed.  The addition of rainfall, however, caused the problem.<\/p><p>The research paper states that the system was acting as excellent pollutant containment even if it could not fully achieve a zero discharge system on an annual basis.  It cannot operate at a level of zero discharge but it can achieve a zero impact.  That is the point I am making.  The amount of water leaving was equal to the amount of water coming from a system that had not been fed any effluent.  If the testers took samples from the run-off from the concrete yard at the back of the house and from the effluent that went through the evapotranspiration system, they were equal.  There was an equal loading of phosphates and they were well within any standard.  I know of an evapotranspiration system in a house outside Mohill near Loch Rynn Castle Estate.  I know the old man there well.  He said now and again the testers come and take tests.  He got them to call him back.  He said the man who called him back after carrying out the tests told him that the water was similar to bathing water standard.<\/p><p> The zero effect is what we need to achieve.  All of us want that.  No one wants to pollute or destroy our environment.  We understand that the water in our rivers and lakes often ends up in our taps because it goes back through the system.  We want to ensure that we have a zero effect.  The natural systems involving the growth of willow or reed beds are best in dealing with these situations.  This is the key question.  Are we able to do it right every time?  Are we able to ensure that we can come up with a system that will work at every site correctly?  Can that be monitored and checked?  Is it affordable?  That research is now being done, but when the research is done we come back to the problem at the end of it.  In fairness, the Environmental Protection Agency said at the time that unintended consequences can arise and that zero discharge blocks even that.<\/p><p> Let us suppose we had a system that produced potable water, and it was only letting out 1 litre per day.  Given the rigidity of the system we have at the moment, we are not allowed to discharge that water.  That is a ridiculous situation in any context.  Really, we need to work with the EPA, Trinity College, Laurence Gill and the others who have done this research to ensure we can come up with a system.  Everyone involved in the process to date is confident that a system can be found that would have zero impact but it will not have zero discharge.  It will have a certain level of discharge mainly due to rainfall.  Once we achieve that, we come back to the problem of the zero discharge rule.  The way to get over the zero discharge rule is to put a small licence in place that a local authority can issue.  That is how to solve the problem.  That is what the Bill intends to do.  Of course, if people in the Department have particular issues that they would like to see resolved, I am open to hearing about it.  Sensible amendments can come from anywhere.  We are not all geniuses in this situation.  We all know that there may be unintended consequences somewhere that we do not see but we can find a way to overcome all of those.

I will make some comments.  I come from a rural area myself.  Having dealt with one-off rural housing for the past 15 years I know that it is probably one of the most frustrating processes any family can go through.  Not only do they have to deal with qualification rulings, location details and the visual impact that a house might have on the area, they also have to deal with traffic regulations and the increase in traffic from one-off rural housing.  Now, there is the question of effluent discharge raised by Deputy Kenny today.  In my county of Wicklow there are areas where there are complications but we seem to be able to get over them by raising the bed and importing a different soil type.  Deputy Kenny referred to areas in Cavan with similar heavy soils getting planning permission for one-off rural housing.  Was that based on reed beds or willow beds?  If it is a similar situation, how can the local authority in Cavan grant permission?

That is what we find in much of County Leitrim.  In west Cavan we have a similar situation, but west Cavan has considerable mountainous areas and we do not have as many planning applications, although we have some.  It is equally difficult for people to get planning in some parts of west Cavan.  There is a similar situation in some parts of Sligo and Donegal.  In counties where a lower percentage of the soil is heavy, people have more options to find land that has good enough absorption for building a house.  A person could have 40 acres but maybe only an area of three acres has suitable soil.  That is where the person will build the house.

If I go down through Dromod towards Carrick-on-Shannon there is reasonably good land there where the odd person will get planning permission.  It can be difficult even there.  Anyway, in most of County Leitrim it is difficult.  People do not seek planning because they have been told in the pre-planning meeting that they do not have a chance.  That has created a backlog.  If we had a situation in my parish where people could get planning, there would probably be eight or ten houses that people would like to build.  In the entire county there might be 40 houses.  Then, that number would quickly go back down to ten or 12 per year.  We are not talking about vast numbers of houses.  The numbers are small but the fact that these small numbers of houses are not being built is having a detrimental impact on the rural community.  Part of our environment is our people.  If we starve our rural communities of people then we run into a major problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019062000002#G00500","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1560985200,"counter":902,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Kenny for attending today and engaging with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019062000002#G00600","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1560985200,"counter":903,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 10.35 a.m. and resumed at 10.40 a.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Scrutiny of the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Bill 2018","time":1560985200,"counter":904,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019062000002#H00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1560985200,"counter":905,"content":"<p>We are now in public session.

For new builds, site characterisation must be carried out in accordance with the EPA code of practice for wastewater treatment and disposal systems serving single houses 2009.  In regard to this code of practice particular attention is drawn to the provision that where the T-test is in excess of 90 then the site is unsuitable for discharge of treated effluent to the ground. <\/p> <p>  In County Leitrim, the landscape is characterised by drumlins which contain high clay content.  Unfortunately, due to the underlying nature of the sub-soils which are present across the majority of our county, estimated at 87% of our soils, the soil percolation tests fail to meet the acceptable percolation rates required to comply with the EPA code of practice and the sites are deemed unsuitable for discharge of treated wastewater or effluent to the ground. <\/p> <p>  This is proving to be a significant impediment to the granting of planning permission for individual dwellings in the countryside by Leitrim County Council's planning authority and indeed is preventing many prospective applicants making applications in the first instance as agents are aware that the subject sites will be deemed unsuitable once the soil percolation tests are undertaken.  This situation is not unique to County Leitrim but no county is affected to the same extent as County Leitrim. <\/p> <p>  The number of planning permissions granted for individual houses reliant on individual wastewater treatment systems is set out in a table which I have supplied to the committee with a copy of this statement.  It ranges from four in 2017 to 13 in 2018.  The figures in preceding years from 2012 are similar.  <\/p> <p>  Leitrim is a sparsely populated county with the 2016 census showing a population of 32,044.  The county is highly rural in nature with the vast majority of the population living in a non-urban environment.  This profile of the county represents the history and culture of Leitrim with a high proportion of small family farms.  In the context of this fabric the imposition of the percolation standards through the 2009 code of practice has had what the council believes to be unintended consequences.  These consequences are most acutely felt in the small farm holding scenario where, despite many acres of land being available, the farmer's offspring, son or daughter, who may wish to establish their home on the family farm to continue to farm the land and be of support to their aging parents, will fail to secure planning permission.  The compounding effect of these restrictions for almost ten years is a contributing factor to the continued depopulation of areas of rural County Leitrim which will have a corresponding effect on the sustainability of the surrounding community and its facilities and services such as primary schools etc.<\/p> <p>  In this regard Leitrim County Council, while maintaining a responsible attitude to the protection of the environment, as is required by law, set about identifying options that could be explored to provide a wastewater treatment system solution that would be suitable, acceptable and affordable.  In addition, the council has at all times maintained a responsible attitude through its county development plan to rural planning with a variety of policies that ensure the appropriate establishment of one-off rural housing in Leitrim and would not see the restrictions of the code of practice as necessary or relevant from a rural planning control tool perspective.<\/p> <p>  The existing EPA code of practice is under review with a new document expected to be published in the next couple of months.  It is anticipated that the review of the code of practice may widen slightly the acceptable parameters of percolation rates which will result in a limited number of marginal sites in County Leitrim now becoming acceptable for discharge of treated effluent to ground but, as only marginal in nature, it is felt that the Council must continue to pursue these alternative solutions.<\/p> <p>  Leitrim County Council has been pursuing innovative solutions to facilitate the design of a wastewater treatment and disposal facility that would be suitable in the poor draining soils.  Through this process the council identified a treatment solution that has the potential to have a zero discharge or near-zero discharge of effluent and, if successful, would allow sites with poor percolation characteristics to treat the discharge of wastewater in a manner which was not prejudicial to public health or the protection of the environment.  The nature of the wastewater treatment system is a willow-based system constructed within a sealed soil basin.  The council has engaged with Dr. Laurence Gill, a professor in environmental engineering in the school of engineering, Trinity College Dublin as academic support to the process.  Dr. Gill has extensive experience in assessing the operation of individual wastewater treatment systems and was co-author of the EPA publication that Deputy Kenny mentioned earlier.<\/p> <p>  The willow evapo-transpiration system consists of a sealed basin that has been refilled with the original soil excavated on site in order to install an impermeable liner and distribution pipe network, which has then been planted with willow cuttings.  The system receives wastewater effluent fed to the base of the basin and treated and removed via evapo-transpiration, primarily during the growing season when the willow trees have high water demand but it also occurs on a limited basis all year round.  Results from 12 trial systems to date have shown that the system provides excellent pollutant attenuation greatly reducing organic, nutrient and indicator bacteria.  Through the most recent design concepts the level of rainfall entering the system will be significantly reduced if not eliminated thus ensuring minimal if any overflow from the system and if such were to happen tests available already show the characteristics of such escaped liquid to be similar to ground run-off.<\/p> <p>  Currently the water pollution legislation provides for discharges to ground and surface waters.  In regard to domestic waste water treatment systems there is an exemption for discharge to ground where the quantity to be discharged is less than 5 m3 per day.  However, a discharge to surface waters can only occur under licence from the local authority.  As a consequence a detailed application process is required in order to comply with the legislative requirements.  The application process is lengthy and requires significant data collection on the identified receiving waters such as all year round flows and assimilation capacity along with a rigorous monitoring regime thereafter in regard to items such as ongoing sampling analysis, inspection chambers, record keeping and licence renewal processes.  This system of licensing discharges is more designed to deal with matters such as industrial by-products rather than domestic waste water treatment systems.<\/p> <p>  A pilot scheme is currently proposed in Leitrim to further test the willow system for zero discharge, that there is no discharge or escape of effluent from the willow plantation basin at any time based on a more refined design taking learning from the trials to date.  However, on other trials to date in Ireland the objective of zero discharge from the system has not been fully realised.  In addition to that detailed earlier in regard to attenuation what is also known is that the willow system does deliver a significantly reduced level of effluent discharge, with discharge only in winter months.<\/p> <p>  Taking into account the research already available what is now required is a means to dispose of the limited, if any, resulting discharge proven to be primarily arising from rainfall.  The option for this discharge is to proceed to surface discharge only, given that the ground conditions on the subject site prevents discharge to ground.  Given the proven reduced scale of effluent, its proven standard and the fact that the discharge arises during the wetter times of the year, there is a case for the development, in the context of output from these systems, for a less rigorous regulatory regime that is both appropriate and proportionate and which would therefore move away from the rigours of the current authorisation process for discharge to surface waters.<\/p><p>This reformed regulatory process can be limited to provide only for installations meeting certain design standards based on the experience of the willow systems to date, for example.  The data available also provides the basis for both design guidelines for the system and design parameters for this discharge, particularly in regard to volumes, effluent standard, and so on.<\/p><p> Through the work carried out nationally to date, along with the work of Leitrim County Council, there is now an immediate opportunity to address the unintended consequences of the provisions of the code of practice of 2009 in regard to sites of low permeability.  This opportunity relates to the use of the domestic wastewater evapotranspiration treatment system, coupled with the requested regulatory reform under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977.  This would provide a clear option for the provision of a new rural dwelling where the housing need to be accommodated in rural Leitrim is of an absolute requirement, which in turn could be of general application in areas of the country with similar soil conditions.  The pilot scheme in Leitrim will continue to pursue the objective of zero discharge, which would be the ultimate preferred outcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019062000002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joseph Gilhooly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560985200,"counter":908,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I am joined by my colleagues from the EPA&rsquo;s Office of Environmental Enforcement, OEE, Mr. Darragh Page and Mr. Noel Byrne.<\/p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, the EPA is an independent statutory body established under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  Our organisational vision is to protect and improve the environment as a valuable asset for the people of Ireland, and also to protect our people and the environment from the harmful effects of radiation and pollution.  To that end, the EPA performs a number of functions that are particularly pertinent to the current discussions, including monitoring the quality of the Irish environment, in particular the quality of our water courses.  We are responsible for the development of the national inspection plan for domestic wastewater treatment systems, and the co-ordination and reporting on the implementation of that plan.  We develop and maintain a code of practice on wastewater treatment and disposal systems serving single houses, as mentioned by previous speakers.<\/p> <p>  With regard to water quality, I would highlight a number of troubling findings in recent EPA reports that are relevant to our discussions.  Water quality in Irish waters has deteriorated, with a net overall decline of 3% in good water quality between 2015 and 2017.  Long-term loss of high-quality river sites is continuing, with a further 0.6% decline since 2015.  The EPA groundwater national monitoring programme found that 43% of groundwater monitoring wells were contaminated with faecal coliforms in 2017.  These findings illustrate the vulnerability of our ground waters, which provide much of our drinking water in rural Ireland, as well as the vulnerability of our surface waters, where we are failing to arrest the continued decline in quality.  These are priority, shared challenges in terms of human health protection and environmental protection.<\/p> <p>  The Water Services Act 2007, as amended, and associated regulations, among other things, provide for inspections of domestic wastewater treatment systems by water services authorities.  The EPA is responsible for preparing the national inspection plan, which specifies the minimum number of inspections across the country for each local authority area.  Inspections target areas where there is the greatest potential for improving water quality and improving the protection of human health.  The EPA reports regularly on the implementation of the plan and the report for the 2017-18 period, due for publication shortly, will show the following: almost half of the domestic wastewater treatment systems inspected in the reporting period failed the inspection, which is consistent with previous years and shows persistent problems with existing systems; failures are due to system construction defects and systems not being maintained and cleaned properly; over one quarter of systems were found to be causing a risk to the environment or human health; and almost one third of systems that failed during the 2013-18 period are still not fixed, with many of those unresolved for more than one year.<\/p> <p>  Domestic wastewater treatment systems are a risk to human health and the environment if they are not constructed and maintained properly.  They can contaminate a householder&rsquo;s drinking water well or their neighbour&rsquo;s well.  In this context, it should be noted that Ireland has the highest rate of VTEC infection in the EU, with over 1,100 cases in 2018.  One possible source of this infection is contaminated drinking water from private wells.<\/p> <p>  The EPA published the code of practice on wastewater treatment and disposal systems serving single houses in 2009.  The code is referenced throughout technical guidance document H on drainage and wastewater disposal developed under the building regulations.  The purpose of the code is to ensure that domestic wastewater treatment systems are constructed and maintained properly so they do not contaminate groundwater and surface waters and endanger people&rsquo;s health.  Essentially, the code sets out how to determine if a site is suitable for the installation of a treatment system and the standards necessary for the construction and maintenance of the system, providing several construction options, depending on the site constraints and householder requirements.<\/p> <p>  The current code was published over a decade ago and the EPA is cognisant of the importance of ensuring that national guidelines reflect available and emerging technologies and techniques.  To that end, research funded by the EPA was recently conducted through a collaboration between researchers at Trinity College Dublin, National University of Ireland Galway and National University of Ireland Maynooth to examine further domestic wastewater treatment options in areas of low permeability soils.  This research identified two new technologies - low pressure pipe and drip dispersal systems - which can operate in low permeability soils, increasing the percolation limits and, hence, providing greater flexibility for householders and planners.<\/p> <p>  These new technologies and the associated increase in the percolation limits are incorporated in the draft revised code which was published in December 2018 for three months of consultation.  During the consultation period, 36 submissions were received, including almost 500 individual comments on the code.  The code revision process is being overseen by a steering committee which is currently considering the submissions, with a view to finalising the revised code by end of the year.  The steering committee is comprised of representatives of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and local authorities, as well as industry and the research community.<\/p> <p>  The code of practice represents the best available technical and scientific knowledge for domestic wastewater treatment systems.  For homeowners, it provides the assurance of having their site assessed to a proper standard and that the system chosen will operate satisfactorily in the long term, protecting their health, the health of their neighbours and the environment.  I assure the committee that the EPA will continue to work closely with local authorities, Departments and others to assist in the assessment of possible solutions and strategies in this area, and to support further research where that is identified, with the primary objective of ensuring the protection of people's health and the environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019062000002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1560985200,"counter":910,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I am joined by my colleague, Mr. David Flynn, principal adviser.  By way of preliminary comment, the Department understands and appreciates the intent behind the Private Members&rsquo; Bill, that is, to make possible and facilitate the choice of those who wish to live in rural communities outside cities, towns and villages.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the rationale behind the Bill, the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, last week organised a meeting with Deputy Martin Kenny and a delegation of public representatives and officials from Leitrim County Council to discuss the particular challenges of providing domestic wastewater treatment systems in Leitrim.<\/p><p>As we heard this morning, Leitrim County Council, with the support of the EPA, has been working with Trinity College to investigate treatment systems that use willow beds.  The Department agreed at the meeting last week to follow up with a more detailed technical engagement with the county council and the EPA to explore how a pilot project could be supported.  The Department also noted that there was unanimity at the meeting regarding any solutions which may be developed and which do not give rise to a threat to human health and the environment.  That is in line with the current general statutory requirement not to allow the deterioration of the chemical or ecological status of bodies of water bodies, such as rivers, lakes, estuaries and coastal waters, and groundwater.  The imperative to maintain good water quality is the right thing to do in any event in to manage risk and for the protection of human health.<br\/><br\/>The Bill seeks to make it easier to issue discharge licences under the Water Pollution Acts in cases where EPA-approved domestic wastewater treatment systems would not be adequate.  However, as set out in the Department's letter to the committee, the Department is concerned that the Bill does not contain adequate safeguards to ensure Irish law is compliant with the EU water framework directive or would not give rise to potential significant threat to the environment and public health.<br\/><br\/>Ireland has high dependence on individual wastewater treatment systems.  We have already been found guilty by the Court of Justice of the European Union of failure to put in place adequate safeguards for the environmental performance of these systems.  The inspection regime and the current plans the Department has put in place are in response to that judgment.  In 2012, the court found that Ireland had failed take the necessary measures to ensure that waste is recovered or disposed of without endangering human health and without processes or methods that could harm the environment.  The judgment led to financial penalties of &euro;2.76 million and had implications for 440,000 wastewater treatment systems serving single houses.  As a result, the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012 introduced registration and inspection arrangements for domestic wastewater treatment systems.  I am highlighting this because the Bill before us seeks to amend section 4 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977 to provide for the granting of discharge licences to surface water in order to allow for the development of single houses.<br\/><br\/>We have some experience, primarily in Wexford, where the local authority used discharge licences to facilitate house construction in the 2000s.  The difficulties encountered by householders in managing licensed discharges to surface waters included the technical challenges of managing wastewater treatment systems and achieving the required effluent standard.  Where difficulties were encountered, such as the malfunctioning of the domestic wastewater treatment system causing pollution to the receiving waters, significant local issues arose, including public health concerns, the use of water for livestock drinking and problems with foul odours.  The majority of these licences have had to be revoked at considerable cost to householders.<br\/><br\/>Since 2009, Wexford County Council has worked in collaboration with householders to find sustainable solutions to minimise the impact of these legacy systems.  In many cases, householders requested that licences be terminated because of the difficulties they have encountered in managing the systems.  In these instances, alternative solutions not involving direct discharges to receiving waters have been developed in consultation with Wexford County Council.  In most cases, the alternative solutions placed a significant additional financial burden on householders.<br\/><br\/>It is also important to note, as we heard from the EPA, that there are reliable and sustainable technical solutions available to those building new houses under the current regulatory framework for domestic wastewater treatment systems.  In addition to septic tanks, the feasibility of using alternative treatment systems for low permeability soils, such as low pressure pipe and drip dispersal systems, has been researched.  In the context of the new guidelines the EPA is developing such alternatives may be permissible for some areas that may have previously failed percolation tests and are unable to support percolation areas.<br\/><br\/>From an environmental perspective, the proposal in the Bill, as drafted, would pose a significant risk to the water quality in the receiving rivers, lakes and estuarine waters in rural areas.  This is because discharges of septic tank effluents directly to surface waters generally pose a higher risk to water quality than discharging to groundwater via a septic tank percolation area.  The percolation area which domestic treatment systems use is a vital component in treating and reducing the pollutant load of the wastewater effluent.  Making it easier to license less safe effluent discharge options is likely to pose unacceptable risks.<br\/><br\/>Effluent discharging to surface waters from domestic-scale wastewater treatment systems poses a significant risk to the water quality in the receiving waters.  The consequence is likely to be degraded quality in receiving waters, which would be contrary to our legal obligations, with all the attendant increased risks to human health.  In particular, section 4(13)(<i>a<\/i>) appears to suggest that a local authority must issue a licence under section 4 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977 regardless of whether the discharge would cause deterioration in water quality and would be contrary to any existing water policy and associated water quality standards and objectives.  I heard Deputy Martin Kenny's comment on whether that was a necessity.  The Department considers that it opens up an unacceptable risk.  It would leave a local authority exposed to the risk of legal action for breaching its duty under a number of legislative provisions intended to protect human health and the environment.  For all the foregoing reasons, the Department has significant concerns about the Bill, but we would be happy to explore these in more detail with the committee.  In light of the conversations at the meeting last week, the positive attitude adopted by Leitrim County Council and the new guidelines being developed by the EPA, it seems there are opportunities to come at this issue and the particular problem facing County Leitrim in a different way that could help the situation without the need for the blunt instrument of legislation that could cause more problems than it would solve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019062000002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Feargal &Oacute; Coigligh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560985200,"counter":913,"content":"<p>My thanks to our three guests.  This committee takes its responsibilities seriously when it comes to issues of water quality.  The representatives from the EPA and the Department will know that we have spent considerable time scrutinising the important report on wastewater treatment, the risk arising from treatment plants and the risk on the private side which the agency publishes annually.  When we look at this legislation, we are looking at it through not only the lens of trying to facilitate people to live in the communities into which they were born but also to keep focus on maintaining high-quality water systems.  That is certainly my focus.<\/p><p>The challenge is to try to find a way of ensuring that, where in all other instances a planning applicant would otherwise get planning permission but for this issue, there is some way of solving this problem that does not in any way compromise the quality of our water system.  That is the challenge that Deputy Martin Kenny set himself and it is what we are discussing today.  I have three questions, one of each of our guests, that focus around this key challenge.  If we can fix that, then we have a solution that meets the interests of everyone here, guests and members alike.<\/p><p>My first question is for Dr. Ryan.  Deputy Martin Kenny made the case that it is possible to have a zero effect even if we have zero discharge.  I am interested in hearing the EPA's view on that.  To what extent is it possible?  To what extent does natural technology, such as that incorporating reed and willow beds and as outlined by Deputy Martin Kenny and Mr. Gilhooly, allow us to move towards that?  If we are not there 100%, can the EPA offer a view on how long it might take for such systems to achieve that?<\/p><p>I understand what Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh stated but section 4(13)(<i>b<\/i>) empowers the Minister to make regulations for the purposes of the granting of these licences.  Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh said that this is a blunt instrument.  Yet, even if the legislation were to pass, the ball would then fall into the court of the Department and Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh, who is the lead person to advise the Minister on how to draft such regulations.  I would never accuse Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh of being blunt in his work with the Department so I imagine he could find a way to craft the regulations in such a way as to meet our legal obligations and protect water resources.  Will Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh respond to that?  Surely regulations give the Minister a level of control and nuance for something important like this.<\/p><p> Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh mentioned two new technologies that are coming onstream that should allow the possibility of this problem being overcome in dense soil areas.  Can the witnesses tell me whether the two technologies would be much use in County Leitrim where a large section of the county has failed the percolation tests?  Please tell us a little more about the other work done to develop technologies that would meet planning and water quality requirements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019062000002#K00200","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560985200,"counter":915,"content":"<p>I propose that we start with Dr. Ryan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019062000002#L00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560985200,"counter":916,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin for his question.  I will refer to the current technologies for treating domestic wastewater and those that are incorporated into the revised code that we have just consulted on that allow greater flexibility in areas of low permeability soil.  Once one goes above a certain soil permeability level where the soil is compacted there is nowhere for effluent water to be discharged.  Therefore, dangerous pathogens and E. coli accumulate on the property in ponds and gives rise to significant health risks for the people in the dwelling, the children, the neighbours and water in wells.  That is the difficulty with low permeability soils.  The code extends flexibility because of the new technologies.  Therefore, we can push the limit somewhat and, as has been signalled, that may allow some permissions to be granted in the right circumstances.  Planners will consider that.<\/p> <p>  Looking to the future, the willow bed evapo-transpiration systems are promising.  We have been happy to support the research but more work needs to be done.  For certain elements of the discharge willow beds are quite effective but it does not allow for zero discharge.  That means there are some liquids.  More important, it also means that the system is not quite effective at removing the more hazardous pathogens, in particular E. coli.  It is not a case that there is no impact.  There could be a significant impact with the accumulation of residual waters with E. coli.  The technology looks promising because it is effective at removing some of the other elements but this is a stumbling block worthy of pursuing further research.  In terms of a timeframe for research, it could take a couple of seasons to establish but there are ideas being contemplated as to how these systems might be more effective.  It is an area that is well worth pursuing and the EPA would be happy to support such work. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019062000002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom Ryan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560985200,"counter":917,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Broin has put his finger on the nub of the Bill.

We are no longer allowed to legislate saying that the Minister can just go away and make regulations on anything.  That has been found out.  We need to be clear in this piece of legislation regarding what the regulations will cover and what is the framework within which the regulations operate.

That would be the context in which regulations are developed.  <\/p> <p>  The regulations would then bring us to a point where the Minister would probably pass the EPA without developing the relevant standards to ensure that discharges do not impact on our health and environment.  That brings us back to where we are now, which is codes of practice and regulatory regimes that are designed to ensure that health and the environment are not impacted.  I suspect we could do a huge amount of work and spend a huge amount of time on legislating but that would not actually bring us any further than what the current legal position is.  What we suggested when we met last week was to have greater technical discussions between the county council, ourselves and the EPA and see where that brings us.  If those discussions find that legislative or regulatory tweaks are required then that could inform how we would approach the matter in the future.  There could be tweaks within the existing code without the need for new legislation.  <\/p> <p>  Indeed, as we see, even within the current regime as Dr. Ryan outlined, the EPA is already, through the new guidelines that are being developed, allowing for new technologies that will give greater scope.  That is a slightly convoluted answer to say that by the time we go through a significant legislation process we may not actually progress the issue a huge amount whereas if we, the EPA and the county council work closely through guidelines we may help to resolve issues in some of these areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019062000002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Feargal &Oacute; Coigligh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560985200,"counter":918,"content":"<p>I am familiar with the amendments in the draft code of practice that was published and referred to earlier in terms of the technology around the drip dispersal system and the low pressure piping system.  The Deputy must take into account that there is an acute problem with soils in County Leitrim.  One does not have many borderline cases - one is either okay or far from okay.  Allowing for the new systems that have been suggested in the draft code, if it is approved, and the changes in the level of the T-test that would arise, because those systems would allow a higher T-test to be acceptable, we would be of the view that that would have a very limited positive impact on the county because of the soil types we have.   It does not really matter if one has a T-test of 90, 110, 120 or 130.  The new technologies are those that can handle the system and allow for a higher level of T-test.  As alluded to earlier, there are situations where one is successful and data shows we are granting one-off houses in a very limited number of areas.  We would welcome any positive adjustment to the code of practice.  It is not that we are negative towards it; we would welcome it and be delighted to see it coming.  However, it would not be a solution sufficient to the degree of need that exists in County Leitrim.<\/p> <p>  In terms of where we are at with our work at the moment and going forward, I am familiar with the space in so far as I was assigned to the planning department as director in September 2010 and this issue was the first thing on my desk when I arrived.  I had a period of learning and coming up to speed with what was happening and what options did and did not exist.  We worked our way through that from both official and political perspectives and reached a point in 2012 and 2013 where we started to consider piloting various options.  We considered what was out there that could work and then we piloted them in the context of County Leitrim and Ireland, if one considers this internationally.  That work has been ongoing and we have accumulated a certain level of knowledge and understanding.  I have been with this process since then and believe we are on the cusp of making some progress.  I am very much encouraged by the meeting that we had recently with my colleagues here from the Department and the EPA, all of whom have emphasised their willingness to work closely with us to assist in coming up with strategies to deploy the options.  Examining ways to work collaboratively is very important to us.<\/p><p>We have worked in isolation for a good while, and I do not mean this negatively, but we had a sense that we would go ahead, do some work, pilot something, get research, and then, when we had all our papers together, we would arrive at the door of the Department or the EPA with all this done, asking if we could try to find some way of implementing it on a more general application basis.  We have the opportunity here to cut that stage out, so that we might move forward collaboratively and collectively from next week when we intend to meet on this.  We would no longer be using a two-pronged approach, whereby, having done a certain level of research, we set about establishing something we think works, compile our reports, and then have to go into sales mode to get the success of the information and research we have done across to others.  If we do that together, we can save a lot of time.<\/p><p> We are encouraged by the work we have been doing with Trinity College on what the next phase of the willow system pilot would look like.  At this stage, we are 100% focused on the willow evapo-transpiration system as a solution worth pursuing.  We are encouraged by the existing research on how to strip out more of the rainfall impact on the system, which could be achievable, but its impact on the efficiency of the system has to be tested and that is why we need to pilot it.  Calculations from some previous reports, which were alluded to earlier, suggested a reduction of 60% in the rainfall hitting the system, which could make the difference in there being discharge or not.  We think that figure is achievable, provided the revised design process is still efficient and deals with the system properly.  We are encouraged, and are looking forward to proceeding along the lines that have been set out collectively and collaboratively with the EPA and the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019062000002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joseph Gilhooly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560985200,"counter":920,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  Dr. Ryan said the ET system does a very good job in general, but he has particular issues around E. coli and how it can be dealt with.  Are there possibilities there?  Many systems in the past have had a polishing element at the end which eliminates E.coli.  Does Dr. Ryan think it would be possible to add a polishing system to ET systems in order to do that, or does he believe further refinement and research on the ET system on its own may be able to achieve a reduction to negligible levels that will not have an impact?<\/p> <p>  Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh mentioned that the Minister might regulate this when the doors are fully opened and pulled back a bit.  The intention is for the Minister to set out very strict regulations which would ensure the impact on the environment is eliminated.  The difficulty we have is with the zero discharge element.  Even with collaboration and the good work that has been done by Leitrim County Council, the EPA and others, we will come to a stage where, while the discharge will be extremely small, will have been reduced considerably and will be of a very high standard which will have zero impact in the future, we will still have discharge.  Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh says there may be another way to deal with that discharge, other than putting a licence in place.  Can he explain to me where that may arise from, or if it is possible?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Gilhooly referred to the soil types in Leitrim, of which a large quantity are impermeable, and so we seldom have many areas there which are borderline.  Moving from a T 90 to a T 120 will make no difference in the vast majority of cases, and that is the reality because we have very few borderline cases.  In that context, if we are going to try to achieve as close to zero discharge as possible, with zero impact, how long will it take to finish that research?  Dr. Ryan mentioned that it might take a couple of seasons.  Considering the volume of work that has already been done, could we come to this quickly?  I am conscious of the sense of panic, and of real frustration, that exists both in Leitrim and in many rural communities, where people feel they are being shut down and that nobody cares about them.  We need to deal with this.  I feel frustrated that we have been looking for solutions for ten years, and people are saying it is a shame on our houses that we could not come up with a solution to this sooner.  We need to put an intense focus on this in order to get a solution in place as quickly as possible.  Perhaps Mr. Gilhooly could outline an appropriate timeframe to come to a solution here.  It is important that we have the technology right and we feel the solution can work, but we also need to ensure the legislation and regulations are in place in advance, so people can move on the solution as soon as it is reached.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019062000002#M00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1560985200,"counter":921,"content":"<p>We will start with Dr. Ryan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019062000002#M00300","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560985200,"counter":922,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.

It will take time to trial a system.  Currently, there is no authorised development process to proceed with a trial in Leitrim.  One would be depending on the design of the system, getting planning approval for it and constructing it.  The system is a natural one.  It must be constructed and become established and that will take some time.  It could be done in conjunction with the construction of a property and the system ideally would be ready to receive effluent when the house is ready for occupation and from that point we would move to the monitoring stage.<\/p> <p>  We would work collectively and there would be an ongoing process of engagement.  We would take the information from the trials, reports and analysis.  After the system is established it would receive effluent and the system would have a chance to mature.  Early analysis could be informative in indicating if we would have turned a corner in dealing with issues such as the escape of effluent, the composition of the effluent and if success has been achieved in separating the rainfall element with it being repelled from rather than absorbed into and discharged out of the system.   We could assess if the rainfall element has been successfully dealt with, that the system is performing as well as previous systems, notwithstanding its new design and that it provides more of a cover.

Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, as did Deputy Kenny, that it is not intention of this Bill or of the members of the committee to put public health at risk.  Equally, no individual living in a rural area would want to contaminate their neighbours' well that supplies their drinking water.  However, families are trying to build a home on their own land at a time when we have a housing crisis.  I have been dealing with the issue of one-off rural housing for 15 years and it has consumed most of my time.  Sometimes rural people get the feeling, as do I, that one off rural housing is looked on negatively all the way from Europe, down to national level, down to local level.  There is a sense that one off rural housing is not wanted.  That is the basis on which an applicant is starting and they have to convert a number of negatives to positives to build a home for their  family.<\/p> <p>  To put some matters in context, Mr. &Oacute; Cogligh said that we incurred financial penalties of &euro;2.76 million in respect of one-off 440 wastewater treatment facilities.  What other fines is our State incurring in respect of the discharges from our public wastewater facilities?<\/p><p>If we were to compare like with like, which is the lesser of the two evils?  I often wonder because there is a significant lack of investment in public wastewater infrastructure and we are being fined for that.  This is to put it into perspective that not just rural houses pollute our rivers and streams.  Our public wastewater treatment plants do the same.  The witnesses mentioned Wexford with regard to private housing developments.  I concur that we have one or two in Wicklow that have continued to cause problems where discharge licences were given and there were significant issues with ongoing maintenance of wastewater facilities.<\/p><p> Dr. Ryan made a point about water quality having decreased by 3%.  That would not all be related to septic tanks.  There are other factors at play, including agriculture and, in my constituency, former mining activity has had an effect on water quality.  When Dr. Ryan says that water quality has diminished by 3%, it is not just because of one-off rural housing.  There are other significant factors at play, including the public supply or public discharge.<\/p><p> I have a few points for Mr. Gilhooly.  He says that when considering a replacement house, there is a provision in the existing code of practice amounting to a relaxation of standards where an existing wastewater treatment system exists.  If someone has a house and is replacing it, even though the replacement house can increase the population, the same standards do not apply to that development.  I am not sure about the breakdown of village sizes in Leitrim.  How many villages in Leitrim are on a public mains supply for water and sewerage?  What level of investment is Irish Water making into small rural villages in Leitrim to improve the capacity of our villages to cater for rural housing?  This is a problem nationally.  Irish Water is not investing in any infrastructure for our rural villages in any form unless they are polluting and Irish Water has no choice but to intervene.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019062000002#N00800","speaker":"1357","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560985200,"counter":935,"content":"<p>The Vice Chairman mentioned the one-off housing issue.

One has to bear in mind that people in an existing property, or inheriting or buying a property with an existing wastewater treatment system, have an approved, authorised development that they can occupy.  They may become part of the national inspection plan, as was alluded to earlier.  That can arise depending on the risk analysis and what inspections are carried out annually in any local authority area.

This has an impact not just for one-off housing but a range of issues.  E. coli was mentioned.  The point has often been made to me by people in the planning department that they look at a two acre site and find there is nowhere on it to build a house but then the person will drive past it two months later and see that a farmer has spread several tanks of slurry on the same piece of land, which obviously has impermeable soil.  The question arises as to what is going on.  I imagine this issue will have an impact on E. coli and the agricultural sector.  We have a vast amount of forestry in Leitrim and there is the run-off from all of this.  What are the three main causes of pollution?

I acknowledge the significant body of work done by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service in the briefing paper that accompanies the Bill.  It is a substantial and helpful piece of work.<\/p> <p>  The Bill is very simple and does three things.  It seeks to increase the Part V requirement for standard residential developments to 25% from the currently reduced 10%; it seeks to impose a larger Part V requirement of 30% in strategic development zones; and it also makes one significant wording change to the existing legislation.  Not only does it change the percentages but it also changes the wording surrounding them from \"not more than\" to \"at least\", which is a significant change for members to be aware of.<\/p> <p>  The arguments are very straightforward and the committee discusses them week in and week out.  We are not getting a sufficient supply of social housing, notwithstanding the increases taking place.  There are very few affordable housing schemes in the pipeline and most of them will not start delivering units until 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023.  While the Government previously stood down the affordable housing schemes, affordable housing is still on the Statute Book and if we increase the Part V requirement to 25%, it will allow local authorities to make decisions on the basis of an increased supply of affordable housing.<\/p><p>That, in turn, will allow local authorities to make decisions on the basis of an increased supply of affordable housing.  If combined with the serviced sites fund that is now available to local authorities, this could be used to deliver a much more significant increase in affordable rental or affordable purchase accommodation in these developments.<\/p><p> The Department has given a statement and I will comment on the concerns it has expressed.  It is concerned about the change of wording from \"not more than\" to \"at least\".  It is especially concerned that this could lead to local authorities which do not need more affordable and social housing having to agree to it.  I am not convinced that there are many such local authorities.  If, however, members are of the view that some flexibility needs to be introduced in order to ensure that local authorities will not be forced to take units they do not need, I would be happy to explore the matter on Committee Stage.  We hear from Deputies in almost every county and local authority area that there is an urgent need for more social and-or affordable housing.  In light of this, I am of the view that the change of wording is valid.<\/p><p> There is a concern that this will have an impact on the price of properties because developers will have less stock in each development to sell at open market prices.  The difficulty is, as the Goodbody report published earlier this week confirms, that we have much housing stock which is currently being built in the wrong place or at the wrong price.  It has shown that there is a reduction in the number of new purchased units at prices of less than &euro;250,000.  Rather than increasing prices, if the local authority chose the option of affordable housing as the increased portion, this would increase the volume of affordable housing for people who are currently priced out of the market, which would be an important change.<\/p><p> We do not have many strategic development zones, SDZs.  The two most recently designated are at Poolbeg and Clonburris, which is in my constituency.  Some 30% of the houses in the Clonburris zone will be Part Vs, or social and affordable houses, on lands that the local authority owns.  That is in the SDZ and has been approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Dublin City councillors approved a requirement for 30% in the Poolbeg SDZ in respect of land that is all private, albeit under the control of a NAMA-appointed receiver.  While An Bord Plean&aacute;la ruled that any such percentage would have to be voluntary because the law does not permit otherwise, it still demonstrates that SDZs are, by their nature, very strategic in key locations and the latter are precisely the locations in which a higher percentage of social and affordable housing is needed.  The idea that only 10% of the units in the Poolbeg zone would be social and affordable homes makes no sense, particularly in view of the nature of the area.  There needs to be separate treatment for SDZs above the standard requirement.<\/p><p> Different views were expressed by parties which allowed the Bill to pass Second Stage.  People stated hat they might like to see a slightly lower increase, perhaps to 20% rather than 25%, with a similar view about SDZs.  I am happy to work with any of the Deputies, those in parties or Independents, in order to reach a compromise position.  The objective is to get more than 10%.  While I have set out in the Bill what I would like to see at an optimum level, I am open to supporting friendly amendments in order to ensure that the Bill passes Committee and Report Stages.  I will work with Deputies in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019062000002#P00800","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560985200,"counter":954,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin for that great presentation.

I have heard what Deputy &Oacute; Broin had to say and I read the submission from the Department that was circulated earlier.  We need to keep it simple.  I would not have supported the reduction in respect of Part Vs from 20% to 10%.  I prefer to use the broader term, \"public housing\", rather than social housing.  It is public housing, whether it is for an affordable purpose or some other purpose.  I like that concept.  I hear what the Deputy is saying about SDZs.  I am especially familiar with the zone in Cherrywood.  There is not much State land there, it is land that is held by private developers.  SDZs are different from each other depending on where they are located.  We would be doing very well if we could reverse the reduction and bring the figure back up to 20%.  That would be practical and reasonable.  We had it before.<\/p> <p>  I looked at an application for a development in south County Dublin recently that was approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We see the clustering of social or affordable housing.  The sites do not necessarily have the best aspects.  Many are single aspect sites, facing north, and I am concerned about that.  I would like to see stronger legislation for more equal and fair distribution of units across a complex.  I do not like the idea or suggestion that they are maybe slightly substandard, not the same quality of build, or that they are single aspect.  If we could get 10% social and 10% affordable housing, it would be a positive move.  What we do has to be incremental.  The Department raises many issues about stability in the market, how this is settling in and we are seeing these units come on stream.  They are standard sentences.  I do not want to rubbish the Department altogether.  It has legitimate concerns about stability in the market and an increased peak in outputs of the delivery of housing across all sectors by all different types of providers.  In general, I support this legislation and congratulate Deputy &Oacute; Broin and everybody involved in drafting it.

It is not legally possible to apply these retrospectively.  Developments for which planning permission has previously been granted will continue.  This is about future developments.  I emphasise the point about affordable housing.  On page 12 of the Library and Research Service's paper there is a good table of Part V developments and the breakdown of social and affordable housing from 2002 to 2018.  One can see that, from 2006 to 2008, affordable housing was the larger proportion of those.  We had a good meeting with officials from the Department, the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, and two local authorities about affordable housing.  Members that were here will know that those projects will not deliver a significant yield of affordable units for some years.  We will get some in D&uacute;n Laoghaire next year but it will only be in the following years for Dublin city and elsewhere.  For those members who are really keen to see affordable rental or purchases come on-stream more quickly, this is the only route on the table.<\/p> <p>  The final point I will raise, which Senator Boyhan mentioned - and which brought a wry smile to my face - is one that I will also mention to Mr. Paul Hogan when he speaks later.

I am not saying the Department is necessarily wrong; some changes I agree with, some I do not.  If a policy change has a positive outcome, particularly for people who are unable to access social and affordable housing now, it is one that is worth making but when it is made the Government should stick to it for a period.  Most members of the committee are of the view that we will not seek to come back to this at a later stage if we pass it and proceed.  Industry will then know that is where it will stay for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019062000002#Q00500","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560985200,"counter":959,"content":"<p>I propose we suspend the meeting for few minutes to allow the witnesses take their seats.

I am accompanied by Paul Hogan, senior planning adviser, and Marian O'Driscoll, assistant principal in the housing policy unit.<\/p> <p>  The Bill as proposed intends to amend section 94 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 so that section 94 would essentially provide that at least 25% of land zoned for residential use or a mixture of residential and other uses would be reserved for the provision of social and affordable housing.  In addition, it proposes adding a new subsection which would increase the figure of 25% to at least 30% in a strategic development zone, SDZ.  This Bill was originally debated in the D&aacute;il in November 2018 and the position on it has not changed.  This is a time for stability and certainty in this policy area in order to foster housing supply and unnecessary change, which could affect supply and house prices, should be avoided. <\/p> <p>  There are a number of issues with this Bill, both substantive and technical, that deserve close consideration by the committee.  It should be noted that the Bill is not a straightforward return to the language of the original Planning and Development Act 2000.  The original Act referred to a percentage of \"not more than 20 per cent\", whereas the current Bill goes much further and proposes that \"at least 25 per cent\" or \"at least 35 per cent\" in a special development zone must be acquired by the local authority, thereby placing obligations on the local authority to acquire at least 25% or 35%.  This obligation would persist whether or not the local authority requires the land or the housing units in that given area, without further consideration of appropriateness from a financial or integration perspective and without any clear analysis of whether and how a sudden significant policy change such as this would affect housing supply or house prices in the short or medium term. <\/p> <p>  The committee has referred to the fact that this policy was previously comprehensively reviewed and that the review included a public consultation based on a report prepared by economic consultants.  In the context of this review, a detailed assessment of Part V requirements was undertaken, including the benefits that Part V had for social integration.  The review had regard to the changed economic circumstances and the changed circumstances in terms of housing supply.  It considered that the principle of integrated, mixed-tenure developments was positive from a housing policy perspective and therefore recommended the retention of Part V as a concept.  It urged that Part V be focused on the delivery of social housing and therefore recommended the lowering of the requirement from 20% to 10%. <\/p> <p>  Following this review, a number of amendments were made to Part V by way of the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015.  While the developer's \"contribution\" was reduced from 20% to 10% of the \"planning gain\" - the amount by which the site increased in value as a result of having obtained planning permission - the previous provision which enabled the developer to make a financial contribution instead of selling land or units to local authorities was repealed.  Also, the developer was henceforth required to conclude a Part V agreement before commencing construction. <\/p> <p>  It was considered that this would copperfasten the original objective of Part V in the legislation, the delivery of social housing, combined with integration and sustainable mixed tenure communities across the country.  It should be noted that local authorities were informed, that they should seek to secure social housing units only, rather than affordable housing, under Part V.  It is considered that the amendments made to Part V in 2015 were fair and balanced.  It is also is a relatively short time since those amendments were made. <\/p> <p>  In relation to unintended consequences, it is entirely foreseeable that increasing the percentage to be set aside for social housing now would likely lead to an increase in private house prices as developers would likely seek to protect their overall profit margins.  Such an unintended consequence would be seriously problematic in the current housing climate where we are finally seeing a moderation in price increases. <\/p> <p>  It is also not considered appropriate to require a higher percentage in a strategic development zone, which would require a higher contribution from a developer carrying out residential development in an SDZ as opposed to a developer carrying out residential development elsewhere, with no underlying policy rationale.  Again, the local authorities should have the ability to make informed decisions based on the local need as to whether to acquire more housing in an SDZ without risking overall viability. <\/p> <p>  The supply of new housing in Ireland reached a nine year high in 2018, with more than 18,000 new units.  Indicators so far are positive that this figure will increase in 2019.  Having regard to the range of schemes and programmes that the Government has put in place to facilitate the accelerated delivery of social housing and affordable homes, including from State land, and mindful of the fact that the housing sector generally is still very much in a state of ongoing recovery, with a considerable journey yet to travel before a more balanced and stable housing market will be achieved, it is not considered appropriate to raise the current 10% Part V requirement to 25% at this time.  It is a time for stability in order to foster growth in supply and when supply has reached the required levels the policy can be appropriately reviewed again. <\/p> <p>  It should be noted of course that there is nothing to prevent local authorities acquiring further units in a development beyond those delivered under Part V, subject to being satisfied that this is appropriate in terms of sustainable communities' objectives and subject to funding being provided by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  This provides an appropriate level of flexibility whereby the local authority can acquire housing or indeed stimulate development in targeted areas. <\/p> <p>  While much has been achieved since 2015 in terms of recovery in the housing sector, there is still a considerable way to go, both in terms of achieving the level of supply that would better reflect a balanced housing supply and also in terms of achieving a recovery in supply that is more geographically spread.  Much of the recovery in scheme type home-building has been concentrated in Dublin, the greater Dublin area and Cork. <\/p> <p>  The policies put in place in recent years have played a major part in the recovery that has taken place and it is essential at this stage that there is policy stability and certainty if the recovery is to continue in the desired manner.  Now is not the time to introduce fresh policy uncertainty into this area by increasing or reintroducing costs and liabilities on the provision of housing, as to do so would foreseeably adversely impact the viability and therefore deliverability of housing in a market where viability, particularly in terms of housing at affordable price points, remains finely balanced in many areas and has yet to be restored in some parts of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019062000002#R00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline Timmons"},{"type":"speech","time":1560985200,"counter":963,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Timmons for her presentation.  Local authorities are prevented from entering voluntary agreements in standard residential developments and SDZs because developers do not have to enter those agreements if they do not so wish.  The point of increasing that is to make it a viable option.  Dublin City Council voted to have a 29% social and affordable requirement in the Poolbeg SDZ but the receiver appealed it to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and effectively won the core point of his appeal, that such an agreement would have to be voluntary.  That is now working itself out but it will cost the State a significant sum of money to purchase the land.  It would have been much better if An Bord Plean&aacute;la had the legislative foundation to uphold the original Dublin City Council decision.<\/p><p>That is why I think there is a need to have some increase whether it is 30% or 20%, as others have suggested, within the SDZs. <\/p><p> At present developers are entering into voluntary agreements, for example at Shackleton Park, as Mr. Hogan will know, from his former job with South Dublin County Council.  Due to the difficulty of accessing bank finance developers of very significant projects are quite open to voluntary agreements as it gives them a certain degree of additional security when they approach banks.  There is an argument for making this a more secure option that could assist some of those projects being developed at a faster level.  <\/p><p> One of the outcomes of the review in 2013-14 was a reduction to 10%.  There is a growing body of social policy evidence to say that 10% is too small for any possibility of integration of the very small number of lower income households in a larger private housing estate.  While nobody had the answer to what is the appropriate level to encourage the integration, which Government policy promotes, there is no evidence to suggest that 10% is high enough.  In fact, there are bodies of evidence from Britain, Australia and the US, and some research here, that shows 10% is too small and contributes to the isolation of lower income households within a larger housing development.<\/p><p> The witnesses are correct about the significant change in wording and that is a correct interpretation of my intention.  Do the witnesses know of local authorities that currently do not need an increase in social and affordable housing?  I ask because all of the local authorities we have talked to have housing lists and affordable housing needs greater than the level of supply available.<\/p><p> In terms of the potential increase in price for the remainder of the development, I made the remark before the witnesses came in that the Goodbody report was published earlier this week and highlights that too much of what has been built is above an affordable price point.  Therefore, surely if one has an increased Part V requirement it means there will be a greater level of affordability for those people who currently cannot buy in developments with only 10% provision.<\/p><p> In terms of policy uncertainty, we are going to have a series of other changes.  For example, the Joint Committee on Climate Action is going to have to consider changes in building regulations that the nearly zero energy building requirements, as Mr. Hogan and other witnesses rightly know, will create.  We are going to have a period of policy uncertainty.  We know for sure that we do not have enough social and affordable housing and this is one way of increasing that.  The Government cannot say we are going to have lots of uncertainty because of the initiatives that the Minister wants to introduce yet at the same time criticise the Opposition for creating alleged uncertainty because the Opposition wants to introduce those things.  There is going to be uncertainty over the next period but so as long as it is well flagged and is left at that level for a period then the industry will cope adequately. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019062000002#R00600","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560985200,"counter":965,"content":"<p>My colleague, Mr. Hogan, will comment after a few minutes but I shall start by answering the last point.  The Deputy identified one way to increase the amount of social housing.  The flaw in his logic is that simply setting a percentage does not automatically increase the level of social housing.  One could set the percentage at 100% yet one will still not get social housing because simply no one would be able to supply it, instead one will affect development and choke supply.<\/p> <p>  The initiative does not address the impact on supply in the short to medium term.  There has been no such analysis.  Let us consider what was being developed during the years when the bust happened.  In 2008 and 2009, there were 4,518 Part V units, which was the height of the provision, yet the number plummeted to just 36 in 2016.  That shows the percentage does not automatically mean one will get more units.  A percentage represents what one wants but it does not mean developers will provide units or that there will be a supply.  What we are looking at here is increasing a percentage and effectively not knowing if the supply will be available.  People have bought the land at these prices, they are looking at building these houses in the next two years and we are saying that we absolutely want them to do so.  However, now we are saying we are going to change the rules so people must go back to their banks and say: \"No, I am sorry but we will have to look at that again.\"  As a result there will definitely be a delay and we could negatively affect the supply.<\/p> <p>  The reference by the Deputy to the Goodbody report is very apt because it shows how finely balanced things are right now.  We are on the precipice and do not know whether we are going up or down.  The ESRI still says that we will hit about 25,000 units and it is important that we maintain the momentum.  I do not accept the point that there is instability in policy anyway and, therefore, we should have more, and it does not matter.  Of course it matters.  It matters that we do not have any more instability than we absolutely have to.  The Minister accepted in his Second Stage speech that once a supply reaches a level that is maintainable and sustainable - possibly the 35,000 units mark - he would look at that again.  That is a very fair and balanced position.  Once we see supply coming back to the level we really need then one would consider whether we are getting enough and if we could get more.  That is a really reasonable position.  In 2000, we were very reasonable when we said we wanted to get more units and more again during the boom.  However, we are not in that space now and have a very different economic reality in which to make decisions to change things; we said, in the review, that this is what we are going to do.  The last point made by the Deputy was precise because he said we should stick to it for a little while.  What we are doing is sticking to it for a little while, making sure we do not affect things and giving a little bit of stability but once we reach a position of stability we can make changes again.  The Deputy is right that this is about providing certainty to the market.  In other words, if one bought something at this price we are not going to change the game immediately and we will get= the supply, which is what we are asking for.<\/p> <p>  It is wrong to say that we are not going to get social and affordable housing any other way.  Of course local authorities need them but this is why we are considering other ways to provide such houses.  We are using public lands to do so, which the Deputy very much supports.  We are also considering measures like the serviced sites fund, the local infrastructure housing activation fund or LIHAF, affordable purchase homes and the rebuilding of home loans.  We know that all of these levers will accelerate and increase supply but this is a lever that manifestly could choke and decrease supply.  One has got to use the ones that are safe bets.  With this one there is a clear possible unintended consequence because at a minimum there will be a delay and, at a maximum, it could decrease supply.  Given how much that might affect rents in the market  we have to be very clear we have the evidence base to make a policy decision.  We do not have the evidence base before us to make that policy decision right now.  It would be something that we will consider again when the time is right, to check that this is something we would like to do.  <\/p> <p>  My colleague, Mr. Hogan, will comment on strategic development zones.  He is a planner and, therefore, has more expertise on them.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019062000002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline Timmons"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560985200,"counter":966,"content":"<p>The one-size-fits-all nature of the proposal is an issue.  A strategic development zone is a geographic planning designation, it is a spatially unique thing, applies to one place and is for a specified set of purposes.  Each one of those aspects need to be considered in a local context as opposed to being subjected to a very high-level of overall national provision.<br\/><br\/>Not all SDZs are for housing.  Again, this is a point that needs to be taken on board.  Some include some housing or could include some housing at the point of designation but it is always specified, such as the Grangegorman SDZ for the Technical University Dublin.  Waterford north quays is another current example of where the development could be entirely commercial but could also include some housing but we do not know for sure and depends on what comes forward.  We have a current draft for Knock Airport, for example, which probably will not have any and an emerging proposal for the University of Limerick that could include some but, again, that is down the line.  The real point is that there is no one-size-fits-all and the proposed threshold of 35% is very high.  Therefore, it would be inappropriate to single out and prejudge how an SDZ can be approached locally given the intended purpose of an SDZ.<br\/><br\/>Finally, SDZs are intended to be, particularly in the case of housing, a strategic approach to planning whereby the normal set of uncertainties and things in a system are set aside and there is a clearer or more certain route to the volume delivery of housing such as Adamstown, Clonburris and Cherrywood.  Applying this kind of differential standard, all of which would have to be negotiated in advance and prior to the commencement of construction, would for a variety of reasons, and viability comes into this as well, render SDZs unattractive <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>other development routes where a lower figure would apply.  There is a concern that it would kill off any new SDZ proposals in the future.<\/p><p> On the first question about local authorities that do not need social and affordable housing, obviously, we know that an element of it is required everywhere.  The point is that it is simply not viable to build scheme housing in approximately half the counties in the country, or possibly more, although it is not entirely county-specific.  One of the reasons one-off housing is so popular in rural Ireland is because it is a possible route for people to house themselves.  The margins are very fine.  There is a lot of talk about county development plans and the need to be sustainable and provide an element of choice in terms of urban housing.  However, if it is simply not viable to do scheme housing, it is unlikely that we will achieve even the modest 10% target that we have.  That has to be seen as the baseline from which further units can be acquired in the future.  We will not see any of it if we make it even more difficult than it is to deliver housing by means of Part V developments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019062000002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Hogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560985200,"counter":968,"content":"<p>The starting point for this discussion, which we should not take as a given and of which we should remind ourselves, is the greatest housing crisis in the history of the State.  It is a housing emergency, with more than 10,000 people officially homeless and a generation that has in large measure been locked out of the housing market.  Every serious analyst, think-tank and commentator, almost without exception, is now arguing that an increase in the supply of social housing is key to dealing with the crisis.<\/p> <p>  It has been suggested that we need to provide certainty to the market, and so on.  The starting point for me is that we need to provide certainty to people who are being locked out of the market and we need to provide certainty to people on housing waiting lists and who are in homeless emergency accommodation.  I have listened to the points that have been raised about unintended consequences but if we are talking about an evidence base, the first piece of evidence we should have put before the committee is not what might happen if we go down this road but what is happening.<\/p> <p>  I do not have the statistics to hand and I would like to have them for this discussion.  However, let us take the last three years, 2016 to 2018, inclusive.  What have local authorities and the State received in terms of social housing units on the basis of Part V?

While we have reservations about the percentages, we have spoken to Deputy &Oacute; Broin on that directly.  However, we are fully behind the thrust of changing Part V back to a minimum of 20%, which will include affordable homes.  We have not delivered on affordable homes for a long time and there is currently no affordable scheme.  Affordability is a key issue for us.<\/p> <p>  Ms Timmons stated that people bought the land and that they need certainty.  I do not buy that at all.  In the context of county development plans, the Department had no problem completely dezoning land that had been bought.  The Department has dezoned land wholesale and it did not cost it a thought to do so.  I do not think the fact that somebody has bought land should be a concern of the Department regarding Part V and I do not understand that logic.  In the context of Wicklow specifically, most developers are selling nearly 100% of their developments to the Department for social housing in any case.  Why is there suddenly an issue and why should increasing it by 10% or 15% be a concern to the developer, who has already bought the land, when it did not concern the Department in previous years, when it was dezoning land or changing the criteria for zoning?  That is still ongoing.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned earlier that this is an apt time to implement this measure.  We have the national planning framework and the regional plans.  Most counties will have a complete review of their county development plans on the basis of those regional plans.  With that in mind, this is the ideal opportunity.  I sometimes wonder whether we should look at all developments and state that a percentage should be build to rent, a percentage should be affordable, a percentage should be for first-time buyers and a percentage should be for social housing.  Is that something we need to do?  Should it be policy that all aspects of housing need are met with the planning application?  Those are a few points to consider.  On the question of unintended consequences for a developer, I do not buy that at all.  Ms Timmons stated that they bought land.  That is not a reason not to look at this as a logical policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019062000002#T00300","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1560985200,"counter":970,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hogan and Ms Timmons for their responses.  To reassure them, I take all of the points very seriously and I appreciate the time they have taken to consider them.  I agree with them that we need an evidence base and we need to be mindful of unintended consequences, so I am not disregarding either of those points.  I have read the 2012 DMK report which underpinned the review of Part V in 2013 and 2014 and I did not see any evidence in that to support the reduction.  There were assumptions, assessments and opinions, and, obviously, in the following five years, it did not lead to any immediate response from the market.  Of course, it was never going to lead to any immediate response from the market in terms of increasing Part V because of where the construction sector was at that stage.  Nonetheless, given the fact the reduction was not evidence-based, it is reasonable for us to argue that whether it is returned to 20%, 25% or 30% is something that should be explored.<\/p> <p>  Some of the language used by Mr. Hogan and Ms Timmons is interesting.  For example, Ms Timmons stated that what is proposed would \"choke supply\".  That is a pretty significant statement.  What evidence does she have that makes her believe it would choke supply?  In what was probably an even more extreme comment, Mr. Hogan said it would \"kill off\" SDZs.  Obviously, I would like to believe that and, as that is what he said at the committee, I will take it at face value.  One of the big criticisms of the Docklands SDZ is that there was virtually no social or affordable housing in real terms.  One of the things we have seen with Poolbeg is a real desire on the part of residents and the vast majority of the elected members of Dublin City Council to have affordability.  In fact, even the Ministers - the previous incumbent, Deputy Coveney, and the current one, Deputy Eoghan Murphy - wanted to have that 30%.  SDZs are of such huge importance because they are always in key locations.  One of the constant challenges in those key locations is, of course, affordability, given their proximity to economic opportunities, public transport hubs and so on.  It is actually because of their strategic nature that a higher percentage is needed.  Again, I am willing to work with committee members to respond to that.<\/p> <p>  Our biggest challenge is the undersupply of affordable housing.  All of the information we have from the Department and the local authorities is that there is not going to be a significant supply of affordable housing through the serviced sites fund or LIHAF for four to five years, and they are asking us to wait until we reach 30,000 to 35,000 total completions, and then review it.  The difficulty is that, by that time, we will have produced so many unaffordable private sector units that the affordable housing crisis will have got worse or, at least, remained static.  There is still a compelling argument to do this.  Do I genuinely think that by introducing this we are going to delay output?  I genuinely do not, and I have yet to see any evidence for it.  However, if the witnesses have any evidence, I would be more than happy to consider it and to reconsider my position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019062000002#T00400","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560985200,"counter":971,"content":"<p>Many of the arguments made are very fair.  However, there is quite a circular argument going on in that, with regard to the proposals made, we are told we should provide the evidence that they are not true.<\/p><p>It is quite difficult for us to be asked to prove the negative.  We should be shown evidence that it would work, but none is being put before us and so we cannot consider it.  That is a difficulty.  It is also an issue to say that if there was no evidence to reduce it, which we did the last time, we do not therefore need evidence this time.  With the greatest respect, that is a difficult argument to accept.<\/p><p> We cannot say that we should just go back to the way we were without evidence to show that it will not have unintended consequences.  I am not saying that that would justify it, but it could; it is a foreseeable possibility and we should have evidence to show that we are reasonably certain it will not.  We need a decent economic analysis to show the reason it will not.  The man in the street will know that if the game changes, the financial model changes and one will have to go back to one's bank, or to one's financiers, to say that the land or units have to be sold back to the local authority at a particular price.  That is reasonable to assume.  To say that that is not reasonable to assume, it has to be demonstrated why that is not the case.<\/p><p> It has been said that local authorities are acquiring in some areas, and that is absolutely right.  Local authorities have the flexibility to do that.  In a given area, if they want to acquire units, they now have the flexibility to do that.  That is the beauty of the system.  However, if it is stated that they \"must\" acquire a given area, as this legislation does, all flexibility is removed from the local authority to decide that there is enough social housing in an area.<\/p><p> The Department has looked at the research that was raised which states that 10% is enough, but that 10% is not separate from everything else.  All these places are connected to other places.  Local authorities have to look at the percentage in the broader area.  Looking at one development is not a fine-grained assessment of the situation; the percentage around the development has to be looked at.  To simply say that we should not care about what is around it and have 25%, regardless of what is needed, means that local authorities will have to spend a significant amount of money, perhaps in areas where the units are quite expensive, where it might not agree that it should.  All flexibility to make the decision is removed.<\/p><p> It also means less flexibility in decision-making for a developer.  It is important that developers are able to say to local authorities what would assist them in their model.  If it works for everybody, that is wonderful, but developers should also be able to say that if they do this, they cannot supply the units because it does not work under their financial model.  That has to be taken into account.  We have to understand that it might not always work for a developer, but if it does, that is great.<\/p><p> I hope I have addressed logically the points being made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2019062000002#T00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline Timmons","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1560985200,"counter":973,"content":"<p>I understand what was said in relation to the big statement about killing off SDZs.
