This is supported by the initiatives outlined in the Audiovisual Action Plan, launched in June 2018 under the Creative Ireland Programme.<\/p>  <p>  The aim is to grow the audiovisual sector in Ireland to such an extent that sufficient employment opportunities are made available to allow our cast and crew to work consistently work across different productions. In Ireland, a key attraction to foreign production companies is the calibre of our talented workforce in the audiovisual sector and the positive reputation they enjoy internationally. Looking at the recent announcement of the Irish Film and Television Awards (IFTAs) 2021 Nominations for the Irish Academy Awards, I was struck by how much our Irish acting talent is being showcased, both here in Ireland and across the world through myriad roles in film and television. It is truly heartening to see Irish talent on the global stage, both in front of, and behind the cameras. <\/p>  <p>  Government policy supports the film and television sector to create an attractive environment for film production. Key to this is support for skills and training initiatives in the sector. Ireland also supports the sector though its international film co-production treaties and by offering a competitive section 481 tax credit. This is a tax credit calculated by reference to expenditure on cast and crew working in Ireland, and on goods and services sourced in Ireland. As members of the European Union, we must of course be mindful of our responsibilities to avoid discrimination on the grounds of nationality but we are unabashedly proud of our talented Irish workforce and the reach of our talent across the global industry is testament to this. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department funds Screen Ireland, the national development agency for the screen sector investing in Talent, Creativity and Enterprise.

I recognise the essential role that the local media plays and the particular value of local and regional newspapers, as well as local, regional and community radio stations, in bringing communities together and sharing reliable and relevant local news.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of these longer term challenges facing the sector, the Programme for Government provided for the establishment of the Future of Media Commission, chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, to consider the future of print, broadcast, and online media in a platform agnostic fashion.\u00a0 The Future of Media Commission conducted a public consultation, that resulted in over 800 written submissions from stakeholder groups, including local media, and the general public.\u00a0 In addition, the Commission conducted a number of online dialogues with stakeholders and experts CRAOL, IBI, the NUJ, Local Ireland, and NewsBrands. I look forward to receiving the Commission's Report on the completion of its work in July which will inform media policy, including local print and broadcasting media, over the next 10 years. <\/p>  <p>  Since I assumed formal responsibility for the media sector in September 2020, I have met key stakeholders including NewsBrands, Local Ireland and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ).\u00a0\u00a0My Department has developed an understanding of the impact of the pandemic and general financial trends in the print sector through particularly useful engagement with Local Ireland.\u00a0\u00a0My officials continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders in order to explore the issues arising and build an understanding of the range of challenges facing the sector.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has put in place a range of supports for all businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which are available to local newspapers, such as the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme.\u00a0 The loss the sector has suffered from the impact of the restrictions has also been addressed by the public health advertising placed by the Government. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that at least &euro;4.4 million has been expended on regional and local print advertising from March 2020 to April 2021. I am also ensuring that advertising campaigns organised by my Department include a local print media element.\u00a0 Recently the campaign for Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g, a day of free creative events for young people, included a spend of &euro;187,000 on local print advertising. <\/p>  <p>  To relation to the local radio sector, I have received quarterly reports from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, analysing how COVID-19 has affected Independent Radio.\u00a0 These reports have identified the size of falling revenue streams for commercial radio, especially local radio; and the beneficial impact of government supports, such as the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, which has reduced costs for local stations. In the first quarter of 2021, 17 radio stations availed of this scheme and received &euro;1.5m in supports.\u00a0 Moreover, government and HSE COVID-related advertising spend also produced a source of revenue for radio stations which amounted to &euro;1.8m in Q1 2021. The BAI will continue to report to me on the sector in the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of challenges facing the sector and its important contribution\u00a0to society as a whole, I secured additional funding for the Sound and Vision scheme alongside the allocation of 7% of net licence fee receipts which normally supports the fund.\u00a0 I allocated an additional &euro;4.9m to the BAI in December 2020.\u00a0 &euro;1m of this was distributed by the BAI in December and the balance of &euro;3.9m comprising &euro;2.5m for the independent radio sector and &euro;1.4m to support the live music sector was recently allocated by the BAI.\u00a0\u00a0On 31 May 2021, in Round 38 of the Sound and Vision 4 scheme, the BAI announced the allocation of &euro;7.2m in supports which will facilitate the production of 104 projects.<\/p>  <p>  A further round of &euro;2.58m was awarded on 29 April to support all 32 radio stations in the independent radio sector. This funding, which is Round 39 of the Sound and Vision 4 scheme, is on top of the supports already put in place in 2020. Further Sound and Vision funding rounds will follow later in year and the BAI, will announce these as they arise.<\/p>  <p>  It must be noted that the Sound and Vision scheme is a statutory scheme provided for under Part 10 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 and is largely funded by the television licence. It is limited by statute to audiovisual and sound media and is independently administered by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. There is no equivalent statutory framework for the print sector. However, as stated above, the report of the Future of Media Commission will make recommendations in relation to the print media when it reports next month.<\/p>  <p>  My officials continue to engage with the secretariat of the Future of Media Commission and relevant stakeholders in order to explore the issues arising and build an understanding of the range of challenges facing the sector at present and appropriate solutions for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200060#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":26,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200060#WRB01700"},{"type":"question","counter":27,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[33297\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200060#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the status of the take-up of the &euro;50 million suite of supports for those working in the live entertainment sector; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1511","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":28,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to my earlier reply to Parliamentary Question No\u00a064. <\/p>  <p>  I allocated &euro;50 million to a suite of measures to assist the live performance sector.\u00a0 As part of that funding, on Tuesday June 15th I announced the allocations for the &euro;25m Live Performance Support\u00a0Scheme (LPSS 2021).\u00a0 I was delighted to be in a position to fund 237 successful applications under this scheme, the details of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.\u00a0 These grants will help support employment and wellbeing opportunities across all genres and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public.<\/p>  <p>  I have also made an allocation of &euro;14m available for the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, specifically musicians and related crew,\u00a0that have been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports.\u00a0 The main features of this new scheme will see support offered by way of\u00a0three levels of flat payments:<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;2,500 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;20,000 - &euro;50,000 with minimum business costs of &euro;3,000 incurred from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021.<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;4,000 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;50,001- &euro;100,000 with minimum business costs of &euro;6,000 from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021.<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;5,000 for businesses with VAT-exclusive turnover in excess of &euro;100,000 with minimum business costs of &euro;7,500 from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Under the scheme, self employed businesses including musicians, singers, lighting and sound crew and audio\u00a0 equipment suppliers operating exclusively within the commercial live entertainment sector\u00a0are eligible to apply.

The Arts Council announced details of its investment plans last February and this included a range of initiatives aimed at supporting artists and arts organisation through the crisis. <\/p>  <p>  From the outset of the COVID-19 crisis, the Arts Council adopted pro-active approach to supporting individual artists of all genres as well as arts and culture organisations.\u00a0 One of the Council's first actions was its announcement to honour all existing funding commitments, pre-funding grantees up to 90% of funding to assist with commitments, especially to artists. Since then, the Arts Council introduced new and enhanced funding programmes specifically in response to COVID-19. Further information of these investments can be accessed on the Arts Council&rsquo;s website <\/p>  <p>  In 2021, I allocated &euro;50 million for a suite of measures to assist the live performance sector aimed at supporting employment and wellbeing opportunities across all genres and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public.\u00a0 Included in this package\u00a0are the following measures:<\/p>  <p>  - I recently announced 237 grant allocations under the 2021 Live Performance Support Scheme amounting to &euro;25m.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - An allocation of &euro;14m has  been made available for the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, specifically musicians and related crew, that have been negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports.\u00a0 This Scheme is a demand led scheme and is accepting applications at present.<\/p>  <p>  - An allocation of &euro;5 million has been made available to local authorities for live performances in summer 2021 to animate town centres, should public health considerations permit. <\/p>  <p>  - Up to &euro;1 million was allocated to the St Patrick's Festival 2021 for programming and it supported over 3,500 days of employment for performers, producers, artists, technicians, creatives and support staff.<\/p>  <p>  A separate &euro;11.5m new fund for the entertainment industry, including festivals, conferencing and large events has been agreed between myself and the T&aacute;naiste Leo Varadkar. This Events Sector Covid Support Scheme (ESCSS) will support SMEs that are not eligible for the CRSS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200060#WRB02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":32,"content":"<p>Question No. 75 answered with Question No. 72.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Facilities","counter":33,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200060#WRB02400"},{"type":"question","counter":34,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[33280\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200060#WRB02500","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if funding will be made available for a stadium (details supplied); and the details of funding provided by her Department to the stadium in the past five years.","asker":"1560","askee":"1471"},{"type":"question","counter":35,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[33281\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200060#WRB02600","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she has had any communications with the management of a stadium (details supplied) to date; if she will take steps to prevent the sale of the stadium; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1471"},{"type":"question","counter":36,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[33279\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200060#WRB02700","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she will help to develop and enhance a stadium (details supplied) to ensure women and men's football can continue to play in a modern stadium into the future; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":37,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76, 115 and 126 together.<\/p>  <p>  The question of any possible sale of the stadium referred to by the Deputy is a matter for Dublin City Council in the first instance.  <\/p>  <p>  In terms of my role, my Department provides grant assistance for sporting facilities through the Sports Capital and Equipment Programme (SCEP) and the Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF). <\/p>  <p>  Under the SCEP, grants of up to &euro;300,000 are available to community organisations, sports clubs, national governing bodies of sport and local authorities to develop or refurbish sports facilities. The stadium referred to by the Deputy received a provisional allocation of &euro;71,000 under the 2018 round of the Programme but this has not been drawn down. <\/p>  <p>  The latest round of the SCEP closed for applications on the 1st March and assessment work is underway. An announcement on the timing of the next round of the Programme will be made once these allocations have been finalised.   <\/p>  <p>  The National Sports Policy published in 2018 provided for the establishment of the LSSIF. The aim of the fund is to provide support for larger sports facilities where the Exchequer investment is greater than the maximum amount (&euro;300,000) available under the SCEP. The National Development Plan provided a capital allocation of at least &euro;100m over the period to 2027 for the Fund.   Approximately &euro;86.4m has been allocated to 33 projects to date including an allocation of &euro;918,750 to Dublin City Council towards the overall design cost for the redevelopment of the stadium to which the Deputy refers. <\/p>  <p>  While it is not proposed to open the LSSIF for new applications at present, my Department is undertaking a review of the LSSIF which is expected to be complete in the near future. This review will look at, inter alia, progress on all existing grants and the timing of a new call for proposals will also be considered. <\/p>  <p>  A key consideration in the assessment of any applications under the SCEP and the LSSIF is the likelihood of increasing participation including female participation and the government is committed to continued investment in our sport infrastructure in the years ahead. Any future application for funding for the stadium referred to by the Deputy under either the SCEP or LSSIF will be considered on its own merits in line with the relevant assessment criteria.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200060#WRB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1475"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":38,"content":"<p>Question No. 77 answered with Question No. 67.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":39,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200060#WRB03000"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[29842\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200060#WRB03100","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the supports that are in place to sustain the live music sector at present.","asker":"1469","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":41,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to my earlier reply to Parliamentary Question No\u00a064. <\/p>  <p>  I allocated &euro;50 million to a suite of measures to assist the live performance sector.\u00a0 As part of that funding, on Tuesday June 15th I announced the allocations for the &euro;25m Live Performance Support\u00a0Scheme (LPSS 2021).\u00a0 I was delighted to be in a position to fund 237 successful applications under this scheme, the details of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.\u00a0 These grants will help support employment and wellbeing opportunities across all genres and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public.<\/p>  <p>  I have also made an allocation of &euro;14m available for the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, specifically musicians and related crew,\u00a0that have been significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports.\u00a0 The main features of this new scheme will see support offered by way of\u00a0three levels of flat payments:<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;2,500 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;20,000 - &euro;50,000 with minimum business costs of &euro;3,000 incurred from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021.<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;4,000 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of &euro;50,001- &euro;100,000 with minimum business costs of &euro;6,000 from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021.<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;5,000 for businesses with VAT-exclusive turnover in excess of &euro;100,000 with minimum business costs of &euro;7,500 from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Under the scheme, self employed businesses including musicians, singers, lighting and sound crew and audio\u00a0 equipment suppliers operating exclusively within the commercial live entertainment sector\u00a0are eligible to apply.

In particular, sectors such as tourism, live events, sports\u00a0and the arts have been among the worst-affected sectors of the pandemic, and the Economic Recovery Plan\u00a0recognises the particular impact on the economic viability of the sectors that will continue for longer than other sectors in the economy\u00a0while of physical distancing remains a feature of these sectors.<\/p>  <p>  Under the\u00a0Economic Recovery Plan, Government has committed to maintaining supports by extending the period during which a range of horizontal and business supports will be available to enterprises and workers in all sectors of the economy, including Tourism, Arts and Culture, Sport, Media and those working in Gaeltacht communities.\u00a0Of particular relevance are the following measures:<\/p>  <p>  - Extending the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS);<\/p>  <p>  - Extending the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme to 31 December;<\/p>  <p>  - Extending the Pandemic Unemployment Payment beyond 30 June 2021;<\/p>  <p>  - Extending the Commercial Rates Waiver to end-September 2021;<\/p>  <p>  - Broadening of eligibility criteria for the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID-19, which opens the scheme up to businesses in non-rated premises.<\/p>  <p>  The Economic\u00a0Recovery Plan\u00a0also sets out the intention to introduce a new, additional and more streamlined business support scheme in September 2021, called the Business Resumption Support Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to horizontal supports, the\u00a0Economic Recovery Plan\u00a0includes a package of sectoral\u00a0measures for the Tourism, Live Events and the Arts and Culture, which are\u00a0providing additional interventions to support recovery in these sectors.<\/p>  <p>  For the live events, arts and culture sectors, I opened applications for the new &euro;14 million Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme last week, on 9 June. This payment is targeted at helping not only bands and musicians, but suppliers and music businesses. I also recently announced 237 grant allocations under the &euro;25m Live Performance Support Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste Leo Varadkar and I have also agreed\u00a0to deliver a\u00a0separate &euro;11.5m new fund for the entertainment industry, including festivals, conferencing and large events . This\u00a0Events Sector Covid Support Scheme\u00a0will support SMEs that are not eligible for the CRSS.<\/p>  <p>  I am also delighted that the  Economic Recovery Plan includes a commitment for Government to prioritise a Basic Income guarantee pilot scheme for artists. This was a key recommendation of the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce, and I will bring forward a proposal following the report of the Arts and Culture Recovery Oversight Group in July.<\/p>  <p>  I also recently confirmed the release of funding for local authorities with &euro;5m to support live music in villages and towns across the country. Amounts of &euro;285,000 are now available to the Dublin local authorities, and &euro;143,000 to other local authorities to facilitate programming of outdoor live performances over the summer months, animating town centres for local communities as public health considerations permit. Local Authorities and hospitality businesses can also benefit from F&aacute;ilte Ireland's Outdoor Dining Enhancement Investment Scheme, which will facilitate greater capacity in outdoor dining by supporting the upgrade and enhancement of streets and public spaces, and implementing weather-proofing solutions which will facilitate year-round outdoor dining.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to benefiting from revised and extended horizontal supports, the Economic Recovery Plan also provides the following additional targeted interventions for the Tourism sector:<\/p>  <p>  - An Extension of the 9% VAT rate to September 2022. This will continue to act as a stimulus for the sector as it moves towards recovery.<\/p>  <p>  - The F&aacute;ilte Ireland Business Continuity Scheme will also continue.<\/p>  <p>  This will provide tourism and hospitality businesses with much-need clarity that will enable them to plan longer-term with confidence and accept bookings.\u00a0Government also recognises that as long as physical distancing remains a public health requirement, further supports may be needed for these sectors.<\/p>  <p>  These supports will augment the work already being undertaken by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, and Screen Ireland in supporting Gaeltacht companies, the Tourism and Hospitality sector, and the audiovisual industry to withstand the full impact of the pandemic and position them for growth in the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to sport, a total Covid-19 funding package of &euro;88.5 million was provided last year to support the sport sector. This significant investment benefited all levels of the sport sector, including thousands of grassroots clubs across the country, and provided some certainty for sporting organisations in their planning for 2021.\u00a0 In relation to further\u00a0Covid-19 funding for 2021, Minister Chambers and I have committed to supporting the sport sector again this year in meeting the challenges arising from Covid-19. Sport Ireland is in ongoing communication with the NGBs and is assessing the financial needs of the sector. In addition, I am engaging with NGBs with regard to the supports required.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I will continue to work with colleagues across Government to ensure that the sectors covered by my Department are supported in their recovery as we reopen our society and our economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200061#WRC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":75,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200061#WRC01000"},{"type":"question","counter":76,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[33229\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200061#WRC01100","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if consideration has been given to increasing the number of scholarships offered to students through Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge given the impact of Covid-19 on Gaeltacht regions and students alike; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":77,"content":"<p>My Department, via\u00a0Sc&eacute;im na bhFoghlaimeoir&iacute; Gaeilge,\u00a0subvents the cost of attending summer college in Gaeltacht regions.

The scheme is administered on behalf of the Department\u00a0by Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board.<\/p><p>Due to COVID-19, it was not possible to\u00a0provide the scholarships last year nor indeed this year, following\u00a0the recent decision not to proceed with recognised Irish summer courses, in the interests of protecting public health.<\/p><p>It is envisaged that the\u00a0provision of\u00a0scholarships under\u00a0<b>DEIS Gaeltachta\u00a0<\/b>will resume next year or as soon as it is safe to do so. The number of scholarships made available under the measure\u00a0will of course be kept under consideration in the context of available resources and competing demands.\u00a0 However, it is a stated priority of mine to expand this scheme in order to increase the availability of the Gaeltacht experience to students from all socio-economic backgrounds.<\/p><p>In the interest of completeness,\u00a0the Deputy may be interested to\u00a0note that both I and my officials are continuing to engage with the\u00a0summer colleges sector on foot of the decision to cancel courses this summer. The overall purpose of this engagement, which includes discussions with\u00a0a representative group of Gaeltacht accommodation providers, is to tailor insofar as possible, suitable stabilisation measures with a view to ensuring the sector is on a sound footing for a full and safe return in 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200061#WRC01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1475"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":78,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200061#WRC01300"},{"type":"question","counter":79,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[29220\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200061#WRC01400","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if the outdoor enhancement scheme will be extended to gyms and health centres given the positive impact the outdoor dining enhancement scheme has had in supporting businesses in the hospitality sector to moving more outdoors; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1555","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":80,"content":"<p>The development and administration of the Outdoor Dining Enhancement Scheme is an operational matter for F&aacute;ilte Ireland, in partnership with the Local Authorities.\u00a0 Although I am not aware of any plans to extend or otherwise amend the existing scheme, I have asked F&aacute;ilte Ireland to respond directly to the Deputy to confirm whether or not gyms or health centres with a public food and beverage service offering could be\u00a0eligible to apply for support under the existing scheme.\u00a0 Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200061#WRC01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"question","counter":82,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[33299\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200061#WRC01700","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the status of strategies to assist the hospitality industry to retain and regain qualified staff in their sector; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":83,"content":"<p>The reopening of the country and the economy has been happening gradually over June and I look forward to further reopening in July and beyond.\u00a0 Tourism accommodation and outdoor dining have reopened and subject to satisfactory progress with the health situation, more indoor activities will reopen in July.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has supported businesses, including the tourism hospitality sector, through the closure, in particular with initiatives such as the CRSS, EWSS and the F&aacute;ilte Ireland Tourism Business Continuity Scheme (TBCS) and is now assisting them in their reopening.\u00a0 While CRSS and the TBCS have addressed fixed costs, the EWSS has been crucial in maintaining employment and the link between employer and employee.\u00a0 Its continuation was one of the key asks of the sector and the Government has committed to its maintenance until end-2021 in the Economic Recovery Plan.\u00a0 I know that the reopening is very welcome but I also know that it brings a number of challenges, particularly in reconnecting with employees.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to the pandemic, tourism and hospitality accounted for approximately 260,000 jobs and F&aacute;ilte Ireland was very active in the issue of skills development in the sector.\u00a0 The Tourism Recovery Taskforce made a number of recommendations to enhance sustainable employment in the tourism sector to support both its survival and recovery.\u00a0 This includes the development of a National Tourism Education Gateway as a one stop shop to education for all tourism employees.

This network protects consumers when conducting transactions across national borders and, allows consumer protection agencies to co-operate to resolve particular consumer issues.

Tests are available on a first-come-first-served basis with the new online service becoming more widely available later in the year. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise the limits of\u00a0online testing.\u00a0 These may be convenient for test candidates, but they have to be monitored closely by a supervisor, which makes them more staff-intensive than tests in test centres.\u00a0 In consequence, if the RSA and Prometric, the test operator, get approval in future to extend capacity in test centres to 50,000 tests, they have indicated that they will prioritize staff for the test centres and may have to reduce the figure online from 10,000.\u00a0 This will in fact have a positive impact on numbers\u00a0tested, as the test centres are far more efficient. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The gradual reopening of services will not immediately solve the backlogs. Every possible measure is being put in place to ensure that the maximum number of customers can be served while public health guidance is strictly adhered to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200065#WRG04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":346,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200065#WRG04400"},{"type":"question","counter":347,"qnumday":185,"qnumall":"[33122\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200065#WRG04500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the amount of funding allocated to the National Transport Authority to increase bus route capacity in County Waterford in 2018, 2019, 2020 and to date in 2021, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":348,"content":"<p>As the Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.

The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan.<\/p>  <p>  Details of CRSS were published in Finance Act 2020 and detailed operational guidelines, which are based on the terms and conditions of the scheme as set out in the legislation, have been published on the Revenue website.<\/p>  <p>  The CRSS applies to businesses carrying on trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, which requires the business to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises and as a result, is operating at less than 25% of turnover in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  It is not sufficient that the trade of a business has been impacted because of a reduction in customer demand as a consequence of Covid-19.\u00a0 The scheme only applies where, as a direct result of the specific terms of the Government restrictions, the business is required to either prohibit or significantly restrict access to its business premises.\u00a0This means that in the case of a travel agent that operates from a business premises, they may qualify for support under the scheme provided they meet all the eligibility criteria, including the requirement that customers are either prohibited, or significantly restricted, from accessing their business premises under the public health regulations.<\/p>  <p>  As non-essential retail, including travel agent businesses, were permitted to open from 17 May 2021, they are no longer subject to Covid restrictions which would require them to prohibit or significantly restrict customers from accessing their business premises.\u00a0Therefore, from that date, they ceased to qualify for support under the CRSS. However, subject to meeting the relevant criteria, a business such as a travel agent business, reopening after a period of restrictions, may claim a &ldquo;restart week payment&rdquo; under the CRSS scheme to assist it with the costs of reopening.<\/p>  <p>  For businesses reopening between 29 April 2021 and 1 June 2021, an &ldquo;enhanced restart week payment&rdquo; may be claimed, which is computed at double the normal weekly CRSS rate, for two weeks, subject to a maximum weekly amount payable of &euro;5,000.<\/p>  <p>  On 1 June, I announced that an additional business support scheme, the Business Resumption Support Scheme (BRSS), would be available for businesses whose turnover in the period from 1 September 2020 to 31 August 2021 is reduced by 75% compared with their 2019 turnover. To qualify under the scheme, a business must carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D.\u00a0The BRSS will come into operation from early September.\u00a0 Under the scheme, a qualifying business will be able to claim a cash payment calculated as three times the sum of 10% of their average weekly turnover up to &euro;20,000 and 5% on any excess of average weekly turnover above &euro;20,000, subject to a maximum payment under the scheme of &euro;15,000.<\/p>  <p>  Companies and self-employed individuals may be entitled to support under other measures put in place by Government, including the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS).

Having said that, the Deputy will appreciate that, neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, have powers around pricing or provision of insurance cover. These are commercial matters for insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and the need to make adequate provisioning to meet these risks. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive).<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these constraints, insurance reform is high on the Government&rsquo;s agenda as evidenced by the Action Plan for Insurance Reform. The Action Plan sets out 66 actions which aim to bring down costs for consumers and business; introduce more competition into the market; prevent fraud and reduce the burden that insurance costs can have on business, community and voluntary organisations.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to note that significant progress have been made in this regard. Achievement to date includes:<\/p>  <p>  - The adoption of new Personal Injuries Guidelines by the Judicial Council; and <\/p>  <p>  - The creation of an Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market within the Department of Finance.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will know, the new Personal Injuries Guidelines came into effect on 24 April. The Guidelines materially reduce award levels for many categories of common injuries, particularly those of soft tissue. As awards have been reduced, we now expect that insurance premiums should also be reduced. This is a logical consequence and it is also the commitment that the industry has made.<\/p>  <p>  Another key achievement of the reform agenda is the new Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market. Since its establishment, the Office has held meetings with wide range of stakeholders including insurance companies, representative bodies, civil society groups and other state regulators on the issues surrounding competition.

It provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid which are eligible for the subsidy payment.<\/p>  <p>  The objective of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is to support \u00a0employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. To date, payments of over &euro;3.5 billion and PRSI credit of over &euro;575 million have been granted to 50,000 employers in respect of 583,000 workers.<\/p>  <p>  I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS and, as the Deputy will be aware from announcements made on Tuesday 1st June, it has been decided that the scheme is now to be extended until the end of December 2021.<\/p>  <p>  With the agreement by Government on the revised plan, COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead, a cautious and measured approach will be taken as we lay the foundations for the full recovery of social life, public services and the economy. It is therefore appropriate that key business supports should remain in place until the end of December 2021.<\/p>  <p>  As the revised plan is implemented, the EWSS will play an important role in getting people back to work as public health restrictions are eased, thereby reducing the numbers dependent on social welfare payments over time, including the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).<\/p>  <p>  For Q3 2021, the Government has decided to broadly maintain the status quo for EWSS, including the enhanced rates of support, with a modification to widen eligibility, and maintaining the reduced rate of Employers&rsquo; PRSI of 0.5%.<\/p>  <p>  While the Government has agreed that the EWSS should be extended to end Q4 2021, it is too early as yet to prescribe the precise operational parameters of the scheme that should apply for that quarter.\u00a0 Decisions in that regard will be taken closer to the time, possibly around the end of August\/early September, with the benefit of more up-to-date information on a number of variables, including the overall epidemiological situation, progress made in reopening all sectors of the economy, the vaccine efficacy, as well as the operation of the EWSS during the early parts of Q3.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, no decisions have been taken in relation to future of the scheme beyond the end of Q4, 2021.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that, as the recovery gains further momentum, supports are further recalibrated in the longer-term interests of businesses that are in receipt of those supports and in the interests of the wider body of taxpayers. As such, and as already signalled, for Q4, consideration will be given to a future change to EWSS which will require an employer contribution towards employee wages. The precise manner in which such a change might be implemented is a matter to be considered.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, for those businesses who may need additional support during this period, I would draw attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available since the July Stimulus Plan and Budget 2021 - including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS) which has been extended, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.

From correspondence received, the BPFI has indicated that only 0.05% of mortgage applications approved by its members did not proceed to draw-down due to a lack of mortgage protection insurance. Moreover, it is my understanding that under Section 126 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995, lenders can provide a mortgage in situations where a borrower may be unable to obtain mortgage protection insurance, or where such insurance is unduly costly compared to that payable by borrowers generally.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Where a consumer feels that they are being treated unfairly, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO is a statutory official who acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it is also worth noting that Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in obtaining insurance, and it can be accessed at feedback@insuranceireland.eu.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200067#WRJ04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Bodies","counter":460,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200067#WRJ04300"},{"type":"question","counter":461,"qnumday":224,"qnumall":"[33313\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200067#WRJ04400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the State agencies, organisations or boards under the responsibility of his Department, or that receive funding from his Department, that have been charged interest for savings on deposit in Irish banks since negative interest rates were introduced; the amount of interest that has been charged to each State agency, organisation or board; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1576","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":462,"content":"<p>A number of the bodies under the aegis of my Department have incurred negative interest rate charges in Irish banks, details of which are set out below. <\/p>  <p>  Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI) was established in December 2018, at which time there was a requirement to open a number of accounts to allow day to day operations and activities to be undertaken.

However, I can assure him that Ireland has a clear and transparent statutory corporation tax regime that applies to all companies equally and raises billions in revenue each year. Taxable trading income is taxed at 12.5% in Ireland, one of the most competitive headline rates of corporation tax in the OECD. This rate is applied to a broad base &ndash; a policy which is endorsed by the likes of the OECD because it is good for economic growth. In many countries, a high statutory rate is mitigated by its application to a relatively narrow base, so producing a lower effective rate. By contrast, Ireland&rsquo;s effective tax rate of between 10% and 11% is close to the 12.5% headline rate and the difference relates to a small number of targeted tax measures provided for in legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, Revenue has no authority to depart from or supersede the law. Revenue&rsquo;s Tax and Duty Manual Parts 37-00-00a and 37-00-40 outline the procedures to be followed where taxpayers are seeking Revenue&rsquo;s advance confirmation as to how a transaction will be treated for tax purposes, based on the relevant legislation. As Revenue publishes detailed guidance, opinions should only be required in relatively limited circumstances. Nevertheless, any opinions given by Revenue are not legally binding and it is open to Revenue officials to review the position when a transaction is completed and all the facts are known. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Finally, Revenue analysis shows that foreign-owned multinationals were responsible for &euro;9.7 billion (82%) of net corporation tax receipts in 2020 and Irish-owned multinationals accounted for &euro;0.8 billion (7%) of net corporation tax receipts. Non-multinationals paid &euro;1.3 billion or 11%. Revenue analysis of 2019 tax returns also show that foreign-owned multinationals accounted for over 2.4 million employments in companies with combined income tax, USC and PRSI payments for these employees of &euro;21.5 billion. Foreign multinationals account for 32% of employment and 49% of employment taxes. In 2019, Revenue calculated the average effective tax rate for all companies as 10.3% while for foreign owned multinationals it was 11.1%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200067#WRJ06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":480,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200068#WRK00300"},{"type":"question","counter":481,"qnumday":231,"qnumall":"[33590\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200068#WRK00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of workers employed by his Department and in each office or agency under the aegis of his Department who earn less than the living wage of &euro;12.30 per hour; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1495","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":482,"content":"<p>The staff of my Department are paid in line with Government pay policy and there are currently 6 civil servants in my Department whose salaries are less than the living wage of &euro;12.30 per hour.

It currently stands at &euro;12.30 per hour according to the Living Wage Technical Group document 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The National Minimum Wage is a statutory entitlement and has a legislative basis. The Low Pay Commission annually assesses the appropriate level of the National Minimum Wage.

These groups will also benefit\u00a0more from other measures in the Agreement including the overtime rates and premia payment adjustments. By the end of the Agreement,\u00a0the annualised pay increases\u00a0will almost eliminate the cohort of civil servants\u00a0earning less than the suggested living wage.<\/p>  <p>  More broadly, the Low Pay Commission has, on request of the Government,\u00a0formally begun work on examining how Ireland could move towards a Living Wage. The study\u00a0will examine the design of a living wage in an Irish context and consider the policy, social and economic implications.

Unlike the National Minimum Wage, the Living Wage has no legislative basis and is therefore not a statutory entitlement. The Low Pay Commission annually assesses the appropriate level of the National Minimum Wage, and the current national minimum hourly rate of pay, since 1 January 2021, is &euro;10.20 per hour, as set out in\u00a0the National Minimum Wage Order (No. 2) 2020.<\/p><p>The suggested Living Wage at &euro;12.30 per hour based on the Civil Service 37 hour standard net working week equates to an annual salary of &euro;23,747.\u00a0 Detailed data on Civil Service staff indicates that only some 0.2% of staff (FTE) in the Civil Service are on salary points less than &euro;23,747.\u00a0Further to this, all civil servants are paid at rates above the minimum wage of &euro;10.20 per hour.<\/p><p>Those currently on an annual salary of less than &euro;23,747 may be receiving remuneration in excess of the suggested Living Wage through additional premium payments in respect of shift or atypical working hours or are on salary scales that progress to the suggested Living Wage and above through incremental progression. <\/p><p>Building Momentum - A New Public Service Agreement 2021-2022 provides for\u00a0a general round increase in annualised basic salary for all\u00a0public servants\u00a0of 1% or &euro;500 (whichever is greater) on both 1 October 2021 and 2022, as well as the equivalent of a 1% increase in annualised basic salaries to be used as a Sectoral Bargaining Fund (in accordance with Chapter 2 of the Agreement) on 1 February 2022. The Agreement is heavily weighted towards those at lower incomes with headline increases of approximately 5% for the lowest paid public servants.\u00a0These groups will also benefit\u00a0more from other measures in the Agreement including the overtime rates and premium payment adjustments.

Revisions will see payments for businesses reopening of up to &euro;30,000;<\/p>  <p>  - Extending the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme to 31 December;<\/p>  <p>  - Extending the Commercial Rates Waiver to end-September 2021;<\/p>  <p>  - Broadening of eligibility criteria for the Small Business Assistance Scheme for COVID-19, which opens the scheme up to businesses in non-rated premises; and<\/p>  <p>  - The ERP sets out the intention to introduce a new, additional and more streamlined business support scheme in September 2021, called the Business Resumption Support Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to benefiting from revised and extended horizontal supports, the Economic Recovery Plan also provides for an extension of the 9% VAT rate to September 2022, which\u00a0will continue to act as a stimulus for the tourism sector as it moves towards recovery.<\/p>  <p>  These measures and supports will provide tourism businesses with much-needed clarity that will enable them to plan longer-term with confidence and accept bookings.\u00a0The ERP also commits to continuing to provide\u00a0business continuity schemes through\u00a0F&aacute;ilte Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, F&aacute;ilte Ireland\u00a0ran an\u00a0Ireland Based Inbound Agents Business Continuity Scheme of &euro;10m in the final quarter of 2020.\u00a0Taking into account the new and revised horizontal supports set out in the ERP, I have asked F&aacute;ilte Ireland to examine what supports will be needed for the tourism sector in the coming months.\u00a0I\u00a0will discuss these proposed supports\u00a0with colleagues across Government to ensure that the tourism sector is supported in their recovery as we reopen our society and our economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200069#WRL02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":559,"content":"<p>Question No. 257 answered with Question No. 255.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":560,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200069#WRL02500"},{"type":"question","counter":561,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[33061\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200069#WRL02600","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"when the 2021 sports capital programme will be announced; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1518","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":562,"content":"<p>The Sports Capital and Equipment Programme (SCEP) is the primary vehicle for Government support for the development of sports and physical recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  The 2020 round of the SCEP closed\u00a0for applications on Monday 1st\u00a0March, 2021.

The supports in 2020 and again in 2021 included provision for extensive online content to be generated.

My Department also continues to expand the delivery of the Creative Ireland programme.<\/p>  <p>  In 2021, I allocated &euro;50 million for a suite of measures to assist the live performance sector aimed at supporting employment and well-being opportunities across all genres and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public.\u00a0Included in this package are the following measures:<\/p>  <p>  - I recently announced 237 grant allocations under the 2021 Live Performance Support Scheme amounting to &euro;25m. <\/p>  <p>  - An allocation of &euro;14m has been made available for the Music and Entertainment Business Assistance Scheme (MEBAS) to make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, specifically musicians and related crew, that have been negatively affected by COVID-19 and that do not qualify for other business supports.\u00a0 This Scheme is a demand led scheme and is accepting applications at present. <\/p>  <p>  - An allocation of &euro;5 million has been made available to local authorities for live performances in summer 2021 to animate town centres, should public health considerations permit.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - Up to &euro;1 million was allocated to the St Patrick's Festival 2021 for programming and it supported over 3,500 days of employment for performers, producers, artists, technicians, creatives and support staff.<\/p>  <p>  A new &euro;11.5m new fund for the entertainment industry, including festivals, conferencing and large events has been agreed between myself and the T&aacute;naiste Leo Varadkar.

The Creative Ireland Programme is a culture-based programme to promote individual, community and national well-being. Its core proposition is that participation in arts, cultural and heritage-based activities drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal wellbeing and achievement. Under the Creative Communities initiative in the Creative Ireland Programme, my Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage provide funding to Kildare and to the other 30 local authorities to implement their individual Culture and Creativity Strategies 2018-2022.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In County Kildare, the Culture and Creativity Team is made up of local authority-defined positions including the Librarian, Arts Officer, Heritage Officer, Irish Language Officer and Climate Action Officer along with economic development staff. To support the implementation of their Culture and Creativity Strategy, Kildare County Council has been allocated funding on an annual to implement their Strategy.\u00a0This includes access to targeted funding streams to facilitate engagement in creative ways to address societal issues such as those related to climate action, positive ageing and health and well-being. For example in 2021, Kildare County Council successfully applied for additional funding of &euro;26,810 under the Creativity in Older Age scheme for an initiative that supports positive ageing groups in communities in Kildare to explore, discuss and question artworks from the Kildare County Council Municipal Art Collection.<\/p>  <p>  Funding for local authorities for commemorative events under the Decade of Centenaries can be applied to appropriate cultural events under the creative imagination strand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200069#WRL06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"question","counter":599,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[33489\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200070#WRM00300","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which she continues to have dialogue with stakeholders in the entertainment sector with a view to alleviating insofar as is possible the hardship brought about as a result of Covid-19 and the utilisation of online performances in the short-term to keep the industry alive; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":600,"content":"<p>I have been very cognisant of the fact that the arts and culture sectors have been amongst the hardest hit by the necessary restrictions required to deal with COVID-19.\u00a0I and my officials have been in regular and ongoing communication with stakeholders over the past 15 months to fully understand the challenges posed by COVID-19.\u00a0 I established a\u00a0number of taskforces and consultative stakeholder fora to ensure that the most up to date information is available to me about the difficulties facing the sector.

This workshop aims to reduce the high dropout rate of teenage girls from sport by upskilling and educating the coaches.<\/p>  <p>  Sport Ireland is also funding school-based initiatives as part of the &lsquo;Get Ireland Running&rsquo;, &lsquo;Get Ireland Swimming&rsquo; and &lsquo;Get Ireland Cycling&rsquo; programmes in line with the National Sport Policy commitment to prioritise these sports as they have the greatest potential for generating high levels of active participation across the life course.<\/p>  <p>  The European School Sports Day (ESSD) will take place on September 24th 2021. As part of the European Week of Sport 2021, Sport Ireland plans to support the Irish Primary PE Association (IPPEA) to coordinate the ESSD. The IPPEA have been invited to apply for funding supports and the application review process is currently underway. The IPPEA plan to grow the event from last year, reaching more students and schools. They have already held workshops with schools focusing on the sustainability of their activities following the ESSD. They also plan to continue with competitions for physical education equipment for schools, to drive further engagement.<\/p>  <p>  Sport Ireland and my Department, in collaboration with the educational authorities, will continue to support these and other initiatives to get young people more active in our schools and in our communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200070#WRM02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1475"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":617,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200070#WRM02100"},{"type":"question","counter":618,"qnumday":277,"qnumall":"[33575\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200070#WRM02200","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the allocation her Department made to F&aacute;ilte Ireland in 2020 and 2021.","asker":"1497","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":619,"content":"<p>Details (at subhead level) of the annual funding allocations provided by my Department to F&aacute;ilte Ireland are available in the annual Revised Estimates Volume published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.\u00a0The subheads of relevance to F&aacute;ilte Ireland in 2021\u00a0are A3, A6 and A5 (shared with Tourism Ireland) and further detail is available in the Agency Statement for F&aacute;ilte Ireland in the Revised Estimates Volumes.\u00a0 In 2020 the subheads of relevance were E3, E6 and E5.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200070#WRM02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"question","counter":621,"qnumday":278,"qnumall":"[33576\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200070#WRM02500","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the allocation her Department made to Tourism Ireland in 2020 and 2021.","asker":"1497","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":622,"content":"<p>Tourism Ireland is funded through the Department of Tourism,\u00a0Culture, Arts,\u00a0Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and the Department for the Economy in Northern Ireland.

The Programme commits to putting affordability at the heart of the housing system through the progression of State-backed affordable housing.  <\/p><p>This commitment is reflected in Budget 2021, which provides for an overall investment of &euro;3.3 billion for the delivery of housing programmes.  This represents an increase of &euro;641m or 24% on 2020 and the single biggest spend on housing by any Government to fund the largest build programme, in the history of the State.  <\/p><p>Importantly, &euro;110 million of this amount will be provided to deliver a new national Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme for first time buyers and a new funding model to accelerate the delivery of cost rental homes through the Approved Housing Body sector. <\/p><p>&euro;75 million is allocated for the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme, aimed at first-time buyers buying new-build homes on private land. It will enable first-time buyers to buy a new home at a price they can afford, much sooner than would otherwise have been the case. The equity stake will fill the gap between the mortgage people can get, and the price of a new home. In so doing, it will build confidence in the construction sector to increase housing supply. The proposed price caps for the equity scheme are reflective of the median price of a new home bought by first-time buyers, and are targeted to address the affordability gap in different areas.  It is anticipated that the Scheme will be supported and operated in partnership with the retail banks - depending on the final design, this will allow support for c.1,500 to 2,000 households to buy new homes in the first year.<\/p><p>The new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) is the first dedicated funding stream for Cost Rental housing in Ireland. CREL will assist Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) in developing or acquiring new homes for Cost Rental, to accelerate implementation of this new housing sector in the immediate term. The scheme harnesses the expertise and capacity of AHBs, amply demonstrated in the provision of social housing, and builds a foundation for further AHB involvement in Cost Rental.<\/p><p>Under the CREL scheme, the Housing Agency will make loans available to AHBs on very favourable terms to cover up to 30% of the development or acquisition costs of new homes for Cost Rental. The Budget allocation of &euro;35 million is intended to assist the delivery and tenanting of c. 350 new homes this year, on top of the 50 new Cost Rental apartments scheduled for delivery later this year at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside.<\/p><p>To date, my Department has issued two broad-based Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) calls for proposals to local authorities. Funding of almost &euro;200 million has been approved in principle in support of 40 infrastructure projects in 14 local authority areas across 9 counties, to assist in the delivery of almost 4,200 affordable homes for purchase or for rent.<\/p><p>Details of 35 SSF projects which received approval in principle under the two SSF calls to date are available on the Rebuilding Ireland website as follows:<\/p><p>Call 1.<\/p><p>Call 2 .<\/p><p>In addition to these projects, approval in principle has also been given to five further applications for SSF funding, namely, Dublin City Council&rsquo;s projects in Emmet Road and Oscar Traynor Road, Fingal County Council&rsquo;s projects in Ballymastone, Donabate, and Hayestown, Rush and Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council&rsquo;s project in Shanganagh.<\/p><p>In making an application for SSF, each local authority must demonstrate that an affordability issue exists in the area in question and that it is viable to deliver homes, for purchase or rent, with a price reduction of at least 10% below open market values.<\/p><p>In addition, the Land Development Agency is tasked with working with Government Departments, Local Authorities, state agencies, and other stakeholders to assemble strategic sites in urban areas and ensure the sustainable development of social and affordable homes for rent and purchase. On its establishment, the LDA had access to an initial portfolio of 8 sites that have near term delivery potential for approximately 3,400 new homes. Whilst the tenure mix for these homes has not been finalised, the LDA will have regard to Government policy, and all appropriate legislation, in considering the appropriate tenure mix for developments on public land, as well as the criteria for the operation of cost rental and affordable housing schemes. All these measures are designed to increase housing supply at a time when needed most. <\/p><p>Finally, the Government has also approved the drafting of amending provisions to Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, for inclusion in the Affordable Housing Bill 2021 as Committee Stage amendments. This will see an increase in the current 10% social housing requirement related to all new housing developments to a mandatory 20% for social and affordable requirements. <\/p><p>Finally, the Government&rsquo;s upcoming Housing strategy &lsquo;Housing for All&rsquo; will detail an extensive range of measures and ambitious targets to underpin the delivery of affordable housing over the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200071#WRN03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defective Building Materials","counter":685,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200071#WRN03200"},{"type":"question","counter":686,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[32994\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200071#WRN03300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that houses in County Limerick are impacted by pyrite; if he will include County Limerick in the compensation scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1493","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":687,"content":"<p>The Dwellings Damaged by the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks in Construction (Remediation) (Financial Assistance) Regulations 2020\u00a0provide for a grant scheme of financial assistance to support affected homeowners in the counties of Donegal and Mayo only,\u00a0to carry out the necessary remediation works to dwellings that have been damaged due to the use of defective concrete blocks.\u00a0 The regulations came in to operation on 31 January 2020 and it has been open for applications since the end of June 2020.

A nominal interest rate of 2% fixed per annum is charged by the local authority on the initial capital amount. Repayments on either the capital or interest are not required during the term of the loan (between 10 and 30 years), although where an AHB chooses to, repayments can be made during the term.

Approved Housing Bodies to utilise existing vacant housing stock throughout the country as social housing.\u00a0 The scheme is targeted at owners of\u00a0\u00a0vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring\u00a0their properties up to the required standard for a rental property.\u00a0 The maximum loan for property repair available under the Repair and\u00a0Lease Scheme has recently been increased by my Department from &euro;40,000 to &euro;60,000. \u00a0This increase allows for greater access\u00a0 to the scheme for owners of properties that require more extensive

community.\u00a0 It provides\u00a0the option for\u00a0suitable properties to be purchased by local authorities, rather\u00a0than\u00a0leased, if that is the preference of the owners. <\/p><p>-

The Board is fully independent in the\u00a0performance of these statutory functions. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2020, primary responsibility for compliance of works with the requirements of the Building Regulations rests with the owners, designers and builders of buildings.<\/p>  <p>  Since the introduction of Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, (BCAR), greater accountability is required in relation to compliance with Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction by registered construction professionals and builders, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates. This legislation empowers competence and professionalism in construction projects and establishes a chain of responsibility that begins with the owner. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2020, Building Control Authorities have strong powers of inspection, enforcement and prosecution. As such, the number of inspections is a matter for local authorities, who are independent in the use of their statutory powers the Acts.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the agreed Performance Indicators for Local Government and the Code of Practice for Inspecting and Certifying Buildings and Works, Building Control Authorities are required to carry out a level of inspection equivalent to 12% to 15% of new buildings for which valid commencement notices have been received. The National Oversight &amp;amp; Audit Commission (NOAC) collects and publishes this data. The Performance Indicators in Local Authorities reports are available at http:\/\/noac.ie\/noac-reports\/.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The National Building Control Office (NBCO) within Dublin City Council\u00a0provides oversight, direction and support for the development, standardisation and implementation of Building Control as an effective shared service in the 31 Building Control Authorities. \u00a0My Department is working with the NBCO on a review of the inspection policy for building control. It is intended that\u00a0the new policy will position Building Control Authorities to carry out risk-based targeted inspections by making more efficient and effective use of the available resources. Much progress has been made on this review, an\u00a0inspections protocol and\u00a0methodology has been developed\u00a0and a pilot IT system to\u00a0support\u00a0inspections has also been developed. The issue of\u00a0targets and capacity\u00a0will be\u00a0considered further in this context of this policy review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200072#WRO04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":755,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200072#WRO04200"},{"type":"question","counter":756,"qnumday":325,"qnumall":"[33413\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200072#WRO04300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the amount of funding allocated to each local authority for the housing adaption grant for people with a disability scheme and for the disabled persons grant scheme; if local authorities have discretion to use funds from one scheme to meet demand under the other scheme according to local need; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":757,"content":"<p>In respect of the Disabled Persons Grants Scheme for local\u00a0authority\u00a0tenants or persons on local authority housing waiting lists, 2021 funding allocations were issued in early May to all local authorities and are available publicly at the following link: <\/p><p>Separately, funding allocations\u00a0for 2021 under the Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability Scheme, for private houses, were issued to all local authorities on 1 March and\u00a0are publicly available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following\u00a0link:<\/p><p>Each scheme operates independently of the other with Disabled Person Grants applicable to\u00a0local authority owned homes\u00a0and the\u00a0Housing Adaptation Grants available for homes in private ownership.

There is considerable scope for economic ties to develop further and I was pleased to note a 8.5% increase in exports to Malaysia between 2020 and 2021. <\/p>  <p>  Malaysia is a key member of ASEAN. At Monday&rsquo;s Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg, I highlighted the importance of increased bilateral engagement with ASEAN member states as well as regional engagement with ASEAN following the recently agreed ASEAN\/EU Strategic Partnership.<\/p>  <p>  I last met His Excellency Zakaria Nasir, Ambassador of Malaysia to Ireland, in October 2020 as part of a remote consultation with the ASEAN Dublin Committee. We held a constructive discussion on the topics of Brexit, COVID-19, the UN Security Council and Ireland&rsquo;s Asia Pacific strategy. Though I have not yet spoken formally to Ambassador Nasir in 2021, officials from my Department&rsquo;s Asia Pacific Unit met remotely with the Ambassador earlier this year and are in ongoing contact with the Embassy as issues arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200073#WRP01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Policy","counter":786,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200073#WRP01700"},{"type":"question","counter":787,"qnumday":335,"qnumall":"[33101\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200073#WRP01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on recent developments internationally particularly with regard to Ethiopia and the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1572","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":788,"content":"<p>Ireland is closely following developments in Ethiopia, including on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), Tigray and elections.<\/p>  <p>  The construction of the GERD in Ethiopia is the cause of escalating tension between Ethiopia on the one hand, and Sudan and Egypt on the other, and poses a significant potential challenge to regional peace and security. As a member of the UN Security Council, and given our friendly relations with Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan, Ireland has been closely monitoring efforts to facilitate dialogue between the parties.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland recognises that the GERD is of critical significance for the three countries. We support the continued leadership of the Africa Union (AU) in facilitating negotiations to find an equitable and peaceful solution. Ireland supports the active role played by the EU in supporting the AU-led negotiation process. <\/p>  <p>  I remain extremely concerned by the ongoing conflict in Tigray. \u00a0Notwithstanding commitments made, the situation on the ground is worsening. An immediate ceasefire is the most important step all parties can take. In this regard, it is imperative that Eritrean forces leave Tigray immediately.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am alarmed by credible warnings of famine. \u00a0I am also concerned by attacks on humanitarian workers. There is an urgent need for full humanitarian access. \u00a0Ireland joined recent international calls for a humanitarian ceasefire to allow for planting and to avert the risk of famine.<\/p>  <p>  We support the work of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, with the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission, to investigate reported atrocities, including widespread and systematic sexual violence. \u00a0It is vital that perpetrators be held to account. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland continues to work on the UN Security Council to ensure a focus on the situation in Tigray. Most recently, on 15 June, we called an informal meeting of the Security Council that focused on the humanitarian situation, having led the negotiation in April of a Council press statement on the situation in Tigray, the first time the Security Council spoke publicly on the crisis. We have also used Council thematic discussions on conflict and hunger, and on conflict-related sexual violence, to highlight these aspects of the crisis. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  We continue to support a strong and constructive EU response to the crisis. Minister Coveney also continues to engage with key interlocutors on the situation, including in the region, the Gulf, as well as the AU.<\/p>  <p>  The Department, through Irish Aid, has provided over &euro;3.2 million to support the humanitarian response in Tigray and the refugee response in neighbouring Sudan, through our UN and NGO partners on the ground.\u00a0 Further Irish Aid humanitarian support is under active consideration.<\/p>  <p>  Ethnically-motivated conflict in Ethiopia beyond Tigray is also of concern, including in the context of the national elections which partially took place on 21 June. In advance of the elections, the EU issued a statement highlighting concerns about the situation on the ground, including ongoing violence, human rights violations and political tensions, harassment of media workers and detention of opposition members. \u00a0The exclusion of large segments of the electorate was troubling, and we remain concerned that the situation on the ground was not conducive to a credible, inclusive and transparent electoral process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200073#WRP01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1573"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"United Nations","counter":789,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200073#WRP02000"},{"type":"question","counter":790,"qnumday":336,"qnumall":"[33125\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200073#WRP02100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if Ireland will propose a call for a global ban on fracking at the United Nations General Assembly on climate mitigation, public health, environmental protection and human rights grounds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Review also referenced the training needs of SNAs.\u00a0 In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.\u00a0 The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the specific complex needs of some students being cared for by SNAs would also be provided.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by the Department. It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  A public procurement competition was held for the development and delivery of a new national training programme for SNAs. A detailed specification of need and learning outcomes was developed and published for the competition. Formal accreditation to the National Qualifications Framework was not a requirement for the programme. Following evaluation of the tenders received, the contract was awarded to University College Dublin (UCD) School of Education, in conjunction with UCD School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  UCD has a strong reputation in the world of education and training.\u00a0 It brings with it a wealth of experience and research knowledge in the training and has very strong quality assurance arrangements for its programmes.\u00a0 Feedback from programme participants is a key feature of this quality assurance process.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  This new programme aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The programme consists of five modules, delivered online over a 10-month period.

This is an annual grant to support learning in the context of DEIS for the academic year. In recognition of the difficulties faced by some students to engage with remote learning, at the time the grant issued last year all DEIS schools were informed by letter that they could consider using some of their DEIS funding to support pupils&rsquo; learning, for example to arrange access to additional materials of supports for students during the move to remote teaching and learning caused by Covid-19. It is a matter for each individual school to determine how best to use this funding, but it is intended to support the objectives of the DEIS programme. <\/p>  <p>  Schools are asked to be conscious of students who may not have access to online facilities or technology and to adapt approaches to ensure that these pupils&rsquo; ability to participate in learning is not compromised. Schools in the DEIS programme are asked to use all available supports, both in-school and community-based, to promote a positive solution-oriented approach that will support all pupils to achieve, to learn and to progress in their education and to help minimise any further educational inequality among those at risk of educational disadvantage.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Under the Schools Broadband Access Scheme my Department will continue to fund the provision of broadband services to schools and upgrade services to existing schools as the opportunity arises. Currently some 98% of schools are provided with broadband connectivity through the Scheme.

This project will comprise up to 1,100 primary schools, while some 679 primary schools are in the National Broadband Plan Intervention Area (NBP IA), with the balance of schools in areas where commercial provision will provide the infrastructure for high speed connectivity.

I have also extended the Employee Assistance Service to all school staff. <\/p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under grant schemes. Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.  As a result my Department does not hold data on the estimated 15,000 staff concerned and is not in a position to provide costings. In terms of the current claim for secretaries and caretakers, my Department has recently completed a data gathering exercise in respect of school secretaries and caretakers paid by grant-funding which will inform costings of this claim. <\/p>  <p>  An arbitration agreement was implemented for secretaries and caretakers over 2015-2019 which was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019 been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. <\/p>  <p>  F&oacute;rsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim from that agreement seeking public sector status, including a pay scale and access to pension schemes, for secretaries and caretakers. Officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and School Management Bodies have been engaging with F&oacute;rsa on the claim which does not include any other similarly employed school staff such as cleaners.<\/p>  <p>  On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues raised in the F&oacute;rsa claim. Several key strands have been identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals. The parties continue to engage under the auspices of the WRC and I support meaningful engagement on this issue by all parties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200074#WRQ06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":897,"content":"<p>Question No. 370 answered with Question No. 369.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":898,"content":"<p>Question No. 371 answered with Question No. 369.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":899,"content":"<p>Question No. 372 answered with Question No. 369.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":900,"content":"<p>Question No. 373 answered with Question No. 369.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":901,"content":"<p>Question No. 374 answered with Question No. 369.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Equipment","counter":902,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200075#WRR00700"},{"type":"question","counter":903,"qnumday":375,"qnumall":"[33166\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200075#WRR00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the estimated cost of installing an air monitor in every school classroom.","asker":"1460","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":904,"content":"<p>The importance of good ventilation is an increasing and important aspect of public health advice on managing Covid-19 risks and this led to the establishment of an Expert Group by the Department of Health.<\/p><p>A sub-group of the main Expert Group focussed exclusively on the issue of improving and monitoring ventilation in schools.<\/p><p>This report formed the based for the most recent updating of the ventilation guidance for schools and included recommendations in relation to strengthening the message about the importance of good ventilation, the use of CO2 monitors and, where considered necessary, air cleaners.<\/p><p>A link to the published guidance and the associated background information is available at:<\/p><p>-  www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/ad236-guidance-on-ventilation-in-schools\/.<\/p><p>-  www.gov.ie\/ga\/foilsiuchan\/aerala-i-scoileanna\/.<\/p><p>The use of CO2 monitors can provide a useful general indication that areas\/rooms within a building may not be adequately ventilated and can enable occupants to become familiar with the impact that activities, outdoor weather and window openings have on levels of good ventilation within a room.

It monitors PSPs compliance in accordance with the provisions of the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 and its associated Regulations.<\/p>  <p>  There is no legislation in place that would allow the PRSA to advise estate agents to request sight of a prospective house buyers exact funds rather than their mortgage approval when arranging viewings or bidding on a property. There are no provisions in the 2011 Act or its associated Regulations relating to agents requesting personal or financial information.<\/p>  <p>  Following on from the Government&rsquo;s publication of the Plan for Living with Covid-19 and Department of Health and HSE Guidelines, the PSRA, in conjunction with IPAV, the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers and the SCSI, the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland published the guidance document &lsquo;Property Services Providers Guidance to Implementing the Plan for Living with Covid 19&rsquo; to provide guidance to PSPs on how to safely manage business continuity during the Covid 19 pandemic. This document sets out measures to be taken at the different levels of the Government&rsquo;s plan on Living with Covid-19. This guidance, approved by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, sets out at Level 4 and 5 of the Plan that viewings should only take place where proof of funds was available. This measure was advised to protect the health and safety of all parties and is no longer required as the restrictions in place have been reduced from level 5 to level 3 effective 10 May 2021. At no time where proof of funds was requested, was there a requirement for information on the amount of exact funds approved to be provided. The provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018 continued to apply in the course of the provision of property services. <\/p>  <p>  The GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 place obligations on data controllers including PSPs, to ensure that all of the principles of data protection law are complied with. I understand that the PSRA and the Data Protection Commission (DPC), which is an independent body established under the Data Protection Act 2018, have engaged on this issue and the DPC has issued targeted guidance in this area in recent days.  <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, Section 61 of the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011, requires PSPs to retain a record of all offers received in respect of a sale of property other than by auction, for a period of not less than six years. The Minimum Standards Statutory Instrument which was commenced in November 2020, further strengthened the Regulations in relation to the recording of offers, where PSPs are now required to provide written confirmation to each offer or on receipt of an offer and a PSP is not permitted to express or imply to any person, that an offer on a property has been received, unless that offer has been received by the PSP. The PSRA has powers under the Act, to inspect such records as part of an investigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200080#WRW05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Speech","counter":1233,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200080#WRW05100"},{"type":"question","counter":1234,"qnumday":487,"qnumall":"[33496\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200080#WRW05200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent to which her Department can protect the freedom of speech and at the same time protect against the use of such freedom to incite hatred; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1235,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, incitement to hatred is a criminal offence under the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989.<\/p>  <p>  Justice Plan 2021 commits to introducing new legislation to deal with hate crime and incitement to hatred by the end of this year.

This places a potentially onerous burden on family successors and could challenge the future viability of these productive assets.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, the Department of Health has proposed a policy change to the Scheme, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at three years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset. The stated policy objective of the legislation is to introduce additional safeguards in the Scheme to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for their livelihood. <\/p>  <p>  The definition of relevant business in the 2021 Bill is unchanged from the existing definition in the Principal Act. It has been altered only to remove the qualification that the definition is solely relevant in the context of applicants with relevant businesses who enter care because of sudden illness or disability.

The most recent agreement was the <i>Framework Agreement on the Supply of Medicines to the Health Services 2016-2020<\/i>(FASPM). <\/p><p>The HSE has statutory responsibility for medicine pricing and reimbursement decisions, in accordance with <i>The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013<\/i>. The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines, including provision for the existence of any framework agreements in place. <\/p><p>Savings generated from the powers afforded to the HSE under the Health Act 2013 relating to Reference Pricing and Interchangeability of generic medicines falls outside the remit of the FASPM. Similarly, HSE activities to optimise the use of biosimilars in Ireland are separate to this Agreement. <\/p><p>For example, the prescribing of Best Value Biologic medicines is leading to significant savings for the health service under the Gain-Share Initiative. By December 2020, almost 12,000 patients have switched to a best-value-biologic (BvB), almost 57% of the claims submitted to PCRS for payment was for the BvB alternative to the originator biologic and associated annual savings in excess of &euro;46 million has been achieved.  <\/p><p>The current FASPM was due to end in July 2020; however, due to COVID-19 it was necessary to implement an extension. The Department of Health, along with our partners in the Department of Public Expenditure and the HSE, agreed with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) an extension on the terms of the existing 2016-2020. This remains in place until 31 July 2021 to facilitate preparatory work on the successor agreement within the context of the ongoing COVID-19 challenges.<\/p><p>My Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE are presently engaged in preparatory work with a view to initiating negotiations on a successor agreement later this year.

Expenditure on medicines represents one of the largest areas of expenditure across the health service and will continue to grow in the years ahead.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health is fully supportive of domestic policies that maximise efficiency in our medicines usage.

In the health sector, the HSE has deployed rapid antigen tests for use for specific indications in the acute hospital setting, and as part of the response to outbreaks in the community setting, supported by appropriate clinical governance and operational arrangements. This includes updating the case definition for SARS-CoV-2 to accept notification of positive results from rapid antigen tests undertaken in the public health system and reporting of such cases to the COVID Care tracker and to the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) information system developed to manage the surveillance and control of infectious diseases in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Operational planning is also underway in the HSE in relation to the piloting of testing using RADTs in education and childcare settings. This includes development of guidance documentation, a training programme and other related templates and resources to support the testing pathway for educational facilities. The antigen assay to use for the pilot has been selected and stakeholder engagement is ongoing.

In the first place, licences remain in place for three years and circumstances may change in that time. Land may change hands or other land-use opportunities may be availed of, and indeed, some licences may be purely speculative from the outset.  <\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that delays in issuing licences for thinning and felling may have some part to play in influencing planting decisions. I take very seriously the need to improve licensing output and it an issue of the utmost importance for Minister of State Hackett, who has responsibility for forestry, and myself.  <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, Project Woodland, which was launched in February this year, has been set up with the objective of reviewing and improving  the efficiency and effectiveness of the forestry licensing system, as well as the creation of a shared national vision for forestry and the development of a new Forest Strategy. <\/p>  <p>  Two working groups in particular are looking at the licensing situation. Working Group 1 is tasked with looking at the backlog.  This Group  has examined in detail the cases on hand and is producing specific recommendations for improving output, including a definition of the backlog, which will be brought to the Project Board for consideration. Working Group 4 is concentrating on licensing process improvement. A business analyst has commenced work on an end-to-end process review.  In addition, proposals for a pre-application process and a planning grant  are under development  and will be submitted to the Project Board shortly. The Group is also actively considering how best to conduct a regulatory review of the licensing system. <\/p>  <p>While these initiatives are being worked on, we continue to issue licences and engage in a process of continuous improvement. The extra resources invested in and new streamlined procedures for dealing with appropriate assessment cases have resulted in gains in output. To 18th June, a total of 1,594 licences have issued, which is  27%  ahead of the same period last year.  In terms of timber volumes, the  Department has issued licences for 3.14 million cubic metres. Overall, 971 tree felling licences have issued to date, of which 47% are private felling licences.  I expect to maintain this momentum for the rest of the year and to reach the target of issuing 4,500 licences, which is a 75% increase on last year&rsquo;s licencing output. <\/p>  <p>  Communication is another important aspect of Project Woodland and Working Group 3 is working on a new Customer Charter for forestry, and the development of a communication strategy. A review of the organisational structure of the forestry division within the Department will also be carried out and the roles and interaction with COFORD, Teagasc and Coillte will be examined.<\/p>  <p>  Working Group 2 is also developing a public engagement strategy as part of the development of the new Forest Strategy. It is envisaged that all stakeholders in the forestry sector as well as the general public will be included in this process, and this should help identify both opportunities and barriers to afforestation.  Furthermore, Irish Rural Link has been commissioned by Minister Hackett to conduct a study to determine the level  and type of engagement of communities with forestry and to make recommendations for the future. <\/p>  <p>  The Forestry Policy group is meeting later this week at which a full update on progress to date will be provided to all stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that the framework now in place under Project Woodland will deliver on its objectives and I am hopeful that this will provide encouragement to farmers and landowners to go into forestry, or to realise the planting licences they have already received,  and to avail of the attractive premiums available under the Department&rsquo;s Schemes. It is a land-use which can be complementary to a productive farming enterprise, and can provide a valuable additional income support stream.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is also working to ensure that there is integration between Agri-Environment schemes in CAP and the new Forestry Programme.  It is intended that tree planting measures will form part of the new Agri-Environment schemes.  The transitional REAP scheme (a results-based payment approach for grasslands) has for instance tree planting as a complementary action.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to re-iterate my commitment to forestry and to delivering a service and conditions that will benefit all those involved in the sector and, in particular, landowners and farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200088#WREE01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1683,"content":"<p>Question No. 640 answered with Question No. 639.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":1685,"qnumday":641,"qnumall":"[33278\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062200088#WREE01400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will address a matter regarding harvesting plans (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1686,"content":"<p>The control of tree felling is regulated under the Forestry Act, 2014 and the Forestry Regulations, 2017 (SI number 191\/2017).\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The provision of a harvest plan at application stage is not a legal requirement.\u00a0 However, applicants are encouraged to include them with their licence application.\u00a0 Where not provided at application stage, the Department often subsequently requires a harvest plan or other information about the felling so that it can satisfy itself that that the project will not have an adverse effect on the environment.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In June 2019, a Harvest Plan template\u00a0was developed for the sector and Circular 11 of 2019 encouraged its use.\u00a0 DAFM Circular 18 of 2020 confirms that, for sites that are screened in for Appropriate Assessment,\u00a0a well-developed Harvest Plan (or equivalent) is essential, as it is likely to inform part or all of the site level mitigation associated with the appropriate assessment.
