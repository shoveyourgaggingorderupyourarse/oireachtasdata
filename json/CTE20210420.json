The expenditure is divided across four expenditure programmes.  These correspond to the four key strategic objectives set out in the  Department&rsquo;s statement of strategy for 2016&ndash;2019.  The programme of farm and agri-food sector schemes and controls accounted for over half of the spending.<\/p> <p>  Apart from the activities funded under the Vote, the Department is also the accredited paying agency in Ireland for EU payments to farmers and to the agri-food sector.  Co-funded scheme payments are accounted for in the Vote Appropriation Account.  EU payments directly to farmers, including the single farm payment, are accounted for separately from the Vote.  A summary of the EU-related transactions is disclosed in note 6.1 of the Appropriation Account.  In total, EU payments amounted to just under &euro;1.6 billion for 2019.<\/p> <p>  Each year, the Department provides substantial funding for several public bodies operating under its aegis.  These include Teagasc, An Bord Bia, the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, and R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann, RCE.<\/p> <p>  By year end, net expenditure under the Vote was &euro;98.4 million less than had been provided for 2019.  With the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, &euro;19.8 million in unspent capital allocations was carried over for spending in 2020.  This related mainly to spending shortfalls under the subheads for forestry, and for agriculture and food development and promotion.  The remainder of the surplus for the year, &euro;78.6 million, was liable for surrender to the Exchequer.<\/p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the Appropriation Account.  However, I drew attention to disclosures in the statement on internal financial control of non-compliance with procurement rules that occurred in respect of contracts that operated in 2019 to the value of &euro;3.8 million.  The statement on internal financial control also discloses significant financial risks faced by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, as well as the steps taken to address those risks.<\/p> <p>  The Department is directly responsible for the management of the six statutorily-designated fishery harbour centres, which are important economic infrastructure distributed around the coastline.  While the harbours are organisationally part of the Department, the relevant legislation requires that separate financial statements are produced for the transactions and activities located there.  The day-to-day operations of the centres are funded through harbour dues and user charges as set by law, and rents from State-owned properties. The financial statements for 2019 indicate that the operational receipts of the harbours totalled &euro;5.7 million, while operating payments were &euro;4.8 million.  In addition, significant annual capital grant funding is made available from the Exchequer, via the Vote, for the development and maintenance of harbour facilities.  Capital payments in 2019 totalled &euro;28.7 million, mainly in respect of major capital projects then under way in Castletownbere and Killybegs.<\/p> <p>  Following a reorganisation of departmental responsibilities in 2007, the Department assumed responsibility for marine matters, including the fishery harbours.  Some difficulties arose with the transfer, and one result was a serious delay in the presentation of the financial statements.  At worst, there was a delay of almost two and a half years between the end of the year of account and the production of audited financial statements.  As a result, I issued a special report in 2014 about the financial management and reporting for the fishery harbour centres.  This included a set of seven recommendations that I considered needed to be implemented.  All the recommendations were accepted by the Accounting Officer in 2014.  The recommendations were subsequently endorsed by the Committee of Public Accounts, following a hearing to examine the special report.  Each year subsequently, we have monitored the progress being made in implementing the recommendations.<\/p> <p>  The report before the committee today documents the situation as of September 2020.  I am glad to report that the Department has made significant improvement in the timeliness of its financial reporting for the fishery harbour centres.  However, there is scope for further improvement, and I recommend the setting of a target date for earlier presentation of the financial statements.<\/p><p> The Department had made progress by September 2020 in implementing all of the special report&rsquo;s recommendations.  However, there are a number of areas where we found further action needs to be taken.  This includes bringing the format of financial reporting into line with standard accounting practice, the undertaking of a formal review of the merits of possible alternative governance structures for the centres and the cyclical review and revision of user charges.<\/p><p> I also concluded that the Department should have taken a more structured approach to monitoring the implementation of the recommendations.  Had it done that, I believe better and earlier progress could have been made and I would not have needed to report for a second time on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021042000002#A00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618939800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for giving me the opportunity to address the committee.  I would like to refer to the Department&rsquo;s appropriation account for 2019 and chapter 10 of the report on the accounts of the public service 2019 on financial management and reporting for fishery harbour centres.<\/p> <p>  I will begin with the appropriation account.  The Department&rsquo;s gross estimate for 2019 was &euro;1.678 billion, which included a carryover of capital savings of &euro;22 million from 2018.  In all, this represented an overall increase of &euro;92 million over the corresponding figure for 2018.  The gross outturn was &euro;1.635 billion, an increase of &euro;89 million over 2018.  The Department received a technical Supplementary Estimate to further address emerging priorities.  This provided extra funding that was partly offset by additional appropriations-in-aid and also facilitated the transfer of funds within the Vote.  I will refer to this in my later remarks.<\/p> <p>  The Department also receives appropriations-in-aid, which are significant in 2019 in the overall financial outcome.  These principally comprise EU receipts in respect of rural development, seafood development and animal disease programmes.  In 2019, these receipts amounted to &euro;388.4 million, some &euro;55 million more than the estimate of &euro;333 million.  The difference was substantially because of the timing of payments from the EU in respect of its co-funding of rural development programme schemes as one of the receipts that was expected in January 2020 was received in December 2019.<\/p> <p>  Turning back to expenditure, the Department&rsquo;s Vote is divided into four programmes, each representing a key policy priority.  Programme A relates to the food safety, animal health and welfare and plant health programmes that underpin our agrifood sector.  These include: disease eradication programmes such as those relating to TB or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, TSEs; testing for residues in food products; on farm controls; plant protection controls; and other such headings.  Programme expenditure under this heading, excluding staff and administration costs, amounted to &euro;93 million in 2019.  Staff costs constitute almost half of the expenditure on this programme and this programme accounts for more than half of the Department&rsquo;s total payroll.  This reflects the very strong investment we have in the skills, expertise and commitment of our staff who are the foundation of the food safety regime upon which our agrifood sector is so dependent.<\/p> <p>  Programme B covers our major farm support schemes other than the basic payments scheme, which is entirely EU funded.  By and large, these schemes are intended to encourage sustainable agricultural practices and most of them, apart from the forestry programme, receive co-funding from the EU under the rural development programme.  The final allocation for these schemes in 2019 following a Supplementary Estimate, came to just over &euro;893 million.  This included additional spend on the beef exceptional aid measure, an EU support scheme for the Irish beef sector in response to market conditions.  The supplementary also allowed for savings elsewhere to be allocated for extra spending on the green, low-carbon, agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and the targeted agriculture modernisation schemes, TAMS.  In 2019, other co-funded schemes included the areas of national constraint scheme, the organics scheme and the forestry programme, which alone among these schemes is 100% nationally funded.  The capital carryover into 2020 from 2019 was partly drawn from the forestry savings in 2019.  The eventual outturn for this programme was &euro;874 million, some &euro;50 million more than the previous year.  That reflects the mature stage we had reached in the rural development programme, which has helped us to make a large portion of scheme year payments within the same calendar year.<\/p> <p>  Programme C, policy and strategy, includes expenditure on research and training and a number of food support schemes and grants to some of our State agencies.  It also included a number of additional measures designed to help build resilience in the sector confronted by Brexit.  This included supports for food companies but due to the extension of the Brexit deadline to 2020, demand remained low for those schemes.  The Supplementary Estimate was availed of to transfer savings that emerged in various parts of the Vote to respond to a specific request from the World Food Programme for early payment of our 2020 commitment under the strategic partnership agreement.  This resulted in total payments of &euro;25.3 million to the World Food Programme in 2019.  Overall, the programme C outturn of &euro;356.7 million was &euro;10 million less than the voted allocation.<\/p> <p>  Programme D relates to the seafood sector.  Expenditure under the programme part of this heading in 2019 amounted to &euro;142 million, or 99% of the Estimate.  The next piece relates to sea-fisheries and harbours.  In order to meet the time allowance, I will terminate my contribution and deal with any questions that arise in the mean time.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021042000002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gleeson"},{"type":"speech","time":1618939800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Hopefully, members will have read the presentation prior to the meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021042000002#B00300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1618939800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I welcome our witnesses and thank them for their attendance.

In general, we found a reasonably high level of compliance.  In addition to that we facilitated serial testing at those plants.  There were several rounds of testing of staff with PCR tests once a month.  There have been three or four rounds of that and at the last round the level of infection was 0.36% for the staff, which is lower than the current community rate, but it is certainly not something we can take for granted.  That PCR testing is still going on in meat plants.<\/p> <p>  In addition to that we ran a pilot for the development of rapid antigen testing.  We felt that meat plants were a perfect environment for running this pilot because we could run the antigen tests against populations that were at the same time being tested for PCR.

It was important also in those circumstances to protect the staff and the reputation of the Irish sector.  These inspections are ongoing.  In the context of testing, the latest figure I have is 86,541 tests completed in 88 food production facilities with 526 cases detected in all.  At the last round of testing, which involved 11,000 swabs taken in 44 facilities, the positivity rate was 0.35%, which is something below the national positivity rate.  The reality is that as long as there is infection in the community there is the possibility of this disease getting into meat plants.  We know because of specific research that we have done that they are high-risk environments, particularly in the boning hall because they are temperature controlled.

It is an ongoing effort to reduce this problem and the figure is diminishing every year.  A significant part of the problem is in our laboratories.  A variety of issues arise in our laboratories.  For example, sometimes, for complex pieces of equipment there is a single supplier.  Sometimes, for an accredited test there is a single supplier of reagents and if the reagent is changed we have to change the accreditation of the test.  There is a variety of issues but we are working hard on those.<\/p><p> In terms of risk management, the Department was among the earliest movers on the development of an electronic risk management system.  The reality was that the system we had became a bit stale and was no longer consistent with the central system established by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We have replaced that with a new risk management system.  The Deputy mentioned the winding down of the committee.  The truth was that we decided we would deal with risk management at the management board rather than having a specific committee.  We have a specific committee now.<\/p><p> On the way we will deal with non-compliance, we have an accreditation review group.  That group was established to look at all audit findings and it ensures that audit findings are followed up in a systematic way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021042000002#C01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Gleeson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618939800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>Finally, the asset verification project was expected to be done by 2021.

This matter is being reported in terms that Ireland cannot be trusted to guarantee that fraud can be detected.  I am sure Mr. Gleeson will agree that Irish fishermen will be utterly aghast at such an assertion.  Is the Department aware whether the Commission intends to impose financial penalties on Ireland?  More importantly, what actions does the Department intend to take to challenge the Commission's ruling?  The SFPA has expanded greatly in size in recent years so either fraud is being committed and not being detected, which would be widely disputed, or the processes are not in place to give the European Commission the assurances that it requires.

The standard requirement under the relevant regulation is that fish are weighed at the point of landing on the pier.  Ireland has been operating on the basis of a derogation.  We had a Commission audit followed by an administrative inquiry which indicated that, in some instances, that they were not happy to rely on the efficacy of the controls relating to the weighing of pelagic fish.  It is on that basis that the Commission's decision has emerged.  The decision removes the derogation.  That is what the effect of the control plan is.  There is a process under way and the SFPA and the Department are still engaged with the Commission on that.

I looked through the figures for previous years and discovered that the spend on the TB eradication programme in 2014 was more than &euro;86 million and that 16,000 cases of TB were detected.  Last year, the spend was &euro;98 million and 23,000 cases detected.  Where this becomes more of a concern to the Committee of Public Accounts is the fact that the EU funding element of that decreased from &euro;12 million in 2014 to a little over &euro;5 million last year.  Does Mr. Gleeson accept that there is a problem in that we are spending a lot of money?  A huge proportion of that money comes directly from farmers.  When Mr. Gleeson was talking about the programme being rolled out in factories with regard to Covid mechanisms, I was struck by the fact that the associated costs involved are not being levied from factories.  In the context of the TB programme, a substantial levy is imposed on farmers in the context of meeting the overall cost.  Does Mr. Gleeson accept that the TB eradication programme is not working?  Is there a need for a fundamental review of how we spend this huge sum of money?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021042000002#D00800","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618939800,"counter":39,"content":"<p>The firs thing I will say about the TB programme is that we have to have it.

If we look back at the figures relating to the programme, it becomes clear that &euro;5.5 billion has been spent on it since the early 1960s.  The truth is that what the programme has done is that it has kept TB at a reasonably low level compared with where it was in the 1960s.  The disease is at a much lower level than it was then.  The programme is a burden on farmers and it is a burden on taxpayers.  If we are to reduce the burden on farmers and on taxpayers, then we have to take the steps necessary to try and eradicate the disease.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy will know that we have a TB forum.  Part of the dynamic here would be to try and work with farmers, and agree a system on the measures needed to reduce disease levels.  The forum has a number of sub-committees and one of them is looking at finance.  We will be talking through the financial arrangements with farmers.  There is a report from Grant Thornton which examined the cost-benefit analysis relating to the programme.  Informed by that analysis, farmers and the Department will discuss future financing.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned others being levied.

The current scheme, the REAP, is really a vehicle for testing some concepts and ideas, particularly the results-based idea, so that we are not forcing measures on farmers and then penalising them if they do not meet them.  Instead, we are offering farmers the opportunity to volunteer for things under the results-based scheme and to decide what level of payment they want.  That is the idea behind the new scheme.

There is a long list of sites in the appendix and a lot of them are small bits of forest and bog.  We do not have valuations for them because our policy is to value things at the point of disposal.  Some of the sites are former Land Commission sites and some of them are bits of land on top of mountains.  We are looking at our forestry plots to see if it is worthwhile transferring them to Coillte.  Most of them, I would suggest, have very little value.  They are not fit for agriculture.  <\/p> <p>  We have a number of specific sites like the potato testing centre in Raphoe, which is quite near Raphoe town.

We do not have a valuation on that either but there is no prospect of the State disposing of its interest there.  The State Laboratory is there and we have a variety of other laboratories on site.  We have some ideas about how that site might be developed as a centre of excellence for laboratories generally across the State.  That is it in terms of significant holdings.

However, for example, sometimes animal welfare cases are also human welfare cases.  There are sometimes complex situations locally, which people are aware of, and sometimes people try to work with the families of people involved in these cases to try to resolve the animal welfare issue.  Sometimes the priority in cases like this is to resolve the animal welfare issue.<\/p> <p>  Regarding that letter, it came to my office.  I did not see it and no Minister in the Department saw it.  It was not a letter from a Minister, although there is a perception out there that it was.  I am not saying the Deputy is suggesting that.

We are the only remaining member state that has not yet introduced both penalty points systems.  While we were able to introduce the licence holder penalty points arrangements by way of statutory instrument, as there was a legislative basis at European level to do so, we require primary legislation to put in place a system to deal with masters.

We debated the proposal in the D&aacute;il and I have to accept that it was voted through.  I remind the Minister that when he was Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on agriculture, food and the marine, he had a very different view on this matter.  His colleague and former Deputy, Pat the Cope Gallagher, when he was spokesperson on the marine, introduced an annulment motion.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of points I want to reintroduce today in regard to the heads of this Bill.  Specifically, I want to raise again the four key and reasonable bones of contention the industry has with these proposals.  I have read the Minister's opening statement and, remarkably, what is missing in his assessment is an acknowledgment that the draft penalty points have been challenged in the courts and the Supreme Court has ruled on the matter previously.  Everybody recognises that the European Commission is demanding that Ireland introduce a scheme.  It is agreed that there needs to be a penalty points system, and oversight of that system, and that we must ensure our fisheries are operated sustainably.  Unfortunately, the schemes that have been introduced on a number of occasions have not been fair and just.  I will go through the correspondence that was issued to the Minister by the various fishing organisations in September 2020.<\/p> <p>  Point 9 in the draft general scheme, which is on page 10 of the document, shows that the Minister has not addressed the four main areas of concern for the industry, and I am sure that will continue through the scheme.  The four major producer organisations in the State, namely, the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation, the Irish Fish Producers Organisation, the Irish South and East Fish Producers Organisation and the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation, have written to the Minister to raise the four key issues.  The first of these concerns the decision to be made by the determination panel on the balance of probabilities.  This is very serious stuff because we are talking about potentially taking away somebody's livelihood.<\/p><p>The threshold for conviction for all Irish citizens and, indeed, European citizens is beyond a reasonable doubt.  That is the threshold a director of public prosecutions and a jury looks at - beyond a reasonable doubt.  That is the accepted threshold yet we are going with a threshold of \"on the balance of probabilities\", which I think is very dangerous.  I reiterate that this type of approach has been rejected by the courts and it is the reason that it has taken so long for us to bring in legislation.  With all due respect to the senior officials in the Department, they keep getting things wrong when drafting this legislation and, unfortunately, they have been turned around in the courts, which is what has delayed this process.<\/p><p> Having spoken to people across the industry I want to take this opportunity to say the following.  There is an attempt to present the fishing industry as some kind of a mass illegality or an industry that does not like to follow laws, is up to skullduggery and so on.  We only have to see that the funding and number of staff for the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority have multiplied tenfold since it was brought into place so one has an organisation or regulator that has been seriously resourced.  Any fisherman with whom I have spoken talked about how determined these officials are in terms of doing their job so I do not think anybody doubts the determination of the SFPA to implement the law.  If some mass illegality did take place then how come we have not had a mass number of people convicted in the courts?  It is very dangerous for the State to allow a narrative to go out that mass illegality is happening in the fishing industry.<\/p><p> Let us remember that the fishing industry is being squeezed out of its rightful access to the fish in our seas.  We had 12% of the seas in the European Union yet we only get 4% of the quota across the European Union.  We get one third of what should be our natural right so we should stand up for fishermen rather than allow a narrative of criminality and illegality to be placed on our fishing industry.  Of course there should be oversight, and people should fish sustainably, not over fish and where over fishing is found to happen then people should be taken to task but there must be due process and it has to be fair.  Every citizen is entitled to that fundamental pillar of our democracy and I find it astonishing that we allow legislation to again be presented to us that accepts a ban that removes any reference to \"the balance of probabilities\" and replaces it with \"beyond a reasonable doubt\".  I appeal to the Minister to do that today and I draw his attention to the language again used in section 9, page 10 of the general scheme.<\/p><p> As the Minister will recall from correspondence he received from the four producer organisations, POs, last September, it states: \"Where points remain on a licence even in the event of an appellant being exonerated of any offence.\"  This provision is very objectionable.  This is where a person has the right to take his or her case to a court of law if he or she feels that he or she has done no wrong yet, even if successful in that court of law, those penalty points remain on the licence.  Can one imagine a situation where a person pulled over by the Garda for speeding is adamant there was no speeding and goes to a court of law where the case is won yet the points remain on the licence? Such a situation would not be tolerated by citizens yet we expect fishermen to find it acceptable.<\/p><p> The third point of contention is that fisherman are only allowed to apply to the High Court on a point of law.  Again, the fishing community finds that objectionable.<\/p><p> The final point of contention, and I have no doubt that it is replicated in this legislation, is \"where points attached to capacity multiply in the event of that capacity being subdivided\".  In other words, those points flow throughout even if one sells and subdivides one's capacity.<\/p><p> The Minister must agree that these are four reasonable grounds of concern for the fishing industry.  As he knows, with all legislation that is presented to the Oireachtas one would expect that he would consult the stakeholders and invite them to make submissions.  I know that he has rejected these grounds.  I cannot see how any Minister can stand over the balance of probabilities being a threshold for conviction, having to go to court yet still be unable to remove points and being only able to apply \"on a point of law\".           <\/p><p> Finally, I am pretty sure that every Deputy and Senator on this call today, and every fisherman I know that is worth their salt, understands that there needs to be a penalty points system.  We all understand that we must have oversight and laws and that we must protect the precious amenity and natural resources in our seas but there is a plethora of staff in the SFPA, and there is the Naval Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is a wide range of people to enforce the law but citizens have a right to due process and to be considered.  Most important, a citizen has the right under law to be considered innocent until proven guilty.  In my opinion, one must prove one's innocence as one is presumed guilty under too many of these processes.  I put all of that to the Minister and look forward to his engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021042000002#A00700","speaker":"1463","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I have previously discussed this matter with the committee in terms of the licence penalty points statutory instrument and licence holders.  Also, I met and discussed the matter in great depth with fishermen's representatives.<\/p> <p>  A number of proposals or suggested amendments were put forward on the licence holder statutory instrument, which my own party put forward in opposition, that we felt should be considered.  The amendments were considered in great detail and some were incorporated such as additional time for the appeals process, etc.  For some of them, given the legal advice following a full assessment, it was found that if they were to be accepted it would mean that the statutory instrument and the licence penalty points system would not pass muster or meet the expected thresholds.  At that time they were examined in massive detail, given exceptional hearing and fully examined as to the capacity for them to be absorbed and incorporated into the statutory instrument.<\/p> <p>  The masters penalty points system requires legislation.  The same approach and the learnings from all of that full examination and assessment is followed through in the approach being taken now with the masters penalty points legislation.  It is very similar to and consistent with the approach taken in terms of the licence holders.<\/p> <p>  As I mentioned at the outset, the regulation requires each member state to have a penalty points system for licence holders and for masters has been in place since 2012.  We are very late to the table and are the last member state to put this legislation in place.  The initial licence statutory instrument was legally challenged and found not to be appropriate in some regards so a new SI was required.  There was a significant examination of the amendments put forward by my own party and a new SI was introduced last August.<\/p> <p>  Overall, the two penalty points systems must achieve a system that is dissuasive, proportionate and effective, which are the key thresholds.<\/p><p> I will touch on the three points the Deputy raised.  On the issue of the standard of proof to be used by the determination panel and the appeals officer, balance of probabilities is the approach that is being taken.  The legal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt is almost entirely confined to criminal trials and is not applicable to proceedings that are civil in nature.  For any civil proceedings that end up in court, the standard used is on the balance of probabilities.  It is a standard that is used for the licence holders points system and for the masters system we are discussing.  Our legal advice is that it is the appropriate legal standard for the penalty points system to ensure we are compliant with our responsibilities as a control authority and as a control member state.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked about cases where there is no guilty verdict in criminal proceedings.  Where the master or owner is found not guilty in criminal proceedings, this proposal would involve both systems being interlinked.  They would not stand alone from each other if the proposal the Deputy is making were to be adopted.  They are separate systems involving separate standards of proof between the points and a criminal prosecution.  It would lead to confusion and conflation of evidence, and render elements inadmissible.  In addition, the legal advice is clear that points under the EU regulation are intended as additional to criminal prosecution.  I will repeat that.  The legal advice is that points under EU regulation are intended as additional to criminal prosecution.  Accordingly, it could not be argued that Ireland has both criminal and points systems as required under EU regulation if we operated this system in a manner whereby criminal proceedings completely eclipsed the points system.<\/p><p> That is the legal advice we have on the matter.  The overarching point I would make is that it is my objective to introduce a system which is as balanced and proportionate to all of our responsibilities and, indeed, to the fishing sector as it possibly can be while meeting our legal obligations to comply with European regulation.  There is no point in any of us going through this process and introducing a system that then falls flat on it face and does not meet our legal obligations.  That adds no value.  We need to deal with the facts and deal with the issue.<\/p><p> We certainly should tease out the details as we are doing today and over the next period but, ultimately, what we introduce must ensure that, as a member state, we are compliant with our obligations under the 2012 EU regulation.  At the moment, Ireland is the only member state that is not compliant.  We would all be wasting our time if we fool ourselves by introducing a system that does not bring us into compliance with our European obligations as a control member state authority.  That is ultimately where we need to be at the end of this process, having introduced this legislation.<\/p><p> Regarding a licence holder having a full right to the rehearing of a case before the High Court, the legal advice is clear that under the Constitution the High Court has full original jurisdiction and can hear all matters of law brought before it.  The legal advice is that it would be highly anomalous, if not unprecedented, to provide such a full High Court rehearing of a matter first governed in procedures set down in the previous statutory instrument or, indeed, in this legislation.  In addition, it would delay the application of points which would run up against the timelines stipulated in the EU regulation that points apply for three years from the commencement date following detection.  To that extent then it would hinder the effective implementation of this EU law and would not meet Ireland's obligations to implement these EU provisions.<\/p><p> Similar challenges would have been teased out regarding the licence holder penalty points system.  They were given great examination at that time when amendments were considered and ultimately decided upon.  The same considerations apply to this masters penalty points system which is very much based on the licence holder one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021042000002#B00200","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for appearing before the committee.  I have a number of questions.  The Minister may not be able to answer them all in the time we have allocated, but he might come back to me in writing.<\/p> <p>  This is another blow for the fishermen and fisherwomen in this country.  It could not come at a worse time, regardless of when it should have been implemented.  The statutory instrument, SI 318\/2020, is linked to this Bill.  It was signed into law by the Taoiseach in August 2020.  That was a grotesque and deeply damaging act by the Taoiseach, who was the then caretaker Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine.  What is worse was that it occurred without any consultation with the fisheries sector.  Does the Minister believe it was handled well?<\/p> <p>  The Minister's first meeting with the fisheries sector via Webex was on 16 September 2020.  Representatives of the sector raised their deep concern over the introduction of SI 318\/2020 at that meeting.  Why did the Minister not listen to the representatives of the sector that day, rescind the statutory instrument and go back to the drawing board, including the sectoral viewpoints, in redrafting a more appropriate statutory instrument?<\/p> <p>  Why did the Minister vote against the same statutory instrument in 2018 when his D&aacute;il colleague from Donegal, Pat The Cope Gallagher, brought a rescinding motion before the D&aacute;il?  What changed between the summer of 2018 and 2020?  The statutory instrument did not change.  Was it that the opportunity for power changed the Minister's mind and blinkered where his loyalties lay?  It appears to me and to many fishermen and fisherwomen, including many in his county, that he is doing one thing in opposition and another thing when in power.  Has the Minister consulted with the man who proposed having the original statutory instrument rescinded, namely, the former Deputy, Pat The Cope Gallagher, for advice and guidance?  Surely that should have been his starting point given that he had been advocating for the industry back in 2018 on this very issue.<\/p> <p>    Why is the burden of proof, under SI 318\/2020 and this Bill, on the balance of probabilities and not, as required in criminal cases, beyond a reasonable doubt?  Why is the Minister degrading the civil liberties of fishermen and fisherwomen in this way?  Why do the statutory instrument and the Bill not allow fishermen and fisherwomen a right to appeal a sanction arrived at on the basis of balance of probabilities?  It makes no sense and undermines the civil and human rights of the entire fishing sector.  Would the Minister not agree that this is dictatorship territory?<\/p> <p>  Why is the statutory instrument, introduced by the Taoiseach and then acting Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine, forcing the fishing licence holders to retain the penalty points on their licences even if their cases are cleared in court?  Does the Minister believe this is fair and just in a liberal democracy?  It is no longer that our courts are the highest law of the land.  If a fisherman gets points under this administration scheme, they cannot be removed by any court.<\/p> <p>  I plead with the Minister, even at this stage, to see common sense and stop being influenced by the bureaucrats in Brussels.  He should rescind SI 318\/2020, go back to the drawing board and give the fisheries sector an input into the penalty points system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021042000002#C00200","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":267,"content":"<p>Regarding consultation with the industry on the previous statutory instrument, it is clear there has been considerable engagement with the industry on this issue over the past couple of years in particular.  As I outlined to Deputy Mac Lochlainn, there was significant engagement with industry on proposed amendments and these were then fully assessed and examined.  Those that could be incorporated, while ensuring that we introduced a system that meets our obligation, were incorporated.  Those that could not be without meaning that we were bringing in a system which did not meet our obligation were not incorporated.  Great examination and consideration were given to that.<\/p> <p>  After I was appointed as Minister, I met representatives of the industry and engaged with them even further.  We examined and discussed all the issues we are discussing here today.  I explained that some of the proposed amendments have been incorporated - those that could be incorporated without undermining the capacity to introduce a system that met our obligations.  Those that did not allow for that were not incorporated and overall it had tremendous examination.  The two statutory instruments - the one that was rejected by the D&aacute;il and the one that was introduced in August - were different in that they incorporated those amendments that were considered to be able to be incorporated without making the statutory instrument one which would mean we still would remain non-compliant with EU obligations for which we have had responsibility since 2012.<\/p><p>I have listened a lot.  We might not agree with the outcome and I am open to engaging in detail with the Deputy on the backdrop and the tactical and legal considerations around that and getting into the nitty-gritty of that.  It is important we do that.  We can talk in headlines or overarching rhetoric, but it is the nitty-gritty and bringing into place a system that brings us into compliance which will count.  There is no point going through this process if, at the end of the day, we are no further forward and still have not met our obligations.<\/p><p> The other backdrop to this is that, given we are the only member state without a penalty points system in place, the EU Commission has moved in the past year or so to introduce a reasoned opinion against Ireland for failure to have, previously, a licence holder penalty points system and, now, a masters penalty points system in place.  They have applied the pressure and moved through the compliance tools available to them to force us to get into line and bring in this system.  The other thing they have done is suspended funding to us.  There is &euro;24 million in funding, which the EU has not released to the taxpayer because we have not met our obligations in this regard.  That could go up to &euro;37 million.  That would be a loss to the taxpayer were we not to ensure we meet our obligations.  It is important that we meet our obligations but, were we not to, the taxpayer would be out to the tune of &euro;37 million.  There is an obligation on us to tease this out in detail and bring in the most balanced and appropriate system we can, one that is as fair as possible to fisherman and at the same time ensures we are applying the law of the Common Fisheries Policy, as is our obligation and responsibility as a member state.<\/p><p> The Deputy mentioned the burden of proof.  I have dealt with that and refer him to the response I gave to Deputy Mac Lochlainn.  I have also dealt with the question on not allowing a full appeal to the High Court in my previous response.  There is an appeals system within the legislation.  One can appeal to the determinations panel.  The statutory instrument, SI, that was introduced brought in some amendments around the appeal system, compared to what was in the previous SI.  The Deputy asked why the penalty points still stand if a criminal prosecution does not lead to a conviction.  As I mentioned to Deputy Mac Lochlainn, it is because there is a requirement on us to have civil and criminal strands to this.  The burden of proof in a criminal case is beyond reasonable doubt; the burden of proof in a civil case is on the balance of probabilities.  That applies to other laws in our land as well.  Some are civil laws and some are criminal laws.  If one was to make a civil law and the application of a civil approach subject to the outcome of a criminal strand, it would nullify the civil strand.  I thank that answers all the questions the Deputy raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021042000002#C00300","speaker":"1546","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and his officials for attending.

The work of Macra na Feirme is crucial.  The outworkings of the current Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, negotiations are pivotal in ensuring that young farmers have a viable avenue into farming.

Will there be a provision within the next round of CAP that will allow the Government to address their particular concerns?  I refer to the issue of the GAEC proposals.

I thank the Chairman, a man from my end of the world, for his kind words.  In a broad way, the negotiations and trialogues are still ongoing, which means there are, essentially, three positions that we have to consider, that is, those of the European Commission, the European Council and the European Parliament.  From our analysis, the position of the Parliament is the closest to one with which we would agree on two key aspects for young farmers.  First, the Parliament has supported having a minimum of 4% of direct payments for young farmers.  We believe this is essential.  The current allocation of direct payments in Ireland was up to a maximum of 2%.  We commend the Department on having that in place.  However, now is the time to increase the amount of funding that is made available for young farmers under direct payments and Pillar 2 payments.  We may return to that issue shortly.<\/p> <p>  On the question of the forgotten farmers, but also, more broadly, the many young farmers under the age of 40 who are currently going to be excluded from supports going forward - we have already seen them being excluded from supports - the key area is the so-called five year rule under which supports are primarily focused towards young farmers entering the industry.  We are incredibly supportive of supports for entry into the industry but the issue now, particularly in Ireland where we have seen a change in the entire model of farm succession and planning, is that this directly discourages young farmers who are taking on the role at an earlier stage.  Both I and Mr. Fitzgerald, the chairman of our agricultural affairs committee, are in such a position.  In spite of the fact that we are under the age of 30, we are no longer considered young farmers, going by the Department definition, because we have been farming either as part of a partnership or a joint herd number for more than five years.  The position of the European Parliament is that this should be moved to a minimum of seven years.  That is at least some positive movement to address the situation.<\/p> <p>  Outside of that, in terms of potential in the current negotiations to address the issue of forgotten farmers who have been farming for more than ten years, unfortunately the only area in which it appears this could be addressed is that of the allocation of the national reserve.<\/p><p>Again, that ties back into the total allocation of funds under direct payments.  The allocation of direct funds or payments can either go to young farmer top-up, which would only be available under the current proposals for either five or seven years from establishment, or it can be allocated to the national reserve, which would allow sufficient for young farmers and new entrants and potentially for those farmers who are farming longer than that in a so-called third category.  This third category has only been used a single time.  The legislative position is very clear that all demands from young farmers and new entrants have to be satisfied before there can be a third category.<\/p><p> On GAEC 2, I will try to be brief and run through some of the elements because there is overlap.  Our concerns with GAEC 2 are under two elements.  First, we have seen the definition of what exactly this will change and appropriate management versus protection of wetlands.  This is a significant issue for Ireland because the country has some of the highest organic matter soils.  Second, there is the question about the definition of peatland soils and exactly what that will mean, because there is a variation in Ireland which is not seen in other countries.  We have some drained farmable lands and others with high organic matter.  Then we have the very extreme element, appropriate management of uplands and full peatland or bog-type soils.  This is the essential element.  The question here becomes the appropriate management.  We strongly feel that high nature value farming, which is normally practised on the uplands in these areas, is the most appropriate management to protect these from a biodiversity and carbon protection point of view.  Unfortunately, and this is an element that has been raised, under the biodiversity strategy there is a question about strictly protected definitions of designation.  The strictly protected definitions essentially would block all farming activity.  It would be a very extreme form of designation.  We believe it would be detrimental not only to the rural economy in these areas but also very significantly to the protection of farmland birds and other forms of farmland biodiversity.<\/p><p> On the balance of support in terms of financial packages, there appears to be a willingness to continue, and we strongly support that.  The young farmer top-up payments have been excellent and a major support.  We would like to see them extended to seven years rather than five.  However, the legislation that is currently under consideration in the negotiations allows for an installation aid type of package.  We have encouraged the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and it has agreed, to assess the potential for that in the CAP strategic plan.  This would be under Pillar 2 funding.  We believe this is significant.<\/p><p> On the other question that is often raised about older farmers, getting the balance right and encouraging land access, there are no proposals on that at present.  The reason for that and the complexity is that countries vary.  Countries such as Finland and Germany have a designated older farmer pension scheme which has been in place for many years and which provides increased financial support.  When we discussed the appetite for an older farmer retirement scheme or something similar with our members, their major concern has been, and will continue to be, the financial viability of some of those farmers.  We prefer, and we have been a major force for, moving the question away from a succession model into a partnership model, which we find is a far more suitable method for encouraging access to land and with regard to the inheritance of land.<\/p><p> Thank you, Chairman, for your kind words in welcoming us here today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021042000002#G01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I have a question relating to what you said and to a paragraph from your opening statement in regard to young farmers stamp duty relief.

Is there an issue with the ceiling that exists at present in respect of the availability of stamp duty relief?  Is the ceiling high enough that it is not causing an issue?  Obviously, I will be lobbying for the stamp duty relief to be rolled over again for another three years because it is a very important incentive for young farmers to get land transferred into their names.

One is that it is absolutely essential to retain stamp duty relief.  That is being considered by the Department of Finance.

However, we have suggested some minor changes to it to encourage what we have called a steeped approach, addressing a set of separate taxation measures which would encourage and support young farmers entering into the system from the beginning.  We feel the extension needs to include succession partnerships - there is currently a cut-off there - and extension up to the age of 40 years, but only where there are additional measures such as taxation relief on the leasing of land to young farmers up to the age of 30 years and limited to five years.  Our logic on this is very clear.  We are seeing a particular issue in the handover of land.  It is a major lifestyle and financial change for many farmers.  Many farmers are asking, essentially, how they can test the water here.  What we have proposed is a measure whereby a farmer might encourage a young person to get on board in a limited way, which would not affect the person's application for both stamp duty relief and the young farmer top-up payment in the future.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the limit, there are concerns about the limits to state aids.  We engaged with the Department of Finance when this was announced as to whether it would impact on the total lifetime aid which a young farmer could draw down.  There are a small number of farmers who might be affected, who would be inheriting extremely large holdings and also drawing down 100% of grant aid under schemes such as the targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS, and so forth.  However, we are satisfied at present that, broadly, the stamp duty supports and the other taxation supports should be in line for the European Commission not to raise any objections to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021042000002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Thomas Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I welcome the representatives of Macra na Feirme and I wish to be associated with the good wishes to Mr. Duffy.

We will all lobby for, and hopefully we will be successful in, getting the extension to the current stamp duty laws.  While they are vital, they are not cash in hand.  They are a net saving.  I refer to where Macra na Feirme would like to see more capital expenditure funding coming on stream.  We are very much aware of building costs.  There is the percentage of funding that is available in TAMS, the capping of expenditure that is allowable to receive TAMS funding and a combination of the percentages that are available to young and older farmers.  Will Mr. Duffy elaborate on that with regard to investment?<\/p> <p>  Moving on to the partnership company model, while it is a great model and works well in certain areas of the country, there is an element of partnership which will most likely require the enterprise to be in a position to support two families.  This is not feasible everywhere.  I am a Westmeath man and the further north one goes, the smaller are the holdings and enterprises.  While it might work on a large dairy set-up in the south or elsewhere, where there is a steady cash flow, it is not a runner in the majority of cases further north and west in the country.  What is the alternative to that?  What consideration has Macra na Feirme given to, what lobbying has it done for or how would it look on something similar to the old retirement scheme?  If the current farming generation was prepared to step aside to avoid the situation I mentioned where two incomes would be required from the holding, would Macra na Feirme welcome, or what is its opinion on, something similar to the old retirement scheme?<\/p> <p>  I will conclude on the land mobility scheme that Macra na Feirme piloted or introduced.<\/p><p>I know Macra is lobbying to get this included under the CAP and to get European support.

I would like to put on record the incredible work of Austin Finn, who is the lead facilitator in that role, and highlight the support we received from sponsors and co-ops to establish the service, including seed funding from FBD early on.  There are two elements to this.  One is the consideration for the entire EU to look at this as a system.  We engaged with groups such as UK Young Farmers, prior to Brexit, which was trying to roll-out a similar model while facing challenges which were unique to themselves.  It will have to be adapted and changed to each country.  Specifically for Ireland we have a clear ask, namely, that there be continued funding from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine - which has been supportive of the service from the very beginning - and to move away from annual support to the entire term of the new CAP, directly supporting the land mobility service under the CAP strategic plan.  We have seen this grow very significantly over time.  I will ask Mr. Dillon or Mr. Duggan to cover some of the key figures around the number of partnerships and arrangements that have been put in place.<\/p> <p>  On smaller farm holdings and the challenge in that regard, we mentioned this in our opening statement but, unfortunately, the amount of detailed evidence on which we are working is very limited in the context of what interventions have been successful.  The EU's recommendations are still based on 2016, as are its assessments when we know that there have been very significant changes since then such as the young farmers top-ups and the taxation supports we have had in Ireland.  Our best figures for the challenges of young farmers entering the different enterprises come from the national farm sustainability report, which is compiled by Teagasc.  That report shows a very clear delineation.  Sheep and beef farms are significantly higher as a percentage of those who are more than 60 years in the enterprise.  Currently, there are no strict proposals which state that a retirement scheme would be introduced under the CAP.  There are rules in member states such as Finland where you cannot receive single farm payment and a pension at the same time.  There is very little appetite in Ireland and among young farmers, with whom we have discussed this, for such as scheme to be introduced.  The best supporting mechanism may be through the tax code.  That is something that we are working on with the Department, trying to identify potential taxation reliefs that would facilitate farmers who are willing and interested.  The likes of land-leasing taxation reliefs have been significant in allowing farmers to take a step back.  That is the only aspect that we can at the moment.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned geographical spread.  Looking across the country, there is a very clear geographic issue with land fragmentation and farm viability.  It is not simply that many farms do not have the total land needed to become viable without external economic input in the form of a part-time job, it is also that a large number are simply too fragmented to become viable.  That is something that we, through the Land Mobility Service, have been working on and have had very significant success in trying to assist farmers.  The taxation measures which would allow the sale of land without the tax implication to allow farm consolidation is quite significant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021042000002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Thomas Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":326,"content":"<p>There are members wishing to come in so I ask Mr. Duggan to be as brief as he can, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021042000002#J00300","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":327,"content":"<p>Our opening statement outlines the key figures for the land mobility service.

We tend to stay away from family farm partnerships although we do receive queries on them and we provide information where necessary.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about the appetite for the scheme at European level.  To put it in context, we have made a number of presentations to the European Network for Rural Development, which is part of the European Commission.  We have also been part of several Erasmus and European Commission-funded projects, such as the Polish Farm Advisory Service, the University of Bedfordshire in the UK and other European partners which are looking for similar types of solutions, including the National Farmers Union in Northern Ireland and the Ulster Young Farmers, who are working in collaboration on a similar land mobility service.  We have given those two organisations a lot of support in setting up the service in Northern Ireland.  There is an appetite.  It does need a little tweaking from jurisdiction to jurisdiction because of the various different local issues which arise but it is recognised at European level as being a critical tool in the tool box to support generational renewal.  A key tenet of our lobbying, through the European Young Farmer network in the Conseil Europ&eacute;en des Jeunes Agriculteurs, CEJA, and to the Commission, has been to have a mechanism included in the next CAP to support at member state level a land mobility service from member state to member state.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021042000002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Denis Duggan"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests and acknowledge the president and CEO and other members of Macra na Feirme.  I also acknowledge Macra na Feirme's great input in the social and economic aspects of agriculture in Ireland.  They have had a great input over the past 40-plus years which we should acknowledge.<\/p> <p>  There are probably three or four questions around how we can ensure that the next CAP will benefit the agriculture industry and hopefully the young farming community.  I spoke to Mr. Dillon some weeks ago about the old young farmer dynamic that has been somewhat forgotten.  It is one of the issues in the CAP that we have to return to talk about how we will ensure that there is a fair, level playing field for the cohort of young farmers who have been missed, for lack of a better word.  That is something that we need to look at in particular in the new CAP in 2023.  How do Mr. Dillon or Mr. Duffy think we could try to work to accommodate this cohort of farmers which unfortunately has been forgotten about?  They are moving into their 40s but still receive relatively low payments, through no fault of their own, merely because circumstances meant they fell between two stools.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the president's comments about how we can work with our farming community to move land from older to younger generations, particularly the retirement scheme in other countries.  That is a very positive statement.<\/p><p>The opportunity for the older generation to work off-farm or move away at a certain age is something that such people would welcome.  We need to work with the Department to see what we can do to resume the retirement scheme of 20 years ago that, although successful, was taken off the books for some bizarre reason.  It was a positive scheme that promoted the renewal of the farming community and got young farmers involved at an earlier stage in life.  At that age, they have the potential to make major differences on their holdings whereas someone who takes over a family farm at 35 years of age probably has other commitments and concerns and his or her potential or ability to drive the significant changes required on some holdings is limited.  Progressing a farm retirement scheme is a major issue for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021042000002#J00500","speaker":"1666","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I might invite Mr. Dillon to speak about investment supports in a moment.  We have asked the Department how many of what we would class as young farmers, namely, those under the age of 40 years, have missed out on drawing down as a direct result of the five-year rule.  I do not believe I touched on the question of investment support that Senator Paul Daly raised.  We view it as a significant issue.  Land is not only a capital-intensive business, but also an investment-intensive one.  Many younger farmers who have inherited, purchased or leased land must make a substantial financial investment.  We commend the Department in recognising this under TAMS.  It has been successful and met its limits.  Under the next CAP, however, there must be recognition of the need for all young farmers under the age of 40 years to be able to access some level of funding.  Currently, only those qualifying under the five-year rule can apply for 60%.  The limit of &euro;80,000 on qualifying spend is increased in partnerships, but this touches on the question of gender and the break-up of farms between siblings, which is generally a tragic event.  Currently, if two young farmers enter into a partnership, the limit remains unchanged.  We would like to see it expanded so that as many as possible young farmers who are entering into a partnership can embrace the opportunity.  We would also like to see a third category being made available from 2023 under the legislation, one that lies between 60% and 40% investment support.<\/p> <p>  The numbers are substantial.  Young farmers are often recognised for their considerable commitment to social sustainability.  In terms of economic sustainability, they have invested &euro;186 million as a direct result of the support they have received under TAMS alone.  That investment was mostly loaded towards the past two years.  We can clearly see that young farmers are the ones making investments on farms and generating economic activity in the wider farm economy.<\/p> <p>  I will now hand over to Mr. Dillon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021042000002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Thomas Duffy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":331,"content":"<p>Senator Lombard asked a specific question about old young farmers.  When we were before an Oireachtas committee in June 2015, we outlined specific proposals on a solution to the issue of old young farmers.  Mr. Duffy mentioned the national reserve in the next CAP.  That is the primary mechanism for delivering for old young farmers.  There are two mandatory categories and the potential to introduce an additional category.  However, this is all contingent on us getting a minimum of 4% delivered to young farmers in the next CAP.  If we do not have that level of funding available, the national reserve will, as Mr. Duffy outlined, have to provide for young farmers and new entrants, who comprise the first two categories, before it can provide for other categories.  We had other proposals in the past, but we believe that the best mechanism for delivering for old young farmers is the national reserve in the next CAP.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make a comment on a point that was made about our proposal in respect of stamp duty relief.  Mr. Duffy outlined the aspects of the proposal.  We propose that the 35-year age limit in respect of stamp duty on general transfers of farms remain but that it increase to 40 years where succession partnerships and the purchase of land by young farmers are concerned.  We would like to see the 35-year age limit for general transfers remain as is because most transfers happen where 34-year-olds are approaching their 35th birthdays and we fear that it would only move five years on to when they were approaching their 40th birthdays were it to change.  There is a cliff edge at 40 years of age when the rate of stamp duty increases to 7.5%.  Perhaps there should be tiering after 40 years of age so that people who just miss that date do not incur the full 7.5%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021042000002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Derrie Dillon"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":332,"content":"<p>We all recognise that young farmers are the future of this industry.

There is no denying that.  Unfortunately, this issue is often not considered in the overall encouragement.  There are investment supports, but many of those are not oriented towards the extensive and high nature value farming that we tend to find on uplands and peat soils.  The young farmers in question are able to benefit from the young farmers top-up payment and so on, but an element that we have consistently raised with the Department in the design of new environmental schemes is that there should be prioritisation and increased ceiling levels for young farmers.  We say this because these schemes have higher uptake rates in so-called disadvantaged areas and areas that are considered marginal.  We have many members in some of those areas who are farming on commonage.  They are progressive and driven young farmers who want to make a living and continue contributing to their local economies and societies.  They are being undervalued and unconsidered.  We have submitted proposals on the successor to GLAS, whatever that may be.<\/p><p>There should be consideration of higher ceilings for farms or farm partnerships that include someone under the age of 40.

These are the key elements.<\/p><p> As we have said, the question about the final language in the agreed text will be with regard to protection and appropriate use.  We all agree that appropriate use will look very different on peat soils than on mineral soils.  Nonetheless, the idea of essentially abandoning our hills will not deliver for rural communities.  More importantly, from the perspective of many of the people who are, unfortunately, pushing this idea, it will lead directly to land abandonment, which we know has a major negative impact on the biodiversity of these areas.  If we want to keep the good environmental conditions we have and improve them, we need not only to keep farmers on the land but to get more young farmers onto the hills and peatlands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021042000002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Thomas Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":335,"content":"<p>I call Senator Garvey, who is deputising for Deputy Leddin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021042000002#L00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for having me.

I will not even pretend to be involved in it in any way.<\/p> <p>  From my reading of the witnesses, from having met some of them previously and from listening to what they have been saying, I have a couple of questions.  Does Macra regularly meet the IFA at local or national level? Is there much engagement between the two organisations?  How do younger farmers feel about horticulture as a viable option?  I am into diversifying.  My happiest farming neighbours are those doing things slightly differently in some ways.  My sister has a goat farm and several of my neighbours are making a good living out of growing food and employing people on a much smaller holding than many big dairy or beef farmers.  Another friend is creating a glamping site as well as having a bit of dairy on the side.  We have increased funding for horticulture and the number of organic farmers has doubled.  Do the witnesses see this as an important part of where Macra and younger farmers are coming from as well as continuing traditional methods?  I believe in the beef and dairy industries.  We have to give people many choices based on the types of land they have.  We want to keep people on the land as much as possible and make it as viable as possible.<\/p> <p>  I have seen at first hand many farmers turn to horticulture, creating far more viable incomes for themselves and creating jobs.  A couple of my friends grow food on 30 acres and employ 15 people full-time.  My sister is on 50 acres and has ten staff.  The job creation side of it is huge and the farmers do not seem to have to borrow as much money as big dairy or big beef farmers.  I am interested in this side of things.  I am from Clare where we do not have hugely intensive farming so I am biased that way.  I am putting myself in a little box.  I would like to work with the witnesses more on this and engage with the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, more on it also.  She is a midlands farmer with good land.  I am more concerned about subsistence farmers, small farmers and uphill farmers.  I look forward to hearing from the witnesses again on this.

We engage with all of the other farm organisations fairly regularly and we are in communication with most of them and discuss various proposals.  We have independence within our organisation, as do the other farm organisations, and we try to work together for common goals.  Certainly when it comes to young farmers we do not shy away from demanding what needs to be demanded in CAP and under other supports.<\/p> <p>  Horticulture is a very complicated industry, not primarily because of the production method but because of market access, which is a major obstacle for many people.  We do have young farmers who are involved in the horticulture sector but it is a very regional approach, primarily based on some of the best land in Meath and Louth with diversification.<\/p> <p>  On the question of diversification, the key area from where we would see support coming is under Pillar 2 of the LEADER funding for diversification and processing of on-farm product to try to capture more of the value in the supply chain.

An example is the Tipperary food project, with which the Chair is familiar.  It has added value and it has been very successful.<\/p> <p>  Our major concerns around some of the language focused on horticulture is that in reality it needs to be farmer driven.  Farmers know their land better than anyone else.  For instance, I know my land is simply not suitable for cultivation over the longer term.  It would lead to degradation of the soil.  Senator Daly and Deputy Carthy are familiar with similar soils.  Ultimately, they cannot be continuously cultivated.  There is potential here and we support any measure that could return greater benefit to the farm.

Our priority is ensuring that there is a strong definition of \"active farmer\".  We have engaged with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on matters such as minimum stocking densities and minimum cropping densities which would be appropriate in that regard and which would allow for such a definition.<\/p> <p>  There are certainly concerns that while we move to a more productive and environmentally-focused area that this situation could encourage an abandonment of land and, indeed, increase the number of farmers not actively involved in appropriate land management.  As we have said, it is going to be a different form of land management depending on whether people are in Cavan, Laois or Tipperary.  That is our key priority regarding that aspect.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the subject of capping, I will hand over to Mr. Dillon and he will run through some of the key aspects in that regard.  I apologise, I omitted Senator Paul Daly's query on the agrifood strategy.  Yes, we certainly find it a very challenging document concerning some of the elements it has proposed.  We engaged throughout the process and, indeed, we gained key commitments regarding the role of young farmers, particularly concerning increasing the percentage of young farmers and moving towards a continuous professional development model, which we trialled through our Skillsnet programme, and developing a network for young farmers for recognition of their education, which is a key element.  <\/p> <p>  The main aspect getting a great deal of focus is the 10% biogenic methane reduction target.  We will not mince words.  It is an incredibly challenging target for the industry to try to meet by 2030.  If it is to be achieved, we will need to see major supports for the industry to adopt practice change and in that respect we are looking at the likes of the management of the national beef and dairy herds.  In dairy, we know that extending lactations is a very successful way of reducing the number of replacements.  Turning to the beef herd, changes in that area would include reducing the age at slaughter.  Unfortunately, we have seen the age of slaughter increase as we have seen the increase in the percentage of dairy calves entering the beef sector.  <\/p> <p>  We have welcomed the support for initiatives such as the sexed semen lab, which will allow higher quality beef semen to be used on the dairy herd and that will have a direct impact.  As I said, it is still a very challenging situation.  Regarding enteric methane, we simply do not have the silver bullet that other industries have available to us, such as moving to electric or renewable energies.  We are some way from having market-viable feed additives.  What we need to do in reality, therefore, is to look at what we have.  Macra na Feirme has a position on the Ag Climatise document.  We feel it is the appropriate roadmap, but we would like to see greater ambition in some targets, such as 100% of the herd being milk recorded and 100% of the national beef and dairy herds genotyped.  Those are ambitious targets to set, but they are a way in which we can achieve this ambition.  <\/p> <p>  We remain opposed to any limits on the national herds and certainly any mandatory calling.  That is our position on the simple basis that any attempt at mandatory culling or herd limits will be fundamentally unjust.  How could anybody figure out which herds are to be cut and what should be the percentages?  Ultimately, such an approach would lead directly to lower farm viability and have a massive negative backlash.  We are concerned about such a potential backlash from the farming sector and rural communities more generally against the climate action to which we are committed.  I will hand over to Mr. Dillon now to comment on our position on convergence and capping.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2021042000002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Thomas Duffy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":347,"content":"<p>We made a proposal when we met with officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

I remind them that apart from me and members of the committee secretariat, all members and witnesses are required to participate remotely and all members are required to participate from within the Leinster House complex.<\/p> <p>  Today we are considering the loan guarantee schemes agreements (Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland) Bill 2021.  Recently, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, wrote to the Business Committee seeking an exemption of the normal pre-legislative scrutiny requirements, given the urgency to have the Bill enacted by mid-May 2021.  The general scheme of the Bill has been drafted to comply with advice received from the Office of the Attorney General on 19 March 2021 that legislation is required to provide the necessary powers for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to enter into an agreement with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland to implement loan guarantee schemes for SMEs and small mid-caps, including many primary producers.  The legislation must be enacted by mid-May if the scheme is to go ahead in time to provide support to businesses that face the twin disruptions of Brexit and Covid-19.  The request of the Minister to the Business Committee for a waiver of pre-legislative consideration has been passed on to this committee to give our opinion on the request.  Following this meeting, we are required to communicate this opinion to the Business Committee to allow it to decide on the waiver application.<\/p> <p>  To brief the committee on the Bill and the case for a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny, I am pleased to welcome from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Mr. Declan Hughes, assistant secretary, Ms Fiona Kilcullen, principal officer, and Dr. Elizabeth Harvey, assistant principal.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and to the practice of the Houses as regards reference that may be made to others when witnesses are giving evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  Today's witnesses, however, are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  If, therefore, witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Hughes's opening statement has been circulated to all members.  To commence our consideration of this matter, I invite him to make his opening remarks on behalf of the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021042000002#A00400","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present the views of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the general scheme of the loan guarantee schemes agreements (Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland) Bill 2021.  In order to meet the pressing need for finance by Brexit-impacted SMEs, small mid-caps and primary producers, this new scheme will need to be fully operational by the end of quarter 2 of this year, as the Chairman mentioned.  I am joined by my colleagues Ms Fiona Kilcullen, principal officer and head of the Department&rsquo;s finance for growth unit, and Dr. Elizabeth Harvey, assistant principal in the unit.<\/p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has been working with Brexit-impacted businesses since 2016 to ensure we have the right range of supports in place at the right time to help businesses adjust to Brexit eventualities.  Before commenting on the specifics of the Bill, I will provide a general outline of the plans for a new Brexit-focused loan scheme.  Loan guarantee schemes continue to be a key instrument for providing help to vulnerable but viable businesses impacted by the effect of Covid-19, Brexit or both.  Since the start of the pandemic, close to &euro;931 million in lending has been sanctioned to more than 8,000 businesses through State-backed loan guarantee schemes operated by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, on behalf of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The results from the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s bank lending survey from January 2021 indicated that 2021 will see increased demand for business lending for both guaranteed and unguaranteed loans, with the increase in demand for guaranteed loans expected to be larger, as businesses navigate the uncertain and difficult times and as the parameters governing the schemes evolve.<\/p> <p>  Introducing the Brexit impact loan scheme, BILS, which provides for easier access to a wider range of financing needs for Brexit-impacted SMEs and small mid-caps, including primary producers, which were not included in the previous scheme, will ensure that appropriate access to finance options will remain available for SMEs over 2021 and 2022 at least, beyond the lifetime of the credit guarantee scheme, which is allowed by the European Commission only until the end of this year.  It is intended to help viable but vulnerable businesses respond to the liquidity challenges presented by both the Brexit and Covid disruptions, ultimately helping them to sustain their operations and employment. <\/p> <p>  The Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment is being asked to provide a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny for the general scheme of the Bill, which is intended to provide a statutory basis for the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to engage with the SBCI on the new scheme and on future loan guarantee schemes to be delivered by the SBCI, and to enable us to benefit from the European guarantee fund.  It is a short, technical Bill with a narrow scope, relating to a technical agreement that the Ministers will need to sign with the SBCI, rather than with the European Investment Fund, EIF, by the end of May 2021 in order for the BILS to be delivered by the end of quarter 2.  The new Brexit scheme will leverage a counter-guarantee by the European Investment Fund&rsquo;s pan-European guarantee fund, to which Ireland is a contributing member and which will be of benefit from the funding to which we are contributing.  Based on financial modelling, the effect of this guarantee for the BILS will be to make up to &euro;330 million in lending available by the end of 2022 at an Exchequer cost of &euro;29 million, and this relates to a multiplier effect of greater than a factor of ten for the Exchequer in terms of the money flowing.<\/p><p>This means that we will be able to leverage and much of the guarantee is coming from European sources.<br\/><br\/>In considering the legal basis for a new scheme and how the Minister might progress such a scheme, advice was sought from the Attorney General.  The Department is satisfied that it is appropriate to provide for the specific <i>vires<\/i>in legislation and to provide a statutory basis for relevant Ministers to fund and enter into future agreements with SBCI for the purpose of facilitating access to finance for qualifying enterprises.<br\/><br\/>The intention is to be fully operational by the end of the second quarter.  We mentioned at the beginning why there is some pressure on this.  There are several processes we have to work through to have it launched in time.  The first is to have an open call and assessment of the applications by lenders.  We would go out to a range of banks and financial institutions to participate in the scheme.  Legal agreements have to be developed between the European Investment Fund and SBCI, between SBCI and lenders to the scheme and between SBCI and the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Bill would enable this.  Information technology systems need to be put in place as well.<br\/><br\/>The Brexit impact loan scheme, as proposed, provided for lending to enable diversification of businesses in response to, and to mitigate, the impacts of Brexit and Covid-19.  SMEs and small mid-capitalisation companies, including primary producers, will now be included and can utilise lending through the scheme for activities aimed at addressing climate change challenges and other opportunities.  Funding through the Brexit loan scheme can also be utilised for purposes which yield environmental benefit but which are, under normal lending conditions, less attractive to lenders due to longer return-on-investment periods.<br\/><br\/>The proposed legislation will also enable Ministers to separately or jointly enter into future agreements with the SBCI and provide the necessary financial support thereunder, with the purpose of providing policy responses to identified market failures in access to finance for SMEs, including primary producers and small mid-caps.<br\/><br\/>Today, we are focusing on Brexit but we have headroom to enter into further agreements in other areas.  In particular this will allow Ministers the opportunity to act quickly to enter into agreements with the SBCI to leverage further European funding that is, or that becomes, available to Ireland through European-funded guarantee facilities.<br\/><br\/>The legislation must be enacted by mid-2021 if the scheme is to go ahead in time to provide support to Brexit and Covid-19 impacted SMEs, including primary producers and small mid-caps that are grappling with the twin disruptions of Brexit and Covid-19.  On behalf of the Department, I thank the committee for the opportunity to present and I look forward to engaging in the discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021042000002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Hughes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I will now invite members who wish to make a contribution.

Has there been engagement with the people who those of us sitting here in Dublin 2 believe will benefit or potentially benefit from this?

We have probably discussed this on previous occasions at the committee.  Certainly, there are some dimensions I am keen to highlight.  My colleagues might want to come in as well.<\/p> <p>  The first point relates to the demand side.  We know that with regard to Brexit we are in a strange situation where many of the impacts are still working their way through.  Businesses are working out what to do in terms of dealing with the additional cost of trade with Great Britain and the additional logistics costs relating to direct supply into Europe, etc.  There are also investment costs relating to the need to change or diversify to new markets and address climate change challenges as well.<\/p> <p>  On the demand side, we have indications from the Central Bank and from our engagement with the State bodies group that meets across all the suppliers in respect of SBCI, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and Enterprise Ireland.  We are confident that this scheme is at a level that will be needed in the coming months.<\/p> <p>  The second part relates to businesses.  One of the key issues is that businesses are reluctant to borrow at the moment in view of the level of uncertainty in Great Britain and in the domestic economy.  We have been hearing in respect of the Brexit loan scheme that, because the funding was guaranteed by the European Investment Fund's InnovFin facility, there was an innovation criterion.  At one level it related to anything that businesses were going to invest.  The point was that investment would have to go into diversifying or being innovative.  That was a test and an issue that kept coming up with businesses and representative bodies.  We have an SME and state bodies group where this point was specifically raised.  Essentially, we will not have that criterion in future.  We are dropping it because it comes from the European Guarantee Fund.  The only criteria are in respect of the business having an exposure directly or indirectly.  The business may not be trading directly with GB but some customers may be and they may be exposed.  This may apply to businesses in the tourism sector or primary producers supplying a dairy company that is ultimately supplying the GB market.  It may apply to a business importing as well.  We have covered off maximum flexibility with the fund.  They are the criteria.<\/p> <p>  There is a second element we have heard.  Brexit has been happening since 2016 and we have been trying to get businesses prepared.  Some are working through what were three-year schemes.  We have now managed to extend this from three years to six years.  One key requirement for businesses is that they work through the next year and the uncertainty.  Moratoriums relating to this can be negotiated with the banks.  A six-year period will allow businesses to work through the implications.<\/p> <p>  We will also have provision for refinancing.  If there are already some loans that are on two or three years and are coming near the end, they can be refinanced.  Again, that is something businesses have looked for in light of the uncertainty.  Covid-19 has compounded the uncertainty relating to Brexit.  We have also included another feature that was not included in the previous Brexit schemes relating to primary producers.  Some of our other schemes that relate to horticulture businesses and others that are labour-intensive and are exposed were not included in the schemes so we have included those in this scheme.  Another point is that flexibility on loan rates can be offered.  We hope that, on the basis of what we have done with the credit guarantee scheme whereby we have brought in several other finance providers, including the credit unions, we would be able to increase the number of participants.  This would broaden the range of financial providers available to impacted businesses.<\/p> <p>  In response to the Deputy's question, I would say we have been listening and we have certainly tried to maximise the flexibility of this scheme.  Moreover, I believe we have sufficient headroom over the coming two years.  This goes beyond the EU temporary aid framework that expires at the end of this year.  We would then have this facility into next year.<\/p> <p>  The final question was whether we have sufficient headroom with this Bill.  We are asking, with the committee's agreement, that we provide for &euro;50 million to negotiate deals with the European Investment Fund and the European Guarantee Fund.  The point is to get the &euro;330 million fund up and running and we would use &euro;29 million in this regard.  We will have further headroom to introduce further schemes as either Minister or both together may see fit.<\/p><p>If we need to expand it in future, we would have the room to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021042000002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Hughes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I thank the officials for the detailed briefing.  The essential role the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland plays is clear.  It has provided &euro;1 billion in bank loan guarantee schemes to 8,000 businesses since the start of the pandemic.  I note from the information provided that, despite last year's high figures, there is expected to be an increase in demand for the scheme this year.  How much of that increased demand is Covid-related and how much is Brexit-related?  The recent expansion of lending beyond retail banks is welcome and relevant.  I note it involves 19 credit unions, spread between three groups and non-bank lenders.  In light of developments in recent weeks, this is particularly welcome.  What is the Department's view on further expansion in this regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021042000002#C00200","speaker":"1646"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":367,"content":"<p>The &euro;330 million we envisage for Brexit will be essential this year for dealing with its impact.  As the Senator said, the lending and borrowing requirements are likely to be significantly higher.  When the credit guarantee scheme was introduced in the autumn of last year, it was initially for &euro;2 billion.  To date, just under &euro;300 million has been drawn down.  There are applications for significantly more than that.  There probably still is capacity for between &euro;1.5 billion and &euro;1.7 billion over the coming months.  We think there certainly would be a high demand for that in the context of reopening.  Many businesses that will need additional working capital, investment and so forth will be looking for five-year to six-year money which will be available from the credit guarantee scheme.  Between the two schemes, we have close to &euro;2 billion available this year.  As the economy reopens, that is what we envisage is needed.<\/p> <p>  On the demand side, there are different groups of companies which will need alternative sources of funding.  From a Covid perspective, we would see high demand from retail and wholesale businesses, as well as tourism, hospitality and personal services, as they begin to reopen.  They will need access to medium-term money such as five-year to six-year terms at low cost.  Many providers are at or below the 3% rate which is very competitive from a Covid perspective.  This gives these businesses time then to work through their new business sustainment plans and reopening.<\/p> <p>  On the Brexit side, we are also dealing with some of those businesses which would be dependent, for example, on foreign earnings.  This would involve tourists coming in but also engineering businesses trading with the UK, food processors and companies, along with education and fintech services.  We are picking off the broad base of enterprise between the Covid and Brexit schemes.  They are not exclusive either.  For example, in Enterprise Ireland's base of companies, 1,500 businesses are Brexit exposed but between 200 and 300 are both Brexit and Covid exposed.  They will have joint exposure to the domestic market, as well as to Brexit.  We do not want them applying twice.  We want them to be able to come in with a business plan and access either the Covid credit guarantee scheme or the new Brexit impact loan scheme.<\/p> <p>  We will be in a position to expand the scheme further.  That is why we have the headroom initially for up to &euro;50 million.  We are running with the &euro;330 million and then we will see what other mechanisms and schemes might be needed over time.  Other Departments may well be looking at the legislation to see how it might be utilised.  For example, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, it might be used to deal with climate action or other measures which might be useful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021042000002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Hughes"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":368,"content":"<p>With the challenges in banking due to the recent announcements by KBC and Ulster Bank, will the role of the credit unions be enhanced?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021042000002#C00400","speaker":"1646"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":369,"content":"<p>We are keen to broaden out the range of participants in our guarantee schemes.

For example, we initially limited the pillar banks to nearly one third of the first tranche of the credit guarantee scheme.  We then tried to get other finance providers, including the credit unions, to participate.  We did that to ensure that not all of the funding was cornered or taken by the pillar banks and to increase competition.  We have taken a similar approach to lender allocation in the future growth loan scheme.  We have the flexibility to reallocate if finance is not being used or drawn down or if any sort of market playing is happening.  Our intention is to help make the market increase participation, drive lending and drive down costs.  The future growth loan scheme was the first product that brought in ten-year money at below 4%, which is what indigenous enterprises needed in terms of low margins.  We are taking a similar approach to the new Brexit impact loan scheme.  The next step is to go out and determine the level of interest from lenders in the market, how best to allocate and what quota might be applied.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right about development advice.  One of the key lessons from the past year has been the importance of providing help to businesses in terms of business continuity and business sustainment planning and providing mentoring for them in advance of making applications for finance.  Advice came to us strongly from the Credit Review Office about ensuring that the business plans answered the right questions and were sustainable before they were submitted to the bank.  Enterprise Ireland provides a &euro;5,000 financial planning grant, which has been helpful to businesses in mapping out their medium to long-term development.  It has helped with the drawing down or preparation of applications to the sustaining enterprise fund, under which a current provision of &euro;200 million is being administered.  Similarly, more than 10,000 business continuity vouchers were issued by local enterprise offices, LEOs, by the end of last year.  In the first couple of months, they were drawn down to help businesses prepare business sustainment plans so that they could access funding.  Microfinance Ireland provides a reduction of 1% in the interest rate for businesses that come through LEOs.  There is a standard rate of, I believe, just over 5%.  It is reduced by 1% to 4% or 4.5% for a business that comes through an LEO.  The business gets access to a mentor, professional advice and so on, which helps it to ensure it has a plan that is sustainable in the longer term.<\/p> <p>  Digital and climate are complex areas.  With Enterprise Ireland and LEOs, the T&aacute;naiste just launched a new &euro;10 million green enterprise fund.  It will help to provide advice and strategic planning capacity to micro and small businesses to prepare climate adjustment plans that include their investment needs and assessments of technology.  Major uncertainties for businesses revolve around what the best technologies are, what is appropriate for their business, what markets are they going to and how they can finance that.  Financial planning supports are available and we hope to support approximately 850 businesses with them this year.  We are open to suggestions about how we might proceed with that.<\/p> <p>  Regarding loss expectations, it is capped.  We are utilising the European Guarantee Fund, EGF, for 56%.  Another 24% is the State's, but it is capped at &euro;29 million.  As with previous guarantees, there is a fair distribution between what the EGF and the State are providing, but also what the banks are providing, given that they will have skin in the game as well and will hence be judicious in their assessments.<\/p> <p>  Regarding attitudes towards borrowing, the key issue before Covid was that businesses were in deleveraging mode.  We had seen a decrease in the refusal rates, but there was still a reluctance to borrow.  During the early part of the crisis, there was a significant increase in facilities being opened or requested by businesses but not subsequently drawn down.  For six months of last year - essentially from April or May to October or November - nearly 30,000 businesses had loan breaks with their banks.  Most of those breaks have now been worked through and businesses are coming back.  We are seeing more modest levels of borrowing in the credit guarantee scheme.  These are more essential levels of borrowing.  The average loan is approximately &euro;50,000 to &euro;60,000.  Our initial budgeting expectation was that it would be similar to the future growth loan scheme at approximately &euro;150,000 to &euro;200,000, but the feedback we are getting is that businesses are taking out just enough to see them through until they get certainty about reopening.  The facility will be available to them to come back to those lenders as they look to reopen.  That is the research and feedback we are getting from the Central Bank.  As the economy reopens, there will be a need for increased liquidity for working capital and investment finance to meet the expected increase in demand in the recovery.  Perhaps Dr. Harvey or Ms Kilcullen wish to comment on the issue of demand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021042000002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Hughes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":373,"content":"<p>A bank lending survey is done by the Central Bank of Ireland.

In one sense, however, this is pre-legislative scrutiny, given that we are discussing the Bill.<\/p> <p>  I will ask one or two brief questions.  Mr. Hughes told us that since the start of the pandemic, &euro;931 million had been sanctioned.  How much of that has been drawn down?  He stated that amount was across 8,000 businesses.  That would be &euro;116,000 on average if my math is correct.  Of the overall 230,000 SMEs, 8,000 seems a small number.  That might be a good thing and mean that SMEs are not under any pressure, but as Mr. Hughes noted, many businesses are reluctant to take out extra borrowings and pressure in that regard.<\/p> <p>  For the purpose of this Bill, how does the Department define SMEs?  It is probably the usual definition, but the witnesses might put it on the record.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Bruton touched on the repayment situation.  I note that loans are repayable after three years, six years and so on.  Will the witnesses say more about when businesses will be expected to repay?  If they are still under pressure in future, might there be rollovers or what other kinds of relief could they get?<\/p> <p>  It was stated that 137,000 farmers had a combined output of &euro;8 billion in 2019.

What kinds of pressures are they are under?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021042000002#D00500","speaker":"1515","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":377,"content":"<p>My colleagues can clarify the figures with regard to the drawdown book.  We have seen very significant drawdown from both the future growth loan scheme and from the credit guarantee scheme.  As I said, more than &euro;250 million was drawn down from the latter scheme and almost &euro;600 million was drawn down from the former scheme.  I will ask my colleagues to comment on that.<\/p> <p>  I might just deal with the other issues regarding SMEs and mid-caps.  Our definition of SMEs includes micro, which employ fewer than ten people, and SMEs, which employ fewer than 250 people.  For the record, we have also included mid-caps, which are businesses with fewer than 499 employees.  Using European definitions, we have very good coverage in terms of the SME base.<\/p> <p>   One of the key objectives of the payment schedules was to try to lengthen the time of the loans.  For example, lending under the credit guarantee scheme is for up to six years.  Similarly, we wanted to extend the Brexit impact loan scheme as far as we could beyond three years.  We can go out to six years now, which will be welcomed by many businesses.  There will also be options for the usual moratoriums on repayments, repayment schedules, etc.  We have seen that flexibility in many of the schemes.  It is being negotiated by the banks with their borrowers and they are obviously kept under continuous review.  The only point the banks always make to us is that it is key that the borrowers maintain contact with their lender in order that they can continue to ensure they are agreeing schedules of repayment and there are no surprises.<\/p> <p>  On the horticultural and agricultural side, we have been working for a number of years now on this joint initiative with our colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  All our initiatives on the guarantee side are generally jointly negotiated with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and jointly funded by the two Departments.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine generally has specific quotas for primary producers, which can be up to 20% or 30% marginal value, MV, for the food sector and maybe up to 40%.  They can mix in terms of their contribution between the processors and the primary producers.  We know the processors and consumer food companies have spent a number of years preparing.  The Deputy may be aware, for example, of Carbery Group Limited in west Cork, which took the significant strategic decision two years ago to invest in mozzarella production.  We spent a lot of time getting the EU approval for that &euro;78 million investment.  The company commenced production of mozzarella for the Asian market before Christmas.  Obviously, that helps to sustain farm families right across west Cork.  Similarly, after Christmas we launched a new &euro;100 million competitiveness and market diversification fund for the meat and dairy sectors to help improve their competitiveness but also to respond on the climate action side.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Enterprise Ireland, together with Bord Bia, are also working with the horticultural sector to help with diversifying its markets.  Whether it is fruit and vegetable producers or mushroom and other producers, the sector is probably better prepared for Brexit than it was for some of the previous crises it had to deal with in terms of companies changing their supply chains, improving their competitiveness and looking at alternative markets and how they can adjust to them.  These companies have been hit twice in the past year, by Covid-19 and Brexit.  This scheme will help the sector with short-term working capital needs and also investment plans as companies seek to increase value added and the innovation of their products so they can continue to compete in Britain and also find alternative markets.  I ask Ms Harvey or Ms Kilcullen to comment on the data side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021042000002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Hughes"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I will mention a few points on repayments for SMEs and moratoriums.  Looking at the figures, and Ms Harvey can follow on from this, loans to the value of &euro;900 million have been drawn so far.  This includes agriculture primary producers.  Many of the schemes contain features that allow for moratoriums.  Under the credit guarantee scheme, for example, payment breaks of up to a year, including interest repayments and principal, can be given to people who have loans if they find themselves in difficulties.  Further forbearance is allowed after that within the scheme.  We are hearing so far that very few borrowers have availed of that.  It is welcome that this capacity is available if needed.<\/p> <p>  On farmers and fishers, there has been a good level of uptake of the credit guarantee scheme in the primary agriculture sector, particularly for dairy.  There are 407 loans in dairy, 189 in other farming and fisheries has also seen a good level of activity.  For those we are here to discuss today, bringing the primary producers and farmers into that scheme would be extremely beneficial for those who are Brexit impacted because the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme is particularly for Covid.  The Brexit impact loan scheme would, therefore, be extremely beneficial to primary producers and farmers as they cannot avail of the current scheme for Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021042000002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Kilcullen"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I thank our guests.

It would be too early to say what would happen at the end of the six-year period.  I think most of the loans would be on a schedule for repayment of capital interest, depending on the schedule, after six years.  Prior to the future growth loan scheme, the banks already had arrangements in place where they were providing five-year loans and had agreements on how the loans might be rolled over.  Some of those would, therefore, be commercial arrangements.  Our intention, working with the lenders, is that in cases involving three-year money coming to the end of the term this year that needs to be refinanced for a longer period, borrowers will get access to this guarantee at competitive rates and on better terms.  I hope that is helpful to the Deputy.<\/p> <p>  On the warehousing of debt and the CRSS and CBAS, those payments are essentially contributions to the fixed costs of any business in receipt of them.  The Government has indicated that those payments will be available until the end of June.  There will not be a cliff edge.  Obviously, it is too early to say what will happen there.  The business plans that would be developed by any business will obviously take account of what they have benefited from to date and then project forward.<\/p><p>Last year, businesses were submitting applications to the banks with a number of scenarios.  That would be the normal sensitivity testing which would be done by the banks, in terms of saying remain open and demand recovers this year or next year, but assessing what might happen if there was a further shock.  The track record has been that the Government has stepped in to provide the necessary supports for employees through the wage subsidy scheme as well as to cover fixed costs with the CRSS and the SBASC.  I expect any warehousing of debt and repayments would be part of the scheduling and the financial planning which would be built in.  The Revenue Commissioners have issued guidance as to when some of those liabilities will fall due.  They are open to engagement and that would feature as part of the financial planning.<\/p><p> As Deputy Bruton mentioned, there is financial advice available to businesses.  We encourage businesses, and certainly microbusinesses, that are trying to work through those financial plans at this stage and are looking forward 12 and 18 months and looking at the financial projections to engage with their local enterprise office, and if they had a mentor last year or they had somebody to engage with through the business continuity scheme to engage with them again.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has similar support, as well as Enterprise Ireland.  Certainly, they should get good advice, as many businesses have done.  That has helped to sustain businesses over the last year, in that they put good business financially sustainable plans in place with their financial projections.

That can have an impact on foreign direct investment here as well, which is something we should take into account.<\/p><p>I have a question for Mr. Hughes and his colleagues.  The small enterprises that have been affected more than any others are small retailers.  There has been talk about click and collect starting shortly and so forth, but many of these small businesses have been closed for quite some time.  With retailers in particular, some of their stock is season-dependent.  They have summer stock and then they must get rid of that in the sales in the winter.  Then they bring in the winter stock and they get rid of that in the sales in the spring.  They have not been able to do that, so their cash flow has been impacted.  On top of that, in recent days we have heard reports that some of the large multiples have been selling stock such as shoes, clothes and so forth, which they are not supposed to do.  That could have an impact on the small and medium sized retailers in towns and cities across the country.  It is deplorable they are doing that and shocking that they are not being pulled up on it.  It appears that it requires a complaint to be made to the Garda and the Garda must then investigate, which seems to be very convoluted.<\/p><p>I appeal to the larger multiples to stop selling this stock because they are impacting in a negative way.  If people get into the habit of going to the larger multiples, they will stop going to the smaller shops.  What is the situation with regard to small retailers in towns?  We hear a great deal about town centres and so forth.  Many of our town centres are being hollowed out because these small retailers have been closed for so long and nobody is going into the towns.  I am not sure whether the behaviour of the multiples will have an impact on the small retailers.  Does Mr. Hughes have a view on that?  Second, what is his information or knowledge of the impact on small retailers across the country?  Will many of them not reopen?  Are many of them engaging with the various agencies such as the Department, the LEOs and so forth with respect to the various loans we are discussing today?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021042000002#F00500","speaker":"1515"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":386,"content":"<p>We have been working with the retail sector in the context of both Covid and Brexit since 2016 or 2017.  We have really good contacts with the sector across the representative bodies, including the Convenience Stores and Newsagents Association, CSNA, and the Retail Grocery Dairy and Allied Trades Association, RGDATA.  They are members of a retail forum which is chaired by the Minister of State with responsibility for retail, Deputy English.  We have also had, for the last year in particular, a retail and supply chain round table which during last year was meeting probably once a month or every two weeks, and over Christmas and at the back end of last year it was probably meeting weekly, to deal with both the Covid and Brexit impacts.  It was to ensure that we have continuity of supply, and retailers and wholesalers put in extraordinary work to ensure we had continuity of supply, and to deal with all the issues that existed in terms of new customs and other procedures.<\/p> <p>  The retail sector proved relatively resilient last year because it had click and collect.  It diversified quite quickly in using the online vouchers from the local enterprise offices.  Indeed, many found new markets and alternatives.  In some of the grocery retail, we know that off-licences and other parts of it have done quite well, in some cases up 15%, 17% or 20%.  However, it is the broader base of retailers that populate our high streets and main streets that have been particularly impacted since Christmas, especially in not being able to avail of click and collect.  That is a huge sacrifice.  People stayed at home, did not congregate and so forth and that was based on public health advice.  We had a meeting of the retail forum with the Minister of State, Deputy English, last week which looked at the reopening roadmap and the prospect, which the T&aacute;naiste and Taoiseach have mentioned, of reopening click and collect, hopefully in May if the numbers continue to go the right way, and then the remainder of non-essential retail thereafter.  Indeed, our advice now to all retailers is to put preparatory actions in place by ensuring they have work safely protocols, ventilation and queuing systems.  We are engaging with shopping centres and others in regard to that reopening.<\/p> <p>  At the same time, we have also had the compliance issues, which the Deputy mentioned.  There are clear regulations which specify the outlets and activities that are to be open and not open, in terms of essential or non-essential.  The regulations are also very clear for mixed retailers.  Where there may be, for example, fashion, clothing and home ware, they are to be sectioned off.  It is not permitted to allow the public into those areas except on compassionate grounds.<\/p><p>We all know of many examples where people need clothing for job interviews or funerals, for example, and the compassionate grounds provision exists in those circumstances.  The Government has also introduced new regulations to allow for the fitting and purchase of children's shoes from last week by appointment.<\/p><p> Therefore, the regulations are clear.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been working very closely with us and members of the force met with the retail forum last week to outline the measures being taken.  Those measures focus on engaging, encouraging and informing.  Where that is not the case, however, and the Garda is not getting co-operation, enforcement will be proceeded with.  I think just under 200 cases have been referred by the Garda for consideration to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, and I believe several cases are pending in that regard.  It is a very credible regime and we have continuously sought the co-operation of all retailers.  I reiterate that the majority of retailers are bearing the brunt of this situation.  In the remaining time, it behoves everybody to fall into line with the regulations to ensure we have a safe reopening for everybody.<\/p><p> The full range of supports are available.  The CRSS is specifically for retail outlets that have had to close on public health grounds and have not been able to allow the public access.  That support is available and is being accessed by the retailers.  Hopefully, it will sustain those retailers on the main street and ensure that they are in a position to reopen.  Many of those retailers have stock from last spring and summer and perhaps now autumn stock as well which has not cleared.  That is a significant issue for them, but we will provide encouragement regarding there being good value available in such areas when we get back out and reopen.  Hopefully, the public will be back out supporting those retailers.<\/p><p> The small business assistance scheme, SBASC, has also been beneficial in this regard.  Approximately 22% of the applicants so far have been from the wholesale and retail trade.  Many wholesalers and suppliers to the retail sector that do not benefit from the CRSS because they do not have customers coming in have been benefiting from SBASC.  There has also been very high take-up under the credit guarantee scheme, and they will also be able to benefit from the scheme under consideration.  <\/p><p> We must now work towards a safe reopening, get consumers back out spending and get cash flow back in the retail sector.  As the Deputy will be aware, we have been working with the local authorities to ensure that the public realm is attractive and safe for local shopping.  Significant initiatives were taken in this area before Christmas.  The Deputy will be aware that there is a new &euro;200,000 grant scheme for local authorities to undertake further improvements in respect of streetscapes to ensure that our town and city centres are attractive for people to come into, mingle and enjoy recreation, shows and other entertainment as well.

It is a very frustrating issue for Deputies and Senators on the ground.  <\/p> <p>  My two brief questions, then, concern whether Mr. Hughes can confirm that click and collect will be reinstated in the first week of May and the percentage of retailers receiving the CRSS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021042000002#G00200","speaker":"1646"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his questions.  I wish we were in a position to set the regulations and the timeline.  Those decisions are made from a public health perspective, but certainly the roadmap as published by the Government, depending on the numbers, has firmly indicated that, all going well, click and collect will be back in May.  That would be step one.  We would be supportive of that development, but it is dependent on public health advice and those regulations are obviously made by the Department of Health, in conjunction with the Department of the Taoiseach.  We will, however, input into that process.  What we and the Minister of State, Deputy English, have been saying to the retail sector is to prepare on that basis.  Things change and who knows what variants or other developments might happen, but I concur with that view.<\/p> <p>  I do not have the details regarding the CRSS as it is a Revenue scheme, but we can provide that to the Senator.  Looking at the temporary wage subsidy scheme, however, it is possible to see that a high proportion of businesses, more than 70% of those in motor retail and repair, availed of the scheme.  There were similarly high numbers in the wholesale area.  Figures for the TWSS indicate that 30% to 40% of retail businesses availed of the scheme, which would tally.  We hope that all retail outlets impacted by the current level 5 restrictions are benefiting from CRSS on the basis that they have a relationship with Revenue, they are on the system and they should be able to avail of the scheme.  If they are not, they should then be able to come in and get the SBASC.  An example would be if a retail outlet is not closed on public health ground but perhaps for other reasons or revenue is down 75% because the trade just is not there.  <\/p> <p>  As I mentioned, approximately 22% of applicants for the SBASC, which is a scheme we know about, are from the wholesale and retail sector.  We are certainly happy to follow up for the Senator on the CRSS data.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021042000002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Hughes"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I have been communicating with Mr. Hughes for some time regarding certain sectors excluded from the CRSS and SBASC because they do not have rateable premises.

Mr. Hughes said that other ways of trying to provide support to these sectors were being explored.  Have there been developments concerning that?<\/p> <p>  My second point concerns previous comments made by him regarding examining involvement of the credit union network in some of the microfinance elements.  Has the Department been considering activities that might promote more of a public banking role for the credit union network, given the exit of Ulster Bank and now KCB?  Is the Department giving any views to the Department of Finance regarding such a role or any support on how we might consider implementing a wider banking role for the credit union sector?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021042000002#G00400","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  We have received a range of queries that are going back out to the local authorities, which hopefully have been helpful.  However, once a business is on a rated premises, even if it is not the business paying the rates - and of course some elements of the rates charge are contained in their bill or payment - then that business will be eligible.  Regarding the business referred to by the Deputy, clarification was provided that it would be eligible because it is a business in its own right providing a service on the premises of someone else.  That service provision has ceased, but the business concerned has a fixed point of operation.  It has a fixed premises in that park, and that is an important point.  We have really tried to get the message out in that regard.<\/p><p>It is also addressed in the frequently asked questions for the local authorities, which is helpful.<\/p><p> For others, such as circus businesses, it is a small amount but they would certainly be eligible.  Most of them have a lock-up or storage as well.  What we are trying to do with the SBASC is to cover their fixed costs.  It is not necessarily about covering their loss of income or, in many of these cases, the ongoing maintenance and re-equipment, which, as the committee will know from many examples, may well be significant.  It is trying to ensure they will at least have funding that will sustain them from a fixed-costs perspective.  I hope it has been helpful and we will seek to examine further initiatives for other sectors.  While we rolled out the small business assistance scheme, our colleagues in the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media launched the music and entertainment scheme, which is again trying to cater for some of those businesses that were not covered by CRSS or other schemes.  We need to ensure we have the right mix of supports.  There are probably still a small number of home workers and so on whom we need to ensure can get back up and running quickly.<\/p><p> As for credit unions, I mentioned in the context of the credit guarantee scheme that extensive work has been done with the Department of Finance and the SBCI to ensure that credit unions could participate.  There have thus far been two tranches of credit unions that have put in the required systems, the capacity and the risk assessment.  Some credit unions have got those systems in place in their own right and will be well versed in lending and risk assessment for credit unions.  We are very keen to see them step up and continue to participate in that market.

No clear guidance can be given as to whether or not or to what extent their evidence is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  Persons giving evidence from other jurisdictions should be mindful of their domestic statutory regimes.  If they are directed by the Chairman of the committee to cease giving evidence relating to a particular matter, they must respect that direction.<\/p> <p>  I will go straight into the business of the committee.

Since the beginning of the Covid-19 period, in March 2020, we have seen many health and social care services, including disability day services, closed to people with intellectual disabilities.  Thankfully, day supports have remained open during the second and third lockdowns, albeit on a limited basis for many and a little or not at all for a few.  Inclusion Ireland has previously addressed Oireachtas committees on the multiple suspensions of children's disability services and the lack of educational supports during school closures, which parents report has affected the development of their children, many of whom were regressing.  This cessation and then reopening of these services has had a significant negative impact on people, affecting their well-being and independence and the mental health of people with disabilities and their families.  Prior to Covid, many people with an intellectual disability told us they felt invisible and poorly treated by mental health services and that they were struggling to access them.  Now, given the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of people with an intellectual disability, there is expected to be an increased need for mental health services as a result of Covid-19.  It is vital that the mental health intellectual disability programme is rolled out, funded and established in communities across the country.<\/p> <p>  More than three years on from the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2018, Ireland is at an important juncture at which the Government must show leadership in its implementation.  The new Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth must show leadership and actively promote the implementation of the convention across all Departments.  One crucial element of the convention's implementation is the ratification at the earliest opportunity of the optional protocol.  Another important aspect of ratifying the convention is the full commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  The Act was enacted several years ago but is yet to be fully commenced.  We need to see action on swift commencement of the decision support service and to ensure that the issue of those being made wards of court as a result of the Act not being fully commenced is redressed as soon as possible.  Full commencement of the Act is essential to ensuring that individuals with disabilities have the support to exercise decision-making and choice in their own lives.  It also plays a key role in the State's compliance with the UN convention.<\/p> <p>  The Government's Time to Move On from Congregated Settings policy was clear in recommending that all congregated settings be closed by 2018.  This simply has not happened.  In total, 8,300 people currently live in residential services, with an additional 1,500 people with a disability under the age of 65 living in nursing homes.  According to HIQA, these figures include approximately 2,900 people living in congregated settings.  We know the consequences and risks of this arising from Covid-19 over the past year.  The convention is clear in its opposition to institutionalised living and on the right of people with disabilities to live a life in the community.  It is, therefore, imperative that the Irish State ceases the continued use of institutions that are in clear breach of domestic and international rights and increases funding to accelerate the deinstitutionalisation process.<\/p> <p>  One of the biggest barriers facing people with an intellectual disability in accessing social housing is the clear lack of available support services that are required for them to live in their own homes.  People who need supports in their homes have no clear pathway to apply for these supports.  Through our advocacy work we have found that many people report being placed high on social housing waiting lists due to their disability but then not being able to access social housing through their local authorities due to the support services not being readily available at the right time.  This must be addressed.<\/p> <p>  I will now hand over to Ms Browne, my colleague, who will speak on the work of the Disability Participation and Consultation Network.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021042000002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Lorraine Dempsey"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Dempsey.

I thank the Chairman, Deputies and Senators for the opportunity to have an input at this sitting of the committee.  I am chairperson of the Disabled Persons Organisations Coalition, or DPO Coalition.  We are one of the member organisations of the Disability Participation and Consultation Network, and I present this statement on behalf of the entire DPCN.  This is a very young group and I will tell the committee a little more about it.  We see the development of the DPCN as a very important milestone for the disability community and we welcome the Government's commitment towards its establishment.  The overall purpose of the DPCN is to ensure that disabled people and their representative organisations will be heard directly by the Government in making decisions on disability policy and law.  There are four grant-funded members of the DPCN: AsIAm; the coalition of the six national organisations of disabled people, of which I am chair, and which is known as the DPO Coalition; the Disability Federation of Ireland; and Mental Health Reform.  As the committee can see, the membership is a very broad church.  The membership of the DPCN is also and very importantly includes more than 100 non-funded members, individuals and disability organisations.  Representatives from the four grant-funded members, along with Inclusion Ireland, as the network organiser, are involved in establishing the network.<\/p> <p>  Our immediate task has been the network's response to the State's draft report under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  That consultation process closed very recently, on 9 April.  The DCPN organised six consultations, which included anyone and everyone from around the country.  In these Covid times everything was online and more than 190 people participated across all six of those consultation sessions.  This presented a very good opportunity for the DCPN to connect with the wider membership.  Following the consultations, a response to the State's draft report was formally submitted on 9 April.<\/p> <p>  It has been a very challenging start for the network.  It is new; it was established in December 2020.  In reality we only began meeting in January, with the timeline of 9 April to be met for submission.  The five organisations have been working together for the first time, consulting at the same time with more than 100 members on the State's report.  All this has happened within a very short timeframe.  Our next priority is to explore how we can formally establish the network and to focus on governance, organisational structures and planning.  However, given the substantial increase in the network's membership, with many members being volunteer-led, additional resources are essential to ensure that our participation is genuine, active and meaningful and that the direct voice of disabled people is prioritised at all times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021042000002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Jacqui Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Browne for her contribution.

We welcome our colleagues, Ms Lorraine Dempsey and Ms Jacqui Browne, who have introduced themselves.<\/p> <p>  The Joint Committee on Disability Matters requires a complementary mechanism through the Department of An Taoiseach, namely, the operation of a project management function to ensure effective and efficient implementation across the Civil Service and public service area.  This is urgently needed.<\/p> <p>  There are over 640,000 people with disabilities in Ireland and they have a shared reality of poverty and exclusion from many things that others rightly take for granted.  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, requires nothing less than the will and preference of people with disabilities to be front and centre and, equally, that all organisations, be they State, voluntary, community or private, work together.  They all have an obligation to work together to make this great project work.<\/p> <p>  The DFI has been involved in the implementation of a number of national disability strategies.  This is our learning from that.  If Ireland uses the same approach for implementing the UNCRPD it will not succeed.  The programme for Government commitments to the implementation of the UNCRPD came after the arrival of the Covid pandemic.  We now need, and expect to have, to have a strong implementation programme for the remainder of this D&aacute;il.  We look forward to what the budget might bring us in a number of months' time as a start to that.<\/p> <p>  I will now discuss progress on implementing the UNCRPD, the optional protocol and the State's response.  In our opening remarks I laid out a number of important foundations to progress implementation, namely, the new Department and a full Cabinet Minister with disability as part of the remit, along with equality and other related organisations.<\/p> <p>  Ms Dempsey and Ms Browne mentioned December, when the State published its first initial draft report on the UN convention.  This was a very positive move.  DFI, as one of the funded members of the DPCN, consulted within our own disability family, people with disabilities and organisations.  I want to make some points that came out of that consultation.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is rich in policy and relevant legislation.  We are constantly and consistently weak on implementation.  There are notable parts of Education for Persons with Special Needs, EPSEN, Act , the Disability Act 2005, the Citizens Information Act 2007 and the more recent Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act.  They are all pillars of disability inclusion legislation, with significant elements of them not having been implemented.  That is not a bad place to start catching up.  <\/p> <p>  Ireland continues to have the highest rate of poverty among people with disabilities in the EU.  We still have a big problem in terms of having reliable and relevant data on people with disabilities to better target our initiatives and work.  <\/p> <p>  Ireland still has to ratify the UN optional protocol.  When the convention was ratified in March 2018 there was a sting of disappointment that the protocol was not ratified at the same time.  For God's sake, let the Oireachtas get on with it now and encourage it to happen.  There is no substantive reason that cannot be done now.  <\/p> <p>  To conclude before I hand over to Dr. Joanne McCarthy, I wish to state that the DFI position on how well we are doing in compliance can be best characterised as being policy-strong but lacking overall project management.  We are not getting on with doing the job effectively.  That is the key point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021042000002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Dolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dolan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021042000002#B00300","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies and Senators here today for giving us the opportunity to contribute.  I want to welcome my colleagues from the DPCN, Ms Dempsey and Ms Browne.  One of the points the committee asked us to cover was amply addressed by Ms Browne, in terms of the role of the establishment of the DPCN.  I want to reiterate a number of points the committee has heard from Ms Browne, but they are important and we hope the committee takes some time to consider them.<\/p> <p>  If we are to truly ensure that our consultation processes hear from the voices and experiences of people with disabilities, our consultation process has to be genuine.  Unfortunately, once we were appointed as the four funded members of the DPCN there was a very quick turnaround to gather the input from people with disabilities for the State's draft report.  There are over 640,000 people with disabilities in Ireland.  They are not all the same and there are many different spaces and locations.  If we really want to hear from those most marginalised or those most distant from the political process, we need to be genuine in how we carry out that level of engagement.  There is learning from the first round of engagement that we hope to build back into the network.<\/p> <p>  The methodology employed to identify members of the DPCN has to be commended.  One unanticipated outcome was the identification of over 1,000 additional members who were eager to be involved in this process.  Again, because of the quick turnaround required of us for our response to the State's report, that level of engagement has yet to be fully realised.  We encourage the committee to provide the necessary resources and timelines to enable us to hear from and exercise the expertise in that broader network.<\/p> <p>  As Ms Browne said, we comprise five organisations, four funded and one co-ordinating member.  Some of us have a history of working together on measures such as the Oireachtas disability group.  Others do not have that experience, therefore there is a period of time where we have to figure out how to work together in terms of achieving the best possible outcomes for the people with disability we represent.  I reiterate the point that there is definitely a need to examine investing appropriately to make sure that the best possible outcomes can be achieved from across the membership.<\/p> <p>  I want to move on to the impact of Covid.  In some ways, it is a bit like Groundhog Day.  DFI and others have been before the committee a number of times over the lifetime of this pandemic to talk about the issues.  We are all acutely aware of the impact Covid has had on individuals and families, and that has not changed.  I want to take this opportunity to commend individuals, families and organisations on their innovation and commitment, which has ensured that people have been protected from the impact of Covid, especially those in residential and day services.<\/p> <p>  We are, however, concerned that we do not have reliable data to understand how prevalent Covid was among people with disabilities who are not availing of those services.  Unlike other countries, we did not gather data on the presentation of people with disabilities to acute and hospital services.  That is alarming because international evidence suggests that there would have been a high prevalence of those cases, outside of day and residential services, who may have been affected.<\/p> <p>  I also want to take this opportunity to remind the committee that the organisations that have played such a critical role in providing, as best they can, some sort of shield to individuals and families during the lifetime of the pandemic are the same organisations that in 2019 came before the Oireachtas to explain the crippling deficits they were carrying.  Between them they are carrying a deficit of more than &euro;40 million.  Despite the challenges they have faced they have turned into the pandemic, and that is something that should be commended.  <\/p> <p>  There are a number of learnings from the experience of Covid within disability services, something that committee members need to reflect on.<\/p><p>The first is that Covid exacerbated what we already knew were some of the big challenges in disability services and, outside of those, within services to disability generally.  We know the 3,000 people in congregated settings and the 1,400 plus people under the age of 65 who are in day services are inappropriately placed and were in the eye of the pandemic storm due to the unacceptable nature of their current locations.  When the pandemic hit and we had to look at how we safely deliver services, in particular day services, we also began to identify how we are not yet in the position to provide appropriate individualised services and supports.  It has been a difficult period both for the 27,000 people who use day services and for their families.  We now know from the last tally that there has been a return to day services of between 40% and 50%, and we acknowledge the extra investment in those to try to help them to reopen.  There is still a service gap for people with disabilities, and without planning and the resources to deliver much more person-centred services in future, we will always have this challenge in adverse situations.<\/p><p> We must acknowledge the significant investment in budget 2021.  For the second time successively for a long time we have seen investment in personal assistants and home supports.  What this pandemic has also shown us is that these are the critical services that enable the best responses to be developed to people's individual needs and family needs.  It is incumbent on all of us to consider how best we can resource and invest in these models of service as we go forward.  They are, after all, in keeping with Article 19 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  They are the baseline for Article 19.<\/p><p> We often lose sight of the fact there are 640,000 people with disabilities in Ireland.  A very small number of that population access day and residential and other core national disability services.  Most people are users of general health services and these have been crippled during the pandemic.  The impact of the pandemic will be carried by these services for a very long time and will inadvertently impact on people with disabilities as they work to have good quality health and well-being.  We know from the recent tally there are almost 27,000 people waiting for neurological outpatient services, more than half of whom have been waiting longer than 12 months.  We have to address this issue as a matter of urgency.  We welcome the acknowledgement in the recent HSE operational plan of the need to invest in disability services.  One of the main things from today we are looking for the committee to think about is how best it can support the HSE and others to ensure investment best suits the necessary outcomes for people with disabilities.<\/p><p> I do not know whether I have a minute to talk about the vaccination roll-out.  I am sure it is high on all of the members' agendas and they are probably getting many queries in their constituencies around it.  It is merely to acknowledge the fact we will pass a milestone at the end of this week or next week whereby all people in day and residential services within disability services will have been vaccinated.  Our colleagues within the HSE and within the services must be commended on this heroic effort.  I would encourage Oireachtas Members, however, to ensure they complete this programme to people within disability services.  There are many people who receive personal assistant, PA, supports and home supports who have yet to receive vaccines.  Many of these are vulnerable because of the comorbidities they have to the impact of Covid and we would encourage members to ensure the Oireachtas pushes through and finalises the vaccination of all those within disability services.  Equally, we are conscious of the role GPs will play in vaccinating most people with disabilities, and we would encourage members to ensure GPs are receiving the most up-to-date information they can to help in prioritisation.<\/p><p> We are lending weight to our colleagues from Inclusion Ireland, the Carers Association and the Care Alliance on the need to vaccinate carers as a matter of urgency.  The symbiotic relationship between individuals and carers is well appreciated.  If people with disabilities are vaccinated but their carers are still exposed to the impact of Covid, should they contract it, it puts extra pressure both on families and on the services that provide the added support.  Do not forget that carers are the unfunded service providers, and once the State has put the hand out to support those who are funded to deliver day and residential services, we are now asking Oireachtas Members to do the same for the families who provide most of the care within these settings.<\/p><p> I will hand back over to Mr. Dolan for some final comments and I thank the committee for taking the time to listen to our concerns today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021042000002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joanne McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":414,"content":"<p>If the way we have implemented the disability strategy so far continues, it will be a failure.

One of the things that came out of the meeting on International Women's Day of this Committee on Disability Matters was the idea of ability by design, that everything across Government needs to have that.  One of the main outcomes of that for me was to pursue the commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and to speak about that, and the following Friday I had a Commencement matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to discuss that very matter.  In my previous life, I dealt with how that Act, coupled with the general data protection regulation, GDPR, could empower people with disabilities, when it came to decision-making, in having access to all of their information, so I came to it with a little bit of background in how to deal with that.

Imagine not being able to make medical decisions about yourself and your own bodily autonomy without going through the ward of court system.  Imagine someone with an intellectual disability wanting to enter a sexual relationship and get married but not being able to do so unless he or she goes through the ward of court system.  These are decisions that, as a community, we take for granted, but certain people, particularly those with intellectual disabilities or mental health difficulties who are made wards of court, are stripped of any power over their bodily autonomy and decision-making.  We view wards with intellectual disabilities or mental health difficulties as being incapacitated and they must prove their right to understand anything big in their lives on which they wish to make a decision.  The fundamental change under the legislation and through the setting up of the decision support service will be that we will assume they have the capacity to make decisions, and it will be up to the State to prove otherwise.  In that, they will be supported with co-decision-making practices.  For those who do not wish their families to be part of their decision-making, if issues arise in that regard, there will be an independent support service to help them make decisions that are right for them without the interference from the courts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021042000002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Lorraine Dempsey"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":419,"content":"<p>I reinforce that.

It is too intricate to be discussed today at a meeting of the committee.  On the decision support service, Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn is very much on top of the matter.  Let me outline one of the main things that it would be great to see the committee pushing for in order for the decision-making support service to truly work for us, disabled people, especially those who are very marginalised and excluded and often in coercive or controlled settings or relationships that are unhealthy.

It is great to hear from all of them.  Since the time is limited, I have some questions I would like to ask.  Every member of this committee is very anxious to do what he or she can to implement the UNCRPD but I do not want to see this committee consigned to history as being full of good intentions while having no teeth to get things done.  In this regard, reference was made to many reviews, reports and strategies that were prepared but whose recommendations were not, or not fully, implemented.  Could Mr. Dolan expand on his proposal to have the Department of the Taoiseach operate a project management function?  How can this committee make that happen, and what should we be doing to make something of that nature happen to ensure we achieve what we set out to do?  We have had a number of meetings with Ministers and have raised issues with them.  I acknowledge that our work has been hampered by the Covid restrictions and that we should have a lot more done than we have but it is difficult when trying to  talk to Ministers on a media platform rather than face to face.  I find we do not get the answers we want to many of the questions we ask.  The lack of independent supported living, which I see as a cornerstone of the UNCRPD, is raised with me constantly.  What we are seeing is a lack of co-ordination between local authorities and the HSE.  How can we do something about that and move it on?<\/p> <p>  What are the delegates' thoughts on how we could address and perhaps reverse the regression the closure of schools has resulted in for many students with additional educational needs?  Is there something that could be put in place, such as enhanced July provision and other supports, in schools?  The waiting lists for intervention and therapy seem to grow longer all the time.  The withdrawing of therapists to do contact tracing has had a negative impact in this regard.  We keep getting assured that the therapists are back in place but that is not what I am hearing from many parents.  The waiting lists seem to be getting longer.  Children who get an assessment of need often have to wait years for any sort of intervention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021042000002#D00500","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I will pick up on the first question and let colleagues pick up on the issue of school closures etc.  It is as simple as this: one of the roles of the Taoiseach's Department is co-ordination.  It is the Department that supports the Taoiseach of the country.  It is our absolute experience that the efforts to achieve implementation to date have fallen down because there was not what I would call a ward boss, or somebody with authority who can ring up any Department and say, \"Come on, lads, you need to think this through a bit more and work with other Departments.\"  All the problems people with disabilities have are exacerbated because they have to go back out the door of one Department, go down the street and queue up to go into another Department, local authority or other organisation to actually get things moving.  The Oireachtas disability group and the voluntary members, the Disability Federation of Ireland, National Disability Services Association, Inclusion Ireland and Independent Living Movement Ireland &mdash; I believe I have mentioned them all but I may be corrected if I have not &mdash; looked for two critical infrastructural things in the run-up to the last general election.  One was a committee, this committee.  We did not come up with the phrase \"disability matters\"; some other genius came up with that lovely name.  It is all about the disability matters in people's lives.  We also looked for a Minister of State in the Department of the Taoiseach who would have responsibility for disability matters and who could, in effect, pick up the phone, pull Departments together and go back to the Taoiseach and say we need more in a certain area.  It is that leverage that is needed at the centre.  We did not solve the unemployment problem of ten, 11 or 12 years ago without a whole-of-government approach to it.  It was the job of every Minister and Department every day of the week.  The response to Covid has been at a whole-of-government level.  It is not just been regarded as a health issue for the Department of Health to solve.  If disability and implementing the UNCRPD involve a lived commitment, the Taoiseach's Department has to find a way to put in what I describe as a project management system to help and support and to test that things are happening efficiently and effectively.  Public service reform is supposed to be about efficiency and effectiveness in carrying out the commitments the State has already made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021042000002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Dolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":423,"content":"<p>While I am aware that several members want to contribute on Deputy Tully's points, I am conscious of the time.

Instead of being diverted towards testing and contact tracing, therapists are being directed towards assessments of needs and reducing the State's breaching of the statutory obligations to complete assessments within the statutory timeframe.  This means any children on intervention waiting lists, or in intervention but not receiving intervention, have to wait because of the State's obligation to meet the assessment of needs deadline.  I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has invested more than &euro;7 million towards reducing the assessment of needs waiting lists but while children are in a constant loop of assessments they do not get what they really need, which are the actual interventions to make a difference.<\/p> <p>  Inclusion Ireland came before several Oireachtas committees to speak about the impact of Covid on children in schools through school closures and remote education not working.  What we would like to see is a massively expanded summer programme, even larger than last year.  This means incentives for more schools to engage in school-based summer programmes because for the most part this is what children really need.  What we do not need are parents having to struggle to find tutors or special needs assistants themselves with no centralised database operated by the Department of Education.  I understand the spokesperson for education in Deputy Tully's party has raised this issue with the Department.  Inclusion Ireland, Down Syndrome Ireland, AsIAm and Family Carers Ireland requested, and received approval from the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and the Minister, Deputy Foley, that the Department should set up a regular consultation forum for our organisations in order that we can input collaboratively to the development of measures such as the summer programme.  Instead of something that will not be effective being announced, we can be part of designing something that will be effective from the outset.  We have written to the Department to establish this group.<\/p> <p>  With regard to services, Covid has only exacerbated waiting lists.  It did not create the waiting lists.  What we need is investment.  When we do have investment the HSE has a problem with recruitment.  I understand it is looking at how we get over this.  I cannot see any difference being made in the coming years if we do not produce the required therapists in third level and entice them into children's disability services.  Otherwise, we will always have unfilled yet funded posts.  This is the direction we are going in.  We are at risk of not being able to deliver for children's needs because we simply cannot fill posts when funds are available.<\/p> <p>  Every other day we hear parents on the radio, in the media and on \"Prime Time\" expressing how distressing it is to see their children not developing and not meeting their potential because the parents are not been given the right resources to support them.  This also goes for schools.  We know that allocation of special educational teachers and special needs assistants are based on whole school profiles.  Re-examining these school profiles has been stalled.  We understand the reasons for this, given the pandemic, but schools will be trying to provide an additional teaching allocation for children with special educational needs based on the same numbers they had four years ago.  This is particularly the case for developing schools, such as those with Educate Together as a patron body.  We need to see an increase in supports for special education teacher allocations and special needs assistant allocations to wrap around schools, as well as additional therapy supports to ensure children are delivered therapy in the right place at the right time for what they need.  If it is school-based so be it.  If it is home-based or community based, depending on what the goals are for that child, we need to develop the systems and resources to deliver them effectively for children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021042000002#E00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Lorraine Dempsey"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":425,"content":"<p>I confirm I am in Leinster House.

Deputy Tully asked how we would know we were successful at the end of this term.  The most important thing to remember is that we do not have the baseline data to understand how we will know.  We have it on some things within the disabilities services programme but there is no knowledge of the number of people who require a personal assistant or home support.  We do not have these data.  One of the key successes that would give a foundation in the world of UNCRPD is having the right data and understanding them.<\/p> <p>  This is also linked to the question on housing.  Often people may get a house but have difficulty accessing the personal supports to enable them to live independently in the house.  How do we marry data from various Departments to ensure the most comprehensive person-centred responses can be delivered?  We need to tease out some of the challenges on what data we have and what data we need.  The census has been very important but it has gaps.  We use data from the survey on income and living conditions, SILC, but sometimes it is very difficult to disaggregate it.  We really need to think about what are the data we need.  If we look at what is in the draft State's report on the UNCRPD we will see this.  Without baseline data it will be very hard to track success or otherwise over the coming years.  I encourage the committee to think about the data deficit because it is very important.<\/p> <p>  The housing issue is critical.  Consultation has been quite good.  Housing advisory groups have been established in most local authorities.  Sometimes they work very well and sometimes they do not.<\/p><p> In terms of very good models, it is almost like a systemic change within local authorities.  There are different models.  We in the Disability Federation of Ireland are supporting a model in Wicklow, which is powerful.  We would welcome the opportunity to come back and talk to the members about that.  It is where we work with local authorities to consider how we plan in an inclusive and mainstream way for the inclusion of the needs of people with disabilities within that county in the services we plan.  There is a definite need to consider the role that local authorities play because when we think about health we are almost pulled by the nose in terms of the &euro;2.2 billion that is in disability services.  However, while that is a lot of money it funds 9,000 places within residential services, allows 27,000 people to access day services,as well as providing a small amount of respite and a few other services.  Most people with disabilities never get near that.  The role and the importance of local authority planning for their population, which might include 13.5% of people with a disability, is critical.  We need to think that through and bring that over to other Oireachtas committees to ensure they also ask those questions in a mainstream way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021042000002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joanne McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":429,"content":"<p>We are running over time.

I will try to be brief.  There is so much I could say and offer, in addition to the other members and colleagues from Inclusion Ireland and the DFI.  I want to remind people of something that has been forgotten about, especially in today's discussions where we talked a good deal about the service provision.  We are losing sight of disabled people as individuals and their direct participation in life but also in the implementation of policies and strategies.  For too long in this country we have operated in silos.  That is one of our core barriers generally.  We saw some very good examples of how we broke down silos when it came to resolving many issues around homelessness during the Covid pandemic.  For example, very few people who were homeless died because of Covid.  That was as a result of partnership in terms of breaking down silos.  I urge the members of this Joint Committee on Disability Matters to not forget to take the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, as their mapping and overarching policy tool.  There are only 50 articles in the convention.  I urge the members to lead and not impede.  In particular, I urge them to look at Article 1, the opening article, which speaks about how disabled people are at the heart of the convention.  We should be doing nothing without the direct involvement and representative voice of disabled people and not have others speaking on their behalf.  That is very important.<\/p> <p>  Equally, Article 4 talks not only about the participation of disabled people but also the prioritisation of the voice and the lived experience of disabled people in decision-making and in planning, implementation and strategy.  Those are two critical points for the committee to take on board when it is discussing the future and championing the rights of disabled people under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  I hope that helps.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021042000002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Jacqui Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Browne.

I have two brief questions.

Second, if he has time to answer, what do we need to do to accelerate supportive living and to move away from congregated settings?

Members might remind me if I miss out on something.  I will start with Deputy Cairns' questions because they are most easily remembered.  On the optional protocol, there was a commitment to implement the CRPD in the 2011 programme for Government.  It was not done in that one and it was re-ignited for the next programme for Government.  There seemed to be a sense that the line that was always being put out was that Ireland is not ready to do this until we have all this other legislation lined up.  I thought that was ridiculous in the sense that it is progressive implementation.  It is about implementing the convention bit by bit, year by year and module by module.  It starts on the basis that many things in one's state are not the way they should be in terms of legislation, funding, services, participation and so on.  Am I being cynical in saying that they held that piece back?  I cannot see any reason it cannot be done, particularly when a state says it is up for it.  We were the last country in the EU to ratify the convention.  We then moved very quickly and did something that was ground-breaking, namely, the establishment of this committee.  Why do we spoil that by not signing up to the protocol and saying that we will do our damnedest to make sure that people have their day in court, if they need it?  All other mechanisms have to be dealt with also in terms of that process.<\/p> <p>  On the Time to Move On from Congregated Settings report, as Ms Dempsey said at the start, it should be history by now; it should have been done.  We are talking about approximately 2,900 people.  The undertakers of Ireland will solve that problem if it is not taken by the scruff of the neck.<\/p> <p>  Ms Dempsey referred to 1,400 people.  Those are people under the age of 65.  While it was right to focus on people in congregated settings and the delivery of that policy, at the same time the State was putting young disabled people into nursing homes across the State, and that number has been increasing every year.  There is a small commitment in this programme for Government to start moving people out of those nursing homes.  It is down to political will and the confidence of the State to get on and do what needs to be done.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Hourigan's questions, I totally agree with Ms Browne's points.  People with disabilities are the front and centre, as I have said already.  Anyone and everyone else comes in to support that, not to speak on behalf of that.<\/p><p>Otherwise, the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015 is a joke.  <\/p><p> On Deputy Hourigan's point, I mentioned four items of legislation in my opening remarks.  There might be others, but those I mentioned are key.  It would be great to get the relevant Oireachtas committees to consider them and to actually start pushing them.  I will mention one more, namely, the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009.  It gave the National Transport Authority, NTA, the right to require private operators providing public transport, for example, buses, to make the vehicles more accessible.  It has never chosen to do that, even though it is in the legislation.  Therefore, there are many issues across the system, including cultural issues, lethargy and all sorts of other things.<\/p><p> Deputy Murnane O'Connor asked some questions in respect of responsibilities transferring from the Department of Health to the new Department.  Let us be clear about it.  It concerns the transfer of the disability services programme.  There is a whole range of services and supports that fall under the remit of the Department of Health and which should rightly remain under the remit of that Department.  People may be in congregated settings, day programmes or residential supported living.  They equally and strongly need access to a whole range of other health services, whether they are dental, neurological or whatever.  I warn against thinking that responsibility has been transferred elsewhere.  It is one of the responsibilities that will have to remain.  I do not have a view.  It is important that focus is placed on getting the move done right rather than just getting it done.  However, it does need to happen sooner rather than later.<\/p><p>  Going back to a point made by Deputy Murnane O'Connor on whether there is a model local authority in respect of housing, generally, Wicklow County Council was the first local authority in the State to set up a committee that is almost akin to this joint committee.  That county council is the first local authority to start to look at disability in the round.  That is something worth looking at.  I hope I have not detained members for too long.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021042000002#F00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Dolan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":438,"content":"<p>Mr. Dolan has not.

It is something we have discussed previously at this committee.  We have spoken about the potential benefits of setting up a steering group that would have on it a representative from each Department that would set out its own objectives in terms of delivering on the UNCRPD commitments and objectives and report to us on a quarterly basis.  If we had something like that, that was cross-departmental in nature, with the backing of the Taoiseach, and most importantly, with goals and targets and a structure whereby it did not necessarily set deadlines but reported on a quarterly basis, as everybody would want to deliver a good update.  If we had that, we could create more impetus around ensuring that each of the different Departments is bringing this to its top table and is always considering whether policies are inclusive and how they will work from a disability perspective.  We should be encouraging them to always ask those questions and to strive to achieve their objectives under the UNCRPD.  <\/p> <p>  Ms Dempsey spoke well about congregated settings and where we are - or indeed, where we are not - when it comes to progress in that area.  I was interested to hear her remarks about the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  I know that my colleague, Senator Seery Kearney has touched upon that issue and on what amendments to the legislation might be required.  It is something on which all of us here from the different parties must work on a cross-party basis to ensure that when the laws come in, they are as strong and practical as possible and can be implemented.<\/p> <p>  The discussion has been most welcome.  Ms Browne and Dr. McCarthy have made really interesting points.  It has been hugely welcome to have this level of discussion around the issues.  I know that from Ms Browne's perspective, the network that she is hoping will make a significant difference to the sector requires resourcing and will require funding.  That message was heard by me loud and clear - that is for sure.  I thank her for all of her work.  I would like to hear some more about what is happening in Wicklow County Council to enable us to encourage our local authorities to take a leaf out of its book. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021042000002#G00300","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":440,"content":"<p>Does Ms Dempsey wish to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021042000002#G00400","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I can come back to the Deputy's point and tie in with remarks made by some of the other members.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. Dolan said, our undertakers are partially responsible for sorting out the Time to Move on from Congregated Settings strategy.  They always have been.  In the period since 2012, when the strategy was launched, over 1,000 people have passed on rather than moving out to live within the community.  The issues with this are as follows.  We are both under-resourcing and under-prioritising this as a policy.  According to the HSE's service plan for 2021 - and consistently in its service plan every year - the number of people set to move out into community-based settings is under 200.  That does not mean those people are moving out to live on their own, isolated from supports; it involves moving the supports out with them.<\/p> <p>  In relation to housing, one issue is that in cases where people choose to move from a residential setting under the care of a service provider out into social housing, quite often they find it impossible to decouple their funding from the disability service provider, which gets substantial funding for each person that is in a residential setting.  While those people might be able to acquire the social housing, they simply cannot avail of it because of that.  Under the national housing strategy for people with disabilities, there is an obligation to develop national protocols and frameworks for interagency co-operation, right down to local authority level.  The best practices that exist need to be shared, but it must be consistent across the country.<\/p> <p>  In response to the Chairman, Deputy Moynihan's point, when the Covid restrictions are lifted, I would love to invite the whole committee to visit Inclusion Ireland's offices.  In our boardroom, there hangs a picture that was painted by Ms Frieda Finlay, a former chair of the organisation, called Gathering Dust.  I have repeatedly mentioned this.  It is a painting of probably 300 different documents, papers, legislation, steering group and departmental reports related to disability on the shelves that have never been implemented or have been partially implemented.  Mr. Dolan has mentioned four key items of legislation.  There is a significant deficit in funding implementation.  We provide the legislation and the framework, but we do not actually provide the funds  For example, in respect of the Time to Move on from Congregated Settings strategy, which is part of the HSE transforming lives programme, without exception, it was requested that most of those streams be implemented on a cost-neutral basis for the HSE.  That was impossible from the get-go.  Project management came in late in the process, three or four years into some of those programmes.  <\/p> <p>  There are good examples of cases within Departments where either legislation or a policy has been agreed in the programme for Government, and from the start a budget has been allocated to implement it, a strong project management team put in place, along with interdepartmental communication, co-operation and, more so, accountability.  These are the types of model that we need to see in other areas of disability.  A good example is the access and inclusion model under the remit of the former Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  It is one of the few policies under the programme for Government and the national disability inclusion strategy that has actually been fully implemented and year on year, it is about improving it and developing its capacity.  Therefore, there are good examples of where this works.  However, we do suffer from what some refer to as \"implementitis\".  It is significant across Departments.  When the new national disability and inclusion strategy is launched and cross-departmental strategies and steering groups are established, we will face the same challenge again.<\/p><p>The implementation is poor because they are not funded to be rolled out in any significant or meaningful way.<\/p><p> Deputy Hourigan also mentioned the effects of Covid over 2021 and 2022.  Aside from the roll-out of the vaccine programme, we really do not know what is ahead of us in terms of variants and everything else, but what we know is that there has been a significant impact on people with disabilities both in services but more so in the community.  These are people who are not connected to services.  They are people who are living independently, albeit with support.  We keep talking about services in the context of the HSE, but there are people who can no longer go into their employment because of the risk to their personal health and people are isolated within their communities.  I hope that when the restrictions reduce and we look at developing inclusive communities in 2022 and 2023 that we build back better.  When we identify people who are isolated by Covid, we must identify those who were isolated long before Covid and ensure we do not leave them behind in the country's recovery.<\/p><p> Deputy Cairns mentioned the optional protocol.  Again, it comes down to accountability at an international level for the State.  All too often we shy away from accountability, whether it is at a Civil Service level or a political level.  We have to wait until we get to the ballot box.  This was going to make the State accountable at an international level, where we as individuals have the right to call our country into question.  We have the draft report on the UNCRPD.  For some, reading that report does not reflect their lived experience.  It is a description of the State's systems, with a shine on some of them, but certainly for individuals looking at them, they will say that this is not about them and their lived experience.<\/p><p> Part of the network is being able to capture that.<\/p><p> Regarding intellectual disabilities specifically, Inclusion Ireland works very hard to try to create a platform for individuals to be able to have their say, but that takes time.  If there are consultations and submissions to be made, it takes time to work with people with intellectual disabilities to develop their capacity to speak for themselves.  Following this meeting, Inclusion Ireland is before the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science where we have a person with intellectual disabilities speaking on the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act and their experience of special education in mainstream education.  It takes time to enable people to be able to speak for themselves.  In any Government process, whether it is consultation, input into committees, accommodation or time, it requires us to put in the time and to create a space for people who have the quietest voices in all of this.  Whether it is a voice, an augmentative and alternative communication, AAC, device or other means of communication, we need to create that space for them.<\/p><p> Regarding housing submissions, I am not sure of the numbers, but Inclusion Ireland created an easy-to-read survey for people with intellectual disabilities to be able to submit their thoughts into the national housing strategy for people with disabilities.  Departments are more open to that, as part of the new standard to involve people with all types of disabilities to be able to communicate their thoughts on the formulation of Government policy, but we need to do more and better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021042000002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Lorraine Dempsey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":443,"content":"<p>This is an excellent discussion.  I thank the witnesses for their contributions so far and the information they provided prior to the meeting.  A wealth of areas could be mentioned, but I specifically want to touch on the optional protocol.  I know it was discussed earlier, but I had a recent communication with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, where she committed to the ratification of the optional protocol once the UN has responded to the State report on the UNCRPD.  What is the response of the witnesses to that?  We are aware that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, recommended its ratification on the same day as the UNCRPD was ratified.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that.<\/p> <p>  I also note that the DFI has discussed its involvement with the vulnerable people subgroup of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, and the need for the group to continue.  Along with other committee members, I called for the reinstatement of the group.  I want to raise the matter at today's meeting to get a response in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Much of the information that has been discussed so far shows the frustration on the part of people with disabilities given the lack of implementation, in addition to the stark figures on the rate of poverty and social exclusion for people with disabilities, which is one of the highest in the EU at 38.1%.  Inclusion Ireland mentioned in its submission that targeted interventions are needed in households where there is a disabled person, as highlighted by the ESRI.  Could Ms Dempsey touch on that and indicate what interventions are needed to change this trend?<\/p> <p>  I wish to move on to housing before I finish.  It would be great if we saw Wicklow County Council's idea of setting up the committee replicated across all local authorities.  That is something the committee could seek to progress in the near future.  In the interim, how do we ensure collaboration between local authorities and the HSE?  Could we, as public representatives, facilitate that in any way?<\/p> <p>  Could the committee do anything to address the lack of data or could we work with the witnesses on an ongoing basis to identify where we could fill the gaps and how we could apply pressure in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021042000002#H00200","speaker":"1520"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":444,"content":"<p>I will respond to a few questions.  I was the person who sat on NPHET representing disability.  We were hugely disappointed when NPHET's vulnerable subgroup was stood down, because there are so many issues that are so specific to disability and the nuancing that is required.  I will give an example.  By just vaccinating those in residential and day-care facilities and not extending the programme to include those who receive other disability services such as key home supports, many of those have very complex disabilities and it makes them very susceptible to Covid.  It is difficult not having a space to escalate this or to be able to find a space to have it discussed appropriately.  I think we are still suffering the ill effects of that.  We did and would appreciate that ongoing push because we are not through it yet.  We are all talking in a positive way as we are rolling out the vaccine, but we are not out the other side yet.  I think it was my colleague, Ms Dempsey, who said we do not know what Covid will look like this time next year, so it is really important that we plan to make sure that we have the best wraparound response to all people with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  DFI would really welcome the opportunity to come back and to talk about the pilot project in operation in Wicklow and to demonstrate the impact that has had in terms of decision-making and hearing the voice of and the experience of people with disabilities and their families in how they plan their services.<\/p> <p>  I do not want to take up too much time but if I can, I will make some other quick points on which I did not get a chance to respond.  Somebody talked about bringing in each Department once every quarter and that Departments would be answerable to the committee.  That is really interesting.  We did that under the national disability inclusion strategy so I think there is learning there.  If the committee is doing that, the most important thing is to look at what it is asking them to measure against.  Everybody in the disability sector is very busy, but are we busy tracking the impact that this busyness is having on the lives of people with disabilities.  If the committee is bringing people together and asking them to come in, the types of information they are asked to talk about or give evidence against is really important.  We must examine what is being achieved through all this busyness, and how that is impacting on people with disabilities<\/p> <p>  We must be commended as a country.  We have been on a long journey for disability since the commencement of the Disability Act.  We have a lot of history and a lot of knowledge around that.  One of the key things on which we are consistently challenged is interdepartmental work.  Things fall down when two Departments are asked to work together.  Someone talked about housing.  That has been one of the biggest challenges.  Most people with disabilities are not in disability services, they acquire them at working age.  If their housing needs adapting and the housing adaptation grant is not sufficient, all of a sudden they are on the social housing list.  Their needs can change or escalate, for example, in the case of a neurological condition.  They need a home support package in order to sustain their ability to live independently.  They need access to a limited number of personal assistant, PA, hours.  Less than 0.3% of the disability budget goes into PA hours.<\/p><p>Someone else asked what is needed going forward.  We do not need more of the same.  We are asking members to think about how we invest in day services and decongregation.  That is just sorting out where we are currently.  We do not need more of that.  People want to live ordinary lives in ordinary places so do that one needs one's own home and front door, and access and to be secure in the knowledge that one will get personal assistant and home support hours, which will follow one into one's employment so that one can have a job.  <\/p><p> Earlier, people talked about poverty.  Almost 15 years later, Indecon is doing another round of research on the extra cost.  As we know there is an extra cost associated with having a disability, we do not have to wait for the report to tell us that.  We also know that the 120,000 people in receipt of the disability allowance are bearing the brunt of poverty or risk of poverty.  We urge the committee to start with them and it does not need Indecon to provide more information.<\/p><p> We have learning, so if the committee brings in representatives of Departments then I urge it to pay particular attention to the measures and find what works, as well as what interim measures does it want reported on.  It must assess how Departments work together and should make that a valued measure in its own right.  When two Departments need to work on something to deliver a service, the committee must find ways to track that.  The committee must remember that it is not about doing the same.  It is about how we track things such as the investment in new models, personalised budgets, personal assistance hours and the number of people who own their own homes or live in social housing.  They are the most important things to think about.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021042000002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joanne McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I thank all of the witnesses for coming in today.  The debate has been an incredible experience.  Every time we have public meetings I am left completely frustrated because there is a relentless need to do so much.  A few things have been raised today, including funding and resources, a consistent implementation and an attitude.  Wicklow County Council has shown a great attitude towards its disability pilot programme.  When I was a councillor, I tried to get disability awareness training to all staff who worked in Louth County Council, and a few of my county councillor colleagues around the country passed that motion as well.  Yet, the staff still have not received the training over a year later but it is compulsory for council staff to receive training on climate change.  That shows there is an attitude.  Disabilities are considered to be separate and something to be tackled at some stage, which is wrong because these people are our brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers and friends.  Disability is relentlessly boxed off.  While climate change training has been made compulsory, we do not have compulsory disability awareness or access and auditing training for technical staff in county councils.  It is all down to personalities and not looking from the ground up, and looking and listening adequately.<\/p> <p>  The last contribution made by Dr. McCarthy touched on inclusion and some of what I wanted to ask her about.  Inclusion and participation in society is down to poverty and exclusion.  Obviously poverty comes from services and supports but not being able to work.  Dr. McCarthy mentioned exactly what I was going to ask about the cost of disability.  I have seen at first hand that the extra cost of a disability is huge.<\/p> <p>  Today, many other issues were well covered but I have a few problems with the wage subsidy schemes.  There is so much more that we can do to assist people in waiting for wage subsidy schemes, and to encourage and help people.  I recognise that yesterday it was announced that &euro;5 million would be available for employment schemes for people with disabilities.  Dr. McCarthy has long experience.  Can she recommend ways that we can implement a more positive change in trying to get more people actively engaged in working and fulfilling their lives to the best of their abilities?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021042000002#J00200","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":447,"content":"<p>Senator McGreehan has made some very interesting points.  I will outline one thing that can be very helpful to the committee to be aware of and which can be of assistance to Members of the D&aacute;il and of the county councils.  They have available to them the backbone and support of the public sector duty, which is a position in law under section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act.  That legislation is available in order that members can encourage and have mandated all of the issues around awareness and training and regarding the implementation of the delivery of accessible public sector services.  It would be hugely beneficial for the committee to find out more about the legislation and participate in some of the training or at least increase members' background knowledge on it.  We should not forget that option is available.  Some county councils around the country and in urban areas are implementing the training very well.<\/p> <p>  On some of the other points, one thing struck me today, and I mean this with the best will in the world.  There is a lot of frustration, we all feel frustrated and sometimes we see a solution in calling for another committee to be established.  To be perfectly frank, in my opinion and that of an awful lot of disabled people to whom I talk and with whom I work all of the time, we have too many committees.  The problem is we will have too many committees and then there will be no time left to do the work to implement what we want implemented.  Sometimes one needs to say stop, step back and undertake a scoping or mapping exercise on how many and what type of disability-related committees exist, on whether there an overlap and whether we are duplicating efforts and thus wasting resources.  One will often see the same players and actors sitting on several committees.  They are getting no work done other than spending their lives attending committee meetings and saying the same thing in different places.  Sometimes we need to take a step back in order that we can come back with a simple, realistic and implementable strategy right across Irish society.  We must consider it as spanning the time from the cradle to the grave.  We must consider the lived experience of the person and, indeed, the family and parents of children with disability.  When we talk about people with disabilities, we talk about them in an inclusive way in terms of parents and partners as well.  We do not want four more committees and groups but we need to take a step back.  We must analyse everything and refine things.  Sometimes we are loath to let go of things for fear of losing something that we think is valuable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021042000002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Jacqui Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":448,"content":"<p>I join with others in thanking all of the witnesses for giving their time this morning.  The debate has been really interesting and instructive for all of us to listen to their comments and hear about their experiences and views.  I appreciate that along with all of my colleagues.  It is very nice to see Mr. John Dolan back here, as he is a former Seanad colleague.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious that a great deal of issues have been covered already and all of us are conscious of the immense impact that Covid has and is having on persons with disabilities.  My first question is on the closure of congregated settings.  The issue has been covered extensively and I hear the chilling point that was made about the number of people who died in congregated settings.  I am conscious that there is still quite a number of people in congregated settings despite the commitment to close them by 2018.  Was that not the original commitment? <\/p> <p>  I take the point about the difficulty with decoupling funding from service providers where people move out of congregated settings into supported living arrangements.  A charity closed a residential service that operated in St. Mary's Centre Telford, which is located in my own area.  The closure had an immensely hard and difficult impact on the lives of the people, mostly women, who had been resident for so long and it was their only home.<\/p><p>There was no clear alternative in place.  I do not know if there is anything we can do, as legislators, so that there are proper step-down and other supports in place where congregated settings are closed, especially for people who have been resident in them for many years and who may be very vulnerable and really open to terrible trauma through closure.<\/p><p> My second point is a very different one, which is to pick up on the creation and establishment of the new coalition, the disability, participation and consultation network.  I very much welcome that.  At an earlier meeting of this committee I asked the Minster of State, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, about her experience on coming into this sector and about the very many groups that currently represent so many different people and interests within the broad community of persons with disabilities.  The Minister of State said that there is a huge number of such groups.  Any co-ordination is very welcome and it is good to see.  It will only strengthen the advocacy.  How can we as legislators support the new network?  What is the best way for us to engage with the network to ensure that the voices of those with a disability are heard at policy-making level?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021042000002#J00400","speaker":"1631","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Bacik.

Deputy Higgins spoke of meetings with different Departments and steering groups.  I ask the Deputy to think of this committee as pulling together the Oireachtas voice and the Oireachtas questioning about moving on the disability strategy.  If the committee has what I would describe as the \"project management\" function, working from the Taoiseach's office down, one also has the executive side of what the committee wants to do.  The committee is on the legislative side and there is also the executive side.  Flowing from that would be some kind of consistency of reporting and development of the strategy.  Ms Browne, interestingly, referred to the public sector duty.  Every Department must do a statement of strategy.  I do not believe there is any statement of strategy in this Government that should not be referencing the public sector duty, and no strategy should not reference the commitment to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  On the optional protocol, it was interesting to hear the point made about the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  That sounds to me a bit like the old speak: \"We were waiting for somebody else to do it.\"  I absolutely do not see any reason it cannot be ratified now.<\/p> <p>  Senator McGreehan spoke about the frustration around needing to do so much more consistent implementation.  I go back to the point that we need the two pillars.  We have one pillar.  As I said earlier, in the run up to the general election the Oireachtas disability group looked for two infrastructural pieces, one of which was there would be a committee such as this, which is brilliant to have.  The committee is handicapped and frustrated by the circumstances that we are currently in.  I know that members are mad to get out and get at it, and to be able to have more people with disabilities, and organisations and groups in to the committee.  To be really effective, are the committee members going to be able to go around and quiz every Department?  Not really.  This is why the committee needs the Taoiseach's office to put that project management in place.  It must be remembered that there is a National Disability Authority that is funded by the State, which could do a lot of the workshops element and the backroom work on that.<\/p> <p>  Senator Bacik referred to the huge numbers of groups, the congregated settings and decoupling funding.  These are big issues.  I would also add the other issue of people.  Youngsters, people our age and much younger than us, are being given an absolute life sentence of going into a nursing home.  The first thing we must do is ask if we can stop one person going in this month and another next month.  This needs community-based funding for personal assistants, home help and other supports to wrap around people, and for us to sit down to listen to those people and what they want from their lives exactly.  The rest of us come into it in trying to make that happen.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the huge number of groups, there are two things going on.  There is the fundamental right in the Constitution to form associations and unions.  The point about there being too many groups keeps coming up.  Are there too many political parties?  Are there too many independent schools around?  There are 1,500 or 1,700 schools that are all independent.  Yet, they can work in a unified way.  This can also happen with the organisations and groups.  Everyone now has to face into being an implementer, a minder and an owner of the convention.  We have the script, we have the road that everyone must go down, we have the Charities Act, we have HIQA, and we have a lot of State-funded regulatory authorities to put smacht on organisations and groups.  I believe we can move through these but the critical point for the committee members is to get that pillar sponsored by the Taoiseach's office, which is the project management piece.  It will make it manageable and it will be the executive part of what the committee is trying to do with the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021042000002#KK00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Dolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the great presentations.  Many issues were raised.  I will put aside the congregated settings.  I was very interested to hear what Ms Dempsey had to say around digital empowerment, the web accessibility directive and assistive technology.  I would be very interested if Ms Dempsey had something in writing on that, as my time is limited.<\/p> <p>  I want to talk about the big picture.  We have talked about the pieces that need to be done and about the legislation already in play.  I will address two other pieces that I feel we need if we are to take leaps forward: the statutory entitlement to home care and the regulation of home care.  How quickly and how massively can we scale that up?  Has it in fact now moved to the point where we have delayed in delivering these, and the level of ambition has to actually increase to look not just at a statutory entitlement to regulated home care but a statutory entitlement to personal assistance so a person could have that political, cultural and full participation in life?  Should we raise the ambition of that as well as delivering it?  That is from the individual perspective.<\/p> <p>  From a societal perspective, reference was made to the public sector duty.  I know Mr. Dolan.  I co-sponsored legislation with him around how we could put community participation into effect.  In this context, I turn to the national development plan and local development plans.  The national development plan is a huge amount of capital expenditure.  I want both plans trained in on climate change and the UN convention, both of which demand new thinking from local authorities in a really big way.  What would a huge leap forward look like on the national development plan and in local development plans?<\/p> <p>  The Community Participation (Disability) (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill has been hanging around forever and has never moved forward.  If the witnesses were to pick one unexpected or other element, something that is missing from the Bill, what would they add to it?  I am looking to what is coming through.<\/p><p>I thank Mr. Dolan, and again, I thank Deputy Canney, who has facilitated me jumping his place in the conversation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021042000002#KK00400","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":454,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Higgins.

Regarding digital empowerment, Inclusion Ireland ran a right to connect conference last December on International Day of People with Disabilities, which looked at people's access, particularly because of Covid-19, to both the web and the infrastructure, for instance, smartphones and iPads.  We take for granted that everybody hits their teenage years and gets access to a smartphone once they go to post-primary school.  Some adults with intellectual disabilities, however, do not have any connectivity and have been extremely isolated both when living at home with ageing parents or in services.  What we would like to see installed is that people have a right to connect and again, looking a couple of years ahead and at potential future restrictions, that people are supported with the infrastructure, which incorporates things like the national broadband plan, as well as in terms of financing.<\/p> <p> The interrelationship between poverty and employment stretches back to education.  What education path does a person therefore take?  If one looks at a special education pathway from the point of a three-year-old, we know that by the time that person is 18 or 19, he or she will probably still be in a special educational setting.  We have to look at the outcomes of that, which is quite often young people going into day services that are more special all the time.  That leads us into poverty.<\/p> <p>  There are two reports the committee should be seeking.  One is the cost of disability report that is sitting in the Department of Social Protection.  As Dr. McCarthy said, we know the cost of disability and the level of poverty right across the strata of people with disabilities and family carers.  We need the Government's report to be able to evidence that in figures that the Government itself will accept, however.  The other is the capacity review of disability services.  It is extremely hard to plan ahead if we do not have sight of what the unmet need is going to be over the next 20 or 30 years.  We know it is significant because the report was there and available to the previous Minister for Health, who passed it on to the current Minister for Health and said it was a decision for the new Government to publish that plan.  Again, I ask the committee to chase up the capacity review and have it published formally in order that we actually know what we are dealing with as regards disability services and the unmet needs of people with disabilities in the community.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the right to home care and the statutory scheme, a person does not have the right to stay in his or her own home and be provided with State support to do so.  A person can, however, have the right to go into a nursing home and have the care he or she requires.  That is not even suitable for many elderly people, let alone those under 65.  Parents must therefore make decisions with their young persons with disabilities.  I am a parent and I have aspirations for all my children.  For some of my children, however, my choices are extremely limited if I cannot get the funding in order that they can live independently.  And again, living independently does not mean living alone without supports.  It means being given the supports so that one can live independently of one's family members.<\/p> <p>  If we look to ageing parents, Senator Bacik referenced St. Mary's Centre Telford.  In the HSE's service plan for 2021, outside of emergency residential placements there is only provision for double-digit figures for planned transitional residential placements.  That means significantly fewer than 100 people will be able to plan where they are going to live in the community with the required supports and everybody else will be pushed into emergency placements.  At this stage, emergency placements are what we are talking about when parents die.  That is a traumatic time for anybody with a disability but to be removed from one's family home and put into an emergency placement, quite often respite, which then means those who would normally have respite in that centre cannot have it there, especially during the time of Covid-19, is no way for future planning for anybody.  That is what we are resorting to, however.  For the first time in the HSE service plan, therefore, there is provision for planned transitions, that is, incorporating the voice of the person with disability into what they want, for example, who they want to live with, where they would like to live and what life they want to lead.  It is led by them.  Out of a country of 5.5 million people, however, we have provision for a double-digit number of people to engage in that process.  That is scandalous.  And when one adds in the 2,900 in congregated settings, I am talking about individuals who are currently living at home.  There is very little focus on that cohort.  We really need to readdress this in terms of actual transition planning with the voices.  That is part of what would be required for the State to meet its obligation in terms of the right to statutory home care<\/p> <p>  I mentioned broadband with regard to the national development plan.  Senator McGreehan mentioned disability awareness training versus having awareness training around environmental issues.  If we had both, the Senator would realise that, for example, straws were developed for people with disabilities.  They were not developed to put into a cocktail along with an umbrella.  The removal of things that contain plastic, such as straws, removes something that is fundamental to some people's ability to drink independently.  If, therefore, we have awareness training, which like everything else is siloed, we will miss the impact on certain cohorts within our communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021042000002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Lorraine Dempsey"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I have been listening and taking notes as both our members and guests spoke .  I thank the guests for their input.  I have written down a few key words but one thing that is becoming abundantly clear and is most important is the fact that we need an implementation programme for everything we talk about.  I will go back to what Mr. Dolan said about the role of the Taoiseach's office in all this.  We have enough reviews, committees, working groups and all these types of gatherings.  A huge amount of people have brought forward parts of the problem within this area of disabilities.  I have come across some of it myself.  I do not know where to jump when I want to find out something because there are so many places one can go.  Usually, one goes to five places before finding the place one needs to get the structure right.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Dolan alluded to the fact that when we had a jobs crisis, it was a cross-departmental issue.  It was also targeted, however, by which I mean a plan was set out for five years with a target every year.  There was a review every three months, however.  The Minister in charge of it and probably one or two people in his Department, therefore, monitored what was happening on a quarterly basis.  If something was not happening, they asked why it was not happening.  It was flagged up with colours where red meant something had not moved and green meant it had moved and been achieved.<\/p> <p>  As my background is in project management, I like the term \"project management approach\".  We need to set out a five-year implementation plan, not a strategy; we have enough strategies.  There have been remonstrations.  People said they spoke to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, about the optional protocol.  That can be done when something else is done.  The question is who is doing that other thing to make sure the protocols are put in place.<\/p> <p>  From listening to the debate, the expression I would use is we have a fragmented approach at the moment.  Too many organs within the State are doing bits and pieces.  Somebody mentioned that a &euro;5 million fund was announced this week for employment for people with disabilities.  I did not know about it until I heard it today.  Things are happening that we do not know about.  We also need a co-ordinated approach to this in order that we know what to expect and when it will happen.  Then, we as a committee can challenge why something is not happening if it does not happen on time.  It goes back to that.<\/p> <p>  We have seen today, no more than any other time we meet witnesses, that we are learning more and more.  I am, however, more drawn to the conclusion that we need to do what Mr. Dolan said and put pressure on the Taoiseach to put in place an implementation team with somebody at its head who will call the shots and ask why this and that is not being done.  We need to bring together all the departmental officials to say this is our plan, this is how and when we will do it and then put the funding in place in order that it is achieved.  The legislation that is required to change things should be put in place in a proper timeframe rather than waiting for somebody else to do something.<\/p><p> It has been very interesting to hear what the witnesses had to say.  I can sense the frustration in everybody around these issues.  We need to be able to say when we will be getting on the train and starting to move towards getting things achieved and ticking the boxes that have not been ticked.  I said at the first meeting of this committee that my aim is to work to remove some of the things that I personally, as a politician, am not very proud of when it comes to disability services.  There are issues we need to address very quickly.  I thank the witnesses for their input and look forward to working with them to achieve what we are all trying to achieve, namely, putting the plan in place, with somebody at the head of it who will call the shots and get it done.  The funding must be provided by Government and looking to the Taoiseach's office is the way to do that.  When the Taoiseach says at or before a Cabinet meeting that he wants a report on something, he will get that report.  We need to have a person at the top who will make sure this is a national issue rather than being segregated off and spread all over the place, with nothing being achieved other than frustration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021042000002#L00400","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Canney and Senator Higgins.  There is a kind of commonality in the issues they raised.  I am delighted to see the integrity with which members have listened to us today.  I can really hear it in the questions they have asked and that is very welcome.  One of the key points to make is that there is a great deal of detail to consider because the area of disability is dense.  We know that because we work in the field.  Several times, members asked me questions and something popped into the back of my head but I still cannot give a simple answer.  The whole subject is really dense.<\/p> <p>  One of the key points we are taking from this meeting is that we all would really welcome a role for the Taoiseach in the implementation plan.  Looking to see where that stitch can be made is very important.  Another point is that we need a plan that is not just around telling us how much is going on and the activity that is happening.  It would be hugely welcome to have it built into the plan that there would be a consideration of the impact of that activity.  We know there is a plethora of policy and legislation that is hanging around and has not been delivered.  That needs to be front and centre of the plan in order that we can begin to tick through it systematically.  The policy and legislation are there and they have to be implemented.<\/p> <p>  Senator Higgins spoke about the big things that need to be done.  We too often think about disability services in terms of little boxes.  We talk about the people who get day services, for example, and the people who get personal assistance hours.  In fact, the convention asks us to think about what we have to do to ensure people can have ordinary but good-quality lives in ordinary places.  Article 19, one of the core articles in the convention, deals with the right to live independently.  We need to ask whether people have the right to personal assistance hours and whether the State is planning for the appropriate hours.  We talk about a statutory right to home care services.  That right will be a noose around the neck of many people with disabilities because, although it will give them the right to have someone come into their home to get them out of bed in the morning, they will then be trapped like a prisoner in their own home because they will not have the personal assistance supports to enable them to attend further education, go to work, do the shopping or meet friends.  No single Department can answer the right of people to have a good-quality life that is worth living in the community.<\/p> <p>  When we think about the implementation plan, we must go through the Acts and policies that are yet to be delivered.  Then we have to think about the fact that doing more of the same is not going to give us what we need.  We need to think about our expectation and what is put into the system to invest in delivery.  We have talked about the digital poverty experience of people with disabilities, an issue that the Disability Federation of Ireland and others have been talking about for some time.  We highlighted that issue at an Oireachtas committee meeting we attended in 2017.  It took a pandemic, when everything went online, for us to see the real lived evidence of that.  People could not access any services because they did not have access to computers, were not trained to access them or were living in places with broadband blackouts.  There is a reality we have to think about in terms of what is required for people and the fact the answer will not always be day services, residential care or nursing homes.  We need to think about the other models we want to put in place.<\/p> <p>  Senator Higgins spoke about ambition and aiming high.  In the context of an implementation plan, we should look at each convention article and name the multiple Departments that will have a responsibility to deliver on that article.  There is also a need to name any challenges that arise between two Departments or agencies working together that are hampering the delivery of an article.  An expectation should then be put in place, over two years, four years and six years, around where they need to get to in achieving that delivery, and that is what people will be brought before the committee to discuss.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2021042000002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joanne McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending, giving their insight and answering the questions as best they can.  I thank members for attending the briefing this morning and tuning into the meeting.  It is hugely important that we continue this engagement.  The frustration of members is clear.  The restrictions over the past six months mean we are finding it more difficult to do our work and continue the work that is in place.<\/p> <p>  A number of points came across this morning.  One is the importance of a whole-of-government approach or a direction from the centre of government in terms of how we are going to implement change and ensure disability is kept to the forefront.  I thank the witnesses for the invitation they issued to us.  We would dearly love to meet with them in their places of work and see what is being done.  We commit to doing that the very minute restrictions are lifted.<\/p> <p>  Another point that came across is that there is much work to be done to knit everything together.  There is a sense in some arms of the State that there should be a centralised model or approach.  Likewise, we get the sense from the various section 39 organisations with which we have engaged that the approach should be streamlined.  I am not sure that is the right way to do it, because differences can be useful.  For instance, the point that was made about the different types of schools shows that things can all work under the one umbrella provided the policy is right.<\/p> <p>  In my view, the fundamental issue underpinning all of this is the question of resources.  We have seen how the limited change there has been since the budget in reversing cuts and putting in further funding has somewhat eased the situation.  Several members spoke about how the provision of therapies and assessments of need is in an absolutely shambolic state right now.  We need to advocate on behalf of the people who need those services.  The witnesses' evidence has shown us that there is a lot of work to do.  The new word for my vocabulary is \"implementitis\".  It is a concept we need to take away from this meeting.  We have had enough talk about what we need to do.  Certain Parts of the Disability Act that was passed almost a generation ago have still not been enacted.  These are issues we need to tackle as a committee.  We must have a whole-of-government approach.  Our hope is that we will have representatives from every Department before us to discuss how they are implementing the UNCRPD and making changes in how they deal with disability issues.  That is our hope and ambition for the service.<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their engagement.  We look forward to further engagement with them as we try to advance the lived experience of people with disabilities.  We need to keep that at the forefront.

We will continue our work on disability matters and I thank witnesses sincerely for their help in this regard.

The format of the meeting is that I will invite Mr. Harris, followed by Ms Hart and then Ms Turley and Dr. Muldoon, to make brief opening statements to be followed by questions from members of the committee.  Each member has a six-minute slot to ask questions and for the witnesses to respond.  As the witnesses are probably aware, the committee will publish the opening statements on its website following the meeting.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  As the witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present, they have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  The witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  I now call on Mr. Adam Harris to make his opening statement, which will be followed by the statements of Ms Hart, Ms Turley and Dr. Muldoon.  They have three minutes each.  Ms Turley's statement is particularly important so I will give her a little longer, with the indulgence of my colleagues on the committee.  I now hand over to Mr Harris.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042000002#A00400","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for its invitation to present to it today on this important topic.  I also thank committee members for engaging with us on this important topic in recent times.  This is an imperative issue for our community that touches on many aspects of the education system.  It is challenging to cover everything in the opening statement but I will follow up with further documentation for members after today's meeting.<\/p> <p>  AsIAm is Ireland's national autism charity and we are working towards an Ireland where all autistic people can be accepted as they are.  One in 65 people in our school system today has a diagnosis of autism.  Of these young people, 14% attend special schools, 21% are enrolled in a special class attached to a mainstream school and the majority, that is, 65%, attend mainstream classrooms with their neurotypical peers.<\/p> <p>  It is worth considering what children with disabilities and autistic students face when it comes to accessing the right to education.  For the vast majority of children and families, seeking access to an appropriate school place is something they can take for granted but for many of our families it is the first of many battles, as we have seen recently in Cork where a significant number of young people do not have a suitable secondary school place for September.  Securing a school place tends to be just the start of a series of battles to get the support and understanding needed and to have an opportunity to learn in the school environment.<\/p><p>The EPSEN Act was set up to try to address many of these issues.  Its lack of implementation has meant that they have persisted.  Not only that but very often families have been without a formal voice in the educational journey of their children.<\/p><p> It is important to recognise that many children who are now integrated and involved within mainstream school were not only a short time ago.  It is not that long ago that there were even efforts not to recognise the right of all children with disabilities to an appropriate education.  However, we should not confuse this with inclusion.  We will not have achieved an inclusive education system until every child is able to attend a school and to have the opportunity to learn fully, and it seems we are still, unfortunately, a long way from that point.  We believe it is absolutely imperative that the Department of Education take a rights-based approach to providing supports for students with additional needs.  The rights of students and the voice and experience of students with additional needs must be at the centre of this process, and we do not think non-statutory supports or approaches go far enough.  If we need to see evidence of that, we need only point to the shortfalls, the lack of supports and the experiences of too many young people that have persisted across the country.  We remain convinced that the only way to ensure that children have the support they need and that schools are appropriately resourced and supported is to put in place statutory supports and mechanisms as proposed by the EPSEN Act 2004.<\/p><p> We think this needs to take place through a number of steps.  First and foremost, we would like the committee to commence a legislative review of the Act.  We recognise there are parts of the Act that need further amendment to bring them into line with the UN convention prior to their implementation.  We also recognise that some areas of the Act, if they were appropriately resourced, could be implemented now.  We would therefore like the committee to conduct a review to identify where the Act sits within our current education system and to make a plan for it.  We welcome the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, has indicated an openness to updating and amending the EPSEN Act.  We would like the committee, on foot of its legislative review, to propose an amended version of the Act and to bring that forward to the Oireachtas for passage and implementation.  We think it is very important that any commencement of the EPSEN Act is accompanied by the required resources and a clear roadmap with times and deadlines for how that will take place.<\/p><p> Finally, legislation is a key part of how we create an inclusive education system but it must go hand in hand with cultural change.  As we have seen in recent times, too often families and students with disabilities have faced an adversarial system.  Our education authorities must place the voices of families at the centre of every stage of the decision-making process, from the individual journey to the overall policy platform.  It is very important that our education authorities become collaborators, not gatekeepers.  I thank the committee and I look forward to members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042000002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adam Harris","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":469,"content":"<p>I appreciate that, as you said, Mr. Harris, three minutes is a short time in which to cover such a wide topic, but you have done extremely well.

I wish to echo a lot of what Mr. Harris said.  An inclusive society begins with inclusive education, but inclusion is much more than just physical presence.  According to the UNCRPD, inclusion is a process of systematic reform embodying changes and modification in content, teaching methods, approaches, structures and strategies in education to overcome barriers and provide all students with an equitable and participatory learning experience.  For children with Down's syndrome, research has consistently found that academic progress and achievements are better among those children attending mainstream school.  The majority of children with Down's syndrome now enrol in their local primary school, with increasing numbers progressing to mainstream post-primary school.  This is a welcome development and in line with education policy.  The EPSEN Act states that children with special educational needs should, wherever possible, be in an inclusive, mainstream environment with their peers.<\/p> <p>  Shockingly, however, 17 years later EPSEN has yet to be fully implemented.  The Irish State has an unfortunate history of introducing legislation which is then not fully implemented, and often those sections left unimplemented are those which would have the greatest impact.  The failure to enact the provisions in the EPSEN Act relating to an individual right to assessment and an individual education plan, IEP, denies students the statutory right to the educational supports needed to enable them to benefit from an inclusive education.  While in many cases teachers are willing to devise IEPs, this is not universal.  Schools are \"encouraged\" rather than obligated to provide an IEP.  Assessments may or may not be available.  We have long campaigned for EPSEN to be fully enacted and adequately resourced in order that the rights of students with additional needs are enshrined in law rather than dependent on \"encouragement\" from the Department and the goodwill of schools and teachers.<\/p> <p>  We are aware that education theory and practice have moved on since 2004 and we understand the calls for a full review of EPSEN before it is fully enacted.  However, we are looking for action now, not in another decade or two.  We acknowledge that there may be a need for amendments but we believe that the rights-based approach within the EPSEN Act needs to be rapidly adopted and the resources provided to do this properly.  We are not looking for a repeat of the early years assessment of need process, whereby statutory obligations are often not met and identification of need brings no obligation to provide support.  We are looking for students to have statutory access to individualised plans and supports which have been identified as necessary for their education.  With the year that is in it, we are also calling for additional SNA and resource teaching support to be provided to students.  We all know that students with additional needs have been badly impacted during the pandemic.  These same students will need additional support to continue their learning.  The practice of sharing access to SNAs across different classes is difficult to manage at the best of times and completely inappropriate in a pandemic.  It needs to stop.  We would also like to know whether the Department is gathering information and monitoring the use of reduced timetables in schools.  All children have been impacted by reduced access to education during the pandemic, but the fact remains that children with disabilities were disproportionately affected by reduced school days or weeks long before Covid-19.  We have raised this with the committee before and we were assured in early 2019 that there would be monitoring of the use of reduced timetables and consultation on the issue.<\/p> <p>  To summarise, we call on the Government to amend and implement EPSEN without delay; to provide adequate resources and training for teachers so they can provide individualised education planning; and to provide additional resources in order that any needs which are identified in the planning process can be met.  We would also like confirmation that the extended school year programme will be available to all students who have Down's syndrome.  We would like to end the practice of shared SNAs for children in different classrooms.  We would like reassurance that the Department is monitoring use of reduced timetables in schools over and above the pandemic-related closures.  We would like the Department to work with organisations and schools to develop parameters to ensure that reduced timetables are used for the shortest possible time and only for very explicit reasons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042000002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Nicola Hart"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":471,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Hart.

When the EPSEN Act was passed in 2004 as a central pillar of the national disability strategy it was seen as groundbreaking in putting inclusive education on a statutory footing and providing for children to have their education needs assessed and met.  The EPSEN Act promises not only educational equality but also a legal obligation to deliver that education in mainstream settings, where possible.  Seventeen years after the Act was passed, the main pieces of the Act that benefit disabled children have yet to be commenced.  The sections of the EPSEN Act not commenced include the parts that would give children a right an educational assessment of their needs; the development of an IEP based upon this assessment; the delivery of the education supports detailed in the plan; and an independent appeal process.  In short, this means that a child with a special educational need does not have a legal right to an assessment of that need or to have such an identified need addressed through an IEP.  Parents have no legal right to have an input into the IEP.  Because the Act has not been implemented, children's rights are at the whim of policymakers, changes in Government, funding priorities and other factors.<\/p><p>Recent Governments have only committed to implementing EPSEN on a \"non-statutory footing\".  Of all changes to education supports in recent years, there has been no move to give children a right to assessments and IEPs under the Act.<\/p><p> Section 2 of the EPSEN Act places inclusive education on a statutory footing but allows for exceptions to an inclusive education provision.  We also need to be mindful of the rights of children under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, which has been ratified by Ireland since section 2 was commenced.  The UNCRPD calls for inclusive education to be provided for without exception, putting section 2 at odds with the convention.<\/p><p> For Ireland to move towards a fully inclusive education system where children can attend their local school with the appropriate supports, the Government needs a longer term plan that considers the following.  There must be a review and commencement of the EPSEN Act; the Government should put forward a multi-annual, fully costed plan for moving towards an inclusive education model of education; and the Government should invest in teaching and special needs assistant resources, with class sizes needing to get below 20 pupils at a minimum.  We must ensure initial teacher training has a more robust inclusive education component and that all current teachers without continuous professional development in special education are freed to complete mandatory training on this subject.  Schools must be supported by fully resourced mental health and disability teams and they should be fully accessible physically, include sensory spaces and be designed with sensory processing in mind.  We must engage all stakeholders in the process of developing an inclusive model to include families, educators, therapists and pupils, etc.  A campaign should also be launched to address many of the negative attitudes that exist around disability in Ireland, as a sizeable minority of the population does not see mainstream schools as the place for disabled children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042000002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Margaret Turley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I will try to shorten my statement.  I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it.  As members of the committee are aware, the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s office is an independent statutory body, established under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002, as amended.  The rights and welfare of children with disabilities have been a strategic priority for my office since 2016 and we are committed to continue pursuing the progressive realisation of the rights of children with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  In October last year, we published a report called Unmet Needs, which sets out the challenges experienced by children who may have a disability and require an assessment of needs, AON.  The report proposes actions that we believe should be taken to address these challenges in a child-centred, rights-based manner.  Our Unmet Needs report raises serious concerns about ongoing violations of the rights of children with disabilities due to significant delays for children in accessing an assessment of need, despite the HSE&rsquo;s legal obligation to commence this within three months of receipt of a child&rsquo;s application.<\/p> <p>  As members of the committee know, in September 2004, when the Government launched the national disability strategy, it was envisaged this would lead to an equitable reconfiguration of disability services.  The Disability Act 2005 and its counterpart, the Education for Persons with Special Education Needs Act 2004, were key elements of that strategy.  The 2005 Act provides for an AON in order to determine the health services required by a person with a disability.  The EPSEN Act provides for an assessment of special educational needs so that a child with such needs may be educated in an inclusive environment.  While the 2005 Act has been commenced in full, sections 3 to 13 of the EPSEN Act have not been commenced, and that is why we are here today.  In the absence of a procedure under the EPSEN Act, students who require such an assessment have been applying for an AON under the 2005 Act.  This has placed further pressure on the 2005 Act mechanism, which is run by the HSE.<\/p> <p>  Furthermore, in our view, provisions in the 2005 Act concerning children are insufficiently rights-based or child-centred.  Accordingly, we made a key recommendation in the Unmet Needs report that \"an independent expert group should be established to review the 2005 Act, having regard to the EPSEN Act, and related legislation which impacts the provision and delivery of AONs and special educational needs assessments.\"  We recently wrote to both the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, and the Minister of State, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, asking them to initiate a review of the Disability Act while having regard to the EPSEN Act.  Therefore, I noted with interest the meeting of this committee last week, at which it was reported that the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Josepha Madigan, had indicated a desire to review the EPSEN Act and the Department of Education committed to doing that.  This suggests that there could be an alignment that could at last create a better and more co-ordinated legal framework to support our children with disability from the cradle to the end of their education journey.<\/p> <p>  Earlier this month, my office published research called Mind the Gap, which we commissioned from NUI Galway to examine what obstacles in laws, policies and programmes the State places in front of children with disabilities.  This research broadened and deepened our understanding of the barriers that children with disabilities in Ireland face when it comes to enjoying their rights.  Unfortunately, the overarching conclusions reached are stark.  Children with disabilities are not seen and they are overlooked in many child and disability-focused laws, policies and programmes.  Those same children are not heard and they are not actively or effectively involved in consultations on many existing laws, policies and programmes affecting them.  Children with disabilities are not counted because they are relatively invisible in data.  If the State is to fulfil its duty to realise the rights of children with disabilities, it must see, hear and know these children.<\/p> <p>  Having set out the huge disadvantages and barriers that hamper the life of every child with disabilities, it is important to acknowledge that the impact of Covid-19 has been seriously and disproportionately negative for this group as well.  We are here today to discuss the EPSEN Act and special needs education but it is vital to also be aware of many other issues that are live for children with disabilities and their families.  With education, these issues include school places and planning for same, reduced timetables, suspensions and expulsions, expansion of the summer programme and school nurses in special schools.  I thank the committee for its invitation and its time.  I am happy to answer questions with the assistance of my colleague, Dr. Karen McAuley.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042000002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":475,"content":"<p>Dr. Muldoon correctly mentioned a number of matters we will get to but in today's meeting we will just deal with the EPSEN Act.

We are fortunate as we got some additional accommodation recently and now have two more classrooms for children in the area for September.<\/p> <p>  The voice of the advocate is crucial and in that regard I welcome Ms Turley.  It is a challenge to speak to a large group but it is really important for us to hear voices like hers and listen to them.  She mentioned several matters on behalf of Inclusion Ireland.  I am conscious there has been a period since enactment of the EPSEN Act and a number of matters remain outstanding.  This year, we have welcomed the fact that more than &euro;2 billion, or over 20% of the education budget, has been allocated to special educational needs.  I know it probably has to make up for the shortfalls in previous times but we are looking for advances to be made quickly.

Are there any points the witnesses wish to make on that?  Mr. Adam Harris spoke to us last week at a meeting of the mental health sub-committee and it was really powerful.

What recent developments relating to autism should be included in it as an amendment?<\/p><p> I thank Dr. Muldoon for his contribution.  He mentioned a number of different items, including unmet needs and in particular how there is a waiting period for assessments of need because it has not been developed and we do not have a statutory basis for a number of other areas.

This is something that has been expressed by teaching bodies and teachers.  They feel ill-equipped.  For example, with the establishment of so many special classes over the past several years, quite often, rather than being the teacher with the most experience, it is the teacher with the least experience who goes into the special class.  I understand the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, gave directions through the Department of Health that this is not a practice that should happen but in terms of teachers being released for training and substitution cover, there is a significant issue with the take-up of inclusive training modules outside core teacher training.  Were we to look at a genuinely inclusive education system, teacher training, from the point of view of a newly qualified teacher coming out of school, should be well-equipped to differentiate the curriculum regardless of the level of disability.  Until we get to that point, we will still end up with a segregated or integrated education system where children will not have the option of going to their local schools because of the barriers set out in section 2 of the EPSEN legislation.  If it is not in the best interests of the child or other children, that child might be denied a school place in his or her mainstream school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Lorraine Dempsey"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":480,"content":"<p>That point is well made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042000002#D00400","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":481,"content":"<p>There are a number of areas where we think the Act could be enhanced.  Perhaps at a very high level, there are a couple of key examples.  I echo the point made by Ms Dempsey about the need to make sure that there is nothing in the Act preventing somebody from accessing his or her school if he or she wants to.  That said, we still recognise the need for a range of options and that our system is not at a place yet where all children are able to attend their local school but we believe that option should rest with families.<\/p> <p>  One thing that is missing from the Act is the voice of the child.  While there is a lot of emphasis on the voice of the parent and family, it is now more critical than ever that we really listen to the lived experience and place that at the centre of individual education plan, IEP, planning and planning for future education.  <\/p> <p>  One of the learnings from the Disability Act is that a lot of language within the EPSEN Act does not really commit to concrete timelines or supports.  We need to tighten that up so it is very clear when things should happen and that we are taking a rights-based approach.  <\/p> <p>  It is important that we recognise that this is a highly diagnostic and medical model-driven item of legislation and that not every child with additional needs fits into clear diagnostic criteria.  There are children within the autism community who must go private because of the huge waiting list to access assessment.  This means that families who cannot afford to go private can lose out, so there is a need to balance diagnosis and need to make sure it is as equitable as possible.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042000002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adam Harris"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":482,"content":"<p>Regarding assessment of need, we do not have specific numbers but the key issue for me is the fact that the HSE reckons that it can only do 9% of assessments of need within the legal statutorily obliged timeline.

The point I was making is that people are trying, through assessments of need, to access services they should get through the EPSEN Act if it was up and running.  Parents go there because they have nowhere else to go.  That is the problem.  We have not created the system the way it should be created.

People have very different understandings of what the term \"IEP\" means.  An individual education plan is an evidence-based approach to supporting people within school.  As the EPSEN Act describes a particular approach to IEPs, it is correct that this approach is not required because it has not been commenced.  However, this is not to say that there is no need to provide an appropriate plan.  The Teaching Council of Ireland's professional code of conduct makes it very clear that there is a requirement to differentiate and accommodate all students and the courts have ruled that every child has a right to an appropriate adequate education and that requires differentiation.<\/p> <p>  That said, it is critical that teachers are given the support they need to understand and better meet the needs of students because we know the vast majority of teachers really want to do that and already do a good job.  Critically, what this Act should do when commenced is make sure parents have a right to be involved in how that planning takes place and there is transparency around that planning.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042000002#D01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adam Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":487,"content":"<p>We had a good news story last week in Cork relating to the foundation of a new special school in Carrigaline.

Listening to Senator Dolan, however, it is clear that there are similar issues in other parts of the country.  Any public representative will tell you that the vast majority of parents who come to him or her regarding special education provision feel exhausted.

This is in no way meant to be critical of special education needs organisers, SENOs, and the NCSE but it leads me to question their roles.  Do they have enough power to do the job they need to do?

In the past year we had two section 37 orders from the Minister.  That should not happen.  These issues should be capable of being sorted out locally, through the preparation of reports and engaging with school patrons and principals.  That should be sufficient, if the statutory backing for SENOs was available to them.

We are relying on schools to make decisions to cater for the needs of a certain population that might be in their vicinity.  I will put my teacher hat on and suggest that if there is demand in a certain area, then a school should be mandated to address it and cater for it.  There are areas in my own county, including in and around Cork city, where there are population centres of around 20,000 people but no autism spectrum disorder, ASD, unit at second level, for example.  If we are relying on schools to make local decisions, then the potential exists for deficits in provision in certain areas.  Much will depend on how proactive schools are in particular areas.  Is there a greater role for the Department in terms of mandating schools?  I am aware of the powers available to the Minister, albeit they are used infrequently.

That involves looking at our whole education system and the inability to meet the needs of children with more complex educational needs.  This is where the demand is created, with parents looking for alternative, more specialised school places for their children.  We have a pre-existing flaw that has been driving this, year on year.  Rather than underpinning the development of an inclusive education, we are moving in the opposite direction.  In terms of our obligations under article 24 of the UN Convention and particularly <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>other European countries which have similar but more segregated education systems, the UN committee is very clear that we should avoid promoting segregated education.  This means that we must adequately resource mainstream education so that it can be transformed in such a way as to meet the needs of the majority of children, including those with more complex needs.  We are creating a demand, year on year, for children to go into special preschool classes and special ASD classes, although special classes are not exclusive to children on the autistic spectrum.  We are driving the demand here by not addressing the fundamental deficits within mainstream schools.  That is the starting point for this conversation, notwithstanding the fact that we really need a ten- or 15-year Government strategy, regardless of which political parties are in power, to implement the resource and systems changes that are required to stop that demand from growing further.<br\/><br\/>We also need a review of special classes and special schools in the context of outcomes.  We are looking at inputs and how many special classes we can get open because the demand is there but we are not really looking at the outcome of the development of such classes in the context of children's ongoing educational future.  Where do they end up when they go down this road?  Do they end up in employment or in day-service provision?  What are the outcomes and are they quality outcomes directed towards the needs of the child?

There are several issues we must consider if we want to create an inclusive system.  There seems to be an element of class involved in this issue.  It seems that in certain areas of the country, in Dublin and Cork in particular, people are travelling long distances out of their local communities to attend autism classes because there are no classes in their areas.  That is very worrying.  The other point I would make is that when we set up special classes, the idea was that people would get a lot of support and would, over time, integrate into mainstream.  Over 90% of the young people on the autism spectrum starting in a special class are remaining there because families do not have confidence that they will get the support they need in mainstream and that is where there is a huge amount of work to be done around capacity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042000002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adam Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":493,"content":"<p>Gabha&iacute;m bu&iacute;ochas leis na ha&iacute;onna go l&eacute;ir as a gcuid r&aacute;iteas agus as an bhfianaise at&aacute; tugtha d&uacute;inn acu.<\/p> <p>  The AsIAm written submission to the committee refers to the fact that trust between parents and children with special educational needs and the Department has been very severely damaged by the revelations on \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" of an adversarial approach and the fact that there is a daily battle for rights and entitlements, school places and so forth.  The point is made in the submission that there is an opportunity, with the review of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, not just to change the debate but to change the culture.  We need to see the Department and the bodies under its aegis move from an attitude of being gatekeepers to being collaborators with the families represented by the organisations here today.  <\/p> <p>  I will pose a number of questions now.  Unfortunately, I will not be able to stay until the end of the meeting so I will not be able to come in again.  My first question is directed to Dr. Muldoon, but if others also wish to respond, they are welcome to do so.  It occurs to me that there is no way this issue is going to be solved by education alone.  We can invest as much as we want in special education teachers, SNAs, special units and so on, which will make a significant difference but if we do not invest in clinicians and in ensuring that there are enough educational psychologists, speech and language therapists and so on, to ensure that children are getting supports in a timely fashion and with the frequency needed, this will all fall down.  I ask Dr. Muldoon to comment on that.<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Mr. Harris.  There has been a lot of discussion recently about the so-called New Brunswick or full integration model.  It seems to me that balance and discretion are crucial here.  People will have differing opinions on this and we must continue to explore the issues involved.  It is my view that at this point in time we still need to have special schools for those parents who want them.  Some parents will not want that option for their children but a lot will and we must continue to proactively plan for that demand.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan asked an important question of Dr. Muldoon earlier and I ask the representatives of Inclusion Ireland to respond on whether we are getting the most out of our SENOs and the NCSE.  How can we ensure that under a new or revised Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act they play the most constructive role possible?<\/p> <p>  Finally, to the representatives of Down Syndrome Ireland, there has been a lot of discussion, rightly, about expanding the summer programme to all of those with Down's syndrome.  That is essential and a lot must be done in that regard.<\/p><p>We need to be looking at September and the next school year to ensure there are adequate supports on an ongoing basis.  We are not going to make up all that lost ground by the start of the new school year.  Accordingly, we need to invest on a longer term basis as well.<\/p><p> I thank everyone for attending and responding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042000002#E00700","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":495,"content":"<p>There is no doubt that we have always believed children's rights needs to be a cross-governmental enterprise.

Are we going to have this row in perpetuity unless we radically overhaul what the education system does and what it is there for?  The child is not at the centre of the education system.

One of the problems we see in our day-to-day work, although the Ombudsman might be better placed to comment on this than anyone else, is that there seems to be a total deficit of responsibility built into our education system where the Department blames another group or another group blames the Department.  The only stakeholder who does not seem to have a central voice or a relevance is the child.<\/p> <p>  One of the things that really worries me, and we see it every day in our work, is that often children must experience egregious breaches of their rights within the education system before they can be reconciled.  Sometimes an issue arises and it is brought to the attention of the Department but it will not touch it.  As a result, people are left for more than a year on their educational journey with a clear breach of their rights because of the current system, which does not favour the child.<\/p> <p>  We very much need reform but legislation only ever gets so far.  The big word I would use here is &ldquo;confidence&rdquo;.  We will not be able to create an inclusive system until parents and families have confidence in it.  That has been blocked by two issues.  First, there was a promise around the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 which was not delivered on.  Second, most recently during the Covid-19 pandemic, families were sent a clear message that if they chose to send their children to mainstream school, their rights would not be guaranteed in the same way those rights would be guaranteed for those in special schools and classes when it came to reopening.

This allows about four different steps for disassociation of responsibility.  That is wrong.  Again, that is where we need to go.<\/p><p> I do not think we need to look at a constitutional referendum.  There is a constitutional right under Article 42.4, which allows the right to education for our children.  We need to just follow through on that in a child-centred manner.

It is a busy enough day.  I thank all the witnesses for their presentations.  As somebody who comes from an educational background and has taught special needs children, I completely understand what is going on here.  It is unacceptable that parents have to fight tooth and nail.  I have also seen cases where teachers have to fight tooth and nail for IT equipment and basic things children need to support their learning, as well as trying to get them assessed and get access to therapies.  I have first-hand experience in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The lack of responsibility and so forth in the system has been referenced and, certainly, that is a major issue.  How do we overcome the lack of accountability?  We need to have the same robust approach I see in other areas, such as climate action, where there are targets in place and consequences for missing them.  We are dealing with children who need to be given every chance to reach their full potential as is laid out in the Education Act 1998.  At this point, there needs to be more robust measures and more robust accountability in place because we have fantastic initiatives.<\/p> <p>  I wholeheartedly welcome many of the initiatives in the EPSEN Act to create a more inclusive society and a more inclusive education system for all children of different abilities.  I do not use the word \"disability\", rather, I use the term \"different ability\".  We need to wake up to the sense that something needs to be done fast.  This has dragged on and on.  It often struck me, as a teacher with a master's in special education, which I loved doing, that it makes no sense that IEPs were never made mandatory.  It was considered good practice, whereas the classroom planning is mandatory.  Every teacher, when qualified, has to draw up his or her fortnightly and monthly plans, policy objectives and what not, at a whole-school level.  Questions need to be asked here.  Why is it not on the same level?  We are talking about inclusiveness and equality but, certainly, there are serious gaps in our education system that need to be addressed.  I ask the witnesses to indicate how we can make things more accountable in our education system?  How we can place more of an onus on Government to deliver on these targets and great initiatives?<\/p> <p>  I am sure the officials will agree it is imperative that there is early intervention when a child is diagnosed with autism.  There are reports of considerable delays in the provision of support services to children diagnosed with autism by NEPS.  Indeed, it is very much a postcode lottery.  The standard and quality of service depends on where one lives, which is completely unacceptable.  Can NEPS specify the waiting time from when a child gets a diagnosis of autism to the provision of therapeutic services, outside of those provided in school?  Can it provide information on that?  Is there a specified target date for providing these services after diagnosis?  Is it the case that while some measures have been consolidated into law, the actual implementation is just not there?  Certainly, that is what we see. I would like to hear the witnesses' thoughts on that.<\/p> <p>  I want to acknowledge that I met Gavin from AsIAm.  We had a good meeting and discussed many of the issues.  I am more than willing to support the witnesses in the context of many of the concerns they have had for far too long.  There needs to be more collaboration among all stakeholders.  There needs to be co-ordination, certainly among therapists and schools.  We should have on-site therapists in our schools and more collaboration.  That is just not there.  The access to therapies is very much a postcode lottery.  I dealt with a newly married couple who felt that if they moved to a certain county, their child would get better service.  That is not acceptable.

Many of my colleagues on the committee were party to discussions around the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill and the student and parent charter, and the impact they would have on ministerial accountability for allocation of school places for individual children.  Somebody asked about the SENOs earlier.  We need people with teeth who can advocate for our children and not wholly act as gatekeepers.  That is the way parents currently see them.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Nolan's point in respect of the postcode lottery, there are national programmes to develop children's disability network teams where access to services is delivered regardless of the school setting or where the child is living.  One can move from any school setting or any county and the model of service delivery and access to those services should be the same, albeit with challenges around resources.  That will get rid of the postcode lottery we have currently.<\/p> <p>  In the context of children having an assessment that leads to a diagnosis - the Deputy referred to children on the autism spectrum - they do not have a statutory right to intervention.  It stops at the assessment.  The statement a child gets will state when and where those interventions should be delivered.  However, we have seen reports which state that these interventions will be delivered in 56 months because while there is a statutory requirement to put the actual date on the statement, there is no requirement to deliver.  Again, people must have a statutory right to the delivery of interventions that will actually lead to positive outcomes for children, because it is not about whether somebody gets a block of six speech and language therapy sessions, it is about the outcome we are seeking to achieve.  That is what we all need to move towards because we are very focused on inputs but not what it means for the child in long-term outcomes.<\/p> <p>  In terms of accountability, I go back to Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and how he set out the relationship between the Minister, the Government, schools and boards of management which puts children as piggy in the middle.  I have stated before that we can complain to our local schools, go through complaints processes and we hit an impasse when it gets to board level.  The SENOs do not have teeth to take any action, the schools say there are not adequate resources, the SENOs say there are and the child ends up outside of school.  We continue this, year after year.

I have been listening in and have read all the statements.  I thank everyone very much for that.  I have also attended the Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community and education and educational attainment is right up there.  This is not just an equality issue.  It is about equity and the fact that some people need more in order to achieve what they can for society.<\/p><p>They include all of the people the witnesses represent.<\/p><p> I previously tabled a Commencement matter for AsIAm and I have met many of the staff in the organisation, specifically on the issue of individual educational plans.  It is of huge concern to me that 17 years after it was passed, many of the elements of the EPSEN Act 2004 have not been commenced.  In the US and UK, these processes are statutory.  We can say that most schools do them but as a lawyer, I know that is not really the point.  The point is that one must have confidence in the system.<\/p><p> On Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's point, nothing in the Constitution lays down the patronage system.  It is more a matter of how we as a society organise our educational system.  Many will know that I am most passionate about having a citizens' assembly.  The point about surveys is one issue.  I take on board that when a survey is completed, it can be disheartening to see people's reaction.  However, it is about moving the conversation and the dial around how people engage and think about those with disabilities.  It is key that we have those conversations to move that dial.  What are the witnesses' views on that?<\/p><p> The establishment of a citizens' assembly on education is part of the programme for Government.  I believe all of the organisations represented could and should feed into that and try to progress and promote it sooner rather than later.  That said, there is a lot of low-hanging fruit, for want of a better term, that can and must be progressed anyway.  People have human rights, regardless of whether we have these conversations.  We do not need to have the conversations to know that people have human rights.<\/p><p> I agree that rather than saying we would like to do certain things, there is no good reason not to take steps to ensure that people who go before the courts are able to point to a law that sets outs their right, assert that it has been commenced and ask the Department to ensure they receive everything to which they are entitled under that law.  I am a former chair of Home Education Network Ireland.  I sometimes make the important point that half of those who were home educated chose to do so, while the other half were home educated because they were let down by the education system.  There are higher levels of those with disabilities in the home education network than in the general population.  That says that we are letting people down.<\/p><p> I think we would all agree with the witnesses' opening statements.  It is hard to ask questions that have already been answered.  However, I would like to hear their thoughts on the issue of a citizens' assembly.  I also note that the establishment of such an assembly does not mean we should not deliver on the other obligations outlined by the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042000002#G00700","speaker":"1693","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":513,"content":"<p>I totally agree with the Senator.

If we look across the Irish Sea to our neighbours, we see that they have a much more robust statutory legal framework for children with special educational needs.  However, while there is a framework in place in the UK, where funding is inadequate, it leads parents to tribunals.  We do not have a statutory appeal system under the EPSEN Act 2004.  That is one of the elements that was not implemented.  However, if we bring in an appeals system under a statutory framework, we do not want to end up shepherding families down that road because we simply have not provided for their children in an adequate way.  That is the case in the UK, particularly during the Covid pandemic.  The funding mechanisms in the UK are through local authorities which have care and education plans.  It is an integrated plan rather than a singular education plan.  Where the local authorities have made funding cuts, it has often impacted on children with special educational needs there.  We do not need to set up a system that becomes adversarial.  There are children going to the High Court and their parents are taking cases.  We need a system that does not push people through that route because of the lack of resources.<br\/><br\/>I agree with Ms Hart on why the attitudes of the public are so poor.  I hear parents screaming for supports for their children every other day and detailing their bad experiences.  <br\/><br\/>I apologise on behalf of Ms Turley, who has gone back to work, but I wish to speak on her behalf about something she expressed about her lived experience.  Ms Turley started in mainstream school and her mother lost confidence in the ability of the school to provide for her needs.  Her parent made the decision that she needed to go to a special school.  At that young age, it was not Ms Turley's choice or preference.  She did not want to be hidden.  The following are her own words: <\/p> <blockquote> \tI did not want to be hidden or different.  I wanted to interact with others.  I wanted to be with people who were going to bring me on. <\/blockquote> <p>That has had a long-standing effect on Ms Turley, who ultimately ended up on the Trinity access programme and is in part-time employment.  However, her journey through was like that because the right supports were not developed for her school to deliver for her, and her parent the difficult decision to move her.  It was not necessarily in the best interests of the child, society or the children in her class.<br\/><br\/>Ms Dempsey mentioned that inclusion starts with education and inclusive communities.  If children are not educated alongside other children with disabilities, they do not get to see them.  When children with disabilities grow up into adults with disabilities, sometimes those adults are further segregated and are in services based outside of towns.  They are not seen, heard or part of the community.  If we are going to pay this forward so that we can improve employment prospects for people with disabilities, it starts here.  It starts before they ever get to primary school.  In fact, it starts at preschool. That will shift our attitudes further in ten or 15 years' time because they will be the people we grew up with next door who continued their educational pathway alongside us, into employment and so forth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042000002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Lorraine Dempsey"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":516,"content":"<p>I thank all the contributors.  I am a long-time admirer of all of the work done by AsIAm, Down Syndrome Ireland, Inclusion Ireland and the Ombudsman for Children's office.  I have a particular interest in autism.<\/p> <p>  A child who was born when the EPSEN Act came into force will be 17 years of age now.  My God, that is an absolute disgrace.  That really speaks for itself and to the fact that we have an enormous problem.  Will we be dealing with the same situation 17 years from today?  That is what we face as a committee.<\/p> <p>  It is very clear that there is an enormous implementation deficit.  I understood Mr. Harris when he spoke of the need for us to conduct a legislative review and implement a human rights roadmap.<\/p> <p>  Ms Dempsey mentioned education.  Inclusion starts with the education and in<\/p><p>That the legislation must go hand in hand with the cultural change was mentioned also.  That is not a major request and it should not be something that should be added on to this.<\/p><p> I have a number of questions.  First, I ask all the representatives why they think the EPSEN Act has not been implemented and why did it take 12 years for an autistic person to be on the National Council for Special Education?  We must examine the why in all of these things to see where the blocks and the barriers are.  I also wish to ask about the interface between Departments because that is where the biggest issues I have come across are.  Who, therefore, is accountable and who has overall responsibility?  Who is going to ensure the Departments and the different areas of responsibility come together to put the child and the family at the centre of what is being done?  Obviously we all welcome that &euro;2 billion has been allocated.  There are 1,423 new staff for educational needs this year.  My fear is that Government after Government is almost throwing money at this.  How are we measuring the outcomes there?  How are we ensuring the money goes to the right place?  In the case of a lot of these issues, there is a whole industry set up around them without ever involving the people directly affected.  While I believe there is talk of &euro;5 million being spent in recent years on legal cases, that is the tiniest tip of the iceberg.  Most families cannot do that because first of all, they are in fear, and we must remember that.  Many families and people who are directly impacted are in fear of losing what they already have and most families cannot afford to take on the might of the State financially as well.<\/p><p> I have a specific question for Dr. Muldoon.  I refer to families or individuals who want to find out information held on them by various Departments, whether there is a legal case or not.  Does, say, an autistic person have a right to get his or her file without it being redacted?  I have several other questions but I want to hear from the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042000002#H00900","speaker":"1501","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":518,"content":"<p>Will Dr. Muldoon come in on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042000002#J00200","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":519,"content":"<p>On the Deputy's question about the files, I would not be 100% sure about it.  It would be a matter for the Data Protection Commission.  Again, if one is putting the child at the centre of one's thinking, then one would expect he or she should be able to get an unredacted file on himself or herself without it interfering with the rights of other people.  That is where the caveat comes in and redaction happens.  Certainly, what we have seen so far from looking at \"Prime Time\" - and the Deputy mentioned the culture - is that if we are going to create confidence and security for the families, then the culture we have seen so far and which was highlighted by the whistleblower was far from what we want with regard to collaboration and co-operation.<\/p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's other question about the interface between Departments and overall responsibility, we had a great success with an investigation we did with Jack, a little boy with severe disabilities who had a brain injury and was kept in hospital for two and a half years instead of being brought back to his own home.  Tusla and the HSE argued over it.  We now have a situation where they have found a way to work together and to share the funding for children like Jack.  They have done the same in the case of another child, Molly, where they are sharing a budget.  That is the first time I have seen it happen that there is a legislative underpinning within the budget and the Votes to allow a certain cohort of children, who are being cared for by two different Departments, to be funded by the two Departments together and that they have got a process in place for that.  Making that happen was driven by the CEOs of both the HSE and Tusla and the Departments which fixed it.  We need to get to a situation where the Department of Health can share some of its money with the Department of Education.  Again, this is forward planning.  In the case of children with severe and profound disabilities in particular, you know who they are from the day they are born, unless it is a brain injury, and again in that case, you can predict very quickly what they are going to need in the future.<\/p> <p>  We had a meeting last week with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  It was talking about legislating for mandatory collaboration and co-operation across Departments.  It is terrible that we have to do that but if that is the way forward, let us do that.  Let us mandate that Departments must co-operate and collaborate on behalf of the children.  Again, the child then becomes the centre of decision-making and it takes away those barriers so we can share information, share budgets and predict what is needed.  That way, nobody needs to fight over what is required because going back to what Mr. Harris said at the start about constant battles with families, we do not need to have them if we predict, as much as we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042000002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Niall Muldoon"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I am aware the Deputy had other questions but we are out of time now.

At the outset, it must be said that when the Oireachtas enacts legislation, there is an expectation that such legislation will be commenced relatively soon after its enactment.  It is unusual and, to be frank, embarrassing that nearly 50% of the sections of the EPSEN Act, which were enacted 14 years ago have not yet been commenced.  In light of the fact that our witnesses are aware that a review of the EPSEN Act is to take place, do they want the outstanding sections within the Act to be commenced or do they want the review to take place?

There has been a considerable amount of policy development around the area and policy recommendations from the NCSE that are themselves sitting on shelves and have not been taken up by the Department of Education under each successive Minister.  I therefore think we need a wholesale review of where we have come to over the last 17 years in terms of policy and implementation and then look back to see where are the divisions between the enacted parts of the legislation around the IEP, because a lot has changed since then.  Our education system has changed since then, as have the structures of the HSE.  Therefore a review would be the starting point rather than enacting something which may, 17 years later, be flawed in itself.<\/p> <p>  Notwithstanding that the Deputy mentioned that it was unusual for legislation to not be enacted, I was before the Joint Committee on Disability Matters this morning and can tell him that it is not unusual at all.  There is the Disability Act 2005 and there is the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, which is not fully implemented and hopefully next year we will have the decision support service.  Several items of legislation that directly impact people with disabilities, both children and adults, are not fully enacted.  Our Government and our Oireachtas, our legislators, have form on this unfortunately and the EPSEN Act is not an isolated scenario at all.  For people with disabilities, it feels indicative of our status in society that we do not have that legislation to support us and our children.  It is not unusual.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Muldoon referred to the Disability Act.  You must look at the EPSEN Act and Disability Act in parallel and what both were setting out to achieve with the different types of assessment and outcomes.  Thus, it should be review first.<\/p> <p>  The question as to why the EPSEN Act has not been implemented was mentioned.  I think it was a previous Minister for Education who indicated, around 2012 or 2013, that it would cost three quarters of a billion euro to fully implement the Act.  Over those years, Inclusion Ireland has asked for a breakdown of costs of bringing in IEPs, the required training around them and the costs associated with delivering them, in order to let us see what it would look like in segments and for the Government to look at the full implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042000002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Lorraine Dempsey"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":523,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042000002#J00700","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":524,"content":"<p>We ourselves would be asking how much this would cost in its current form.

Even during the recent 37A process that looked at south Dublin, it was noted in the responses of some schools that they had to expand because the population grew.  In other words, it was a recognition that sometimes they had to expand beyond their means to meet the needs of the children in the locality.  I do not think they are exempt from that obligation if some children happen to be autistic.  There are concrete things we can do.  One is that a process such as the 37A process needs to take place much earlier in the year in order that people have time to plan.  There needs to be much better co-ordination between the building section of the Department and the sanctioning of an autism class in order that the school can get the supports and set it up to succeed.  Involve Autism in the Deputy's locality is doing great work on this.  There are not more autistic people in one part of Dublin versus another.  There is a very clear correlation.  This comes back to the question Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in asked, that is, why we do have an education system?

At last week's meeting of the committee a representative of the Department's building unit spoke about having a very fluid situation to identify these places.  I find that incomprehensible.

There should be no doubt over that.  Again, the only question should be how a school gets the resources to provide it, not whether it will provide it.  It should make sure the resources come on stream.  For example, if five places are needed next year, the school needs to provide those places.  Ultimately, a school will know it needs those five places three years in advance and the funding for them will be put in place.  There should be no equivocation about that.

I used that term for want of a better expression, but his term is superior.<\/p> <p>My experience of some of the schools in my constituency, and I am sure this is echoed by my colleagues who are members of all parties and none, is that some schools, teachers and co-ordinators go above and beyond and they are an extraordinary credit to their professions.  However, given what has been said today, at previous committees in discussions with the advocacy groups represented today and others, it is clear that implementation and the point Ms Lorraine Dempsey made in response to the question as to how much this would cost in terms of the implementation of individual education plans needs to be answered promptly.  If we consider the 2006 or 2008 projected cost of fully implementing the Education for Persons with Special Education Needs Act at that time was &euro;230 million a year and the figures now emanating from the Department of Education of &euro;2 billion, or more than 40% of the budget, invested per annum in special education, with the best will in the world it is simply not enough.  All the other questions I was going to ask have already been asked.  <\/p> <p>  I said I would make a remark to which I would invite a response from the remaining witnesses or, indeed, from Dr. Muldoon.  It is related to the question of patronage.  With the deficit of responsibility to which Mr. Harris referred and the adversarial system that exists with parents having to fight for the rights of or for services for their children, do the witnesses as a group believe the Department of Education is either equipped or forthright enough to foresee the requirements in any given school community in terms of the provision of supports for children with additional educational needs and the overarching desire and requirement, which I believe is shared by the witnesses, that an integrated education is provided to as many pupils as is possible throughout their education?  I note Ms Lorraine Dempsey is indicating she would like to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042000002#K01200","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":540,"content":"<p>With the permission of the Chair, I will respond.  We would not have confidence that is possible right now.  If we consider some of the systems the Department of Education has brought in to try to meet the needs of children with special educational needs in mainstream settings, that is, the special educational teacher allocation model and the upcoming special needs assistant, SNA, allocation model which will be based on the same data the Department will be collating on schools, there are already issues with the special educational teaching allocation model.  Both Mr. Adam Harris and myself sat on a working group which designed the school inclusion model and the proposed components of that, of which only one was the SNA allocation model that the Department wants to roll out.  We took that work as a wholesale piece of scaffolding supports around a school.  That was the psychological support, nursing supports which Dr. Muldoon mentioned and providing an accurate level of special education teachers to support children in mainstream settings.<\/p><p>Currently, schools and patron bodies are raising issues, particularly around developing schools that year on year, have additional classes coming in but do not have children leaving.  They are growing schools yet they are now expected to deliver special educational teaching supports, and potentially SNA supports, on the basis of data they submitted a couple of years ago when they did not have the additional pupils in the school.  Without rectifying the current issues around how the Department allocates resources to schools, we are very concerned that it would be able to plan accurately for the needs of children as we move forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042000002#K01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Lorraine Dempsey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Dempsey.

That is important.<\/p> <p>  When we talk about data, we have to recognise at the moment that the approach by the Department and the NCSE often seems to be getting parents to go around with a clipboard and to demonstrate demand, which is bizarre.  It is certainly not the level of sophistication one would expect when we know what the prevalence is, for example, of a variety of disabilities within the community.  There is a need to use the available data in a much better and more comprehensive way.  I would, however, echo what Ms Dempsey said in terms of the data that we are using at the moment.

I have the opportunity to say a few words as Vice Chair.  I will then allow members to come back in.  Deputy Conway-Walsh indicated that she had more questions.  We will, therefore, have a few minutes to come back.<\/p> <p>  I thank all the witnesses.  I found it illuminating and frustrating at the same time, in coming back to this issue that is so fundamentally important to our society and the way we operate, to see the blockages that continue to be an issue.  We absolutely must do our best in terms of ensuring that every young person with an intellectual disability has the opportunity to have an education plan that is suited to them.  It is going to take us a long time to get to that point.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of general questions on the particular topic we are discussing for whosoever of the witnesses wishes to respond to them.  It is good that the Minister stated that one of her priorities is to review and update the EPSEN Act, which as we know is 17 years old.  Do the witnesses have any views on what specific areas of the Act need to be renewed or amended?<\/p> <p>  Second, we heard from Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan earlier that an individual education plan, IEP, was used at his school, which was great.  The fact that the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland, ASTI, and the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, have advised their members not to implement individual education plans, given their lack of statutory footing, is absolutely concerning.  Could the witnesses comment on their views of the importance of the IEPs?  I get a sense they feel it is important but perhaps they feel the lack of statutory footing has had an impact.<\/p> <p>  Parents are having considerable difficulty in finding a suitable school place, particularly at secondary level.  I certainly have found that to be the case for special needs students in County Kildare.  Notwithstanding that extra powers were given to the Minister of the day with regard to schools admission, do witnesses think the Department should have more powers to compel schools?  I tend to agree with an earlier comment that we need to incentivise schools, as opposed to compel them, or perhaps take the fear some schools may have regarding providing education for those with special needs.  Perhaps the witnesses could comment on that.<\/p> <p>  We have spoken about the SENOs, with whom my own experience has been less than satisfactory.  In a case with which I had dealings, the SENO's response was to tell parents they could take a section 29 action and more or less encouraged them to do so.  That set up a whole adversarial session straight away between the school and the parents and it was not helpful.  From what I found, although I have no doubt there are exceptions to the rule, providing a list of schools and telling parents to contact them is not good enough.<\/p> <p>  My final question is regarding our committee.  We will be examining the issue of leaving certificate reform later in the year.  As they are here, do the witnesses have any comments on the specific needs of special needs students, particularly around the whole leaving certificate applied?  I will take answers in the order of whoever puts their hand up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042000002#L00800","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I addressed earlier some of my thoughts around the need for amendments to the EPSEN Act so I will skip over that question.<\/p> <p>  We really need to change the narrative around the whole area of IEPs.  An IEP is fundamentally about taking the adversarial piece out of the conversation and making it a partnership model where everyone sits around one table and asks how they are working in the same direction.<\/p> <p>  Speaking from my own educational experience, the reason it was positive was that my parents were lucky enough to always meet teachers who were willing to co-operate and work as a team.  We need to get that sense of team back.  IEPs in the context of the EPSEN Act are one discussion but it has to be very clear that there is an obligation.  It is established clearly in a whole range of circulars, existing policy and court judgments that an appropriate and adequate education must be provided.  That requires differentiation and demonstration of how it has been done.<\/p> <p>  The whole area of SENOs touches on the fact that we keep talking about how EPSEN and disability interact with each other.  Certainly, the experience our families tend to have is the word they become most used to is \"No\".  The moment you get a diagnosis, everyone tells you what they cannot do for you and why you should not talk to them.  Nobody seems take the role of saying who you should talk to, however, or if you like, holds your hand and actually guides you along the process.<\/p><p>Whether it is enhancing the role of a SENO, changing our approach to the role of a SENO or having a different role that covers all of the agencies, we need families to have a key worker who is on their side and is trying to help them, as opposed to quoting legislation or giving them lists, which really is not very helpful for somebody who does not know the system.<\/p><p> In terms of powers to compel schools, we need to be a lot more defined regarding what constitutes a reasonable excuse in the section 37A process.  Some of the responses I have seen include a school stating it is absolutely essential that children have access to a library so it cannot be given up for a class.  Libraries are nice to have but the right to an education is a constitutional right and some of our children are being deprived of it.  We need to be an awful lot clearer on this.<\/p><p> No school should be able to opt not to deliver the leaving certificate applied.  The biggest problem is we have moved children into our education system but we have not changed our definition of success.  Many of the problems we are speaking about today come from our definition of success and what is a good educational outcome because we have a system which rewards people who get 625 points but which does not celebrate that for another person, working part-time, living independently and being part of the community is as big and as important an achievement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042000002#L00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adam Harris","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I want to come in on the point on the leaving certificate applied about which Mr. Harris spoke.  I agree the leaving certificate needs to be looked at and we need to have a much broader idea of what success in schools looks like for all of our students.  There has been some very good reform providing level 2 and level 1 programmes for the junior cycle but there is no obligation on schools to provide them.  There is still a tendency in many schools to state that if people want special programmes, there is a special school to which they can apply.  We need to have a look at this.  Often our students are excluded from transition year, which could be a very beneficial less academically focused year.  They may not be considered in schools where it is optional.  We need to look at statutory obligations and, as Mr. Harris has said, not accept excuses for not running programmes to broaden the range of options available to students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042000002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Nicola Hart"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":552,"content":"<p>It was alluded to earlier that particular geographical areas do not have more children with autism but we have pockets of areas that are reluctant to open any form of special class.  We also find with the applied leaving certificate that there are pockets of the country where schools perhaps see it as a lesser programme to offer to students and would rater leave it to DEIS schools.  I do not think I need delve any further into what I am alluding to.  For children with intellectual disabilities who might successfully transition from a mainstream primary school to a mainstream post-primary school, there comes a point because they do not have those adapted programmes available to them that the only option is to go to a special school.  Straight off we have set them up for failure in this respect because it was not the plan they set out with.<\/p> <p>  With regard to SENOs, what parents really want are advocates.  We have a national advocacy service that parents contact but it deals only with somebody over the age of 18.  Who do people go to?  They go to non-government funded organisations, they go to voluntary parent support groups and they go to Facebook groups to get information in the hope that somebody will advocate for them when, in effect, the SENOs should have been set up to advocate and guide parents from preschool transition to primary school and not to leave parents with a list.  At this stage, we should be smart enough to have a database of where the vacant places are and not have duplication of waiting lists for special classes.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is examining, on a national level, what is required in the context of parent supports.  We are specifically looking to see what are the additional parent supports needed to be able to guide parents of children with disabilities in the absence of disability supports and key workers and identify who can help them navigate not only through the education system but also through the social protection system and all of the other schemes and assessments about which they need to know and bring them along on the journey rather than just give them a booklet containing information.<\/p> <p>  What we are really looking for under the EPSEN Act is education equality.  Mr. Harris spoke about his personal experience.  I have twins and I have spoken about them previously.  They are 17 and they have very different pathways in education.  They started off together in junior infants in a mainstream school but that is not where they will end up.  It is bitter for families to have to make decisions on the basis of not having the right supports available to them to allow their children to continue in mainstream settings.

She asked a question earlier that I will touch on.  What a lot of this conversation comes down to, and why the EPSEN Act has not been commenced, is that while we are all in favour of inclusion and equality, sometimes what is not accepted in terms of the concept of disability is that it costs money.  If we are serious about it, we have to be willing to invest.  Representation is very important at all levels of the conversation and it has been something of an afterthought to date.  If we were to make the one reform of putting people with disabilities and their families on the key decision-making bodies in this area, we would see pretty rapid reform.  This is something else we need to think about.<\/p> <p>  On exceptional abilities, there is a resource and cultural element.  Leaving certificate reform is part of it because if there were more opportunities to do short courses or gain points by pursuing interests it would create a huge opportunity.  The most autism-friendly school in the world is not inclusive of autistic people because they have scattered skill sets.  People have to be able to work to their strengths as opposed to fitting within a system.  Unfortunately, our system to date has been very much focused on a list of deficits, which aside from not working is catastrophic for people's self-esteem.  We need to create within the education system a strengths-based model that identifies what a person's skills are and helps people to work through areas of education they might find challenging.  To continue this conversation, the Centre for Talented Youth, Ireland does very good work and perhaps it could assist the committee further in this area.  Autistic people are not just amazing at computers or science.  Every autistic person has a skill, an ability and interests, and it is about meeting the person where he or she is at and using these.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042000002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adam Harris"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Harris.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2021042000002#M00600","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":556,"content":"<p>That concludes our discussion.

This is a timely exchange; it is important to do it ahead of the industrial strategy update, which the Commission will present next week.  This will support the triple transition to make our industry more green, digital and resilient.<\/p><p> I will not go into detail now, although I will address one area that clearly illustrates the importance of resilience, which the Chairman mentioned, namely, our vaccine production strategy.  Today we face an historical challenge, that of vaccinating Europe and the world in record time.  We overcame the scientific challenge by developing vaccines.  That was done mainly thanks to European research, as four of the vaccines we are using or will use have been developed in Europe.  The challenge is now an industrial one, namely, to produce them.  No country can do this alone.  Therefore, I am convinced that European solidarity is the only way to avoid vaccine nationalism.  The industrial ramp-up is today a reality.  Since January, Europe's vaccine production capacity has doubled every other month.  By the second quarter, we expect 410 million doses to be delivered to member states.  This included the 50 million additional doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which we agreed to front-load from quarter 4 to quarter 2.  For Ireland, for example, this means an additional 400,000 doses that were not planned.  Ireland will receive between 4.5 million and 5 million doses in quarter 2.  This is of course a tremendous jump over what it was in the first quarter; indeed it is three times more.  This is also, by the way, the case for all of the EU.  In addition, our factories are producing for the world.  We are the only continent to do this.  We can be proud of that but it is in our interest.  We are of course producing for the UK; 70% of its vaccines are coming from Europe.  Men and women are working day and night, seven days a week, to produce enough vaccines for the British, for our partners, but also for Covax.  The reason for this is clear: it is, as I said, in our collective interest to avoid the development of variants elsewhere.  This task is today on the shoulders of the EU.  However, we are doing this without any naivete thanks to our export transparency scheme.  This also helps me to better monitor our production.<\/p><p> The challenge now for member states is to scale up vaccination campaigns and to fight vaccine hesitancy.  To conclude on this point, I am confident that by mid-July we will have produced enough doses to fully vaccinate 70% of the adult population, which is something extremely important.  By the end of the year we will have an annual production capacity of more than 3 billion doses.  Again, this is extremely important and we will need these to be prepared for the variants and new evolutions of the pandemic, if necessary.  The work does not stop here.  From this perspective, we need to prepare ourselves.  This is why we have put in place the so-called &ldquo;Hera Incubator&rdquo;.  The Commission is negotiating with Pfizer-BioNTech for 1.8 billion supplementary doses until 2023 as these may be needed for variants.  Negotiations with other manufacturers may come on top of that.<\/p><p> I would like to end my introduction with a few words on digital matters, which are of particular relevance to Ireland.  The Commission recently presented the Digital Decade, which will serve as a compass to guide us in four key areas: skills, infrastructure, business and public services.  We are acting on two dimensions, namely, the modernisation of our regulatory framework, and the support to digital sovereignty.<\/p><p> On the regulatory framework, the Commission has proposed several major Bills on data and platforms.  I will just mention the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act.  While the Digital Services Act provides modernised routes to combat the distribution and sale of illegal content and goods online, the Digital Markets Act targets gatekeepers to prevent them creating unfair conditions and competitions within the ecosystem in which they operate.  The objective is very clear.  The platforms must adapt to EU rules and not the reverse.  Europe is, and will remain, open to anyone who is willing to play by the rules.  We are creating a digital space that ensures equal and better protection for consumers across the Union while allowing individual companies to scale up and grow in the Single Market.  For this we also need strong co-operation between national regulators to avoid the current fragmentation.<\/p><p> The second dimension is about reducing Europe&rsquo;s strategic dependencies in key infrastructure and technologies.  We are working on four fronts: connectivity with 5G and 6G but also a space-based connectivity project to allow all of Europe to have access to broadband Internet; microelectronics, where we want to be able to design and produce the most powerful and resource-efficient processors in the EU; cloud technology, where we must develop European alternatives to hyper-scalers to store and process the most sensitive data; and finally high-performance computers, where our ambition is to acquire for Europe three supercomputers that are in the top 5 globally.  This is about preparing Europe for the industrial data wave ahead of us.<\/p><p> I do not want to be too long.  Whether it is on vaccine production or on digital transformation, we must aim to make Europe stronger.  Through the European recovery plan, the ground-breaking and largest stimulus package ever, we now have the means for this ambition, but member states must take this opportunity.  I look forward to our discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021042000002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Thierry Breton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":564,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner.

I have two questions on different issues.  On vaccines, we as Europeans are all extraordinarily proud of the speed of development of vaccines.  It was a scientific achievement probably unparalleled in medicine and one to which Europe had significant input.  However, Europe did allow the US, the UK and Israel to steal a march ahead of us where the pre-purchase and acquisition of vaccines is concerned.  Have we learned from that experience for the next phase or indeed the next pandemic?  Can the Commissioner tell us succinctly how we will not make that mistake again?<\/p> <p>  My other questions concern the separate issue of the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act.  I do not know whether the Commissioner has had an opportunity to look at the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill 2020 we recently enacted.  It is intended to protect the public space for citizens so that the Internet is as protected as any public park or street against harassment and abuse.  Does the Commissioner think that would require a pan-European law?  Control of digital platforms was a real difficulty for us in that legislation; a single country cannot do that.  If one looks, for example, at Facebook and Twitter banning Mr. Donald Trump for his extremist utterances, surely it cannot be for corporate bodies and platforms to make the determination of what is and is not acceptable.  Surely that should be a matter for democratic accountability.  Will that be regulated in the European sphere?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021042000002#B00500","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":568,"content":"<p>On the first question, as the committee will know, I was tasked with being the head of the European vaccine task force on 5 February.<\/p><p>To tell the committee the truth, I looked very carefully at the situation.  When I started this new mission, it is true that I had the same feeling as Deputy Howlin.  I will tell him very honestly, I do not share his view.  I respect his position because I know that his view is probably widely spread, even though I would like to share with the Parliament that it is not exactly my view.<\/p><p> The US, the UK and Israel were mentioned.  As member states, we can be proud that this is again a tremendous success for European science.  Four of the five vaccines that will be approved have been developed in Europe.  It is fair to say that if science has been developed here in Europe, we have been able to benefit from the US agency, which was put in place in 2006 after the events of 9\/11 in order to cope with biological war or similar attacks.  This agency has the ability to put in a lot of money to accelerate development in cases of necessity and this is what happened.  In other words, we developed science on this side of the Atlantic and we were able to partner with our US friends to benefit from the money they have been able to put in, including in European companies, to speed up the way we deliver vaccines which are working.  At the same time, as Deputy Howlin rightly said, we had to ramp up our industrial base extremely quickly, as never in history, to be able to produce enough vaccines for everyone.<\/p><p> I do not want to criticise the US because, in my position, I respect everyone.  However, the US made an executive order stating that it will not export one single drop of vaccine until it has reached immunity.  We are the only ones to decide that 60% of our production will be dedicated to member states and 40% for export to our friends and partners, including, by the way, NATO members.  We are the only one to do this in Europe.  We have been able to ramp up 53 factories very quickly.  It was my task to make sure that everything was working on time.  It is my pleasure to report to the joint committee today that we have developed this at exactly the same speed as the US.  In other words, at the end of quarter 1 both the US and Europe have been able to produce roughly 12 million doses and now we are accelerating.  I believe that at the end of the year we will be producing more vaccines than the US.<\/p><p> The point about Israel is very interesting.  I would not encourage the monitoring or control of what is happening in another country.  Israel is an important country and has 9 million inhabitants.  There was an agreement between Pfizer and Israel to get the required doses to vaccinate 50% of the population in exchange for a health study in an anonymised way.  That is what has been done.  We produced the vaccines for Israel in our factories in Europe.  It is important for Pfizer to monitor the process.  It would have been impossible, first, if we had not produced enough doses.  In Europe, like in the US, we produced and delivered 14 million does in January.  In February, we produced 28 million doses, in March, 60 million, and in April, 120 million doses.  We could not do the same thing with our 446 million inhabitants.<\/p><p> We signed an agreement with AstraZeneca in August one day before the UK did so.  We were the first to sign.  We are still in the process of investigating the reasons.  We ordered 120 million doses from AstraZeneca in quarter 1 and 180 million doses in quarter 2 but, unfortunately, the company delivered only 30 million doses.  In other words, it delivered only 25% of its commitment to us in Europe in quarter 1, while we understand that it delivered everything which was planned for British citizens.  It is not my intention to make any comments, except that if AstraZeneca, which has its headquarters in London, had delivered on its commitment on the other side of the Channel, we would today be the first ones to be vaccinated.  The good news is that we are accelerating dramatically and we will be able to deliver probably enough vaccines so that by mid-July Ireland will receive enough doses to be able to vaccinate at least 70% of the adult population, which is extremely important, while the UK said its target was one dose by the end of July for each British citizen.  By the way, I would like to tell the committee-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021042000002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Thierry Breton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":570,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt the Commissioner, but could he repeat the statistics for vaccines for Ireland?

In quarter 2, it will be 4.25 million doses and then by mid-July it will probably be between 5.5 million and 6 million doses.  The number of adults in Ireland is 3.7 million.  This includes also some doses coming from Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, which offers a one-shot vaccine.  This is why we are confident that we be able to deliver enough doses.  It is up to member states to organise themselves.  It will require a very rapid acceleration to be ready for that.  I understand that 12 member states on the list have said that they are fully comfortable with 70%.  This number is increasing on a daily basis.  As I said in my introductory remarks, it will depend on the ability of the countries to organise mass vaccinations in order to be able to reach 70% of the adult population by mid-July and to make sure that one's fellow citizens will accept to be vaccinated.<\/p> <p>  If the Chairman wishes, I could say a few words on the task force.  The lesson has been learned.  We need to organise.  We have a task force now.  Before signing a new contract now, I asked all the negotiators to make sure that before signing the definitive agreement my task force will investigate and ensure that the pharmaceutical companies with whom we sign up will be able to deliver what they commit to do.  The lesson has been learned.  We need to have this task force, which is organised now.  It will be a good tool to make sure that we can select good partners, like we have done with Pfizer, which did not just deliver, it over-delivered, and also to follow on a daily basis their production capacity in order to give the right, accurate information to allow member states to organise their own campaign.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021042000002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Thierry Breton"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":572,"content":"<p>We are well over the five minutes at this stage.

The Commissioner mentioned the stark failure of AstraZeneca to meet its commitments to the European Union.  I welcome his comments during the week that future orders should look to the companies that have been successful and that have stood by their contracts.  Much credit must go to Pfizer BioNTech which has done so much heavy lifting for all across the EU and particularly Ireland.  What ramifications will there be post pandemic for companies which have failed, through questionable means, to meet their contractual obligations to the citizens of the EU in vaccine delivery, which is so vital in returning life and society to normal as well as, crucially, saving lives?<\/p><p> The Commissioner said that 12 member states are comfortable they will be able to achieve 70% roll-out and I have no doubt Ireland will be one of those.  What tools will the EU deploy to ensure solidarity across the EU and, indeed, the wider world?  Until all are vaccinated, the virus will remain a massive threat to the whole world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021042000002#C00800","speaker":"1548","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":578,"content":"<p>As I said, we have not decided how we will continue to work in the future but it is important we learn which companies are able to fulfil their commitments.<\/p> <p>  On the legal part of the question, of course we have a contract.  I am the one who is the first to trigger, to say there is something wrong happening that we do not understand.  My goal was to ensure we got the vaccines as soon as possible and I tried to do everything I can to help with companies, including AstraZeneca.  We have contracts and we sent a legal letter to AstraZeneca, which it has 20 days to answer.  That is now in the hands of the legal department.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge it is extremely difficult to ramp up such a production so quickly.  We will probably be the first continent in vaccine production using technology that never existed before at this scale.  We should remember there was never a factory that could produce this many doses of a new vaccine.  The good news is we have such a large portfolio that now we will be able to fulfil our commitment.  The legal department will do what it has to.<\/p> <p>  Member states are part of the vaccination campaign.  I said there are already 12 member states which have said they see this and can organise it themselves.  I have no doubt the 27 member states, in the coming days and weeks, will agree the target as they become comfortable they will receive the necessary doses to reach the target.  The target is important.  Some have spoken of it being the beginning of global unity - I am not an epidemiologist myself, I am just repeating what I hear in expert debates - but it is also important to give some light at the end of the tunnel for our citizens, including before the holiday season.  That is very important after everything we have gone through collectively and individually.  That is also why we decided to put the green certificate in place to start to reopen our borders for travel.<\/p> <p>  The vaccine strategy in the EU is based on solidarity and it has worked.  I know it was challenging at the beginning, I accept that, but at the end of the day it has worked.  No one single country could have done this.  We have been able to do this all together.  There was a challenge at the beginning but it is important to avoid vaccine nationalism.  We also bear on our shoulders the vaccination of the world today.  We are the only group to export vaccines massively outside Europe.  We are doing this for our allies, partners and for our NATO allies, and it is our responsibility to do this in the future with COVAX and for Africa.  It is also in our interest.  The Deputy mentioned what will happen if we do not do this.  Look at what happened in the UK.  It started its campaign, then there was the British variant, and now there is the Brazil variant.  It is in our interest to ensure we can help everyone with the industrial facility we have now in Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021042000002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Thierry Breton"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":579,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner for this presentation.

We can be proud of that, but in a more selfish way it is also in our interest.  It is not enough but we are the only one using our own production to donate significantly to COVAX.  Of course, there are other donors but we are already exporting vaccines to more than 150 countries either through the COVAX instrument or directly.  We do our fair share without putting the EU vaccination strategy in danger.  It is in the ramping-up phase.<\/p> <p>  I have had a lot of discussions with my counterpart in the US.  The EU is doing this alone and we will be very pleased when the US rejoins.  It is to be hoped that will be soon because it is a big task but we have to do it.<\/p> <p>  We ordered 200 million doses which we hope to have in the second quarter.  We expect to deliver between 800 million to 1 billion doses in the second half of the year.<\/p><p>Of course, we may not need all of that supply.  We may need part of it for the variants.  Companies are already working on a specific booster, if it is needed.  We will also have other doses and, as I mentioned, member states will be part owners of those doses.  Those member states will have the ability to do what they want with those doses, and that includes donating them.  This is an important topic and we will have to discuss it further in the second half of the year, but I am totally with the Deputy.  This is a joint fight.  We hope that before the end of the summer, the US and Europe will have vaccinated their adult populations.  Europe represents only 10% of the population of the planet.  That is why it is extremely important.<\/p><p> On the question on AstraZeneca, I cannot comment because we are in a legal proceeding.  I can tell the Deputy AstraZeneca has committed to deliver 70 million doses in quarter 2.  A big part of that total is coming from European factories.  AstraZeneca also wants to use the worldwide supply chain.  I have no doubt that AstraZeneca is making its best efforts to achieve delivery of 70 million vaccines.  As I said at the beginning, thanks to the additional 50 million doses coming from Pfizer that we did not expect, we can have a level of comfort.  I worked in industry before I became a Commissioner and can tell the committee that, of course, nothing is certain, especially in the vaccine industry.  However, we can have a level of comfort about the fact that we will be able to deliver the number of doses needed to achieve the mid-July target.<\/p><p> The Deputy also asked about the digital green certificate.  It is important to note the certificate is not a passport.  It is to simplify schedules.  Its use will be limited to the time of the pandemic.  It will have simple information and will be totally protected because the general data protection regulation, GDPR, is mandatory and there is absolutely no reason the data will be used for other reasons.  It will, of course, be in the hands of member states.  We want to have exactly the same procedures and format across EU member states.  If citizens of member states are asked for the certificate should they want to go to another country and if someone is travelling by aeroplane, it is easier to have the certificate and it will facilitate boarding.  The certificate will not be mandatory so if an EU citizen does not have a certificate, an airline company may require a PCR test, as they do today.  This tool could be used or it could be on paper.  If a passenger does not have a PCR test, an airline company may ask him or her to undergo a rapid test, or whatever.  It will definitely be a tool, although it will not be mandatory.  The certificate regime will be in the hands of the member states to decide what they want to do with it.  We know that it will be an extremely important tool to allow our fellow citizens to travel more safely and freely.  There is &euro;30 million in my portfolio to help member states to develop this certificate, if necessary.  We also have a technical team and if it is necessary, we can put the team at the disposal of some member states when required because our target is to be ready by the end of June.  There will be no exchange of personal data.  There will be a certified and secure QR code.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021042000002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Thierry Breton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":582,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner for the information he has given us.

I would like to home in on Mr. Breton's work as a vaccine hunter, which is a nickname I commend him on as it is one I would not mind having.  We talk about the huge number of vaccines that had been exported.  At the end of March, that figure was around 77 million doses.  We had a stash, for want of a better term, of AstraZeneca and that was said to be down to the work of Mr. Breton and I commend him on that.

Perhaps the piece of work that Mr. Breton was doing should have kicked into action quicker.  Could he give the detail of how that worked?  What were his successes?<\/p> <p>  There is a wider conversation about finding out the absolute capacity that exists within the pharmaceutical industry from the point of view of producing as many vaccines as possible for Europe and the entire world.  As has already been said, none of us is safe until all of us are safe.  I accept its involvement with COVAX, but has the Commission looked into the likes of the coronavirus treatment acceleration programme, CTAP, and the idea of pharmaceutical companies forgoing, for a fair price, intellectual property and so on, to ensure that we get maximum roll-out?  We have been told that roll-out in some parts of the world will not happen until 2023 or 2024.  We know the difficulties around strains of the virus.  That could have a considerable cost in terms of lives and health but could cost trillions in world trade.  We cannot afford not to vaccinate everyone.  Will Mr. Breton give me any information he has on that matter?<\/p> <p>  Will Mr. Breton give me his view on his dealings with the British Government as regards the Irish protocol and where it stands at the moment?  I know that nobody is ever certain of where they stand when they are negotiating with a British Government.  <\/p> <p>  I would also like to know the Commission's view on mandatory hotel quarantine, if Mr. Breton has time to reply.

We are, obviously, very worried about different strains of the virus, particularly the B1617 variant from India.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021042000002#E01400","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":595,"content":"<p>The Deputy has asked many questions.  I will try to summarise.  I was tasked with this mission on 5 February.  Some people have said that we should have started a little earlier.  I remind the committee that the world was positively surprised when it realised at the beginning of December that some vaccines were working and required to be approved by our authorities and agencies.  That was true of Pfizer at the beginning of December, Moderna at the end of December and AstraZeneca at the end of January.  I was tasked in early February.  I immediately went to sites to try to see how the ramp-up was going.<\/p><p>As I mentioned, there are 53 sites across Europe.  Of course, I did not visit all of them but, together with the team I created for this specific task, I visited many of them.  One of my biggest concerns related to the ramp-up having to be done in less than ten months, with some aspects having to be done in six months, which is a significant increase for this industry where it would usually take years to ramp-up in this way.  That is why what has been done is very impressive.  It was part of the criteria for selecting companies.  All the scientific part of the vaccines were developed by biotech or academic teams such as those at BioNTech CureVac, Janssen or Oxford University.  They were developed by very small teams which, it is important to remember, were funded by EU money.  However, those teams did not have expertise of developing vaccines, which is why we favoured their entering into a partnership with a big pharmaceutical company which could be the one to produce vaccines.  It was not easy because some of the companies did not know how to work together.<\/p><p> The second part we had to get right was the supply chain, which was extremely important.  Of course, when you ramp up supply chains across a continent so quickly, with so many factories involved, there were instances of tension.  The vaccines have between 300 and 500 components, so my biggest fear was whether we would be able to meet the requirements for some of the produce.  That is why I immediately contacted Mr. Jeff Zients, my counterpart in the US.  I wanted to make sure that we could exchange produce.  Even if the United States had an executive order in place relating to the vaccines, I wanted to ensure we could have free co-operation in terms of the supply chain at least to avoid problems in this phase.  There were some problems and I had to discuss many issues with the US authorities, but finally it worked more smoothly.  We learned how to work together and it worked more smoothly than it did at the beginning.  I did not know that some people refer to me as a vaccine hunter.  I do not know how to take that.<\/p><p> It is important to state that I am very proud of what I have seen on the ground, with many entrepreneurs, some of whom are competitors, working together to try to find solutions.  We ran a very important matchmaking event which we invited all the relevant companies, including those from Ireland, to join.  We had two days together.  Companies outlined what they could offer or needed.  I hate to use this comparison but it is quite like we are at war.  Even the companies that were competitors now work together on this common joint objective.<\/p><p> Intellectual property is a very important issue.  We need to have this debate but my recommendation is that it should not be opened now because the key for us now is to produce a massive amount of vaccines.  This is what we are doing.  We should not destabilise the process.  We must also make sure that we will be able to deliver enough doses for our partners outside Europe, including in Africa.  That is extremely important.  If we made the patent available free of charge and linked up with factories in Asia, for example, such as in India or elsewhere, it would take many months or possibly years to adapt the factory lines to produce the vaccines, especially the mRNA vaccines, but also the adenovirus vaccines which are quite complex.  That would not solve the current issue.  It is something we need to put on the agenda and discuss for the future but, as the person responsible for the vaccine task force and making sure the ramp-up of factories delivers what is needed for us and for the world, I think we are still at war and will prefer to focus on this issue.  We will need to discuss the issue of intellectual property in the near future, it is hoped when this pandemic is behind us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021042000002#E01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Thierry Breton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":597,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner.

It is much appreciated.  I detect the collective solidarity of the EU.  All present know Mr. Breton is not the Commissioner on behalf of France or Ireland but, rather, the Commissioner on behalf of the EU.  We thank him for his valiant efforts to date.<\/p> <p>  I am appealing to Mr. Breton to be a Commissioner for countries beyond the EU.  Will he assure us he is aware the world is divided into haves and have-nots, them and us, and those living in Third World countries feel like fifth-class citizens and like they are at the back of the queue?  Will the Commissioner be a leading voice and use his pivotal and influential role to do his utmost in the name of global solidarity?  It is necessary to extend the approach from EU solidarity to world solidarity.  Is he aware of the divisive fears of many that they will be left behind?  Is he acutely aware of that?  Does he have a separate task force or division set up to tackle that issue?  I know he is working very hard in his influential position to help the less well-off, the poor, the disadvantaged and those who have no voice.  Ireland has a voice.  The Commissioner has given the committee a very informative presentation on how we are doing in Ireland but our small nation has a brilliant reputation for standing up for the less well-off.  Through the years, we have displayed generosity that far exceeds our population size.<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to the digital age.  I know Deputy Howlin and others have touched on this issue.  The Commissioner is aware of the vile abuse of ethnic minorities and the disgusting tirade of homophobic abuse on social media.  It is so important that connectivity is not abused.  What is the greatest facility of this generation has also proven to be one of the most divisive, unsupervised and cowardly ways faceless people can abuse others, sometimes to such an extent that the victims take their own lives.  I am convinced this issue will someday be resolved, but I have seen no progress whatsoever in tackling the wanton abuse and aggression on social media, mostly targeted at vulnerable people.  When will there be a tangible breakthrough rather than just tinkering at the edges?  Will that happen during Mr. Breton's term as Commissioner?  I know it is a global issue and it is a big ask, but it is a very important thing to ask.  Will he play his role in putting manners on those on social media, for once and for all, as well as the profit-making people who are allowed to do what they want?  We cannot trust them and the attempts to tackle them have, to date, clearly failed. When will the EU come together with its partners throughout the world to state that enough is enough?  When can we expect the cowardly and faceless persons who propagate this disgusting and vile abuse to be stopped?<\/p> <p>  My third point-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021042000002#F00400","speaker":"1667"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":600,"content":"<p>We have two more contributors to come in and there are only ten minutes left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021042000002#F00500","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":601,"content":"<p>In cognisance of the direction from the Chair, I will leave it at that.

Senator Martin raised two very important topics.  The first touched me personally because I am extremely involved in Africa.<\/p><p>It is an important area in respect of the production of vaccines.  We are not only working to produce the doses for our African partners and others, but I remind members that we have the capacity to produce over 3 billion doses by the end of the year.  Hopefully, we will have a huge stock of vaccines in the second half of year.  That is important.  <\/p><p> However, it is not enough.  We also need to help these countries to develop their own capacity to produce vaccines and to enable them to meet the needs of their citizens.  From that perspective, last week I had a long conversation with the President of Senegal, Mr. Macky Sall, who will be President of the African Union next year.  We decided to start looking into the development of a large vaccine factory, hopefully in Senegal.  Senegal has a long history of developing vaccines at the Pasteur Institute of Dakar.  We are working to find the right tools to do this very quickly.  Of course, we all understand that it is our mission to help everyone during this pandemic and also to prepare for the next one.  Unfortunately, with between 8 billion and 10 billion inhabitants on our planet, there may be, and probably will be, another pandemic.  That is why we are doing this work.<\/p><p> The Irish Government has a very strong relationship with the US President, particularly at the moment.  I understand that he likes Ireland.  Perhaps it would be a good idea for the Irish Government to use its influence, which is considerable.  Having lived in the US for many years, I know that the influence of the Irish Government is significant there, particularly at present.  The Government could use its influence in the US to gain access to vaccine stocks.  It would help us and help me in my task.<\/p><p> On the digital transformation, I am acutely aware of what is happening on social media.  It allows me to reply to the first question asked.  First, I agree that we must work together and do something with our partners around the world.  Second, our December proposal highlighted that what is not accepted offline should not be allowed online either.  That is extremely important.  Third, social media platforms must step up their efforts.  The proposed EU rules will place new obligations on these platforms.  We will supervise and sanction violations.  Fourth, only a European instrument will be effective in addressing the issues that have been raised.<\/p><p> As I stated after the events on Capitol Hill in January 2021, it should not be for private companies to take arbitrary decisions.  Incidentally, the proposal that has been put on the table would have made such events impossible.  I asserted as much in an op-ed.  There must be a democratically validated framework which should be respected by all parties.  That is what the Digital Services Act is precisely about.  We have been the first to move on this issue.  Obviously, I would like to be able to tell the committee that we will discuss it with our friends in the US and that discussions are already under way, but the reality is that we are ahead of the curve and leading the process.  Before presenting the proposal and placing it in the hands of the co-legislators, we undertook a significant consultation exercise.  It is my style of working.  Some 3,000 contributions were received, with many coming from the US and other countries.  It was a year after the consultation that we presented the proposal.  Does that mean that we are one year ahead of the US in that respect?  Probably, yes.  However, we share the same values and issues.  Therefore, it is a good opportunity for further co-operation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021042000002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Thierry Breton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":605,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner.

First, I wish to make a comment, and it is not a throw-away one from my perspective, which is that nobody is safe until everyone has access to safe and effective treatments and vaccines.  In other words, no one is safe until everyone is safe.  We must absolutely mean that.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the Commissioner's commitment that there will be enough vaccines to vaccinate 70% of our population by mid-July.  However, I note his previous comment that he was trusting less in companies in honouring their commitments. I would like to ask him specifically whether those comments solely relate to AstraZeneca or if there are more general concerns around the commitments from the large pharmaceutical companies.<\/p> <p>  I also wish to ask about alternative vaccines and the work that is being done in terms of vaccines being produced in China and the Sputnik V vaccine, and where work is at in terms of looking at those alternative vaccines.  Certainly, they seem to be very effective.  I note that some European countries are accessing them.  I would like to hear the Commissioner's views on that.<\/p> <p>  I also want to make reference to a call from a number of former presidents, prime ministers and Nobel laureates in respect of the TRIPS waiver, which waives certain intellectual property rights.  A number of members have already touched upon the issue.  I believe it was yesterday that the EU foreign policy chief, High Representative Josep Borrell, tweeted his support for waiving some intellectual property rights.  He quickly deleted his tweet, which was quite surprising.  However, I have a copy with me.  He stated: \"at one point, scaling up vaccination efforts by waiving intellectual property rights will be needed to globally combat [the] Covid-19 pandemic.\"<\/p> <p>  We are all genuinely concerned about new variants in Ireland.  Yesterday, three cases of the \"Indian\", or B1617, variant were detected in Ireland.  Until people are vaccinated globally, there remains a serious concern about the emergence of new variants.  <\/p> <p>  I note that in a recent article written by the Commissioner, he stated: \"I would remind you that the companies have invested a lot and very quickly, which has enabled us to have vaccines in a few months when it usually takes several years.\"  While that may be the case, public funding has also gone into these large pharmaceutical companies.  I note that in respect of the one company about which the Commissioner has expressed concerns, namely, AstraZeneca, around &euro;336 million in public money was pumped into that pharmaceutical company to develop and help with the production of the vaccine.  How much public money from Europe has gone into the pharmaceutical companies in the development of the vaccines?<\/p> <p>  I also wish to ask the Commissioner about the waiving of intellectual property rights.  I sit on another Oireachtas Committee, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.  We have seen evidence, and it is widely acknowledged, that the cost of accessing vaccines in developing countries, for example, in Africa, is double that which EU member states are being charged.<\/p><p>I question whether the Union is concerned about dealing with this pandemic globally or is more interested in serving the needs of the large pharmaceutical companies and the profits they are making.  I fundamentally believe that there should be no profit from the pandemic.  Looking at this when the pandemic is over too late.  This needs to be done now.  I ask the Commissioner, the EU and the Government to sign up to initiatives such as CTAP and deal with intellectual property rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021042000002#G00500","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":610,"content":"<p>The Commissioner has been generous in giving us an extra five minutes.

I have three minutes and will try to do my best.<\/p> <p>  On the Chairman's question, we know and appreciate the industrial landscape in Ireland is extremely important and pharmaceutical companies were present at our networking event.  If there is any need, I am in personal contact with the Prime Minister.  Sometimes it helps if we can have more information.  I have a lot of support from the Government.  The key is to say to the industry that we appreciate what it does.  We will of course offer many companies the opportunity to be part of our strategy.  We need to continue working on that.<\/p> <p>  On the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine, we await the EMA assessment of the efficacy of the vaccine, which I have no doubt will arrive.  I am not in charge of health and have no information from the EMA.  Without Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, we will have fewer vaccines in quarter 2 than hoped.  I am confident that enough vaccines can be produced to reach our target of vaccinating 70% of the adult population by July.  As the committee understands, we have some room for manoeuvre.  <\/p> <p>  On the first question, I am confident that AstraZeneca will be able to deliver a reduced amount.  I remind the committee that the figure went from 180 million in its first commitment to 170 million.  These vaccines are of course included in our forecast.  I am working on it every day.  We have a very large and broad portfolio of vaccines, which makes me confident that we will be able to reach our 70% target.<\/p> <p>  I will say a word on the other vaccines.  Soon five vaccines will have been accepted.  I mentioned CureVac which, it is to be hoped, will be agreed on by the end of May or June.  It takes a lot of time to be accepted because we are extremely strict with our health regulations.  We do not have anything against anybody.  We are professionals and it is because of that that we do not try to play politics with vaccines.  It is always a bad idea to do that.<\/p> <p>  Sputnik is another vaccine and I have a lot of respect for Russian scientists, especially in the Gamaleya Research Institute, which is very well known.  Like every other vaccine, they need to apply to the EMA, which was done a few weeks ago.  The process usually takes a few months because it is very serious and advocates for everyone.  It will take a few months for the vaccine to be analysed and approved by the EMA.  It could then take another few months - sometimes it takes between ten and 12 months - to be able to have the facility to manufacture it.  We know that all our facilities have been transformed over the past ten to 12 months to be able to follow the needs of our fellow citizens.  If the Sputnik vaccine is approved by the EMA, it will enter into an industrial process phase, which will take another ten months.  When the facility is up and running to manufacture a vaccine, it takes between 70 and 100 days to do so.  Every preorder for Sputnik or any other vaccine cannot be delivered before the end of this year.  There is another story for all of us.  We said, of course, that we welcome everyone but we know our priorities.  Sinovac is the Chinese vaccine.  There were some difficulties with it in Chile, for example.<\/p> <p>  I discussed IT.  There is absolutely no issue.  It is something we need to discuss, but it is a matter of priorities.  We believe, along with my colleague, High Representative\/Vice-President Josep Borrell Fontelles, that there will come a time when we will need to appeal the decision.

Meeting with the committee is something the commission identified at the outset as a key element of our consultation process.  I am genuinely pleased to have this opportunity to hear the views of the committee this afternoon and to outline to the work the commission has commenced.  Please note that I will not be in a position today to indicate any commission findings or conclusions as our work is still at a relatively early stage.<\/p> <p>  The Government established the commission in December 2020 and has asked that we report by the end of this year.  In establishing the commission, the Government appointed 15 members.  They bring a great range of experience and expertise in key areas, including in senior management, human resources management, security policy, public and the diplomatic service as well as national and international military expertise.<\/p> <p>  As chairperson of the commission, I am fortunate to have such an extensive range of skills and experience among my fellow members.  While a 15-member commission is quite large and presents its own challenges in the current environment where meetings must be held virtually, it is also something of a blessing in that it allows us to undertake work in a number of smaller subgroups in a way that still ensures a good diversity of expertise in each such group.  The commission has an extensive agenda and, therefore, a busy schedule and programme of work.  In broad terms, we see three phases to our work: first, issue identification; second, detailed analysis and consideration of the key issues identified; and, finally, agreeing conclusions and preparing our report.  In this regard, this meeting seems well-timed because we are quite close to the end of the first phase of our work - the issue identification phase - and we are now embarking on a deeper dive into the analysis of the range of issues that we can most usefully deal with in our report.  The production of our report with conclusions and recommendations will be the final phase of our work and I see that commencing in early autumn.  In practice, these three phases of work are not rigid and will to some extent overlap with one another.<\/p> <p>  Members will, no doubt, have seen our terms of reference and I do not propose to go through these in great detail but I am keen to make some important points or clarifications.  First, our terms of reference are quite extensive.  In fact, they set out a challenging range of issues that we have been asked to address by the Government.  There are aspects of our terms of reference that address immediate requirements, while others focus on the need to develop a longer term vision for the Defence Forces beyond 2030.  Developing a longer term vision for the Defence Forces of the future is important given the dynamic changes and the pace of change in the security environment, including the emergence of new threats and new technologies and, of course, globally important issues such as climate change.  In broad terms, we have been asked to consider the appropriate capabilities, structures and staffing needed for our Defence Forces in the immediate and long-term future.  In doing so, we are to be guided by the national defence policy framework and to be cognisant of developments in the current security environment.  I emphasise that the commission is future-focused but obviously starting from a realistic assessment of the current situation.<\/p> <p>  In developing our findings and recommendations, we are required to have regard to the level of funding provided by the Government for defence.  Therefore, in accordance with our terms of reference, the commission is approaching its work against the backdrop of Ireland's existing defence policy, as laid down in the White Paper on Defence 2015 and the White Paper update of 2019.  As such, fundamental issues such as Ireland's policy of military neutrality are outside our remit.  Matters explicitly within our remit include issues around identifying and making recommendations on the capabilities and structures needed to ensure the Defence Forces remain agile, flexible and adaptive in the face of the changing defence and security environment, as well as ensuring they can continue to fulfil the roles assigned to them by government now and in future.  We will look at the structure of each of the three services in the light of current experience and best practice in comparable countries.<\/p><p>In this, as in other work, we will draw on material from the projects being undertaken on foot of the White Paper on Defence and the high-level implementation process involving joint civil-military teams from the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces.<\/p><p> Our initial work on structures is focusing on issues that are cross-cutting for the Defence Forces as a whole, including overall command and control systems and the important concept of \"jointness\".  The latter relates to the need for structures that facilitate a joint force approach across the traditional domains of land, air and maritime, as well as the newer domains of cyber and space.  This is a significant focus in national defence strategies in many countries, especially in recent years.  Beyond these structural issues, our work on capabilities will require us to consider how our Defence Forces are trained, resourced and equipped to undertake the tasks assigned to them by Government.<\/p><p> In regard to staffing and HR, I should draw the attention of the committee to the fact that the commission does not have a remit to consider rates of pay and allowances.  The latter fall outside of its terms of reference.  However, the commission is asked to examine the evolution of the remuneration systems and structures currently in place.  I mentioned earlier that we are on the cusp of turning from issue identification to the analysis phase of our work.  One of the issues that has emerged from the first phase of our work is the complexity of existing remuneration structures, particularly concerning allowances.  This is an issue that a staff subgroup of the commission is looking at.  This subgroup has a particularly busy programme of work facing it and I am pleased to say it has begun making good progress in sifting through the substantial number of issues that have emerged.  These include issues concerning the working time directive, workforce planning, recruitment and retention, promotion, career planning and career progression, as well as issues of gender and diversity and much more.  I do not think the commission will be able to address the range of staffing and HR issues that have been raised, but it will attempt to focus its consideration and recommendations on the issues on which it is felt the commission can be most impactful within its terms of reference.<\/p><p> I would like now to speak briefly to the commission's work on the Reverse Defence Force.  As set out in its terms of reference, the commission will look at a wide range of issues in regard to the Reserve Defence Force.  We aim to make specific recommendations intended to better leverage the capabilities of the Reserve.  It is too early to say what those recommendations will be.  The approach we are currently taking is that all subgroups of the commission, whether looking at capabilities, structures or staff, are tasked with addressing relevant issues in regard to the Reserve.  Later in the summer, the intention is to draw all of this work together to ensure a clear and coherent set of recommendations on the Reserve.<\/p><p> From the outset, it had been the commission's intent to visit military installations across the country to engage candidly with the women and men of all ranks across the Defence Forces.  Our ability to conduct these has been severely constrained by Covid restrictions.  To date, only two visits have taken place, namely, to Cathal Brugha Barracks in Dublin and Casement Aerodrome in Baldonnel.  Nevertheless, we continue to plan for, and look forward to carrying out, a more extensive programme of visits and meeting with as many personnel as possible in the coming months.  As we did with Cathal Brugha Barracks and Casement Aerodrome, we will be actively encouraging staff of all ranks to speak their minds to better inform our work.  Members of the commission and I were impressed with the quality of the people we met on the two visits and their very obvious dedication to and pride in the Defence Forces and the role they play in serving the people of this country.  This has been genuinely inspiring for me and my colleagues.  It makes us every more determined to do our work with the same level of commitment.<\/p><p> Another key element of our engagement is the public consultation process we launched in January.  I am pleased to say that this has elicited a tremendous response, with over 520 submissions received, including some from members of this committee, which are very welcome.  The secretariat to the commission is in the process of sorting through the submissions and members of the commission have begun reviewing the responses.  We have decided that these submissions should be published on our website and this process will get under way in batches, commencing next month.<\/p><p> The past number of months have provided the commission with much food for thought.  We have had a very intensive series of meetings with the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, the Secretary General and senior management teams of the Department of Defence and senior officers from the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service.  We also had a very useful engagement with the Defence Forces senior NCO forum.  We have also met with and listened to the views of the Defence Forces representative associations, permanent and Reserve, and we will engage further with these groups as our work progresses.<\/p><p> Two weeks ago, we held a webinar which, thanks to the Royal Irish Academy and the Institute for International and European Affairs, IIEA, provided an opportunity for experts from outside of the commission, Irish and from further afield, to give us their views.  This proved extremely valuable.  It was very interesting to have such a rich and informed debate on security and defence matters, something, I am sure, many here today will agree is often lacking in this country.<\/p><p> In all of our work to date, we have had tremendous support from our colleagues in the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces.  This support has been freely and jointly given to the commission by the two sides of the defence organisation.  I take this opportunity to record my gratitude to the Secretary General, the Chief of Staff and their colleagues for this assistance.  We will continue to engage with the Department and the Defence Forces as we proceed with our work, but our conclusions and recommendations will be arrived at independently by the commission.<\/p><p> The commission has done a lot of listening and reading over the past four months and we will do some more listening this afternoon.  As I mentioned, we are moving into the analysis phase of our work.  As we do so, it will be very helpful to us to have the views and advice of members of this committee who, I am sure, have also been hearing a lot about the issues with which the commission must grapple in the months ahead.  I look forward to hearing and taking on board the perspectives of members and I am happy to take any questions they may have regarding the commission's approach to this important task.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021042000002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":624,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Driscoll for the very fine progress report notwithstanding the challenges of Covid-19.

I acknowledge the other members of the commission who may be watching and I wish them well in their work over the coming months.  It is critical work.  The commission has its work cut out for it.<\/p> <p>  That more than 520 submissions have been received shows the level of concern in regard to the Defence Forces, as well as the engagement of communities with the Defence Forces.  My party colleague, Deputy Clarke, and I have made a submission on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in.  While I do not propose to go into all of the issues we raised within that submission, it covers many of the matters touched on my Mr. O'Driscoll, from the Reserve Defence Force to the role of women in our Defence Forces, cybersecurity and the really important issue of pay and conditions, which is one of the core issues facing our Defence Forces.  Mr. O'Driscoll mentioned that the commission may not be able to deal with complexity of remunerations in terms of the work it is undertaking.<\/p><p>It is a critical issue which has led to the huge retention issue within our Defence Forces.  Numbers are down at around 8,500 members, which is testament to the failure of successive governments to tackle the issue.<br\/><br\/>Mr. O'Driscoll mentioned the three different stages of the process the commission has embarked on.  He mentioned the issue of the identification process.  I want to ask Mr. O'Driscoll a couple of specific questions on that.  One of the biggest issues facing members of our Defence Forces is obviously pay and conditions, but contracts are also a massive issue.  That impacts significantly on recruitment and retention.  Since 1994, there has been a huge level of insecurity associated with the Defence Forces and the changes that led to the five-year contracts being issued.  Does Mr. O'Driscoll agree there is an onus on the commission to address the issue of contracts post 1994?<br\/><br\/>I will read a quote which I think is poignant: <\/p><blockquote>\tWe all know that there is a retention crisis.  The White Paper target is not being met.  PDFORRA has [established] that in the next year, that some 600 to 800 people may leave the Defence Forces.  Much of that is based on the 1994 contracts. <\/blockquote><p>That statement was made by Deputy Jack Chambers in 2019, now the Minister of State with responsibility for the Defence Forces.  He was also pushing for a review of the 1994 contracts.  An adjudicator was appointed in 2015 due to differences of opinion between PDFORRA and the Government.  An important recommendation came from the adjudicator at that point that there should be a further review of the service limit for line corporals, privates, corporals in technical grades and so on.  Will the contracts form an integral part of the commission's work over the coming months?<br\/><br\/>Article 6.2 of the European Social Charter states that Defence Forces representative groups have collective bargaining rights.  Recent pay talks have found tangible benefits to being associated with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, in terms of securing ancillary benefits.  Does the commission agree that, if they so desire, representative groups should be allowed to be associated with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions?<br\/><br\/>My two specific questions are on the right to affiliate with ICTU and the 1994 contracts.  I wish Mr. O'Driscoll and the rest of the commission well in their work and we look forward to, we hope, a process of ongoing engagement with Mr. O'Driscoll and the commission in the months ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021042000002#B00300","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":627,"content":"<p>For ease of management, we will take two members' observations and questions, then I will revert to Mr. O'Driscoll and then back to Deputies Clarke and Stanton.

I will not ask any questions on the likely outcome of the commission's deliberations.  I welcome as well the members of the commission, who are watching.  I am aware of the onerous task the commission has ahead of it.  A total of 520 submissions is quite a response from the Republic and I am delighted there has been that response.<\/p> <p>  The commission cannot deal with pay so I leave that and the working time directive aside.  I believe those are HR issues the commission may address in its final report.  I am interested in the issue of the land component of the Army element.  Specifically, the Defence Forces has three services and retention of key Army personnel is a daily negativity affected by geographical disposition of the Army.  Since 2012, solders and their families do not receive military housing, rent allowances, soft Government loans or free family medical services, as in other international forces.  As such, reliance of military families on housing or land to build homes made available by families or extended families is essential.  The historical military personnel over the generations were inducted into military units adjacent to or within easy access of where they lived or came from.  The 2012 reorganisation disrupted that.<\/p> <p>  The strategic military need for the State and its disposition of forces in the immediate and middle future will be north of the line from Dublin to Galway, exactly where the Army has the lowest footprint.  The Army supports structure and its disposition of forces are critical for the commission.  The structure of the Army, in particular, needs to be finalised by the commission before it begins to address capability, staffing or otherwise.  It is the cart before the horse.  I would like Mr. O'Driscoll to address these concerns.<\/p> <p>  Regarding recruitment, the proven conveyor belt for same has been the reserve Defence Forces.  The reserve was in every town and village in Ireland until the 2012 reorganisation, which led to the collapse of the Reserve Defence Force.  Going back to my youth, on Tuesday night in Galway city, every corner had a group of guys in uniform waiting to go up to the barracks for training.  That ran across the entire county of Galway because we all met in the barracks.  That is gone and, with it, I believe we have lost a crucial part of the recruitment cohort that were available in the country.<\/p> <p>  Turning to diversity in the Defence Forces, I noted this week an article in the newspaper on new recruits to the Naval Service being from different parts of the world.  Why is a member of the Defence Forces not entitled to Irish citizenship the moment they sign up?  If I go to the United States, walk into a recruitment office and sign up, I am immediately given my green card and allowed to remain there.<\/p> <p>  On the following issues, I am not looking for answers today because I do not think it would be right to.  On training locations, if I am stationed in Galway, Cork or Donegal and I want to train to be a corporal, I have to leave my family for six months and go east.  That has to be looked at by the commission.  On unit culture, I joined the first battalion in Galway in the 1970s and I met my sergeant major my first day in the barracks.  From that day on, I aspired to be the sergeant major in the barracks.  The sergeant major developed the culture of the unit.  Now we have senior non-commissioned officers, NCOs, promoted into positions with a couple of months left in their career.  I do not believe it is good for unit culture and I would be interested to know if the commission is looking at that.<\/p> <p>  On the Air Corps, I and several members outside of here have been advocating for some time for the use of the Air Corps in search and rescue services.  The Air Corps is involved in the air ambulance service.  Will the commission be looking at and making recommendations on the conflict between military tasking and military-civilian tasking?<\/p> <p>  My colleague, Deputy Brady, raised issues with regard to the European Court of Justice.  The ICTU thing hangs over our head.  Will the commission look at the benefits of ICTU membership and compare and contrast such membership with a commission on pay?  The last round of pay negotiations was outrageous in the way it ignored the uniformed personnel in this country.<\/p><p> I am sorry for throwing all that at Mr. O'Driscoll.  I thank him very much and I really appreciate the time he has given to the committee.  I am delighted that he is getting the co-operation that he needed both from the uniformed services and from the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021042000002#C00300","speaker":"1645","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":630,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Brady and Senator Craughwell for their questions.  The Senator raised quite a few issues and he raised many more in his submission, which I have read.  He was being mild on me for which I thank him.<\/p> <p>  I will first deal with Deputy Brady's points.  As I mentioned earlier, we have broken the work into a number of subgroups and among the issues the staffing subgroup is investigating is the area of contracts.  Obviously, the prism through which it is looking at this is in part the question of turnover in the Defence Forces and the desire for retention.  The Deputy specifically mentioned technical grades.  In both our visits to Cathal Brugha Barracks and to the Air Corps, the specific challenges of technical staff were raised very strongly with us and so we are becoming better informed on that.  I cannot tell the Deputy what we will conclude on these things.  I think both will feature in the final report, but I cannot tell him the extent to which they will feature.  They are on our list of matters we are investigating.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about ICTU.  This is obviously a tricky subject and I do not want to get too far into it.  We will keep ourselves informed of developments over the next few months because this is obviously a live issue at the moment involving PDFORRA.  There are also legal issues.  We will keep an eye on it.  Towards the end of our work, we might make a call on whether it would be appropriate or useful for us to make some comment in this area.  I will be realistic.  There are a number of representative associations.  They do not all have precisely the same view and we need to respect that.  We will not shy away from the matter, however, if we think we need to address it.<\/p> <p>  I will now deal with Senator Craughwell's questions.  The land component is very important and I understand his point on the geographical distribution.  We have not had a particular look at geographical distribution yet.  I will probably be hung by my fellow commission members for saying this, but it would be our broad intention to visit all the locations if we can, at which point we might have a better view on this.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, the importance of the distribution of facilities to recruitment has been raised with us.  On the other hand, however, the difficulty of having a very dispersed force in the context of causes for career progression has also been raised.  I hate to proceed by means of anecdote but nevertheless I will do so.  One member of the Defence Forces spoke to me about how his career had stalled.  He felt he was stuck in his initial location because he had his house close by where he and his family were living.  He said there were not too many senior NCO positions at that location.  Obviously, concentration provides individuals with greater promotion opportunities; dispersal provides greater recruitment opportunities.  It is not an easy issue, but we will think about that as we go through those issues.<\/p> <p>  The Senator and Deputy Brady both talked about the Reserve.  The Senator spoke about his experience in the distant past when he was young; I am sure it is not that long ago.  It is a long time since I was in the FCA, although I have to say we were not hanging around corners as apparently they were doing in Galway.  We were very disciplined.  The Reserve is very important.  I will try not to repeat what I said in my opening statement.  We are trying to deal with the Reserve in the three big buckets first.  The Reserve needs to be looked at in totality with the Permanent Defence Force in those areas.  However, we are very conscious of the need for specific attention to be paid to the Reserve.  I am well aware of the current state of the Reserve.  I will not go further than that.<\/p> <p>  Diversity is very important.  Let me first talk about gender diversity.  Only about 7% of the members of the Defence Forces are women.  As I have said a number of times at meetings with Defence Forces colleagues, we are effectively recruiting from half the population and then worrying about problems with recruitment.  There is a big issue here.  It is not exclusive to the Irish Defence Forces.  I have been looking at defence forces in other countries and while some of them are better, quite a few of them struggled with this.  I compliment the Chief of Staff on this.  I used to have responsibility in the Civil Service at Secretary General level for promoting gender balance in the Civil Service.  That expanded to the public service at one stage and I worked closely with the Chief of Staff on it.  I know of his personal commitment to gender balance and diversity, but a considerable amount remains to be done.  The story in the past week of the Rastafarian recruit to the Naval Service was very heart-warming.  I hope we can see more of that.<\/p> <p>  The issue of giving people citizenship was raised.  I am sure that the Chairman, Deputy Stanton and I would be delighted to pass that one back to the Department of Justice.  I am sure they would forgive us.<\/p> <p>  The issue of training locations for six-month courses was again raised with us.  Many things cause strains in respect of having a family-friendly approach and two things have been called out to us in particular.  The first relates to the requirement for Defence Forces members to participate in a six-month course in the Curragh or wherever, when they may be living with their family in Cork, Finner or elsewhere.  The second issue relates to overseas service, which again requires stepping away for the duration of the deployment.  These are significant challenges.  We will be looking carefully at the training systems involved in promotion because they put multiple strains on the individuals who have to go off on these courses and also on the Defence Forces in providing these courses.  I do not have solutions at this point, but we are aware of the issue.<\/p> <p>  The issue of an Air Corps contract relating to search and rescue will be dealt with by the time we report and, therefore, will have resolved itself one way or another.  I know that search and rescue is specifically mentioned among the 11 roles of the Defence Forces set out in the 2015 White Paper on Defence.<\/p> <p>  The Senator raised a broad issue that I have been thinking about recently.  On the one side there is the pull to the core military duties of the Defence Forces and on the other side a pull to using its capabilities in a way that benefits the people of the country generally in what we call aid to the civil authority, including search and rescue.  That tension is a big issue and the Senator is quite right to point it out.  We are thinking about it and, certainly, I am thinking about it.  It seems to be a very present and real issue.  I will leave it there.  I have tried to answer as far as I can.  I again apologise for not being able to indicate any conclusions or anything like that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021042000002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":631,"content":"<p>I thank Mr O'Driscoll for that.

I do not intend to go over questions other members have asked because we are quite short on time but I will start with a couple of background questions regarding the terms of reference.  Mr. O'Driscoll stated that the terms of reference set out a challenging range of issues that have been raised by the Government.  Given that he went on to say he does not think the commission will be able to address the huge range of staffing and HR issues, does he think the timeframe allocated to the commission for this piece of work is adequate?  If the commission is not able to address the HR and staffing issues, will it make a recommendation, as part of its report, on a practical alternative to address them in their totality?<\/p> <p>  On public consultation, there is mention in one of the briefing documents of sifting through the submissions and reviewing the responses.  Perhaps I misinterpreted this point and Mr. O'Driscoll may clarify it.  If the commission is close to the end of phase 1, the issue identification phase, how confident is Mr. O'Driscoll that all issues have been identified if the commission is still sifting through submissions?  Does that mean they have not been read or that they have not been graded?  Will Mr. O'Driscoll provide clarity on that?<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Driscoll also mentioned the webinar.  It was absolutely excellent and I agree with him that these webinars need to take place more often.  It was an extremely interesting event and one that should be repeated quite regularly.<\/p> <p>  To stay on the terms of reference for a moment, there are repeated statements on having regard to the level of funding provided by Government.  How does Mr. O'Driscoll see that affecting his job and the piece of work the commission is undertaking?  Are we to presume the commission will hold back on making recommendations on strategic advice because of it is constrained by budgeting issues or, perhaps, the political impact if it is seen to be asking for increased spending?  This is an area of significant concern because there must be a hierarchy of planning in terms of the flow of recommendations and plans.  Operational thinking comes after strategic planning.  Strategic planning comes after the long-term national plan.  The focus needs to be on that plan and it needs to take on board all recommendations by the commission, regardless of budgetary expenditure.  My fear is we could end up putting the cart before the horse.  We will not get the best value out of the potential of this commission if decisions are made before that national long-term goal is established.<\/p> <p>  I move on to international commitments and the overseas domain.  Will the commission examine the role of the Chief of Staff in respect of policy advice to the Government?  It is done in other Departments, in particular with direct advisory roles.  Is that something the commission will examine?<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Driscoll mentioned the search and rescue contract being done by the time this commission reports.  Is that also a factor in the work the commission is undertaking?  Is the fact that the contract will have gone out to tender limiting the view the commission will take on the future role of the Air Corps in search and rescue or top cover?  Again, that goes back to the original statement regarding the level of funding provided by the Government.<\/p> <p>  I am moving down through the terms of reference that are laid out and I will touch on cybersecurity.  There is no doubt higher priority needs to be given to cybersecurity and tackling cybercrime in Ireland.  This was a major aspect of that webinar.  We hold 30% of Europe's data due to international companies located here and there is a huge range of talent in that environment in the private sector.  The lack of appropriate information and communications technology, ICT, capabilities could make this a dangerous combination if it is not addressed and if structural policies are not put in place to do so.  Some &euro;3.5 billion has been lost to cybercrime, an absolutely phenomenal amount of money.  Is the commission looking at cybercrime and cybersecurity in terms of ultimate responsibility moving back to the Department of Defence and away from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications?<\/p> <p>  On the grade structure, the restructuring that took place in 2012 created significant imbalance and regional uncertainty, and that is far from suitable.  Nobody is happy with this as it stands, based on conversations I have had.  Given the level of understaffing and the lack of defence regional development, will the commission assess the return to a three-brigade structure and of a return to a brigade based in Westmeath?  Will the commission carry out a full review of the efficiencies, including assets and personnel, given as the reason for that restructuring in 2012?<\/p> <p>  I apologise because I know I am throwing questions at Mr. O'Driscoll left, right and centre but I move on to the Reserve.  An issue raised with me regularly is the lack of a permanent headquarters, HQ, for the Reserve that would facilitate training and development and encourage more activity within the Reserve.  One option that has been put out there is looking at one of the closed barracks as part of that restructuring.  It would be one that would be central, easily accessed from the motorways and from Dublin, the Curragh and the Glen of Imaal, that would have sufficient land for small- and large-scale exercises and access to training facilities for water-based activities.  Is that something the commission will examine?  Will the commission go on to examine the potential for overseas participation by reservists?  If so, what model is it looking at or what existing country has a system that may suit Ireland?<\/p> <p>  On retired members and veterans, is the commission looking at the potential for building on the relationship between the veterans and the Defence Forces, in terms of partaking in the Reserve, to give of their experience and expertise gained in a lifetime of service?  Senator Craughwell mentioned the training location and that location also has an impact on the Reserve and on the attractiveness of people coming into the Reserve, in hand with the Permanent Defence Force.<\/p> <p>  I move on to the remunerations systems and structures and that strategic perspective of HR.  Regarding grievances, be they gender, diversity or pay and conditions, one of the key aspects is representation.  It can play a fantastic role in stopping a complaint becoming much more serious if it is put in place at the start.  I refer to the case of Yvonne O'Rourke before the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, in December.  Discrimination against women due to pregnancy is not acceptable in society or in any structure.  Has the commission taken on board the recommendations from the WRC on anti-discrimination as part of its work?  Has it looked at the potential for specific strategies to address diversity and equality? <\/p> <p>  There needs to be an end to the current situation where public pay sector deals that affect current service members are negotiated and concluded with little or no input from representation bodies.  The most recent round of pay talks are exactly of the kind in which PDFORRA wanted to play a constructive role and it would have done so, had it been allowed to affiliate with ICTU, as per the European Social Charter.  There is reference to a pay review body in the context of the national public sector wage policy.  However, given that is an ask of other public sector groups, how does that mechanism not potentially undermine the current collective bargaining structure, should there be multiple demands for pay review bodies in different groups?  The current contracts of Defence Forces members are of significant importance and need to be reviewed in their entirety.  They are not fit for purpose and until they are, they will not be able to compete with the private sector in the labour market.<\/p> <p>  On recruitment, these contracts need to be dragged kicked and screaming into the 21st century.  They need to meet the asks of future employees and current service members.  On recruitment and retention, the long-term costs of losing personnel after training far outweigh the investment in retaining staff.  That has to be critical when we look at recruitment and retention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021042000002#E00100","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":633,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. O'Driscoll and the other members of the commission.  It is nice to see him again.  I echo Senator Craughwell's comment that in the past the Reserve Defence Force was visible in every town and village.  I was a member of the RDF for some years, as were a number of other members.  We took part in St. Patrick's Day parades and various events like that.  The Reserve Defence Force is held in high esteem both at home and abroad.  In the past, the RDF meant the Defence Forces were visible in every town and village and people knew about them.  From being involved in the RDF, I am aware of the change it made to young people who put on the uniform.  Their self-esteem increased dramatically when they achieved success.  It was the great leveller as well, in that everyone was equal when they put the uniform on.  It did not matter where a person came from or who they were - once they put the uniform on there was an equality there.  There was also the opportunity to move on.  As Senator Craughwell said, it acted as a recruitment body for the Permanent Defence Force.  Many members of the RDF got a taste for military life and joined the Permanent Defence Force afterwards.<\/p><p>The Naval Service is based very close to my own area.  Members of the service in particular and the Defence Forces in general are highly sought after by employers because of their skill set and discipline and the high regard in which they are held.  While I do not want to relate anecdotes, I have heard anecdotal evidence that when members of the Naval Service join certain companies, particularly in the southern region, they may be offered a bounty to persuade former colleagues in the Naval Service or people from the other services to leave and join their new company.  That is a positive in a way because the discipline, skill set and mindset of people in the Defence Forces is being spread out into society in a general way.  However, it is obviously a negative for the Defence Forces and the Naval Service especially.<\/p><p>I emphasise again the situation with the RDF.  On a slightly different but related issue, I note that the Canadian Cadet Organizations, as they are known, allow young people in Canada to get involved in military activities at a young age.  They can thus build up <i>esprit de corps<\/i>and morale, a bit like in the FCA in the past.  Perhaps the members of the commission will look at the Canadian Cadet Organizations and see if we can learn anything from what they are doing in that area.<\/p><p>The size of the RDF has been mentioned.  I note from some recent parliamentary questions that its strength is down to fewer than 1,500.  At establishment, its strength was 3,800 and at one stage it was about 15,000, so it is almost gone at this stage.  Consequently, we need to do some more work on that.<\/p><p>Will the commission examine employment protection legislation for members of the RDF who may go overseas?  For as long as I have been in the Houses, and indeed before, Members have been raising the possibility of RDF members going overseas.  The Minister indicated recently that people in the RDF who have specific skill sets, which are needed in the Permanent Defence Force, and have reached a certain level of competence and training could go overseas.  However, if an RDF member leaves a job here in civvy land to go overseas, who is to say the job will be available when he or she returns?  In other jurisdictions, employment protection legislation is in place for members of reserve forces.<\/p><p>Career progression, diversity and the number of women in the Defence Forces have been mentioned, so I will not go over all that again.<\/p><p>When members leave the Permanent Defence Force they sometimes go through hard times.  That may be a slight negative so I ask the commission to consider it at some stage, although the issue is slightly outside its terms of reference.  It is incumbent on us keep an eye on it because I am aware of members who have left and fallen on hard times.  I know there are organisations that do work in this area.<\/p><p>I wish Mr O'Driscoll and his fellow members of the commission well with their work and look forward to having them back when the report is finalised, or perhaps before that, for further engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021042000002#F00100","speaker":"1515"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":634,"content":"<p>A large number of issues have been raised, which I will endeavour to go through as best I can.<\/p> <p>  I am happy with the timeframe set for the commission.  I am a believer in getting on with things.  Long timeframes often do not work very well.  The Chairman and Deputy Stanton will recall that we completely transformed the Department of Justice in nine months.  Sometimes if one wants to get a job done, one needs to get on and get it done.  To address Deputy Clarke, when I said we would not get all the issues covered I meant that there is such a huge range of issues that the commission could be extended for another ten years and we would still be at it.  However, I take her point that at the end of our work, we may make suggestions that a certain bundle of issues should be dealt with in some way.  That would be quite sensible.<\/p> <p>  On issue identification and the consultation process, believe me, we will look through everything in the consultation process and see if we have missed issues in our initial issue identification and if we need to add to that.  We will definitely do that as thoroughly as we can.  To be perfectly frank, we have received at least twice as many submissions as we were expecting.  We are, therefore, a little overwhelmed with love but we will go through them.  The secretariat and some of the members are already doing that and I have been reading through them.  I thank the Deputy for her submission, which I have read, and for her comments on the webinar.<\/p> <p>  On funding, our terms of reference state we should have regard to the level of Government funding.  I am taking that at face value so we will have regard to it.  If one thinks about it, we would hardly make recommendations while completely ignoring the budgetary implications of what we were proposing.  We would not be foolish enough to do that.  We will have regard to the level of funding in another way, I think.  Again, we have not reached this point in our work yet but I guess we will have a look at the level of funding in this country compared with the funding of defence forces in other countries, as a contextual issue where funding is concerned.<\/p> <p>  On the role of the Chief of Staff, we are certainly looking at high-level command and control structures within the Defence Forces, and that includes the Chief-of-Staff role.  We are not looking at the totality of the relationship between the Department and the Defence Forces.  I know some people felt strongly that we should do that.  My view is that we have enough to do as it is.  There is another process in place, namely, an organisational capacity review within the Department.  I am familiar with those processes; they are quite demanding.  At some stage towards the end of our work, our process and the organisational review must have some sort of conversation.<\/p> <p>  On the search and rescue contract, it would not have been reasonable to expect the Department of Transport to postpone the contact in some way until we had finished our work.  That would not be realistic.  Life goes on.  A commission has been set up but the Defence Forces and the Department are making decisions every day as we continue our work.  That means that we are sometimes standing on moving sand but that is just life.  On that basis, I would not have expected the Department of Transport to defer the contract.  However, the issue of the role or potential role of the Air Corps in search and rescue is a live issue for us.  I will put it that way.<\/p> <p>  Cybersecurity is absolutely critical.  We have our national cybersecurity strategy.  The roles of the various bodies are set out in that strategy and they are also set out in the White Paper on Defence.<\/p><p>The cybersecurity strategy was produced in 2015 and updated in 2019.  The White Paper on Defence had the same timing so they are both very much in line.  They set out the policy decisions on the role of the various bodies.  The cybersecurity strategy sets out very clearly the interlinkage between cyber defence, which is broadly within the remit of the Defence Forces, overall cybersecurity which is the responsibility of the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, and cybercrime, which is primarily the concern of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These areas interlock and one could argue that everything should be put in one box but that is not always the best approach because one needs all of the skill sets that these bodies together bring.  We work within the policy framework that has been set out and will continue to do so but the committee can be absolutely assured that the cyber area will feature in a very significant way in our report.  <\/p><p> On the question of the Reserve, a number of issues were raised by Deputies Clarke and Stanton.  We do not have a mandate to cover veteran affairs as such so we cannot deal with issues pertaining to Defence Forces veterans.  While these are important issues, we will not be seeking a mandate on them because we have so much ground to cover as it stands.  However, we will be looking at the potential of the Reserve to recycle skills from people who are leaving the PDF.  Of course, that is one of the issues that arises in relation to the Reserve.  One of the key issues that people have raised with us is the potential of the Reserve to recruit in high-level specialist skills, particularly in the cyber space but also in medicine, engineering and a host of other areas.  This is a really important issue, although I do not want to prejudge our conclusions.  That said, this does not pull away from other potential roles for the Reserve in terms of providing surge capacity to the PDF.  A specialist role and a surge role are both being raised with us.  <\/p><p> I accept the point that the needs of the Reserve are different to those of the PDF in terms of location.  By its nature, the Reserve is spread all over the country but we have not broached that issue yet.  I have already spoken about the ICTU issue so I will not go back over that again.  The issue of the pay review body is beyond our terms of reference.  Our terms of reference do contain a comment on the process of moving from our work to the subsequent work of the pay review body, if and when it is established.  Competition with private sector pay and the loss of staff is a real issue but we are not going to get into the question of pay rates.  One of the problems we struggle with throughout the public service is that when we try to modernise in order to be a public service or a defence force of the 21st century, we train people to a high level in ICT, cyber and other areas and, of course, the moment they are trained, they become extremely valuable and can command very high salaries in the private sector.  To be frank, that is a struggle for us all but it is a particular struggle for the Defence Forces, undoubtedly.  The issue can be addressed in a variety of ways, including by making the Defence Forces an attractive place to be.  One of the things I have found, having spoken to members of the Defence Forces, is that they do have a strong culture of wanting to be in and to stay in the Defence Forces, and we can work with that.  Ultimately, we must provide conditions that people find attractive.  That speaks to pay, with which we cannot deal but it also speaks to other issues of conditions, particularly issues of career progression which are very important in the context of encouraging people to stay.  <\/p><p> Employment protection was referred to by Deputy Stanton in the context of the Reserve and that issue has also been raised with us.  We have received submissions from ICTU and IBEC to our consultation and there may be grounds there for some discussion with those bodies.  That said, we cannot negotiate or anything like that because we do not have that authority but we can make recommendations in this space.  Deputy Stanton also mentioned the gain to industry from turnover in the Defence Forces.  This is something I am personally familiar with through my family.  It must be borne in mind that people who leave the Defence Forces are not lost to the country.  If they have particular skills, those skills are lost to the Defence Forces, which feel that loss but I have no doubt that the result is some very able people moving into Irish industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021042000002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":636,"content":"<p>Deputy Berry is next, to be followed by Deputy Lawless.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021042000002#G00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":637,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. O'Driscoll and his team.  It is great that they are here.  I am a big supporter of the commission and the work it is doing.  I am hearing nothing but positive reports on the level of engagement, and the fact that there have been over 500 submissions tells its own story.  People are very interested in defence matters and the Defence Forces, and want to be involved in finding solutions.  I very much agree that this commission is about capability development and that is exactly how it should be.  To me, the most important element or component of capability is people.  A weapon is only as good as the man or woman holding it and a ship is only as good as its crew.  I am sure everyone is familiar with that argument.  This is all about solving the people issues and technology is a bonus that comes afterwards.<\/p><p>I totally accept what Mr. O'Driscoll has said about pay in terms of the commission not being allowed to venture into the area of rates of pay.  I have a number of questions for the witnesses, some of which are related to the principle or the concept of pay rather than the rates<i>per se<\/i>.  My first question relates to the principle of paying overtime to military personnel.  We know that if prison officers, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or nurses, for example, do shift work, they get paid overtime.  If staff work harder and longer, they get paid more.  That is a generally accepted principle across both the private and public sectors.  I would like to hear the witnesses' thoughts on whether overtime could or should be paid to military personnel.  That would certainly solve a lot of the pay issues because I do not think, to be fair, that people have an issue with the core or basic pay but with the additional hours they have to work for almost a pittance.  <\/p><p>My second question relates to the principle or structure of pay in the context of the national minimum wage, the legislation for which came into effect in 2000.  There has not really been a review of the structure of Defence Forces pay since the Gleeson commission in 1990.  I am interested to hear the witnesses' thoughts on that.  I am of the view that the Defence Forces is obligated to pay at least the national minimum wage, like every other employer in the State, both public and private.  Is there any way we can incorporate the provisions of that legislation, in a very efficient way, into the pay structures of the Defence Forces?  <\/p><p>My next question relates to the outstanding pay awards that have yet to be honoured by the State.  Again, I totally appreciate that the witnesses cannot comment on rates of pay or even analyse them.  However, surely some pay awards that have already been approved, balloted on and accepted by both the State and the representative associations should be considered.  This is an issue that the commission could consider including in its report, that is, a paragraph to the effect that all outstanding awards should be paid.  When I say &quot;outstanding awards&quot;, I am talking about the technical pay award for groups 2 to 6, the Army Ranger wing allowances and the specialised instructors' allowance.  A catch-all sentence or statement explicitly stating that those terms should be honoured would have a sea-change effect across the Defence Forces overnight.  I urge the commission to consider including same in its report.  <\/p><p>A lot of those pay awards come from the conciliation and arbitration system, where an adjudicator makes an adjudication.  As the witnesses will be aware, the Defence Forces family is not entitled to go before the Labour Court.  As a general rule, when the Labour Court issues rulings the Government accepts them and pays accordingly.  I would like to hear the witnesses' thoughts on whether the status of the Labour Court should be afforded to the adjudicator, from a conciliation and arbitration point of view.<\/p><p>If that was included from a structural perspective, it would also have a transformative effect downstream.<\/p><p> The independent peer review body, whether we like it or not, is part of Government policy outlined in the programme for Government.  I acknowledge it is a subsequent piece in which Mr. O'Driscoll is not specifically involved but the process towards it is covered in the terms of reference.  What would the independent peer review body look like to Mr. O'Driscoll?  When will it be established?  Does Mr. O'Driscoll see it being established in January of next year or will it be synchronised with the pay talks later in 2022?  What are his thoughts on that?<\/p><p> My last two questions have to do with implementation.  I have no doubt that Mr. O'Driscoll's report will be excellent.   All the views I have heard so far have been very positive.  It is like all those excellent reports that have been previously written by so many different organisations.  We have a habit, and it is not just an Irish habit but probably is an international pastime, of writing wonderful reports that gather dust on shelves.  What are Mr. O'Driscoll's thoughts on implementation?  Will there be a requirement to establish a separate implementation body to ensure that the wonderful findings of the commission's report will be implemented in full?  All we have to do is look at the White Paper to see that is not always the case.<\/p><p> To finish on a positive, could this committee do anything to assist Mr. O'Driscoll and his team in their work?  We could very easily review the implementation of the commission's report on a six-monthly basis, for instance.  From a political perspective, is there anything we could do to assist Mr. O'Driscoll's work?  It is hugely important and it is a watershed in the history of the Defence Forces.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman.  I thank Mr. O'Driscoll and his team and wish them the very best of luck in the rest of their work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021042000002#G00300","speaker":"1587","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":639,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses from the commission here today.  I will focus on the second point in the terms of reference that refers to \"the appropriate balance and disposition of personnel and structures across a joint force approach in the land, air, maritime, cyber, intelligence and space domains\".  That brings it into my own area of interest, particularly the cyber domain.  I see it as cybersecurity, telecommunications security and maritime security but I would also add climate security.  I do not know if it is in the terms of reference at present but climate security and volatility around climate are matters we must consider as part of our defences in every sense going forward.  I put forward those four areas of climate security, cybersecurity, telecommunications security and maritime security.  They are actually separate and distinct.  While telecoms security has an overlap with cybersecurity, I do not believe it is the same thing.  Cybersecurity can encompass attacks, denial-of-service attacks, hacking and all sorts of different interference involved with taking down various public or even private services, whereas telecoms security can be intercepting.  We had a discussion at this committee a few weeks ago, for example, about submarine cables being intercepted off the west coast.  That can be telecoms security, which can be different to cyber security.  They are separate and distinct but related.  As I said, maritime security is also linked and I would put climate security into the mix as well.<\/p> <p>  In terms of how Mr. O'Driscoll proposes to approach those topics within the commission, I listened to some of the contributions before me and I believe Deputy Berry or somebody else touched on how retention can be an issue.  It can but it can work two ways.  There can be quite strong synergies.<\/p> <p>  I worked in IT in a previous life and I was privileged to work with a number of former Defence Forces officers.  Typically, they came from the old systems and signals corps.  Some of them served abroad in the Lebanon and elsewhere but all of them had very strong capabilities.  When they came back to Ireland or left the Defence Forces, they went out to work with private industry, some as consultants and some in different roles.  They were really strong, capable people who I was delighted to have the privilege to work with in the past.  That said to me there was a synergy.  I do not think people were necessarily being poached by the private sector.  They had served their time and perhaps done 20 years or more and were happy to move on.  They had given their contribution and done the State some service.  There was nothing wrong with them moving on at that point.  It was a good training ground, however.<\/p> <p>  Along those lines, there may be synergies around that being a natural movement of people, which we could do here.  It could actually enable us to grow our economic offering, as well as our defence offering, in terms of working in partnership and looking at career paths that span both sectors over a lifetime.  There is also an opportunity for academic university courses or placements and hosting centres of excellence in those areas.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned at the outset the areas of cybersecurity, telecoms security, maritime security and climate security.  I can see a scenario where Ireland becomes a centre of excellence with academic and Defence Forces expertise with that then spilling over into a wider private sector pool of knowledge that really strengthens our economic offering and our own output.  I put that out there as something of significant interest.  I believe the synergy is there.  In the past, the Defence Forces have done that well.  I would like to see that really brought to the fore in this.  It is only going to be more important, over and above more conventional methods, as we go forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021042000002#H00200","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":640,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Lawless.  Before going back to Mr. O'Driscoll, I will briefly throw two points into the mix.  In his opening address, Mr. O'Driscoll mentioned that he will look at the structure of each of the three services in the light of current experience and then, taking into consideration what some members have said about the complexity of ongoing issues and cybersecurity in particular, also will look at international comparisons, given the size of Ireland's Defence Forces is relatively small.  Would consideration be given or does Mr. O'Driscoll regard it as being within his terms of reference to look beyond each of the three services of land, air and sea and talk about an amalgamation of the services into a defence force rather than the current Defence Forces?<\/p> <p>  Second, I will follow on from a point by Deputy Berry, who is quite right when he speaks of a defence force being only as good as its people.  That is taken as a given.  We need to acknowledge that there are some morale issues.  I believe Deputy Clarke spoke about a family-friendly environment and the need to ensure that the people who form the services have appropriate infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  My constituency is not too far away from the Curragh Camp.  I know it is in Deputy Berry's constituency but it is the Army base I certainly know best over the past number of decades as a serving public representative, where people move from my constituency and actually live in the Curragh.  As for the physical surrounds of the Curragh Camp, it is the largest base for serving members of the Defence Forces.  The need for an overall land-use plan and the need to improve the built environment and have a land-use policy for the built environment and beyond will require a capital investment.  This has been mooted in the past with only limited success.  Obviously, it is not something that could be undertaken by the Department of Defence, or indeed, as a major project on the part of the Office of Public Works.  It needs to be looked at and done, however.  It seems to me that the commission might be an opportunity to dig deeper into how this might be undertaken.<\/p> <p>  Only yesterday, the Department of Rural and Community Development announced multimillion euro funding for rural regeneration in small towns, some of which are smaller than the population base of the Curragh Camp and some of which are larger.  Mr. O'Driscoll will be aware of the LEADER programme, again, multimillion euro investments, from his time in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Then, there are urban renewal and town and village renewal schemes.  None of these, however, seem to encompass the type of investment that to my view is needed in the Curragh to enhance the environment or infrastructure for the many families who live there or who will, perhaps, move there on various courses, as was mentioned earlier by Senator Craughwell.  How best can we ensure the appropriate level of necessary investment or the joining together of various agencies or Departments that might be in a position to assist on that?  Does Mr. O'Driscoll have any view on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021042000002#H00300","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":641,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the Deputies.  I will take the questions in the order they were asked.  Members will have to forgive me.  Deputy Berry has already decided that we are going to do a wonderful report, which is good.  I will take that and also thank him for his comments on the level of engagement.  I mentioned that many of us believe there is insufficient public debate and engagement in this country on security and defence issues.  Through our public consultation, the webinar and so on, we are deliberately trying to provoke debate and discussion, which we hope will have an impact beyond the commission.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy put a series of questions to me and I do not want to dodge them.  I do not like doing that but, frankly, all of them are related to pay.  That poses a particular difficulty for me because we do not have a remit on pay rates and so on.  On the working time directive and overtime, again, we are keeping an eye on that.  I do not rule out that we might have something to say but it will not relate to the issue of pay and overtime rates.  The Deputy also invited us to comment on pay awards already made and so on.  We will probably decline to do so as it is not really our role.  We are not dealing with those kinds of pay issues, which arise in any case.<\/p> <p>  On the independent pay review body, I cannot answer the Deputy's question.  It is a question for the Department of Defence and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as to when the independent pay review body will be established and what will be its relationship to pay talks.  We will not be dealing with that area.<\/p> <p>  On implementation and the idea of an implementation body, this issue has been raised with us.  Unsurprisingly, people have quoted at me the implementation process around the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, which is overseen by a committee that I helped establish and chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach.  That process lies in that place because a whole range of Departments is involved.  One of the things many people do not understand is that the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland was not just dealing with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It was dealing with policing in its broadest definition, including social services and so on that deal with people who get themselves involved in criminal activity and all of that.  There is a range of Departments involved.  I was involved with the Secretary General to the Government in establishing an interdepartmental structure reporting on that to the Department of the Taoiseach for that reason.  I am not ruling anything in or out.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the assistance the committee can give, it is giving it today by raising the issues members have raised.  Also, as I said, I welcome the submissions that have been made by members of this committee, the political parties and other public representatives.  We are well aware that members hear stuff and we are receiving material on the same issues and it is interesting and helpful to triangulate that somewhat.  <\/p> <p>  When we do our report in December the next step is for the Government to decide what it wants to do with it.  The first question is whether the Government accepts, rejects or accepts part of the report.  The second question, insofar as the Government accepts it, as I hope it will, is how it proposes to go about implementing it.  That is what would normally come out of any such commission report.  The Government might ask the committee to review implementation every six months, as members suggest, or the committee may take its own decision in that regard.  I am sure it is within its authority to do so.  Implementation will not be the commission's responsibility.  Our job is to do the report and make our recommendations.  We do not, correctly, have any capacity to implement.  That rests with our elected representatives.  In fact, it rests with Members of the Oireachtas and the Government they choose.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Lawless raised a number of interesting questions in respect of cybersecurity and maritime, climate and telecommunications security.  I agree with him.  There is a big range of issues here.  We have a number of security experts within the commission and we have had discussions with the national security analysis centre, which is based in the Department of the Taoiseach.  We have discussed some of those issues and what is very clear is that the landscape is becoming much more complex than it was even a few years ago.  The ground is shifting very fast.  Every organisation engaged in this area has to develop the capabilities to deal with these matters, and that is very true of the Defence Forces.  This is a major focus for us in our work.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that issues of climate also arise.  I referenced that briefly in my opening statement.  Climate change impacts on everything but it is also a source of instability.  This country will be affected by climate events that we would not otherwise have affected us.  More broadly, some of the poorest countries in the world will be deeply affected by climate change and that will have an effect on migration, terrorism and all kinds of issues in those countries.  We are an island geographically but we are not an island when it comes to issues of security, which are global issues now.<\/p> <p>   Deputy Lawless also raised a question, one that I touched on earlier, of looking at the issue of turnover from the other perspective, in other words, the benefits to industry and so on from highly skilled people moving out of the Defence Forces.  It is a tug of love.  The Defence Forces desperately want these highly skilled people to stay in the Defence Forces and need their skills.  They are extremely valuable to Irish industry when they leave.  I do not doubt that but we have to find a balance.  We cannot have a situation where the Defence Forces are just training people who immediately kick on and leave.  The Deputy made the interesting point that people are trained and they then do the job, serve their time in the Defence Forces and move on.  There is a natural balance there in people's careers that I can understand.<\/p> <p>  To turn to the matters raised by the Chairman, the point about having the three services in one service is very interesting.  In my opening statement I spoke briefly about jointness.  It is a major feature of all modern defence force strategies that I have examined.  It means exactly that the traditional focus on land, sea, air is, for the reasons we have just discussed, no longer sufficient.  More and more threats and attacks come from hybrid sources which may incorporate cyber, space, land, sea and air and we have to be capable of dealing with the complexity of all of that.  Much greater jointness in defence forces is a feature of strategies in other countries and is something we will definitely examine.<\/p> <p>  I take the Chairman's point also on creating a family friendly environment for the Defence Forces.  This is an issue that relates to our desire to have a better gender balance in the Defence Forces but it affects young men also.  There are a number of challenges in that regard.  Some come from the multiple locations of the Defence Forces and some from the training courses that last for six months that I talked about, while others come from overseas deployments.  We cannot throw all of that out the window and say we will not do any of that because we want to be family friendly.  We still have to do the core jobs of the Defence Forces but the question is whether we can find a more family friendly way of doing these things.  I am aware the Defence Forces are very conscious of this issue and are looking at it.  It has been raised with us.  As we go around the barracks, we meet staff in all the different ranks but we also meet staff informally in age groups.  We meet younger staff and more experienced staff and we gets a somewhat different read from the different groups.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman is correct about land use and so forth.<\/p><p>The Defence Forces have 20,000 acres of land, mainly at the Curragh, the Glen of Imaal and Kilworth Camp.  There are 14 permanently-occupied locations and four rented properties around the country.  It is a very dispersed estate, which was largely inherited from the British.  Many of these barracks and other buildings are showing their age.  I visited the Curragh on Good Friday and met with some colleagues from the commission.  It was possible to see even there that the buildings have aged.  I also met a lot of sheep.  It is an unusual situation, but I take the point.  I do not think that the commission will be doing a detailed land-use plan and I do not think we have the capabilities to carry out a survey of all the buildings or anything like that.  I hope, however, that we will have something useful to say in that space.  I am going to leave it at that, if I may.  I hope I have made a good attempt to answer the huge range of questions posed.  That reflects the great range of issues raised with us in the public consultation and in our meetings with staff associations and other groups.  I propose to stop here, unless the Chair would like me to say some final words.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2021042000002#J00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":643,"content":"<p>No, that is fine.

Joining me today are Mr. Damien McCallion, national lead for Covid-19 vaccinations, Dr. Lucy Jessop, director of public health, national immunisation office, and Professor Martin Cormican, chairperson, clinical support group.<\/p> <p>  I will make a brief opening statement on the current situation with the vaccination programme.  Regarding our overall objectives, it is important to restate our objectives for the programme, which are to reduce hospitalisations and mortality through vaccination of the most vulnerable groups and to vaccinate the largest number of people possible in the general population.  <\/p> <p>  Significant achievements have been made by the HSE.  As of this week, more than 1.2 million vaccines have been administered, comprising the administration of 850,000 first dose vaccines and 350,000 second dose vaccines.  I am delighted to report that the majority of residents in long-term residential care facilities have substantially completed their vaccination.  In addition, front-line healthcare workers and people over 70 years of age have largely received their first dose or are due to do so this week.  We are also well advanced with the vaccination of the very high-risk patients in our hospitals, with over 90,000 vaccinations completed, and we will commence the vaccination of the remainder of those high-risk patients in the community from next week.  Vaccinators in this phase have included those in hospital vaccination teams, community vaccination teams, vaccination centres, the National Ambulance Service and general practice.  I acknowledge the work of all these staff and those supporting them in the background for their efforts during what have been challenging times. <\/p> <p>  On supply, we are continuously adjusting our integrated operational plans to align with the updated allocation sequencing and confirmation of supply schedules.  Despite many challenges, the HSE has adhered to the Government&rsquo;s principle of ensuring all available vaccine supplies are administered.  We are regularly administering 95% of available vaccine within seven days of delivery.  There has been variability between manufacturers, which can cause complications to our operations team.  We have faced continual challenges, with changes in supply volumes and delivery dates, but we continue to work to meet our targets in this regard.<\/p> <p>  On the vaccination plan, clinical oversight and guidance are at the centre of directing the roll-out of the vaccination programme to ensure vaccines can be administered safely, efficiently and effectively.  Our ongoing planning and roll-out includes operating models for general practitioners, GPs, hospitals, community vaccination teams, the National Ambulance Service, pharmacies and vaccination centres, alongside the corresponding ICT, infrastructure and recruitment mobilisation.  We have faced many planning challenges with changes in supply, cohort definitions and clinical guidance in relation to specific vaccines.  Last week, we also had to readjust due to the decision by Janssen to pause delivery of its vaccine product.  We are also about to enter another planning cycle this week with the more positive news on increased supply of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.<\/p> <p>  Regarding vaccination centres, 37 such centres have been agreed and the infrastructure is in place for these centres.  More than 19 of these centres are already operating for specific patient cohorts, and this will increase to 26 over the remainder of this week.  Staffing is in place and those centres already operating have been working well and with good feedback from the public.  The remaining centres will open over the coming weeks as the necessary supply and demand processes are put in place.  Online registration opened last week for those aged between 65 and 69 years who will have their vaccine administered through the vaccination centres using the AstraZeneca vaccine and that process has gone very smoothly to date.  The first appointments have already been offered to those who registered.<\/p> <p>  We have seen early evidence of the positive impact of the vaccination programme.  This is illustrated through reduced mortality, reduced incidence of the disease and reduced hospitalisations.  This is particularly evident in the most vulnerable groups who are the initial priority for the programme.  The virus and its impacts on society remain largely unpredictable and, as such, the need for proactive monitoring and flexible planning will always be a feature of our response.  We continue to adjust our vaccination plan every time a change is required and we will continue to be as agile as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021042000002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":658,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Henry.

NIAC was established in 1995 at the request of the Department of Health as a voluntary committee within the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, RCPI.  It has provided advice on immunisation across the ages from infancy to adulthood, on matters such as the human papillomavirus, HPV, vaccination programme and the meningitis and influenza vaccines.  NIAC also develops and publishes guidelines for immunisations in Ireland, which are implemented by the HSE and co-ordinated by the national immunisation office.  NIAC also advocates for best immunisation practices through the widespread dissemination of information to healthcare providers and other stakeholders, including the public.<\/p> <p>  The 22-member committee is made up of a wide range of experts, including representatives from the RCPI, its faculties and institutes, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, the national immunisation office, the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI, the Infectious Disease Society of Ireland, IDSI, the Travel Medicine Society of Ireland, TMSI, the National Virus Reference Laboratory, NVRL, and lay members.  Meetings are also attended by representatives from the Department of Health, the HSE and the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA.  NIAC members regularly participate in meetings of the World Health Organization, WHO, and European advisory bodies on immunisation.  <\/p> <p>  It may be helpful to outline the process through which NIAC considers new evidence and provides recommendations.  The Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health formally asks the committee to consider a question about immunisation.  Since the start of the pandemic, NIAC has considered numerous questions and issued advice to the CMO to inform the Department of Health&rsquo;s immunisation policy, which is then implemented by the HSE.  I have provided a background document detailing the processes that NIAC undertakes, such as reviewing emerging evidence and seeking additional input from a wide range of stakeholders, including medical experts in specialist areas, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and the vaccine task force.  Thus, all relevant considerations are taken into account, together with the scientific evidence on which recommendations are based.  Safety is always a priority.<\/p> <p>  This workload has been significant in recent months.  There has been some concern when new recommendations are made or changed.  It is important to remember that we are dealing with a disease that is only just one year old and, amazingly, we have highly effective vaccines to provide protection against Covid-19.  New evidence about these vaccines is being published almost daily.  As vaccine development and roll-out have been more rapid than ever previously experienced, it is to be expected that there would be many changes to any recommendations, similar to what was seen during the 2009 pandemic.  Then, however, we had only two new vaccines to combat that outbreak.<\/p> <p>  In 2021, with an infection of even greater consequence, greater understanding, adaptability and agility are required to ensure that the safest, most effective course is steered.  The goal is to safely protect our population from hospitalisation and death.  We need to balance the known very significant risks of Covid-19 against any vaccine safety concerns that may emerge, while weighing in how other measures can reduce the risk of Covid-19, including the use of alternate vaccines.<\/p> <p>  The guidelines are amended to give the best possible advice on all available evidence at the time, while bearing in mind the safety and well-being of the individual and the population.  I reiterate that NIAC is not involved in the implementation of the vaccination policy or in the roll-out of the vaccines.  It is an independent advisory committee, which provides advice to the Chief Medical Officer on immunisation.<\/p><p>Final decisions on the prioritisation groups and other aspects of the vaccination programme lie with the Department of Health and the Government.<\/p><p> NIAC acknowledges the significant support of our voluntary members and the collaborations with and by all involved in the vaccination programme in pursuing a common goal of reducing deaths and severe illness from Covid-19.  Through maintaining confidence in a high-quality vaccination programme, we can maximise vaccine uptake and reap societal benefits. <\/p><p>I thank members for their attention.

We have, therefore, done additional training for vaccinators and are reminding them how to find the muscle when they are injecting.  The advice, however, is not to draw back on the syringe to see if one has hit a blood vessel, as the Deputy was talking about in Denmark.  It is not something that I am aware has been recommended.

This is what was suggested by him.  I am not sure what the witnesses' reaction to that is but this is what was put out to the public when Dr. Campbell was being interviewed.

Yes, women who are pregnant are not at more increased risk of getting an infection but they are at increased risk of adverse outcomes.

What has happened over time is, particularly for the ribonucleic acid, RNA, vaccines, there have been increasing use of those vaccines in pregnancy such that now there is an accumulating amount of information on them and on their safety in pregnancy related to that, insofar as they still rely on a passive reporting system.

Variants of concern have a very particular definition.  Mutations happen all the time in the world of virology.  Many have no consequences while some do.  We define variants of concern as those mutations that are associated with either increased transmissibility of the virus, increased aggressive ability to cause illness or virus resistance - a decrease in the effectiveness of public health measures, including vaccination.  Of the two variants in question at this point in time, P1 and B1351 from South Africa, there is some evidence of reduced neutralising antibody response when people have been vaccinated but the vaccines are still effective to a large degree against serious illness and hospitalisation, so it is a mixed story of immunological response and ability to prevent serious illness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021042000002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":826,"content":"<p>As the Deputy noted, variants do come along from time to time.  It is often difficult to predict exactly how a variant will respond to the vaccine but it is a concern.  The HSE agrees that it is important to have an emphasis on reducing the chance of variants that might escape from the vaccination being introduced.  We are very much more comfortable that there are better controls on that in place than was the case previously.  The risk of that in some respects becomes greater because as more of the population is vaccinated, the advantage that a variant which could escape the vaccine has becomes greater, so it is really important that we are in a position to control that.<\/p> <p>  The other point that is important in respect of variants is that variants do not just happen in other countries.  They can happen anywhere so the continued work of our public health colleagues and all of the initiatives the public is supporting to keep the number of cases down are also important in reducing the risk that a virus variant might start here.  Every time the virus copies itself, there is some level of risk that it will change so if we have thousands of people here getting infected every day, there is a greater chance that a variant that will cause us trouble will arise here but if we keep the number of people who are getting infected here lower, the chance of us getting a variant arising here that will cause us concern is lower.  It involve two parts.  One is trying to reduce the risk of it coming in and there are controls in place around that.  The other thing that remains important is keeping the number of infections in this country as low as we can reasonably and practicably manage because it could start here just as it could start in any other country.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021042000002#G00800","nonspeaker":"Professor Martin Cormican"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":827,"content":"<p>My second question concerns extending the period between administering vaccines.  Obviously, the temporary suspension of the AstraZeneca and the Janssen vaccines has slightly skewed vaccine roll-out.  It seems that the Pfizer vaccine has been and will be the dominant vaccine for those who choose to be inoculated.  With regard to the Pfizer vaccine, it is recommended that there should be 21 days between the first and second doses.  What is NIAC's recommendation if it goes beyond 21 days?  Other countries have done this, in particular Britain, which has extended the period up to ten weeks.  It looks like this Government could probably do something similar with regard to the Pfizer vaccine.  What are NIAC's recommendations regarding the time space between the first and second doses?  Pfizer says it should be 21 days but there is a possibility that this could be doubled or tripled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021042000002#G00900","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":828,"content":"<p>This is, again, a very important question because we want to know the most effective way to use our vaccines in the community.  The vaccine is authorised for an interval of up to six days.  The initial recommended schedule was 21 days.  It is currently being used on a 28-day schedule.  If we extend the interval, the potential benefit is that one gets some vaccine into more people.  We have seen that in the UK, that has contributed significantly to the reduction in hospitalisation and its overall early effectiveness rate has been around 70%.  What is the downside to doing that?  The downside is that one is not getting the maximum protection and a situation might arise where there is a level of partial immunity that might favour the emergence of resistant mutants, particularly if one has got ones that need the highest level of immunity.  It is about trying to balance those competing benefits and risks to see what is the best schedule.  The question is also whether we need to think about it depending on what the overall supplies of the Pfizer vaccine might be and what the impact on the programme will be because, again, any stretching out of those intervals will necessarily lengthen the time to get everyone fully vaccinated but there may be a point that is reasonable that gives a benefit without compromise.  It is an important question.  Where do we get the data from?  Most of the early studies involved looking at the efficacy of a single dose.  It was done at that very short interval before a second dose was given with the exception of the UK because that was really the only place that went to the 12-week interval.  They have updated on a monthly basis their effectiveness data.  It was still rather short-term but a report should come out at the end of this month - it usually comes out at about the 22nd or 23rd day of the month - to see if there are any problems with extending that interval or if it is something that is safe and might be beneficial.<\/p><p>Again, it depends on the level of supplies and the overall need.

I wish to put a number of points to Dr. Colm Henry and he decide to re-assign some of those.  I represent County Clare and many people in the county are being vaccinated at the Radisson Hotel, which is located on the Clare-Limerick border.  The mid-west vaccination team has been sending text messages out to people notifying them that it is their turn to get the all-important jab.  I hope Dr. Henry can see the message - I have printed out what the text message states because it is extremely casual.  It comes from an 086 number.  It asks the people to please reply \"Yes\" or \"No\" as to whether they can attend.  They are also asked to bring ID along with the text on their phone as proof of appointment and to ring the number between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. with any queries.  The message is very casual.  Many people believe it to be phoney, a fake text or a scam and they are not replying to it, which means they are losing out on key appointments.  This is happening repeatedly at the local vaccination centre.  The message lacks all formality.  I explained to some HSE staff that in this day and age people receive text messages from their banks, supermarkets and all sorts of companies and entities that look more formal.  There is such important work going on at the Radisson Hotel and it is wonderful.  We thank those involved for what they are doing, but this text message lacks all formality.  As a result of the latter, hundreds of people are not opting to text back and are losing out on their appointments.  It is a basic issue to which I would draw Dr. Henry's attention if he is not already aware of it.  I ask that he examine regularising the position in this regard as a matter of urgency and ensure that there is some structure put onto that message.

I can understand why the Deputy is asking that question.  The 60s to 70s age cohort, particularly, has concerns and feel they are singled out for what they might perceive as a less safe vaccine.  Part of that has arisen from a misunderstanding of the messaging when AstraZeneca was first restricted from the over-70s.  The reason it was held at that stage in the beginning did not arise from any safety concerns whatsoever.  It was simply that there had been a very small number in that age group in the original trials of AstraZeneca.  In the phase 2, 3 and 4 trials there were only about 222 individuals over 70 years of age.  It was for that reason, while waiting for more information to come out, that in the beginning it was recommended that the mRNA vaccines be given preferentially to the over-70s.<\/p> <p>  This was coupled with the fact that as we get older our immune systems do not always respond so well.  We wanted to make sure that the vaccines were equally effective in older age groups.  That data then came out from Scotland and the UK.  Thus, the advice from NIAC was revised to state that these vaccines could be used across all age groups.  There are no concerns about the safety of AstraZeneca in those older age groups.<\/p><p>However, somehow that has not translated into common public knowledge.  It was felt there was a danger at the older ages and now we are saying that perhaps they are less safe in the lower age group, so that middle age group is feeling a little squeezed.  It is about trying to get that information out and realising that there were never any safety concerns there.  In fact, we have said, in terms of the 60 year age group and even, perhaps, the 50 year group, that really has been redirected out of an abundance of caution, a phrase that has become hackneyed in a way, but that is what it is.  What one wanted to see was that a very wide safety margin was being maintained.  We know that the risk of Covid-19 for somebody aged 60 years is 84 times the risk of anything associated with the vaccine.  That is not just the risk of Covid-19 in somebody who contracts it, that is the risk for somebody who is of that age in the population taking into account the risk of acquiring it and the risk of what happens after one gets it.<\/p><p> I understand where people are coming from, but it is about trying to inform them so they may feel confident in that.  We are aligned with many other countries in Europe in taking those age cut-offs, be they around 60 years of age.  We know the UK has taken a much lower age cut-off, but it must be said that it was at a different stage in its pandemic as well.  We also have to take into account the availability of alternative vaccines.

My question is similar to Deputy Durkan's.  I was contacted by a lady this morning who knows I am a member of this committee.  She asked me to ask a question on behalf of her husband who is younger than 60 years and is part of the vulnerable cohort.  He received the first dose of AstraZeneca and she made it quite clear that he will not take the second dose.  Can he get another vaccine?  I explained in the best way I could, as a layperson, the evidence relating to clotting, that there were very small numbers and a small percentage and the facts about the people who got the first dose.  Her reply was that she knows the science, but that he is not taking the second dose of AstraZeneca.  That is my first question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021042000002#L00300","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":894,"content":"<p>First, I should point out that even after one dose of AstraZeneca vaccine, once about 21 days have elapsed, people are very well protected for at least a few months and probably longer.  That is why we had the confidence in being able, for some, to stretch out that interval from 12 to 16 weeks while we got more information and protected against the severest forms of disease and hospitalisation.  The good part is that the lady's husband has already had a dose of vaccine.  That is very helpful.  For someone in his position in terms of his high-risk status, the risk from Covid-19 many times outweighs any potential risk associated with the vaccine.  Even given his age, he is at the lower end of whatever small risk there might be.<\/p> <p>  Regarding other vaccines, there simply are no data yet, although they will be coming out, as to whether what is called a mix-match or using a different vaccine is effective or even, perhaps, advantageous.  Quite simply, we do not have that data at present.  Studies are taking place in the UK which are likely to report over the next month.  Similarly, France and Germany, which decided to go that route, will be getting information.  That information will be emerging over time.  Now, however, the best advice for somebody such as that man is that he would get his second dose of AstraZeneca.  He would not be scheduled yet because the second doses are not scheduled until the first week in May or so.  His risk from Covid-19 far exceeds any risk related to the vaccine.  All we can do is inform and try to share the information with people, but we must respect the fact that they ultimately can make decisions for themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021042000002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Karina Butler"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":895,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Butler.

I have come across a 96-year-old lady who lives in sheltered housing in my constituency.  There are ten others over 60 years old who are in similar accommodation.  I have contacted the National Ambulance Service to try to get them vaccinated.  Unfortunately, these people are falling through the cracks.  They are at an age where they should have been vaccinated very early, but have not been.  I am not sure where or how they are falling through the cracks.  If there are other people who are housebound, is it their GPs or their families who should be making the calls to the National Ambulance Service in this case to get the vaccination?<\/p> <p>  Finally, I presume that for pharmacists and dentists who get the call to be part of the vaccination team that it would be through the portal as well.  Somebody would be sent to Joe Bloggs, pharmacist, at 11 o'clock Wednesday week, for example.  It will be the same type of procedure and it will be done through the portal.

As I explained earlier, for the housebound the system is working closely with the GP community, which is best placed to identify the people who cannot travel to a GP surgery for the over 70 years vaccine scheme.  We have not been able to approach it with the same strict age-based incremental approach as we did with those who go to the GP surgery simply because the vaccine is a multi-dose vial.  The National Ambulance Service has to deliver it and the vaccine, once reconstituted, must be used within five or six hours.  Some of it is somewhat geographically based in the sense that the National Ambulance Service has to assess who needs it in a particular area and schedule the vaccinations on a particular day.  It must factor into this not just the administration but also the lifespan of the vaccine after it has been reconstituted and the need to monitor the patient for at least 15 minutes after the vaccine.  We urge anybody who has not yet heard to inform his or her GP.  The GPs are informing us in turn of those patients who cannot go to their primary care centres for vaccination.  We will leave nobody behind, and that has been our commitment from the beginning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021042000002#L01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":901,"content":"<p>On the second part of the question, GPs are currently involved in vaccinating the over 70 year olds and moving on to the second dose.  We have worked out agreements with the GP leadership on GPs also assisting us with regard to very high-risk and high-risk patients.  As I said, we do not have national disease registries so most people with the majority of conditions, although not all of them, are known to general practice.  That scheduling is done locally and through GPs.  If people are in doubt about that, the HSE website gives details of the criteria for inclusion in both the very high-risk and high-risk categories.  People will be called.  They do not need to contact their general practitioner or hospital as they will be called through that process.<\/p><p> We are still working through the model of how people will be assigned to pharmacists.  As stated earlier, the model for pharmacies is still being developed in the context of the technology and the operating framework.  We will also have to take into consideration the vaccine types that may be available because some of those could be challenging for pharmacists.  We have done an expression of interest for pharmacies in the context of the numbers involved.  That will be closing out soon..  We will be running a trial over the coming weeks to see how that will work in terms of the technological solution involved and to make sure that there will be a clear framework for operating.

There have been a number of questions today.  The difficulty for some people who have contacted us, as public representatives, is that the HSE has been running an advertisement for a number of weeks which states that the over-70s have been largely vaccinated and that it will be moving on to others.  This is causing problems for many GP surgeries.  Children of elderly parents are contacting their GPs, annoyed and angry, asking why their father or mother has not been vaccinated.  They have listened to the advertisements on radio or seen them on television and are asking why their parents are being left behind.  There seems to be a difficulty with this.  The witnesses may need to tweak the advertisement.  A number of GPs have been really upset about this.  They tell people that the reason a person's father or mother has not been vaccinated is that the GP did not get the vaccine, which has been a problem.<\/p> <p>  Advertising has been touched on today.  With regard to vaccine hesitancy, are the witnesses talking about some sort of programme?  Some of the information imparted today is really useful.  Will there be a campaign through the media about vaccine hesitancy?  Will there be a plan regarding those staff who may be hesitant, for whatever reason, within the HSE or long-term residential homes?  What about the part of our population who do not have email addresses?  Believe it or not, there is a small cohort of people who do not have such addresses.  What about people who do not have smartphones?  Have the witnesses come across difficulties with this?<\/p> <p>  A number of people have contacted us to say that they did not understand why someone from Donegal or Clare would have to travel to Dublin to get the vaccine.  Have those difficulties with the roll-out been resolved?<\/p> <p>  I listened to what the witnesses said about rare clotting incidents.  Many people have questions about this matter.  It is atypical and affects a tiny cohort.  We are talking about possibly four people out of 1 million.  What is the recommendation?  A GP has been in touch with me about the issue.

We brought in specialists in the field and in other fields, including cancer, renal, etc., to promote the message, especially for vulnerable groups, that it is much more in their interest to get the vaccine because of the dangers of the virus.  The more difficult challenge would be with younger age groups who perhaps feel that they have less to fear from the virus.  Once we get past the primary objective of reducing harm, we will want to expand the vaccine to the greatest number of people possible to reduce transmission.  As we explained earlier, it is not finished for the over-70s.  It is almost finished but it is an ongoing programme.  Some people may be excluded because of active illness or recovery.  We certainly do not want to give a message that somebody has missed the boat.  We will certainly take on board the Chairman's comments.<\/p> <p>  Regarding travel from Donegal to Dublin, we have ample facilities for all the vaccinations in Donegal, Kerry or Cork.

I might address the Deputy's second question first if that is okay.  I, too, saw that two healthcare workers had tested positive.  That will happen because none of these vaccines is 100% effective for 100% of the population.  If we look at different healthcare workers, the SIREN study in the UK found that they were 85%, and possibly up to 90%, effective at preventing infection.  I do not know about these individual cases so I will not comment on them but the important point in that study is that the healthcare workers who did become infected were picked up through serial testing.  They were not necessarily symptomatic and therefore they had mild infections.  The corollary of that is that they will be less likely to pass on the infection.  I noticed on a Twitter feed that these cases were picked up in serial testing as opposed to the workers presenting as ill.  That is one of the reasons we say that, notwithstanding vaccination, we still need to employ public health measures such as masking and social distancing until we get the levels of virus down in the community.  That goes to address some of the earlier questions, including how we manage people coming into the country, particularly if they have been vaccinated with vaccines that have not been authorised in the EU and where we do not have all that detail.  However, even in the case of those who have been vaccinated, no vaccine is 100% effective for 100% of the population.  The Deputy may have directed that question elsewhere but I thought I might fill her in on that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of NIAC, when we have been asked questions we have turned around advice and answers as rapidly as possible but we want to make sure we have the evidence needed to give the best answers.  We know there are a couple of important pieces coming out.  The first part is whether, when there is more detail on age-related risk, we will still need such broad brush strokes in the recommendations for the age cut-off.  The second part is looking to get more granular detail.  If we go with a one-dose strategy that stretches out vaccination for longer, is there a compromise that will be a problem in the future?

This is made up of &euro;2.356 billion in current spending and &euro;2.76 billion on the capital side.  There was a carry-over of just over &euro;200 million from 2020.  Any fair view of that would see that it is a very significant budget for this Department and that it is heavy on the capital side, which is what we need.  There is no question but that there will be some impact on delivery, which I will cover later, due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the significant shutdown of construction, bar some small exemptions for certain social housing and strategic sites.  In general, my Department's funding represents a very substantial element of overall Government expenditure for 2021.<\/p> <p>  We know that 2020 was a very challenging year for Ireland and 2021 has been no different.  We have seen substantial additional funds flow through the Department in the areas of stimulus funding to bring voids back into play.  Last year, there were 3,607 voids.  They are located all over the country and in all of the local authorities.  There were significant waivers provided to support local business and a 100% rates waiver.  We also made sure to fund the local authorities with that gap in funding and provided additional funding to support local authorities in the area of homelessness where we have made and continue to make significant progress in tackling homelessness.  That has been in no short measure due to the hard work done by those in the NGO sector who work with us, as well as our own staff.  It is also because of the substantial priority the Government has given to driving down homelessness.  The rate of child and family homelessness year on year has fallen by just over 40% and the level of overall homelessness has reduced by 18%.  Homelessness still remains a challenge for us as a Department and it is for us, as a D&aacute;il, to tackle the issue of singles homelessness.  There are supports available in that area but it is a significant priority for me to continue the progress the Government has made in a short space of time to ensure that we give people permanent housing, and permanent housing solutions, but are supporting those who need it most through schemes like Housing First, which we will expand further into this year.<\/p> <p>  Despite the very challenging situation of a very limited construction sector for the first quarter of 2021, the reopening of activity on a broader scale now means that we can work to get back on track.  It is too early yet to fully determine the impact.  Each week of shutdown will result, between public and private house building, in 800 homes not being delivered this year.  We are going to work very closely with our colleagues in local authorities for measures that will support making up some of that lost ground and having a phased delivery of developments.  I will continue to work very closely with the local authority sector and our partners in the approved housing bodies to see how we can expedite delivery through 2021, and to make up for some of that lost ground to ensure that we deliver good public and affordable homes for our people.<\/p> <p>  We have set an ambitious target for this year.  We intend to deliver 12,750 new social homes, the majority of which, 9,500, will be through new build, together with some leasing and a small amount of  acquisition.  We may be looking to allow some further latitude for local authorities on the acquisition side to make up for some of the lost stock.  I intend, with agreement in the Government, to bring forward a further voids programme for this year to ensure that vacant stock that lies idle is brought back quickly.  I reiterate that last year, we brought 3,607 units back into use.  All of them have been allocated already and most have been occupied, which is what we want to ensure is done.<\/p> <p>  Importantly, in terms of capital funding, a priority for the Government is the delivery of affordable homes for working people and we have real plans in place to do that.  I will be bringing forward the affordable housing Bill, and I thank the committee for their work on the pre-legislative scrutiny side.  In respect of capital funding, we have provided &euro;468 million specifically to cover affordability measures, of which &euro;110 million is on the affordable shared equity side plus the cost rental equity loan.  We will deliver the first cost rental units this year.  We have set a target of 440 units but some people have said that it is not enough.  Of course we want to build on that but let us remember that we are starting from zero with that new form of housing tenure.<\/p> <p>  We have an additional &euro;50 million in the serviced sites fund to support local delivery and affordable purchase.  I also intend to bring forward changes to the serviced sites fund to allow faster and more efficient delivery of affordable houses on local authority lands.  We have additional moneys for the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF.  I am also reworking some changes to the Rebuilding Ireland home loan.  I have some proposals with me to improve that product and loan.<\/p><p>In addition to the &euro;205 million being spent on the Land Development Agency in its progression of-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021042000002#A00600","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":930,"content":"<p>I must interrupt the Minister as we are tight on time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021042000002#B00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":931,"content":"<p>I will leave housing at that and I will be happy to take any questions members have on the issue.<\/p> <p>  I will speak on water services for less than a minute.

There is no question that the housing assistance payment is a significant cost to the State.  We have to make sure we tip the balance back from providing the short-term measures that we need to provide for people.  We are looking to support an additional 15,800 new households to have their housing needs met under HAP or the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  It is a necessary measure in the short term to help people, with a particular focus on helping people out of homelessness.  The thrust of the Government's plan in the new programme for Government is to increase the provision of new-build public homes.  That is why we set a significant target of 12,750 homes for this year and bringing vacant stock back into use.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt there are value issues with regard to HAP but we come under understandable pressure from parts of the country where people want to see the HAP limits raised.  To put this in context, 77,503 households are covered under HAP, RAS and other schemes.  We cannot switch off that support.  We need a phased approach to deliver more than 50,000 public homes and help people out of that situation.  We will always need some form of short-term rental support for families and we have significant work to do.<\/p> <p>  On the energy retrofit programme, as the Deputy will be aware, we have the midlands retrofit programme, for which &euro;10 million was provided initially.  We have provided &euro;30 million and &euro;65 million in total for retrofitting.  Most of the target for delivery of retrofit is in our own housing stock.  The target is to complete a deep retrofit of approximately 2,500 homes to improve their energy efficiency and, most importantly, to reduce energy use and bills and make public homes more comfortable and healthier places for people to live in.<\/p> <p>  On Traveller accommodation, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, will be before the joint committee meeting later.  It is a concern to me and all parties that the expenditure allocated to this area has not been fully utilised.  We want to see that change.  We have allocated &euro;15.5 million for the delivery of Traveller accommodation.  The Minister of State is heavily involved with local authorities and Traveller organisations to ensure that funding is spent and utilised.  It was for this reason that we exempted Traveller accommodation and most social housing from the construction restrictions earlier in the year.<\/p> <p>  We have allocated &euro;65 million for retrofitting social housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021042000002#B01000","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":937,"content":"<p>On the theme of value for money, the Minister referred to long-term leasing under Part V.

We must be aware of value for money.  My big focus is on building new homes, which is why we have allocated funding for that.<\/p> <p>  There is a role for leasing.  Most people want to have a formal lease and buy-back arrangement but the capital issue is that with leasing we can secure more homes initially and up-front for a lesser capital cost at the outset.  It makes sense to have certain delivery models in that regard and that we have a blend of delivery.<\/p> <p>  I saw the report in relation to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and the homes to which the Deputy referred and I will certainly look into the matter.<\/p> <p>  Incidentally, the number of leasing units under Part V was actually 16, not 19, in 2020.  It is a very small number.<\/p> <p>  We delivered over 7,000 public homes last year.  We would have liked to do more than that but we were affected by the construction shutdown.  Leasing has a role but the focus of the Government is on new builds utilising our own stock properly.  The approved housing bodies, AHBs, have a role in this as well, particularly on the turnkey side and delivering public homes on private land.  We are in the midst of a housing crisis.  We need to build 33,000 public and private homes per annum.<\/p><p>Right now, we are well off that.  Last year, even without the pandemic, we would probably have reached about 25,000 homes in total between public and private.  We need more than that.

It will be clear to the committee and people will be aware that provision of affordable housing, especially for affordable purchase and affordable rent, is a priority.  The measures that we brought forward in budget 2021 are not insignificant at all.  I am proposing some changes to the serviced sites fund that are subject to Government approval.  The fund itself is &euro;310 million and could provide more than 6,000 affordable homes.  There are affordability issues in some areas, especially Dublin and Cork, and Galway to a lesser degree, where we may look at flexibility in the subvention that the State makes.  Dublin City Council, for example, has come up against one of a number of obstacles and while I will not go into that in too much detail, we need flexibility to allow faster delivery.<\/p> <p>  Under the fund this year, homes will be built in Boherboy and a couple of good schemes have been announced in Dun Emer in Lusk, where we are looking at prices of between &euro;165,000 and &euro;265,000, remembering that the local authority will take an equity stake in that home for that development.  The serviced sites fund can be used well.  The concept is good but it needs to be repurposed.  I will bring forward some of those changes in the affordable housing Bill.  I am also looking at Part V provision and working that through with Government.  I have made some comment on that, as the Deputy will see, about increasing the provision from 10% to 20%.  That would protect the 10% social housing and bring in 10% affordable housing.  We need a national affordable housing scheme, which we are bringing forward in the Bill, including affordable purchase, affordable rental for the first time, and an affordable cost-rental scheme.<\/p> <p>  I am committed to the pyrite remediation scheme.  I was involved with its establishment in 2011.  There is still work to be done by the Pyrite Resolution Board and we intend to continue that.  I have asked the board to look at category 1 plus progression to see if we can expand the scheme further.  We also have the defective blocks scheme that is currently in operation in Donegal and in Mayo.

That group is up and running and is chaired independently by Seamus Neely, former CEO of Donegal County Council.  It has had its first meeting.  I expect it to bring recommendations to me and want it to operate independently of me.  I am glad that the Construction Defects Alliance, the Apartment Owners' Network and others have been able to move on this quickly.  There are some who would say just to bring in a remediation scheme immediately.  We have to quantify the problem, its scale and its cost.  The best people to do that are the people in that group chaired by Seamus Neely.  I will not set a timeframe on their work because it is their work to do.

I assume the bulk of it is in social housing for local authorities but maybe the Minister will confirm that.<\/p> <p>  Covid obviously played a significant role in the drop in construction output last year.  Social housing had a much larger drop in output than overall construction.  Dublin City Council, South Dublin County Council and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council delivered no units directly last year.  Cork City Council delivered very few and Fingal County Council delivered even less.  Is the Minister concerned that there are more issues than just Covid?  Are there other issues, especially with the public spending code, which is slowing down some larger projects?  The Minister is a strong critic of turnkey housing and said he wanted to prioritise direct delivery of new builds by local authorities.  Last year saw 50% of new builds as turnkey.  What does the Minister propose to do this year to shift the balance back in favour of direct delivery by local authorities?<\/p> <p>  On HAP and RAS, at the end of this year, according to the Minister's estimates, 93,000 households will be on HAP and RAS, so we are exponentially increasing the use of HAP and RAS.  I am not saying that the Minister can unwind it straight away.  At what point will we start to see a reduction of the use of HAP and RAS?

The &euro;214 million carryover is made up of six different subheads.  There is &euro;58 million from local authority housing and &euro;40 million from energy efficiency, with about &euro;90 million from pyrite and mica remediation, which is basically because the mica scheme is up and running and accepting applications.  There is about &euro;10 million from Irish Water.  The total carryover of &euro;214 million is outlined in the paper submitted.  We intend for that to be used this year.<\/p> <p>  To answer the question about the impact of the shutdown of construction and the difference between public and private, we made up quite significant ground, where we did just short of 72% of the target that was set for public housing delivery.  One must remember, on the private side, which caught up quicker, that a sizeable proportion of private homes were one-off dwellings.  That has a disproportionate impact.  When one is building estates, the Deputy will be aware that whole sites were effectively closed, whereas people were able to get moving on the one-off houses.  That difference predominantly relates to one-off homes.  We have a total of about 21,000 homes and just short of 4,500 are single dwellings, so it has a disproportionate effect.  The private sector caught up.  We want public home-building to catch up this year.  There is a role for turnkeys.  I have been critical of them in the past, especially if I felt that they were not adding to stock.  Where they are adding to stock, they should be welcome.  They allow fast delivery, especially through approved housing bodies, and efficient delivery too.<\/p> <p>  On where we see the tipping point, even with the restrictions, we hope that we will see quarter 1 figures about delivery in the next four to five weeks.  That will give us a much clearer picture on what the projections for the remainder of this year are.<\/p><p>There has been a greater dependence on HAP and, particularly, RAS, and on emergency rent supplement but I think most people understand one of the reasons for that has been the pandemic.  We have had to be able to provide short-term rental supports for people who have not been able to pay their rent through no fault of their own.  They have lost their jobs and entered into the emergency rent supplement payment, which is an important one that continues at the moment.<\/p><p> The turnkey piece, on which we can go into in more detail in the meeting we have after this, is not to substitute local authority or approved housing body, AHB, build direct programmes but to complement them.  Where it complements them and makes sense, we should do it and we should allow that flexibility.  I am trying to build up capacity in the local authorities to deliver their own homes.  We need to make sure we are building up experience and expertise within the sector on the project management side.  I have set specific targets for every local authority in the country on what it needs to deliver in 2021, split between build, lease and acquisition.  I have met all the chief executives, either in person or virtually.  I intend to continue to do that from the end of this month, particularly in Connacht, where I have to meet a number of chief executives.  In a matter of weeks, we will have an idea of what has been able to be delivered in quarter 1.<\/p><p> We will publish the housing for all plan in the summer of this year, which will give us a multi-annual view of what delivery we need to do over the next three, five and ten years in relation to public and affordable homes.

On the issue of sewerage treatment capacity, wastewater capacity and freshwater capacity, it is a great frustration for many people.  We have discussed this ourselves and we are doing a couple of things right now.  I have asked Irish Water to work with local authorities in resetting priorities of delivery under the capital plan.  We need money to do that, which is why I mentioned at the start about &euro;1.3 billion being provided for Irish Water in 2021.  About &euro;105 million of that is provided to support water programmes delivered by the Department, including the rural water programme.  As part of the national development plan, NDP, review, to which the Department and I have made a submission, we need to be inventive about how we assist in moving projects along that have been there for quite some time.  We need to do this if we believe in balanced regional development, which I do absolutely.  There are few positives of Covid, but one is that many people have been able to go back to their original homes, working online and remotely.  If we follow an approach of town and village centre first, which we are, we need to make sure those towns and villages have the basic capacity to provide for additional population coming into the area.<\/p> <p>  We did the developer-led, older infrastructure scheme recently.  We brought about 2,000 homes back into the mains network.  We have a lot more to do there.  The capital plan for Irish Water is being worked through with them.  I am in regular contact with them.  More needs to be done, particularly in a regional sense.<\/p> <p>  I am confident we will be able to make strides in this, particularly under the NDP.  I have a particular proposal in there, on which I cannot go into detail yet.  Once I have it, I am looking at what we can do in towns and villages that do not have any Irish Water infrastructure.  I refer to places with older historical council schemes and what we can do to build capacity in those areas.  Fundamentally, my earnest belief is we need a publicly owned single water utility that people will be proud of to deliver an efficient and effective service for all our citizens.  That is where the White Paper I published a number of weeks ago on the future of Irish Water and water and waste water provision is important.  I have had very good engagement with unions, with Irish Water and with the County and City Management Association, CCMA.  The next step is for them, hopefully, to go back into discussions with the WRC.  We want to make sure we have a sustainable water system into the future.  I have made sure water is not the poor relation in this Department.  It is crucial if we are to deliver the additional homes we need for our people and if we are to balance our regional development.<\/p> <p>  The Government recently announced &euro;1.3 billion in urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, funding.  Limerick was a significant beneficiary of that.  It is to make sure that our regions are invested in and that people live, work and bring additional foreign direct and domestic private investment into those areas.  It is an exciting time for our regions but we need to make sure it is backed up with the required infrastructure.  I will continue to engage with the Deputy on this issue.  The NDP is a chance to do more and I want to see the capital plan expedited, like the older schemes the Deputy mentioned that have been on the books for 20 or 30 years.  We need to start moving and getting them done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021042000002#D00300","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":948,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister and I thank members for the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021042000002#D00400","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Message to D\u00e1il","time":1618873200,"counter":949,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021042000002#D00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":950,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 101, the following message will be sent to the D&aacute;il:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Select Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage has completed its consideration of the following Revised Estimates for public services for the year ending 31 December 2021: Vote 34 - Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Vote 16 - Valuation Office and Vote 23 - Property Registration Office.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021042000002#D00600","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1618873200,"counter":951,"content":"<p>The select committee adjourned at 7.07 p.m. sine die.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Select Committee on Justice and Equality","time":1618873200,"counter":952},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>Th\u00e1inig an Roghchoiste le ch\u00e9ile ag 18:30<\/p><p>The Select Committee met at 18:30<\/p><p>COMHALTA\u00cd A BH\u00cd I L\u00c1THAIR \/ MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies James Browne (Minister of State at the Department of Justice), Jennifer Carroll MacNeill, Pa Daly, Brendan Howlin, Thomas Pringle, Niamh Smyth.<\/p><p>Teachta \/ Deputy James Lawless sa Chathaoir \/ in the Chair.<\/p>","time":1618873200,"counter":953,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2021042000002"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Counterfeiting Bill 2020: Committee Stage","time":1618873200,"counter":954,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2021042000002#A00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":955,"content":"<p>I welcome all members to the Chamber.

I am here, virtually, with my colleague Dorothy Watson.  We are presenting results based on our work as senior researchers at the ESRI with more than 15 years&rsquo; experience in the areas of social inclusion, equality and discrimination.  As researchers, we have studied the disadvantage experienced by a range of groups, particularly those covered by the nine grounds specified in equality legislation.  Of these groups, it is fair to say that the degree of disadvantage experienced by Travellers is by far the greatest across these groups in a range of areas, including the reported experience of discrimination, educational attainment, employment, housing and health.  Those are key domains of life.<\/p> <p>  We would like to take this opportunity to draw your attention to some specific points in our submission.  Our submission is largely based on a report using census data, which captures the entire population in Ireland and compares Travellers and non-Travellers.  This report uses data from 2011 because those were the data available at the time, but evidence suggests that little has changed since then.  We found very high levels of educational disadvantage.  Among those of working age, between the ages of 25 and 64, only 8% of Travellers had completed the leaving certificate, compared with 73% of non-Travellers.  Only 1% of Travellers of working age had a third level degree, compared with 30% of non-Travellers.  We found that the gap between Travellers and others in completing second level was larger among younger adults.  Among those aged 25 to 34, an estimated 91% of Travellers left school without completing second level education, compared with only 14% of non-Travellers.  This suggests that Travellers had not benefitted as much as non-Travellers from the considerable improvement in levels of education in Ireland since the 1960s. <\/p> <p>  I will turn to employment levels, which is the focus of today's session, and the importance of education.  As many members know, paid work is important for many reasons.  It provides people with a source of income, facilitates financial independence and allows them to contribute to society, as well as conferring social standing, a sense of identity and a sense of purpose.  Not having a job is strongly linked to poverty and social exclusion, as well as physical and mental health challenges.  We found dramatic differences between Travellers and non-Travellers in employment rates.  Some 11% of Travellers aged between 25 and 64 were employed, compared with 66% of non-Travellers.  Of those in the labour market, the unemployment rate was 82% for Travellers aged 25 to 64, compared with 17% for others.<\/p> <p>  Education differences have a big impact on the chances of employment.  In our work, we found the lower levels of education among Travellers were very important in accounting for Travellers not having a job.  The statistical model we used allowed us to ask what would be the results if Travellers and non-Travellers had the same characteristics in terms of their education, age and other characteristics.  It is a what-if model and, if we apply it, the employment rate of Travellers would be just under two times lower instead of the observed six times lower.  This helps us understand some of the barriers to employment and also highlights the importance of educational qualifications in the labour market.  Travellers who had higher levels of education had a much better chance of being employed than those with lower levels of education.  We had data on all Travellers from the census.  Some 57% of Travellers with further or higher education were employed, compared with 9% of Traveller with no second level education.  Even at higher levels of education, however, it is important to note that the employment level of Travellers was lower than that of others.  The fact that a twofold gap in employment between Travellers and others remained, after accounting for education and other factors, suggests that there are additional barriers in the labour market that make getting a job more difficult for Travellers. <\/p> <p>  Other research we have done examined the self-reported experience of discrimination among the population in Ireland in 2014.  Irish Travellers reported rates of discrimination in seeking work that were ten times higher than other white Irish, even accounting for age, education and other background characteristics.  These results suggest that discrimination in recruitment is likely to play a role in accounting for the high unemployment rate among Travellers, as well as lack of social networks, not hearing about opportunities and other factors.  Lack of work is closely linked to poverty and social exclusion and this, in turn, has consequences for living standards, particularly with regard to poor housing and homelessness, and for physical and mental health.  <\/p> <p>  There are policy implications of our findings.  Enhancing the educational achievement of Travellers is crucial to ensuring that they can participate in employment and in society more generally.  It is unlikely that this can be achieved through mainstream policies alone.  Targeted approaches that address the specific challenges of Travellers are needed.  The size of the disadvantage in employment rates suggests that as well as being included in mainstream employment policies, additional targeted supports are necessary.  The level of prejudice against Travellers needs to be tackled by promoting a positive image of their culture and contribution to society.  Discrimination in employment should be tackled as a matter of urgency.  There is a role for Government policy and for action by employers to monitor, prevent and respond to discrimination affecting Travellers in seeking work and in the workplace.  Incorporating actions into the anti-racism strategy that is currently being drafted is also important in this regard.  The scale and persistence of labour market disadvantage among this group means considerable effort will be required through multiple policies and measures, and it may take time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021042000002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Frances McGinnity"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":1015,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McGinnity for that eloquent presentation.

Additionally, we play a key role in identifying members for State boards.  In our work sourcing, assessing and delivering candidates to our clients, we are committed to equality of opportunity for all people who wish to pursue a career in the public service.<br\/><br\/>Despite this commitment, we are all too aware that the level of recruitment and employment of Travellers in the public service is deeply unsatisfactory.  The report launched last week cited 80% unemployment of Travellers.  In our submission the committee will have seen that for our 2018 temporary clerical officer competition we had just 21 applications from people who identified as being members of the Traveller community.  The figures are frankly much too low and unacceptable.  It is incumbent on us as a public sector recruiter to extend proactively the hand of outreach, to listen to the challenges and to enable access and participation from Travellers to a much greater extent.<br\/><br\/>Our first equality, diversity and inclusion strategy, launched last month, identifies three strategic priorities broadly focusing on attaining greater knowledge and understanding of the public sector workforce and recruitment and promotion processes that enable access for diverse candidates and modelling best practice in equality, diversity and inclusion, while collaborating with clients to create inclusive work environments.  This strategy is the product of a significant consultation process, including input from representatives from the Traveller community, and provides a framework for addressing key challenges in a systematic and sustainable way.<br\/><br\/>The public sector equality and human rights duty rightly places an onus on public sector bodies to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the human rights of their employees, customers, service users and everyone affected by their policies and plans.  I understand and appreciate why a focus on equality, diversity and inclusion is increasingly important against the backdrop of growing diversity in Ireland.  We know that a public service that is energised and enriched by the contribution of employees from all sectors of society supports the delivery of a more responsive and inclusive public service.  We need to recognise and design workplaces that embrace and celebrate that diversity.  As the main recruiters for the Civil Service, this is particularly important for PAS.  Inclusive workplace cultures also play a key role in attracting and retaining people from diverse backgrounds, driving business and team performance and supporting collaboration and innovation.  We want to collaborate with our partners and colleagues in the civil and public service to ensure that strong, developed, inclusive workplace culture in order that we can be confident when recruiting people from marginalised communities that they are going into enabling environments where they can realise their potential and bring their &quot;whole selves&quot; to work.<br\/><br\/>There is much to do.  There has been good work to date but we acknowledge that we need to do more.  The area of diversity and inclusion has seen increased attention and support over recent years, with a greater imperative to address the need to increase visible representation in the public sector and enhanced understanding of the benefits for service provision for all the people of Ireland.  Recruiting and employing a diverse public sector workforce that is reflective of the communities it serves is not just a moral imperative; there is also a significant social, political and cultural imperative to have a public sector that mirrors the composition of our society.  We also appreciate the positive impact employment has not just for the individual but also for their families and communities.  This includes benefits way beyond monetary considerations.  For Travellers this goes beyond employment opportunities; it is about having access to and presence and participation in the venues and arenas where discussions, decisions and social policymaking that impact us all take place.<br\/><br\/>We outlined in our paper some of the work we have done in this space.  We have held workshops with Traveller organisations to provide guidance and information on application and recruitment processes.  We have advertised employment opportunities in Traveller publications such as the <i>Travellers' Voice<\/i>magazine and engaged with Jobs Ireland to ensure people on the live register are aware of our current recruitment activity.  We are pleased to support the Department of Justice on its internship for Travellers.  In line with the national Traveller and Roma community inclusion strategy, the Department of Justice will this year initiate a one-year work experience programme for members of the Traveller and Roma communities, with roles at clerical and executive officer level.  The Public Appointments Service will support participants through the provision of a careers clinic at the latter stage of the programme, with dedicated, tailored sessions covering how best to prepare for different elements of the recruitment process.<br\/><br\/>Becoming an active partner and sponsoring the Traveller education awards for the first time last year was, I hope, the beginning of a long-standing partnership which will facilitate increased engagement with the Traveller community while allowing us to promote public sector careers.<br\/><br\/>We have more to learn.  Participating on the St. Stephen's Green Trust traveller employment and enterprise policy programme advisory group enhanced our understanding of barriers to employment while working with other relevant stakeholders to develop opportunities to increase access.  Its report on Travellers in the mainstream labour market gives valuable insights into the experience of Travellers in the workplace.  We need to increase our outreach to hear directly from Travellers the challenges they encounter in accessing employment and the difficulties they encounter when they do enter the workplace.  We must continually challenge our own thinking, increasing our engagement with Traveller organisations to better understand the perceptions of the public service and the lived experience of recruitment and employment.  We will build more relationships, nurturing those already formed.  Our new equality, diversity and inclusion strategy places a key emphasis on engagement with under-represented groups and we are eager to continue to expand the scope of our work within this frame.<br\/><br\/>This will not be a quick fix.  I am acutely aware that our equality, diversity and inclusion strategy on its own is a document and that to give effect to and achieve our ambition will take a lot of work.  We need a concerted effort, collaborating with key stakeholders across the civil and public service, to bring about sustainable change while being mindful of the need to find ways to accelerate progress.  We understand the significant role we have to play as a recruiter while acknowledging that we are one element of the cohesive response that is required.<br\/><br\/>There is a phrase that is often used in the disability sector, &quot;Nothing about us without us&quot;.  This is applicable across the entire diversity spectrum.  Travellers themselves need to be at the centre of decision-making, policy considerations and legislative development to ensure real change.  Our goal as the recruiter for the civil and public service is to enable them to be present in these spheres.<br\/><br\/>We welcome this opportunity to talk to the committee.  This is a really useful forum to invoke self-reflection and critique and to challenge us to think about how we are doing things.  We look forward to the committee's views.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021042000002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Shirley Comerford"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":1019,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Comerford for that.

It is a very welcome opportunity.  I am the CEO of the Open Doors Initiative.  We are a group of more than 95 organisations that work in collaboration to create pathways to work for marginalised groups.  These include refugees and migrants, youth from disadvantaged background, people with disabilities and any intersectionality.  We are also expanding our work to include the Travelling community and other groups that are impacted by low employment.  To do this we organise training, work experience, mentoring, research and employment itself.  We also help entrepreneurs on their journey.  Last year, we helped more than 2,300 people find pathways to work for the first time.  President Higgins said recently that we have not suffered Covid equally, that poor people have suffered disproportionately and that Roma and Travellers have been even further impacted.  They are very key words.  This shows in the 80% unemployment rate the Travelling community faces and even higher barriers they have to gaining employment.  We have put together several recommendations.  I will run through them quickly.  We think these would be practical ways to make some change in this situation and as both previous speakers have noted, this will take time.<\/p> <p>  First, all programmes should be guided by members of the Travelling community itself.  They are best placed to know their needs and what would encourage people to participate.  Peer-led services will have the most success when the funding, supports and resources that are required are put in place.<\/p><p>Specific training, education pathways and job supports such as pre-work assistance and on-the-job supports also need to be put in place.  This helps both the employer and employee and ensures recruitment on merit, retention and career progression.<\/p><p> Discrimination and racism need to be addressed in myriad fora, including in recruitment and human resources and among employers.  We really encourage the inclusion of anti-racism training as part of the learning process for everyone involved in this area.<\/p><p> People from marginalised backgrounds have substantial entrepreneurial capabilities, yet no national strategies have been designed to enable people from the Traveller community to pursue self-employment as a career opportunity.  To pick up on what Ms Comerford mentioned, a great example was highlighted last week with the launch of the report of the St. Stephen's Green Trust.  It featured Bounce Back Recycling, a Traveller-led social enterprise.  There needs to be more work in this area.<\/p><p> We echo the need to increase the local government and public sector percentage of diverse hiring.  Given the challenges that lie ahead after Covid in securing employment, local government should take the lead and proactively increase the number of people from the Traveller community whom it employs.  Department of Justice internships comprise a real step in the right direction in this regard.<\/p><p> We feel we should establish a large-scale mentoring programme.  In our work, this has been a really successful element in helping people to get into employment.  We encourage businesses to join in the programme as role models to help to instil confidence in jobseekers, allow them to begin to make connections and a support network and lead them through the process of applying for jobs and gaining interview skills.  The new Traveller Graduate Network is a very good example of this peer support.  It was set up just recently.<\/p><p> As childcare, caring roles and transport can also be an issue for various groups, we suggest that a network of remote working hubs be built nationwide to accommodate people to work away from home, if that is their choice or requirement.  The hubs need to have reasonable accommodation for people with disabilities.  We could then link in with industry and organisations such as Grow Remote to help to create specific internships and jobs for people in these settings.<\/p><p> Another area is the digital divide.  We feel there is a need to maximise access to hardware, Wi-Fi and training in digital skills.  Covid has certainly emphasised the divide in communities.  Therefore, it is really important that this be addressed.<\/p><p> In our own work, we recently launched a project called Employers For Change, which is directly aimed at aiding people with disabilities in entering work.  It operates in conjunction with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  The aim of the project is to empower employers with all the information and advice they need to hire inclusively and employ, manage and retain staff with disabilities.  We feel a similar hub with information on the Traveller community, pointed towards employers, would be incredibly useful.  There is discrimination, misunderstanding and a lack of knowledge of the culture, language and needs of the Traveller community, who are particularly marginalised when it comes to employment.  <\/p><p> In summary, there is a requirement for targeted supports to be put in place to ensure fair and full representation in the workplace for the Traveller community.  Diverse workplaces help business, existing employees and people themselves.  There is also a greater societal benefit arising from of inclusive practices, with the reduction of stigma, bias and racism.  Support by the Government is key to this and we welcome the new strategy being prepared by the Department to help make progress on employment within this community.  <\/p><p> I thank members for their time.  I welcome any questions they may have on my statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021042000002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Jeanne McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":1022,"content":"<p>I thank Ms McDonagh so much for that presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021042000002#D00200","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":1023,"content":"<p>I thank everyone for their presentations and for the hard work done.  It is very important.  It struck me when listening that, according to the ESRI, there is terrible discrimination against women in the Traveller community.  They tend to lose out an awful lot.  Very many women Travellers are not in employment because of the way they were brought up.  In many cases, they tend to be in the home a lot more.  I wonder what strategies are being rolled out in this regard.  Education obviously plays a big role in this regard and trying to educate people to a higher level is very important.<\/p> <p>  The number of Travellers coming forward to join the Civil Service is low.  Is there positive discrimination in the Public Appointments Service or is it something we are not allowed to do any more?<\/p> <p>  Regarding the Open Doors Initiative, are we encouraging Travellers to work from home?

Many of the gender differences parallel those we find in the population more generally.  Traveller women are a little more likely than Traveller men to complete secondary education but are less likely to be at work, especially married women and mothers.  In the whole population of Ireland, women have higher educational qualifications than men but lower employment rates.  One policy solution to this is to try to facilitate childcare.  There is some policy action through the national childcare scheme and the facilitation of childminders.  Some of the solutions are Traveller-specific and some are matters of improving national policy and upping the game regarding supports for working families.<\/p> <p>  On working from home, the ESRI was not focusing specifically on Travellers but on migrants and Covid.  One of the points to make about working from home is that regardless of the issues an employee might have with the home workspace, such as overcrowding, the Internet connection and whether he or she has a computer, there are many jobs in the Irish labour market that cannot be done from home.  These include the jobs of essential workers and all those in the food and accommodation industry, who are on temporary lay-off now.  On working from home, I hope circumstances will improve.  It should really be borne in mind that people such as binmen just cannot work from home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021042000002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Frances McGinnity"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":1025,"content":"<p>On Deputy Ellis's second question, on positive discrimination, we know that where we use targets and quotas, they can create a focus for people.

As the recruiters, we do not have responsibility for policymaking.  That lies with our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  However, we have been in discussions with the Department on the issue of pathways to employment and we have made some inroads in that regard in recent years.  I would point the members to the Oireachtas work learning, OWL, programme where we have had a very positive impact.  Six of the OWL graduates have gone on to employment, two with our organisation and four within the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There are solutions that are being worked on to make sure we have pathways to employment.  We have had similar success in other areas.  We are currently looking at the willing able mentoring, WAM, work placement programme.

I very much appreciate it.  I will start by addressing an issue that relates to the care of children by women or men.  Even if it is seen as being a traditional role, that does not mean it is wrong for people to want to do that for a period when they have young children.  I do not want to get into the debate that people have to be dissuaded from what they believe is acceptable culturally.  I do not believe a strategy for the Traveller community over and above the general population in terms of getting people who have small children out to work would be appropriate.  However, childcare needs to be put in place to ensure everybody has the opportunity to choose which is appropriate for them.  That is the main issue.  It is not about the way they have been made to feel that, culturally, something is appropriate and something else is not.  That is the first response in addressing the point made by Deputy Ellis, which is important to mention.<\/p> <p>  I understand from Dr. McGinnity that this is more about a deep level of disadvantage when it comes to employment.  It is important we focus on that.  The statistics she gave are stark.  Soul-searching is a wonderful way to think about it and it is incumbent on all of us to see what we can do in our everyday lives.<\/p> <p>  Dr. McGinnity mentioned that if we look at educational attainment and all things being equal in terms of an individual in the Traveller community and someone in the settled community, the individual in the Traveller community is twice as likely to experience unemployment whereas they are six times more likely to experience that if they do not have the same level of educational attainment as the person in the settled community.  That shows education is clearly significant and means there is something very focused we can do in that regard.<\/p> <p>  On the other issue, I am interested to hear if Dr. McGinnity's research uncovered the types of employment where the discrimination or bias may happen.  Is there something around the public or the private sector we could point to that might help Ms Comerford's organisation, for instance?  Are there are issues other than education or going into the community to which we can point?

Where we looked in the research at, say, the experience of discrimination in seeking work and compared the different groups, we did not have enough Travellers to examine in detail the jobs to which the recruitment discrimination was applied.  We do not have that sort of detailed information.  I know from other research I have done on the experience of discrimination in recruitment that good training on recruitment in terms of equality policies is important.  I refer to a small company not having a human resources, HR, person but the employer has a sense of what is appropriate and the law around equality.  In  bigger organisations, and ideally everywhere, there should be rules around recruitment, which can guide people.  That might also reduce the chance that people will simply act on some of their preconceived ideas or hunch.<\/p> <p>  There is a general finding that recruitment discrimination tends to be lower in the public sector, but we did not have enough evidence to say whether that was true for Travellers.  We did not have that kind of detailed information in the survey we looked at.<\/p> <p>  In terms of discrimination in the workplace, certainly in terms of the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and other big surveys we would rely on that survey the whole population, it covers a range of issues, including harassment, microaggression and bullying.  It can also cover people believing they are discriminated against in terms of how much they are paid and their promotional prospects.  In the front-facing service jobs, it can be the experience of discrimination at work from the employer but it can also be from co-workers or, in service occupations, from customers, clients or whatever.  Recruitment is in the hands of the person giving the job, the employer, but when someone has a job and is experiencing discrimination in the workplace, that is a wider issue.  I hope that answers the Senator's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021042000002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Frances McGinnity"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":1030,"content":"<p>I have a number of questions and I ask the witnesses to respond as appropriate.<\/p><p>I am interested in hearing the views on the issue of Traveller training centres.  Several years ago, a decision was taken to phase out the provision of Traveller education through dedicated training centres and for them to be mainstreamed.  Have any studies been done in respect of this area to determine whether it has worked?  In Finglas, the closure of the St. Joseph's Traveller training centre had a big impact in terms of engagement on the part of the Traveller community, particularly for older members who subsequently became more cut off from the wider community.  I suspect an effort to mainstream education services and prevent segregated education has not worked.  I would be interested if the witnesses have any experience in this regard.<\/p><p> I want to hear more about the graduate network for Travellers.  What measures can we put in place in the context of mentoring?  Innovate Communities has a clever programme called INSPIRE which links people who have been successful or graduated from university with younger people in disadvantaged communities.  Could we do something similar for the graduate network for the Traveller community?<\/p><p> No one will be surprised if I say the most flagrant and blatant form of racism in Ireland is that experienced by the Traveller community.  We see that around basic issues such as booking family events at hotels and so on.  In the darkness of a recruitment process, it often is just between the owner of a business and the CVs in front of him.

Once everyone benefits, that is a good and holy thing.  It is obviously an issue that a Traveller education service has gone from the area.  Something certainly needs to be done on that basis.<\/p> <p>  On the graduate network, I must hold my hand up and admit I only have surface knowledge.  One of the key starters of it is Gavin Hennessy, who works in the diversity and inclusion section of Irish Life's HR department.  It is a clever idea because it creates role models and peer support.  That feeds into mentoring because if one cannot see it, one cannot be it.  One needs to have people in place to whom one can aspire and talk, as well as learn from.  With our mentoring, we have had so many successes just by dint of the fact that someone with experience is willing to share their time, network and ideas, as well as bringing someone along from a place where they have none of those things to a place where they have confidence.  That is the commonality between all the groups we deal with, namely, a lack of confidence.  Those sorts of networks and mentoring give a degree of confidence and help people move along.<\/p> <p>  We are looking at recruitment and are having discussions with the national recruitment agencies about how to get cultural training into the recruitment area.  This would mean people would have some knowledge of difference.  It is easy to mirror oneself, especially in recruitment.  If a recruiter sees someone who looks like them, talks like them and went to the same school, the natural inclination is to gravitate towards them.  We need to get recruiters to see difference because they are the gatekeepers.  They work with companies and companies are guided by them.  They can sieve out CVs before they even get to the employer, who may be very inclusive.  The recruiter is working on a certain basis and may feel that only certain candidates can be put forward.  That is a piece of work to be done.  We started it in a small way but it needs a lot of work to get recruiters to think in a far more inclusive and diverse way.  We need them to put forward candidates who might not necessarily tick every single box but who will bring with them diversity of thought, creativity, lateral thinking and problem-solving, all of which are assets to any workplace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021042000002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Jeanne McDonagh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":1033,"content":"<p>On the Traveller training centre, I am not familiar with the particular example raised by the Deputy.  It is a tricky balance between having targeted programmes for a particular group, as well as additional supports in a mainstream programme.  This is clear with migrant integration.  If there are segregated schools and living spaces, then that is a challenge in terms of social cohesion.  The majority group can also learn from training that includes diverse groups.  Non-Travellers in a group will also see that he or she is doing a training course which in turn educates and changes the perceptions of the majority group in the training group.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the point on SMEs.  In the recovery from Covid, it will be small companies and low-skilled jobs that will be very important.  These companies will not have that whole HR infrastructure or may not know the rules.  Building on some of the points Ms McDonagh made, the ideas of support and information in terms of recruitment for these companies is important.  Trying to get the message out so that they are aware is also important.  They might not be recognising the difference or the skills.  It is not necessarily that they do not want to employ somebody.  That might be the case in some companies.  Educating employers more generally, including small business employers, about the benefits of diversity and what is a fair and just recruitment process is important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021042000002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Frances McGinnity"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":1034,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for being with us.  It is clear from the first presentation that educational participation is crucial.  That must remain a great policy objective.  It was fascinating to see the modelling of six versus two.  The two figure is dreadful with the same educational level while the six is extraordinary.<\/p> <p>  There was a break in my feed but one Deputy raised the issue of positive discrimination.  For a start, has the Public Appointments Service considered internships in every Department?<\/p><p> The second issue is quotas.  All the female members of the committee and women guests know that we had to introduce quotas in public life to achieve gender equality in participation in public life.  That was the correct thing to do and had to be done.  Similarly, quotas will have to be introduced for Travellers, particularly in public service areas where that can be done and can work.  I ask the witnesses to comment.  The anti-racism policy that is coming offers potential in that regard.<\/p><p> I have visited Youthreach centres for a couple of reasons in my time and I noticed high Traveller participation in Youthreach.  Can Youthreach participants transfer into jobs?  The point about training centres, which was raised by Deputy McAuliffe, is also interesting.<\/p><p> Many of the Travellers I know personally do not look for jobs simply because they consider it a hopeless pursuit and they have no expectation of success.  I have no expectation of success in snooker, ballet, dancing or whatever and, consequently, I do not pursue those pastimes.  Where we do not think we will succeed, we do not do it.  I would like a comment on that.  There is need for input from the Traveller community to create some sort of a desire or confidence to actively seek work.<\/p><p> In that context, Ms McDonagh's point about lifting all boats is relevant.  We have an excellent Traveller accommodation centre in Cavan.  If a couple of people there got jobs, Ms McDonagh's point arises in that it would create an expectation and a desire in others.<\/p><p> I ask for a comment on community employment, CE, schemes.  We have community employment schemes all over the country, including in my home town.  Community employment is successful.  Why could quotas not be applied to the CE scheme?  Why could it not be made a prerequisite for funding a CE scheme that it have a workable quota?  We cannot have crazy quotas initially.  We need reasonable policy objectives but there is potential for quotas.<\/p><p> Will the witnesses comment on the anti-racism document that is being produced and its practical outputs in terms of employment for Travellers?  It will need to be more than a mission statement or vision for anti-racism.  It will have to have some practical implications.  How could these affect Travellers and Traveller employment opportunities?<\/p><p> I thank the witnesses.  The papers presented were extremely interesting.

I am happy to respond.  As we said, it is important that we continue to do the work we are trying to do.  From our perspective, we have to ensure we have a strategy that declare our intent in relation to our aspirations to create a public service that is reflective of the society that it serves.  There is a role for government in showing leadership on this matter.  There is certainly a policy element around establishing targets and quotas because, as I stated, they focus minds.<\/p> <p>  As recruiters, it is incumbent on us to make sure we are visible, continue with our outreach work, continue to try to engage with the various groups and model best practice.  There is much that we can do in terms of liaising with other government organisations.  We are fortunate in the Public Appointments Service in that our reach goes beyond the Civil Service.  We have a key role in shining a light, sharing best practice, training interview boards and ensuring they are aware of diversity and unconscious bias, as well as making sure that the composition of interview boards participating in recruitment processes is such that they live that diversity as well.  There is much that we can do in this area.<\/p> <p>  I totally agree with the Senator about the expectation of success.  One cannot be what one cannot see.  We know from other disadvantaged or marginalised groups in employment that networks and having role models are important, as are mentors and other support mechanisms that could be put in place.  We would welcome any policy developments in that area.<\/p> <p>  We have made a commitment to do our piece around using our influence with the HR communities across our sectors, highlighting to the public sector organisations that they have a public service duty.  We will use our influence and reach to try to expand HR and other organisations' knowledge around inclusivity and the importance of this.  We are acutely aware that we might get people in the door but if they are going to organisations that do not have an inclusive culture, that work experience for them will be negative.  It is important that we have a two-pronged approach where as well as getting people in to organisations, we make sure those organisations are creating environments where people can succeed.

There is also the issue of role models.  People who have done internships well may feel they can move on having had these kind of experiences.  Internships might also feed into self-belief.  However, we must acknowledge, particularly in a context where someone's parents have had negative experiences in the labour market and education, that it is harder to break that.

Last week, I attended a meeting of the St. Stephen's Green Trust to discuss Travellers in the mainstream labour market.  One of the points made was that the travelling community feels it has been looked at under a microscope to the point that is has been almost wiped out.  There have been so many reports and recommendations on accommodation, the labour market and so on but Travellers need to see action.  This is an important juncture for the travelling community.  We have to put in place structures that will have an impact in order that Travellers see that they are moving on from where they were.  The public sector has a positive role to play here.  I have seen that in disability groups.  My office is in Agriculture House and I see people with disabilities all around the building.  They play a key role in the workplace.  That has a good impact in that they become role models in the community.<\/p><p>That, to me, is the role the PAS can play.  It will be a very responsible role on the shoulders of the PAS to bring that forward.<\/p><p> When we look at the fact 8% of the Travelling community completed a leaving certificate, there is a massive section of the community who are low skilled.  Where do we bring them in terms of work experience and so on?  There are three or four prongs to this.  In particular, the graduates who have come through comprise a very small group but there is a role they can play in assisting the community and getting more young people through the education system.  It is a question of how we can put in place structures that allow low skilled members of the Travelling community to come through the SMEs.<\/p><p> I was interested to hear Ms McDonagh&rsquo;s point about mentoring and role models.  That will be crucial.  I knew the working class kids in the 1970s.  I grew up in the Coolock-Artane area.  If someone put Coolock beside their name, they got nowhere.  People just did not put down their addresses because they would be immediately identified as working class if they did.  It was only when the public sector opened up in the late 1970s that a lot of my peers got jobs in the Civil Service and so on.  That had a huge impact.  There was also the other aspect of migration, but the Traveller community now has no chance of doing something like that.  Therefore, it is very important that we get as much right as possible.  We can make mistakes but we need to learn from our mistakes.  The mentoring programme is going to be very important, as well as how we use organisations like Bounce Back, in terms of how we work with the SME sector to promote people from the Traveller community into those areas of work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021042000002#G00800","speaker":"1569","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":1040,"content":"<p>I totally agree with the Deputy.  There is a huge responsibility on us, as the PAS, to realise the aspirations and ambitions that we have in our strategy.  We have done something.  We have established an equality, diversity and inclusion, EDI, function, which is very important because we need to have structures in place that enable us to engage and enable us, most importantly, to listen.  As the Deputy rightly said, we have made significant progress in the disability sector, so we know there are things we can do.  I am absolutely not saying that sector is the same as the Traveller community but there are things that we have learned can work and that we can use.  We have shared some of those things with the committee today, for example, diversifying our board members, looking at networks, outreach work and visibly sponsoring Travellers.  All of those things are very important and we know they have worked because they have worked before for us with the disability community.<\/p> <p>  I would love to be able to say there is something we could do that would effect an immediate change but, certainly in my experience, it is an incremental process, one block on top of another, to actually get there.

One that it is very likely to propose is the introduction of an ethnic identifier on administrative datasets, but also on survey data.  This is the idea that what gets measured gets monitored.  There are some instances, for example, the post-primary database has a Traveller identifier, but there is lots of other policy activity where we do not have any information on groups like Travellers and how they are progressing.  That would be one way of keeping track of how well Travellers are being served by different needs.<\/p> <p>  Another possibly relevant point is that, within the ESRI, my team have been commissioned to do an international review of policies to combat racism and discrimination in the labour market in order to support the work of the anti-racism committee.  It is sometimes difficult to do a proper evaluation, and evaluations can be expensive, but we would be looking for really good examples that show ethnic minority groups that have benefited from various initiatives abroad.  Of course, there is also the issue that each group has its own challenges, but we believe there is some policy learning whereby we can transfer examples of good practice from other countries in terms of racial and ethnic minorities.<\/p> <p>  I have not worked on evaluations of Youthreach but I have colleagues in the ESRI who have.

It is up to us to instil confidence and create the expectation that they can achieve what they wish to achieve, whether it be a career, progression or whatever.  It needs people to come together with very practical solutions and with learnings from other areas, such as the disability sector and the disadvantaged youth sector, because there is a commonality between all of the groups.

One of the strategic change areas in our strategy is the piece about us having better knowledge and understanding of the recruitment market and the public sector workforce.  We are very aware that we have gaps in our data and that we need to build our knowledge and understanding of the workforce and the recruitment pipelines and how they reflect the diversity of society.  To do this we must develop our data capability and we have to develop accessible data-driven evidence bases.  That is the piece on how we can establish that baseline so we can measure and see any interventions that we make, whether they are achieving anything or whether we are succeeding with them.  Some of the associated elements would be items such as seeking to refine our messaging on diversity and inclusion data collection, to encourage candidates to complete it and to start building and increasing our knowledge.  We know anecdotally that many people do not declare their EDI data when they are filling in forms or applying for roles.  There might be something to do with the messaging on that.  That is something which is an immediate focus for us.<\/p> <p>  Once we have that we will develop the key metrics relating to the brand awareness piece.

We are doing this to try to help us understand where the barriers and the areas for improvement are.  That will then contribute to the development of robust and sustainable mechanisms for mapping the EDI profile for the public sector.

On the point about data, many members of the committee will know that ethnicity is rarely measured in Ireland.  Getting an ethnic identifier on these data sets and these services to allow tracking takes a while.  If it is in a certain health database, primary school database or the Department of Social Protection database it will take a while to build that up to inform how Travellers are progressing and to allow people to monitor what is going well and what is going badly.  While I strongly advocate for a mix of targeted plus the mainstream, the mainstream will only work if one is monitoring.  One has to monitor the mainstream policies to check if the needs of the disadvantaged group are being met in a mainstream policy.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the specific policies in areas, they would target the specifics of Traveller disadvantage, for example, broadband hubs, which were mentioned by Ms McDonagh, facilitating working from home for groups, places to study, childcare where people live, support for parents to support children doing homework and support for parents on the value of education.  Even if they do not have it themselves, it is valuable and a good thing to have.  Staying in school is a good thing to do.  I mentioned earlier additional supports rather than separate institutions for training.  There may be benefits there for the other people, the non-Travellers, who are engaging in the training so they see what Travellers and a minority group can do.  That is a hidden advantage of having the training.  However, if very disadvantaged groups such as Travellers are going to be brought into any mainstream service, that is where one needs to watch that their needs are being met.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021042000002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Frances McGinnity"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":1051,"content":"<p>Do any of the committee members wish to contribute?  They can contribute on the second round if they wish.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make a few points, as a Traveller woman.<\/p><p>First, many Traveller women, like women from the general population, choose to be stay-at-home mothers and wives.  For members of the public who are watching these proceedings, there is nothing shameful about choosing that as a career.  We all know, as mothers and as young mothers, it is one of the hardest jobs in the world, but for women who stay at home it is not recognised enough.  I wish to clarify that.<\/p><p> In addition, and I hope I am not being cheeky in saying this, it is not part of Traveller culture not to work.  Years ago, my father, the Lord have mercy upon him, worked as a mechanic.  He did not have a qualification for it.  Members of my extended family are really good as electricians, plumbers and mechanics, especially some of the men, and the women work with hair and make-up, caring and so forth.  I was in a school before Christmas and before the restrictions and a young Traveller woman said to me: \"Eileen, you are lucky.  We all will not end up in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We all would not get those jobs.  At the end of the day, we are only going to be seen as Travellers\".  This was a young girl of 12 years of age in a secondary school.  I remember my grandfather or my big daddy, the Lord have mercy upon him.  He is more than 12 years dead and he used to say to us that Travellers could rule Ireland - he meant that they could be in politics, jobs and so forth - if only they had the opportunity to do so.  I believe he was right.  Many times we say that if Travellers can go forward and be something, the other Travellers will see it and want to be it as well.  Unfortunately, that is still not happening because racism and discrimination are beaten into one from a young age - in primary school, secondary school and at third level in university.  I am just stating that from my experience.  One of our biggest problems is getting young Travellers to complete second level education.  That is something the Irish Traveller Movement, Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre, the Minceir Whiden Society, Exchange House Travellers Service and all the national organisations are working on at present.<\/p><p> As a Traveller woman, I am sick to death of policies, of sitting in rooms, not just today but for the last ten years, of looking at jobs and employment, how to get the Travellers through the door and saying the Travellers need A, B, C and D.  It is very tough, as an activist, seeing that ten years later.  My colleague, Oein De Bhard&uacute;in, works with me in the Oireachtas.  We work together, hand in hand.  It is brilliant and we have big conversations in which we say, \"If only\".  In every employment we look at the status of women and men.  That information should be available for ethnic minority groups too.  Every employer should be employing people from ethnic minority groups, which include members of the Traveller community.  There are many Travellers who work in nursing homes and are front-line workers in the midst of the pandemic.  There are also doctors, nurses, school principals and so forth who went on to get masters and doctorates.  They work in the Department of Education.  There are many great Traveller people.  While we are having this conversation, and without me running on a little too much, let us look at one of the positives, that we have many Travellers in employment.  Unfortunately, however, many of those Travellers have to hide their identity to be successful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021042000002#J00600","speaker":"1657","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1618873200,"counter":1053,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":1054,"content":"<p>We have to draw up a report on employment for the Traveller community.  Many of the questions I had have been asked.  Deputy Mitchell mentioned the identifier and so forth.  I will refer back to the women who presented here today about going from the real to the ideal.  The real is that we do not have many Travellers in employment.  What do they see as the ideal solution to that, to get access for Travellers and also to be successful when having access to mainstream employment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021042000002#K00300","speaker":"1657"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":1055,"content":"<p>I will respond first to that.  The absolute ideal might be a little idealistic, but it should be that one is in employment because one wants to be in employment and one just happens to be a Traveller, a woman or a person with disability.  However, one is there, first and foremost, on merit as a good employee.  It is very important to get the mindset across to recruiters, employers and people who are already in the workforce that people deserve a chance and deserve to be there on merit because they bring something to the workplace, to their colleagues and to the work.  I would like to see a situation where if the fact that one is a Traveller arises, it is in light of a discussion, such as saying: \"That is interesting; tell me a little more about yourself\".  I recognise that this is the ideal, but it should be by the way, and not just because, if that makes sense.  A great deal of work has to be done to achieve that, as well a great deal of education and learning and a lot of confidence building for the Traveller community themselves.  I do not know when that will be, but the will should be there and very practical steps must be taken to achieve that.  The work of this committee will be important in driving that home, that it is not a talking shop but an action shop and something good comes out of all this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021042000002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Jeanne McDonagh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":1056,"content":"<p>I agree with Ms McDonagh.  That is the utopia, and it would be a fantastic place for us to reach.  Our experience with marginalised groups is that it takes a while.  We need purposeful interventions by organisations or by sectors.  If the Chairman were to ask me what things have worked well previously, we can point to the experiences we have seen in apprenticeships and work placement programmes that provide access to employment.  Although the numbers are small, it is a start.  I believe that could work.  On the other side of that, it is not just that entry piece.  The committee has heard me say previously that it is about ensuring there are appropriate supports in place - supports for the individual and supports from an organisation perspective.  It is a journey.  While I can speak for my organisation, I am sure other CEOs would say the same.  It is a journey, a learning and purposeful journey that an organisation must have.  There are conversations that must happen, interventions and initiatives must be there and an understanding must be created.  That training piece is very important in organisations.<\/p><p>HR communities have an important role to play in ensuring that they are having these conversations at the top table and holding leadership accountable for driving inclusive workplace cultures.<\/p><p> The other thing is not to be complacent.  It is about making sure that we are engaging with individuals, understanding their experience and using that to ensure we develop appropriate interventions and initiatives.  I cannot say that we have all the answers, but if we had something like that it would be a very good starting point from which we could build and develop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021042000002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Shirley Comerford","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1618873200,"counter":1058,"content":"<p>From my perspective, the goal is that Travellers have the same opportunities as other groups in Irish society.  One should not have to be exceptional like you, Chairman, to achieve in society.  One should have the same opportunities.  The ultimate aim is closing that gap.  It is not that we want to downplay diversity or difference; it is that we want to value diversity and inclusion so we can close some of the gaps in education and employment and get to the stage where Government policy makers, employers and the Traveller community believe Travellers can positively contribute to the Irish labour market, and they will.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TCJ2021042000002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Frances McGinnity"},{"type":"speech","time":1618873200,"counter":1059,"content":"<p>Thank you for your feedback.

I apologise for not being able to attend the meeting.  It clashed with another meeting, but I was watching and trying to listen on the monitor.  I will read the transcripts later.  I got the gist of what took place.  I congratulate everybody on what they have been doing.  This is a huge challenge and a great deal of work must be done.  I am familiar with Ms Enright and Dr. McGinnity and the work they have been doing.  We are reported out of it at this stage.  I chaired a committee for four years and we have many reports, but we need action now.  We need hands-on activity on the ground to make this happen.<\/p> <p>  We need to find out, first, why Travellers are not getting employment.  I heard somebody say earlier that much of it is related to their self-esteem.  I visited many Traveller communities over the last number of years and one thing that struck me in one place was all the young people hanging around, and this was when we had full employment before the pandemic.  They were fabulous young people just hanging around with nothing to do and all day to do it.  I wondered what was going on and why those people were not being engaged.  Education has a big part to play, as somebody mentioned earlier.  It is about getting through school, getting out the other side and getting some type of recognition.  Self-esteem and self-belief are very important.  They are part of it.<\/p> <p>  I am aware of the work Ms Enright is doing.  The Irish Association for Social Inclusion Opportunities, IASIO, and other organisations are doing fantastic hands-on work on the ground, and hand holding in some instances.  Employers and businesses need to be hand held as well and brought along.  It is a huge amount of work.  I heard what Ms Comerford said about diversity, which is massively important, and challenging people at the top table.<\/p> <p>  Chairman, you and the committee are doing great work in this area, but we must keep at it.

Hopefully, other Members of the Oireachtas, members of the public and Ministers who were watching today's meeting will learn from it how difficult it is for members of the Traveller community to access employment in Ireland today.
