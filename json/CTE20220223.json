During this time I have also served as a trustee for several animal welfare organisations and have been a firm advocate of animal welfare and health at all times.  I currently also sit as a member of the Veterinary Ireland companion animal committee, and represent the group at a European animal working group level.  In a personal capacity I am also a member of a joint UK and Ireland puppy farming stakeholder group attempting to resolve that major issue, which also represents more than 40 independent and government-affiliated bodies.<\/p> <p>  As we emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic it is not only a time for reflection, but also a time for change.  Over the past two years we have witnessed the ever-increasing demand for pets by the public, and the resorts to which some will go to in meeting these demands.  What was very evident, and something I witnessed first-hand as a clinician, was the mismatch between supply and demand throughout the pandemic.  As a result, the imbalance created by an insatiable public demand created the perfect void for supply by opportunistic individuals, with the sole purpose of generating vast personal wealth.  At a time of huge emotional strain and stress on both families and individuals during what was the greatest health challenge in modern times, some unscrupulous breeders seized the opportunity to capitalise and extort.  With the demand for certain breeds such as brachycephalic, otherwise known as brachys for short, including French bulldogs, pugs and shih tzus at unprecedented levels, the supply of these puppies was seen by many as a passport to riches at any cost.  As a result, more and more people resorted to using artificial insemination in their dogs which increased efficiency and maximised the chances of greater output, that is, greater numbers of puppies and greater profit.<\/p><p>Artificial insemination is not a new practice and has been performed in canines for many years.  It has been used particularly in cases where dogs are in remote geographical areas and cannot travel to mate naturally.  Derivatives of this procedure also include the more invasive transcervical insemination, TCI, technique and surgical insemination.  It is worth noting at this point that surgical insemination is an illegal practice in the UK, whereas as all three forms of canine insemination can be performed legally in Ireland.  In the case of surgical insemination, it is necessary for the recipient to undergo general anaesthesia, as a surgical incision is made through the body wall into the abdominal cavity.  Thereafter, the uterus is identified and the uterine tubes are inseminated.  The patient is surgically repaired and recovered from anaesthesia.  This procedure is highly invasive and requires considerable anatomical skill, knowledge and experience in ensuring the best possible recovery for the patient.  Alarmingly, such a high-risk procedure is being performed by untrained, unskilled lay persons, which is at a compete contravention of the Animal Health and Welfare Act.<\/p><p> With the soaring public demand for designer puppies, the suppliers of these have identified the commercial and practical ease offered by all forms of insemination techniques.  As a result, we are seeing more fertility clinics emerging in an attempt to match the insatiable demand with a faster and on-order supply of designer breed puppies.  Such fertility clinics are highly unregulated places that lack any veterinary or professional contribution.  In essence, they are dungeons of misery for many animals, as the unskilled, untrained people there perform invasive and illegal acts such as blood sampling, invasive swabbing and, in cases, the highest-risk surgical insemination procedure.  It is also believed among many veterinary professionals that Caesarean sections are being performed in some such fertility centres, which, in itself, is a highly disturbing concept.  Attempting to subject any animal to such invasive surgery without the appropriate skills, procedures or medication is a gross violation of the most serious nature.  The emergence of such unregulated and abhorrent fertility clinics has been mirrored across the UK and Ireland and is a trend which seems to be increasing.  Such facilities are in clear breach of many animal health and welfare laws and Acts, not least the five freedoms that underpin all animal-based legislation globally.  <\/p><p> In addition to compromising animal health and welfare, veterinary procedures are being illegally carried by unqualified lay persons who are in possession of medicines which are only licensed for veterinary use.  In total, the existence of such fertility clinics pose one of the most serious risks to present and future generations of dogs and, as a result, must be tackled head on by the Government.  Public education, awareness and vigilance regarding the existence of such centres must also be prioritised.  <\/p><p> Coupled with the emergence of fertility clinics, is the re-emergence of ear cropping in the past 18 months, in particular.  This hideous practice is solely driven by a human desire to create a better looking dog, where floppy ears do not conform to such a preposterous notion.  As with designer breeds, the driving force behind the demand for ear cropped dogs is purely and simply people.  People are choosing such dogs based on looks entirely and, in some cases, ignorant of the abject cruelty inflicted on the poor dogs in cosmetically designing such ears.  Ear cropping is an absolutely cruel, wholly unnecessary and purely cosmetic procedure.  There is no scientific, biological or logical justification for such a barbaric act.  It is shunned among all my professional colleagues and it needs to be shunned by every citizen of this country.  There is no place for such a procedure in modern Irish society and it is harrowing to think that such brutality is taking place out of public sight.  Ear cropping is happening in facilities without any veterinary supervision and without anaesthetic or even pain relief.  It is without doubt one of the most callous and visceral forms of animal cruelty.  Removing a dog&rsquo;s ears not only deprives it anatomically, but it also severely restricts its ability to communicate and express itself.  Dogs use their body language, and ears especially, as a means of expressing their emotions, and removing part or all their ears has a catastrophic effect on their overall quality of life.  I believe that the term \"ear cropping\" should actually be replaced with the term \"ear chopping\", as that better represents the lack of humanity and absolute brutality involved.  Without doubt, a hotline to Government agencies should exist where such cases or suspected cases can be reported in confidence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022022300002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Kirby","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":8,"content":"<p>We get many opening statements in this committee and I have not, in my term here, come across an opening statement as disturbing as the one Dr. Kirby made, in particular the fact that in Ireland and the UK in 2022, these fertility clinics can operate completely unregulated, according to his report, and I am not questioning the accuracy of it in any regard.  We have the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and many justifiable rules on animal welfare, and rightly so, but is there any policing of these fertility clinics?  If there was a rogue veterinarian on the bovine side, he would very quickly be found out and prosecuted.

Certainly, veterinary colleagues and myself who all see puppies coming in their door every day of the week often wonder where they came from.  We live in an era where, as I alluded to, the demand is so great that people on the supply side are doing everything to supply as many puppies as they can.  With that, I am sceptical as to the sources and origins of some of these puppies is, to say the least.  That fits in with the wider issue we have of unregulated puppy farms with industrial-scale breeding.  The lack of standards and care that are exhibited by those breeding practices fit like a glove on a hand with these practices such as artificial insemination, ear cropping and various other procedures, which are completely unregulated as well.  Again, it is part of the wider pet sector.  It is impossible for it to be completely policed, but there have to be greater efforts in determining where puppies are coming from because that is a classic avenue to get back to the root cause of some of these issues as well.<\/p> <p>  As I said, to quantify the exact the numbers is very difficult, but we have heard of facilities where the public were aware of them and Garda sergeants certainly were notified of the existence of them.  Again, there was no veterinary involvement in any of these.  These are people who are doing this of their own accord, seizing the opportunity to extort from people who want puppies quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022022300002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Kirby"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I will bring in Senator Boylan first because she is the one who looked to have this subject brought before the committee and it merits serious discussion, so I will allow her to go first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022022300002#C00100","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  I appreciate that.  I know the work Dr. Kirby is doing with PetBond is exceptional.  I recommend anybody who wants to buy a puppy to avail of the support of that site.  Surgical artificial insemination is a very invasive procedure, even if carried out by a vet.  There are also the more concerning issues raised by Dr. Kirby, namely, the possibility that this is happening without vets or anybody qualified.  Would Dr. Kirby say that, even with a vet present, it is something that should be limited in its uses because of its invasive nature?  I know it is used quite a lot in greyhound racing as well as in the puppy farms.<\/p> <p>  The other issue is the requirement to register only breeding bitches.  A dog breeding establishment has to register only if it has six or more bitches.  Do we need to move on this?  The purpose of these sessions is to look at how fit for purpose the law is.  Do we need to move to requiring anybody keeping stud dogs to register?  It is not hard to find them on Facebook.  One individual whom I will not name is making about &euro;250,000 per year in stud fees of bulldogs.  Does Dr. Kirby think we need to require stud dogs to be registered?<\/p> <p>  My next question concerns designer breeds and the breeding of dogs that are very different in size and nature.  Aside from the fact this must be done through artificial insemination, which is an invasive procedure, what are the implications for the dogs that are born out of those mismatches?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022022300002#C00200","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645574400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Surgical insemination is certainly an invasive procedure, and by that we mean opening into a body cavity.  Obviously, a dog needs a general anaesthetic.  That carries a risk.  We do not give a general anaesthetic very lightly because of the obvious risks it carries, which are the same ones for an animal as for a human.  That is one factor that must always be considered.  Is it critical that this procedure be done?  You would assess the risk of using a general anaesthetic.  You then have the actual procedure, which involves entering a body cavity.  There is a risk of contamination, surgical injury as you are performing the procedure, haemorrhage and other complications.  Even when it is performed in a controlled, sterile surgical environment, it does carry risks.  When we look where the practice is being done in an unregulated and uncontrolled environment by an unskilled, untrained person, the risk of something going wrong is infinitely higher.<\/p> <p>  What we must bear in mind is that even if it is legal in Ireland, is it something at which we need to look more closely and ask whether there is a place for it, and if there is, why and how should it be done?  We need to have this conversation, which is the purpose of discussing this topic here today.  We must also bear in mind that, even though there are certain licences around dog breeding and certain establishments, there is a bigger picture where the majority of puppies are coming from that case.  Similarly, there is the unregulated and uncontrolled sector of it.  Many of the puppies born are selectively bred, such as French bulldogs.  Many of these dogs are not designed for breeding purposes.  They have inherent anatomical deficiencies that mean they are more likely to require Caesarean sections.  If they are being bred in these unregulated and uncontrolled facilities, who is carrying out these procedures on them?  We note there are reports of untrained people performing such procedures, which is highly disturbing.  This is where due diligence is needed to quantify and assess how that area can be tackled as well.<\/p> <p>  Dog breeding establishments with six or more breeding bitches on the premises require licences under the Dog Breeding Establishments Act.  What is the merit in the number six?  We need far more discussion around the whole concept and I am happy to be a part of that at any point.  I agree that in respect of stud dogs, when we look at the number of puppies, we assess their welfare and health.  Again, the genetic contribution of the sire is as important as the dam, but it is an area nobody even bothers to refer to.  The Senator is right.  It is certainly contributing to a lot of the problems.  When we look at the problems some of these brachy breeds are having, for example, French bulldogs, there is an initiative called BOAS, brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome, where you can test specific breed lines, the dam and the sire to see whether they are suitable for breeding.  This is something PetBond certainly encourages.  We will be introducing more initiatives around that because many of these problems can be avoided.  As the Senator rightly said, by introducing these tests on the sire but also on the dam side, we can alleviate and prevent a lot of the problems.  With the number of puppies being bred in Ireland every year, the size of the demand for stud dogs is huge as well, and I think some control needs to be introduced because this is half of the story and it is certainly half of the problem.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the third point about designer breeds, we are talking about breeds like French bulldogs, many of the brachy breeds in general or Shih Tzus.  They are along the very pedigree-generated lines, while at the other end of the spectrum we are looking at Pomeranians crossed with Huskies, Cavachons and Cockapoos, which are poodles crossed with cocker spaniels.  Again, it is not like mixing two paints and getting a specific colour.  When you mix these together, you essentially get a genetic cocktail.  One of the greatest examples of where all of this is going wrong is in clinical practice.  We are seeing a lot of dogs coming in our doors with behavioural issues.  When we start to look at the root cause of these behavioural issues, we find they are underlying health problems.  We have dogs in pain or with health issues we have not seen previously because we are getting these genetic mixes that are constantly being introduced by people to feed a demand for these designer breed dogs.  As a result, dogs are presenting with these bizarre behavioural issues.  What we are trying to do is see what we can do to help these dogs in the short term, but there certainly needs to be a longer term strategy and far greater awareness of the consequences of people demanding these breeds and people then supplying these breeds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022022300002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Kirby"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I compliment Senator Boylan on raising this issue.  I concur with the Chairman's statement.  I was horrified reading Dr. Kirby's statement.  This is not to question its content in any way, all of which I accept.  We had submissions from the Department and the Veterinary Council of Ireland, VCI.  I took it that both of them were going to be here this evening.  The questions I had prepared were for them based on Dr. Kirby's submission.  By virtue of the fact they are not here, and that was my misunderstanding of the situation, I might run some of them by Dr. Kirby and get further elaboration from him.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Dr. Kirby's description of what I would call backstreet clinics, medicines are being used.  We had a lot of deliberation over the past year on the European veterinary medicines regulation.  At this stage, a farmer must have a prescription for anti-parasitic medicines just dosing for worms.  It was made quite clear to us that nobody can buy or import these medicines without being registered and recognised by the VCI.  Where are these medicines coming from?  How are these people getting their hands on the medicines that would be required to carry out these operations?<\/p><p>Is it an issue for customs as much as for anybody else?<\/p><p> Mr. Kirby mentioned, in his opening statement, the raising of public awareness of this issue, which was a point I definitely intended to raise with the Department.  I will be honest and declare my ignorance or naivety, as one could describe it, that either of these things was happening and I certainly was not aware of the resulting consequences and volume of artificial insemination and ear cropping.  We need to raise public awareness of the issue.  There would be people like me who, if they were to go with a family member to buy a dog whose ears were cropped, would not be aware of how or why that happened or that it was not the natural shape of the ear of that breed of dog.  Until the end user or final purchaser is fully aware of how such a dog got to the condition it is in, with the enormous pain and trauma it would have endured to end up looking like it does, we cannot say \"stop\" to that while there is a market.  If there was a strong publicity campaign highlighting the issues Mr. Kirby has raised and more public awareness of them, I would say people would say \"No\" and would not purchase the dog in question.  The questions were based on Mr. Kirby's submission but, as I said, they were intended for the Department and the Veterinary Council of Ireland, VCI.  Mr. Kirby might comment on where I am coming from on these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022022300002#C00400","speaker":"1651","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645574400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I will speak on my own behalf.  Certainly, without doubt, the drugs that would be used where a surgical procedure would be done are what we call controlled drugs.  They are medicines that would only be licensed for use by a veterinary surgeon such as anaesthetics and pain relief drugs.  The question is where some people would be accessing those medicines.  The most likely scenario is that many of these drugs would be imported.  There are reports of that with respect to generic drugs.  For example, when a drug is launched, it gets a period of exclusivity and then the generic drugs come on the market.  There are always reports that when a generic drug is launched there are counterfeit versions of that generic drug on the market.  That is not a new feature of medicines.  That has existed for years in animal health in particular.  I imagine these drugs would be counterfeit generics of licensed drugs on the market.  There are laboratories capable of producing those drugs.  Scientists can reverse engineer them and produce them.  They will make their way on to the market in some shape or form, most likely through importation.  It is important to realise many of these facilities probably would not even have those drugs available.  They would be using human drugs.  People have given various human medicines to animals. Some of the breeding establishments do that to control the fertility of dogs and use pain relieving drugs.  Some people will raid their human drug cabinet to see if those drugs will work on a dog with the consequent major risk and side effects of that for any animal.  That is what I would say about those control medicines.<\/p> <p>  On raising public awareness of ear cropping, there was a very good drive to cut out ear cropping and make the public aware of it the UK in late 2021 with the Cut the Crop campaign.  The word \"cut\" was really effective.  As I said, I would almost replace the wording with \"Chop the Crop\" because it must be that stark.  It is quite a visceral comment to make and it must be that raw that it captures people&rsquo;s emotions such that they think it is not a procedure we should accept and that if we see it, it is abnormal.  It comes down to education on what is normal and abnormal, and what is acceptable based on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022022300002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Kirby"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I cannot get over some of what Mr. Kirby said in his opening statement.

We are trying to bring in new breed standards where we say this is what the norm should be for this dog, its nose and airways need to be this wide and this long and anything that is different or less than that does not conform.  Therefore, we would have some benchmarking for breeders and everybody involved in that sector of pedigree dog breeding.  If we look at the other end, where this also applies, we would have cavachons, cookapoos and pomskies, which are pomeranians crossed with huskies.  Many people would refer to those breeds as designer breeds also, even though there are no pedigrees whatsoever with these dogs.  Some people would argue and say we crossed a pedigree poodle with a pedigree cocker spaniel but it is a completely new breed that is being created.  What health and behavioural issues will it have?

Also, as the Deputy said, it would take away some of the stigma associated with certain breeds.  It does not glamorise certain terms.  That is where the public education about this comes in.  Sometimes we must be brutally honest about what it is, call it for what it is and then deal with the issues around that.

Where a single unit or a batch is produced in the manufacturing plant of whatever company that makes this drug, that is not traced right down the chain to the end user nor is there an upstream of information back to the producer that says: \"We have got a log of every single entry point where this drug was used and, therefore, we can record, we have documented and we can prove that the drug [be it a bottle or vial that was manufactured] was used in X, Y or Z facility.\"  That chain of events does not exist in animal health.  I certainly know from the larger animal side that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is introducing a much better system where the specific use of drugs can be recorded and documented.  On the companion animal side, that does not exist at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022022300002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Kirby"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":23,"content":"<p>How common was the problem prior to the surge in this practice in the past 18 months?

With public awareness and education the practice was no longer justifiable.  As I said, there was no logical or biological reason for the procedure, and that was a huge driver in making people accept and realise that there was no practical purpose to continuing the practice.  However, in more recent times, particularly just pre-Covid, the practice re-emerged.  It fits in with all of the desired aesthetics.  Many of these dogs are now bred purely for their looks and there is no other logical reason for them.  This fits in with the idea that dogs with short ears that are not floppy are deemed to be more attractive.  These animals are just clickbait and people use them to increase their profile on social media.  As sad as that sounds, there is an animal welfare consequence and that applies to these dogs as well.<\/p> <p>  Can we convey the message to people that the practice is abnormal?  Like what happens with a lot of these animal health and welfare issues, people can stop the practice by voting with their feet and saying that the look is abnormal and unacceptable.

I have a husky dog and I am beyond puzzled as to why somebody would subject an animal to this torture.  I find the situation really disturbing and upsetting.<\/p> <p>  Some of my questions have been asked and I want to discuss the demand for these animals.  Anecdotally, I know through social media, that one sees images of cavapoos and all these types of dogs.  When I take my dog for its daily walk I see dogs of mixed breed everywhere and that situation became more apparent in the last couple of years because people got dogs during the pandemic.  Now that the pandemic is over there is a sense that a lot of these dogs have behavioural issues, and I found what Dr. Kirby said about this earlier really interesting.  He said that a lot of these people who paid a huge amount of money for these types of dogs now find that they cannot manage them.  In addition, if people have returned to work, these dogs have become more unmanageable.  Now we have nearly a tsunami of dogs that have been handed back to the animal rescue organisations or dumped.  Has Dr. Kirby seen evidence of this disturbing situation?  I have heard, anecdotally, about dogs being abandoned; is that prevalent among those who look after dogs?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Kirby has said that the ear cropping procedure is performed by untrained and unskilled people.  Who are they?  Does he mean the dog breeders or are people brought in to do the job?  Have untrained people set themselves up and told people that they will perform this dangerous procedure?  Is it just the dog breeders who perform this procedure?<\/p> <p>  This is illegal and I noticed the report from the Minister said, I think, that the Department is aware and supportive of a number of Garda led investigations into such activities.  I have only ever heard of one case of people being done for veterinary prescriptions - I will not name them, but some people will appear in court because of the illegal use of veterinary medicines.  People may contradict me but I am fairly certain that it is exceptionally rare that something like this happens, yet these are exceptionally dangerous drugs and not just to animals.  If these drugs are in unskilled and untrained hands then they are dangerous to animals but they are also dangerous for human beings as well.  I get the feeling that the Department places no real importance on this issue.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the breeding of strange looking dogs, I was extremely upset when I saw one quite recently.  I saw a poor dog that had an enormous head, a very thin body and it was obvious that two different breeds had been combined.  The head was one breed and the back of it was another breed but the poor dog could not hold its head up.  Sadly, the dog was promoted online as a show dog.  When I read the comments I discovered that they absolutely damned the person who showed the images of the dog.  People declared that the dog was not normal looking and that it was completely inappropriate to match the two breeds.  Surely such bad practice is illegal?  As Dr. Kirby said, there should be standards that govern what breeds can and cannot be cross-bred.  I am shocked that there are no regulations to govern this issue considering all of the animal welfare aspects.<\/p> <p>  I notice that the Department, when it sent its report, stated that aspects of artificial insemination in greyhounds may be carried out by non-veterinarians subject to licence and veterinary oversight.  That leads me to ask why greyhounds are exempt.  That seems illogical to me.<\/p> <p>  Much of the root cause of this matter is that the legislation, particularly for dogs, covers three Departments - the Department of Rural and Community Development, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and I cannot remember the third Department.  The main thing that must come from this debate is that we make a difference to the lives of dogs and improve regulations.  Therefore, we must ensure that one Department deals with this matter.  We also need to ensure that proper resources are provided to ensure that whatever is done is safe and legal.  I agree with Dr. Kirby that we need a public awareness campaign to alert people to the fact that the practice is cruel and horrific.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022022300002#E00500","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645574400,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Absolutely, I think the concept that one single Department would take control is something that should urgently be done.  It makes absolute sense.  It would reduce time lags, drift and the lack of certain things being done according to the demand for them.  If that could be prioritised, I would see it as top of the list.  Many things will stem organically from that as a result, so it would be a very positive move.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy.  There are two ends of the spectrum and there are many issues in between, but we have to start somewhere.  We will not have everything resolved in 2022 but we have to start somewhere.  For example, the Deputy referred to the issue of dogs that look abnormal.  Many of these dogs are coming from units that are breeding 300 and 400 bitches and they are breeding them endlessly throughout their lives - they are literally churning them out.  They are commodities and, as I said, they are just seen as a passport to wealth.  These animals are a lot more than that.  We need to start having that discussion around how it can be acceptable in society that 300 or more bitches could be kept in any facility.  It goes back to the previous point about the number six in some of these establishments.  All of that needs to be debated.  We need to get to the granular level of detail to see what makes sense here, what is going to effect change for the lives of these animals, and then start building that up into something that can be put into practice.  There should be a phased approach to all of this.  With one Department and a phased approach taking bite-size chunks, a lot of progress can be made very quickly.  I am convinced of that.<\/p> <p>  To go back to the point raised by the Deputy on the number of dogs being relinquished, I know from the fantastic work Dogs Trust Ireland is doing that it is bursting at the seams at the moment with dogs being returned by people who got them during lockdown.  What that highlights is the value of dogs but also that we need to start educating people before they get a dog in the first place.  As I said in my presentation, it is not a simple click and collect service.  This is a sentient living being and that has to be taken into account as well.  Part of what PetBond does is to make sure people are in the right stage of their lives and are educated before they get a pet in the first place.  We have to be aware of this.  If something else happens in society in the future, are we going to see the same insatiable demand by people for pets?  They are a very good fallback and a very good emotional comfort, but it is not acceptable that when normal life resumes, the pet is usually the first individual within the family that is going to suffer the consequence.  Unfortunately, we are seeing that transpire at the moment.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised a point about people performing various procedures with regard to insemination.  These people have a little knowledge about it, and there is probably nothing more dangerous in life than somebody with a little knowledge who thinks they know a lot more than they actually do.  People invariably do not have any formal qualifications.  They think that once they have observed somebody doing something remotely similar, they can have a go and do it themselves.  I would not say there is a specific profile of any one individual but there are certainly people with very basic knowledge who are attending such procedures.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the veterinary medicines, if there are facilities like this out there that are breeding huge numbers of dogs, without a shadow of a doubt, we have to ask how are these people breeding so many so frequently?  Would insemination not be a lot easier, given it is a lot more cost efficient and time efficient?  What is going on within some of the units that are breeding large numbers?  That question has to be asked, as well as where the medicines around those units are coming from.  I would certainly consider importation is the main route there.<\/p> <p>  These are all areas where, with one single division and one Department doing this in phases and bite-size chunks, we could target those areas where we could get a result and then go on sequentially to the next issue.  In that way, we could make a lot of progress on these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022022300002#F00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Kirby"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I will allow two quick questions from Senator Boylan and Deputy Browne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022022300002#F00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I will be quick as I know we are under time pressure.

It is interesting that when I put a question to the Minister and the Department, they said they were not aware of any animal welfare concerns around surgical insemination.  This is something the committee needs to come back to when we have the Minister and the Department in.<\/p> <p>  My question is on ear cutting and how we strengthen enforcement against that.  One issue is public awareness and making it almost that people would be shunned if they were walking around with a dog that has this procedure done to it.  When the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, DSPCA, representatives were before the committee, they were talking about the potential of a phased-in ban.  If somebody has a dog, the dog could live out its life but we would ban the importation and ownership of a dog with cropped ears and that would be a way to address this.  Under the current law, the person would practically have to be caught in the act of cropping the ears.  I would like to hear Dr. Kirby&rsquo;s view on that and how we could have better enforcement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022022300002#F00300","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>The Department had given the impression that the dogs with cropped ears were being exhibited at shows and so on.

For any procedure like chopping, there must be disincentives around that regardless of where the people see the dogs, be it out in public, at a show or wherever else.  If there is a controlled environment where there are a lot of dogs, it should be possible that the area is regulated to some extent.  I know from discussing this with many dog breeders that, for example, for the French bulldog as a breed standard, it is no longer normal or acceptable for those dogs to have short noses.  Therefore, if any of those dogs are seen at shows, or if any judge is seen to award that dog a rosette to say it is a really good dog, and it does not conform to what is now acceptable as a breed, then there are implications.  Likewise, we need to do the same thing for ear cropping.  If any dog is in an arena or any public space and has ear cropping, or it is suspected the dog was ear cropped, the key stakeholders need to call that out and act on it straight away.  I would absolutely agree with that.  The majority of people are members of the public who are observing dogs from a distance in the public arena, so that fits in with it as well.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Senator Boylan that the phased-out approach is the way we are going to do it.  With many of these changes we are discussing in the different areas, it is going to be a phased-out approach.  It almost has to be done in tandem with public education.  If the two are done in parallel, we are more likely to get a successful outcome but, as I said, we have to educate the public, particularly about ear cropping.  For example, Dogs Trust did a very effective campaign in schools to educate children.  Many things with dogs are visual.  The Cut the Crop campaign from the British Veterinary Association was pushing it strongly and striking imagery was used, which was very effective.  Dogs are very amenable to visual imagery and this helps retain things in people's minds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022022300002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Kirby"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Kirby for participating in today's meeting.

I am here in my role as chair of Hemp Cooperative Ireland, which was set up in May 2018 by myself, other farmers and interested parties.  It came about because we shared a vision of the great potential for hemp cultivation in Ireland.  We now have 262 shareholders, made up of farmers, processors and supporters of the industry.  We have eight board members of various backgrounds who volunteer their time as they are passionate about the development of the industry.<\/p> <p>  In my comments today, I will set out why hemp is an important crop for Ireland, how it can be taken up across Irish agriculture and how hemp cultivation can lead to new jobs through high value products across a range of sectors including health products, food, clothing and construction.  I will also touch on hemp and its environmental benefits in bioremediation and adaptation to climate change and its role in the just transition for our farming communities.  <\/p> <p>   Hemp Cooperative Ireland supports farmers to access resources, equipment and markets through a national body and four regional hubs, covering the four provinces of Ireland.  Increasing the amount of hemp grown here can help Ireland become a leader in carbon sequestration as we strive to meet our 2030 commitments.  Hemp on average sequesters 10 tonnes of net carbon dioxide per hectare, so 10,000 ha sown would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 100,000 tonnes per annum, incredibly in a four month window. <\/p> <p>   Economic valuations show that on average hemp has a 39.5% higher gross margin in comparison to winter wheat.  In recent years the area dedicated to hemp cultivation in the EU has increased from less than 20,000 ha in 2015 to 35,000 ha in 2019, a 75% increase.  France is the largest producer accounting for 70% of EU production.<\/p><p> The hemp stalk is separated into fibre and shiv, the shiv being the woody core.  The fibre is used for clothing, textiles, insulation and, more recently, biocomposites.  The woody core of the plant is used for building products, including hempcrete, fibre board and insulation.  Furthermore, it is used as bedding material, biomass and paper.<\/p><p> The seed from the hemp plant can be used in many ways.  The oil from the seed is in food, body care products and technical products.  The omega-6 to omega-3 ratio in hempseed oil is 3:1, which is considered to be optimal for human health.  The seed cake can be used as an animal feed-rich flour that is 33.5% protein.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine stated in 2014 that the dependence of Ireland and the EU on imported protein sources such as soya bean meal had initiated a legislative and political push towards the development of indigenous plant&ndash;based protein sources.  There is a great opportunity to use hemp to improve this situation, considering that 415,000 tonnes of soya bean meal was imported in 2020.  The leaf and flower of the plant contains many bioactive compounds suitable for health products.<\/p><p> By developing a hemp industry in Ireland, Hemp Cooperative Ireland forecasts an immediate and lasting environmental impact by reducing the volume of high-polluting fossil fuels required for industry.  Of equal importance is the potential of hemp for rural regeneration.  An indigenous hemp industry has the potential to create 80,000 rural jobs according to a recent report from Teagasc.  This is direct and indirect job creation and is based on the premise that legislative frameworks be put in place and State bodies be willing to fund the industry.  For every &euro;8.9 million invested in the sector, somewhere in the range of 200 to 400 direct and indirect jobs will be created in agriculture.  To create 10,250 jobs annually, the hemp industry would need to attract an average of &euro;150 million investment each year.  Hemp Cooperative Ireland has made recent efforts to commence dialogue with State funding agencies like Enterprise Ireland and LEADER to ascertain what potential support could be available.  However, our efforts have been met with resistance.  At these early stages of trying to grow the hemp industry in Ireland, Government assistance will be a key component of the tri-party funding that will be required to help invest in machinery and infrastructure.  Hemp Cooperative Ireland also intends to raise funding through a members share issue and private investment.<\/p><p> There is a housing crisis in Ireland and we maintain that hemp is part of the solution.  Buildings are possible using hemp shiv with lime as a replacement for concrete, not to mention a solution to retrofitting older cottages.  Hempcrete is CO2 absorbing, fire resistant and breathable.  For example, 2 tonnes of hemp shiv will be sufficient to build an average house and will sequester 3.7 tonnes of CO2.  Hemp can also retrofit our existing housing stock and there are many homes in our rural towns and villages that could benefit.<\/p><p> According to the CSO in 2016, since only 5% of Irish farmers are under 35 years of age and 30% are over 65, there need to be as many incentives as possible to entice young people into becoming farmers and for this occupation to be a long-term source of income.  We as an organisation promote hemp as a rotational crop for all farming systems.  It is an ideal break crop that creates an added income stream.  If hemp was recognised in any carbon credit scheme, it would enable a just transition for our rural communities.  There is a great deal of agricultural activity on drained peatland, which by its very nature is a major contributor to carbon emissions.  It is unjust to suggest that these farmers should be told to rewet these lands when they could instead be offered the opportunity to grow hemp to initiate this just transition.<\/p><p> Hemp decontaminates soil as a natural phytoremediation crop.  It promotes biodiversity as a late-flowering source of pollen for bees.  Hemp grows well in organic systems and improves soil structure.  It also needs no artificial fertiliser, is not reliant on pesticides, fungicides or herbicides and increases certain crop yields by 25% while limiting weeds and, therefore, reliance on spraying.  We outlined our vision to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine in more detail when we responded to its consultation call last summer.  This submission was endorsed by the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, and the Irish Grain Growers group.  Hemp fits neatly into the emerging bio-economy and is an opportunity that we should not miss, but it currently cannot be supported because it is not included in policy.<\/p><p> The global hemp industry is growing and Ireland is in a unique position to become a major player in the EU.  Of the major issues facing Ireland, hemp is uniquely positioned to provide part of the solution.  A hemp industry supported by the Government will create green jobs in rural communities, entice young farmers and provide an additional income stream to all farmers, thereby helping Irish farmers and businesses to meet carbon goals while integrating into their existing farming systems.  The time to support the hemp industry is now and Hemp Cooperative Ireland is ready to engage with the Government at national and local levels.  Without Government support, Ireland will be left behind our EU counterparts that have flourishing hemp industries.<\/p><p> To summarise the needs of and barriers to the industry, we need engagement at government and local levels, funding, collaboration, and research and development.  Teagasc has done some research and development and there is a European Innovation Partnership, EIP, project ongoing in Loop Head, County Clare called Hemp 4 Soil.  We have a lack of infrastructure and support for hubs.  Legislation and funding are also lacking.  There needs to be education about industrial hemp and insurance companies do not want to cover hemp products.<\/p><p> The benefits of using hemp include import substitution, rural regeneration and job creation, in which respect there is a Teagasc report that I would refer to.  They also include the environment and CO2 sequestration, soil regeneration and rotational crops, which is of interest to farmers.<\/p><p>In addition, it is of benefit in housing retrofits and plant-based proteins. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022022300002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Kate Carmody","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Allen to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022022300002#J00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645574400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for this opportunity to discuss the development of the Irish hemp industry.  I am the director of Hemp Federation Ireland, HFI, which is Ireland's national hemp industry stakeholder body.  I am joined by my colleague Mr. McCabe, who is a member of our advisory board on agriculture.  He is an organics and permaculture expert and has grown and processed more than 80% of all hemp grown in Ireland in the past two decades.<br\/><br\/>The Irish hemp industry is one of the oldest in the European Union, with a small but fully operational supply chain since the 1990s.  Irish hemp farmers and industry operators are among Europe's leading industry authorities.  Europe's oldest dedicated hemp retail outlet is situated in Dublin.<br\/><br\/>There are nine EU statutory instruments establishing the legal basis for the operation of the European agricultural market in hemp and hemp-derived products, all of which are immediately applicable to Ireland.  Article 34 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union further protects the integrity of the operation of the Single Market in hemp and derived products.  In addition, three European Court of Justice rulings going back to 2008 all positively clarify various aspects of the operation of the EU hemp market.  The tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, content in hemp is not illegal under Irish misuse of drugs legislation as a direct consequence of the primacy of EU law.<br\/><br\/>The support of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for Commission regulations establishing the EU hemp industry has driven the development of the Irish hemp sector since the 1970s.  Indeed, during Ireland's Presidency of the EU in 2004, the extension of trade in hemp between member states was a priority for the then Minister for Agriculture and Food, Joe Walsh of Fianna F&aacute;il.  Mr. Walsh secured EU regulatory amendments which would serve to extend the operation of the EU agricultural hemp market into the future.<br\/><br\/>In November 2020, a particularly clear European Court of Justice decision in case C-663\/18, also known as the Kanavape ruling, again confirmed the legality and scientific safety of hemp and derived products in Europe.  The supremacy of the European Court of Justice in interpreting both EU law and the treaties is acknowledged by Ireland and all Irish regulators.  Indeed, on 20 October 2021, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Thomas Byrne, advised the Oireachtas committee of Ireland's policy in this regard, stating:<\/p> <blockquote> \tAs EU member states, there is an onus on us all to comply with determinations of the European Court of Justice with a view to maintaining our shared legal order. As part of membership of the Union, it is also essential that member states accept the primacy of European Union law, which is a principle of the European Union going back to a time prior to when Ireland was a member. <\/blockquote> <p>The website of the European Commission website carries the following clarifying information on hemp:  <\/p> <blockquote> \tHemp (<i>Cannabis sativa Linn<\/i>) is a species in the Cannabaceae family in which the level of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is very low, according to the provisions under the common agricultural policy (CAP).  Hemp is grown primarily for its industrial uses and there are 75 different hemp varieties registered in the EU catalogue.  Due to the very low level of THC, hemp complying with the provisions of the CAP is not used to produce narcotic drugs. <\/blockquote> <p>Much of the present confusion in Ireland in respect of hemp results from the transfer of primary responsibility for the agricultural hemp sector to the Department of Health.  Much of the discourse emerging from the health committee discussions on medicinal cannabis in the context of our farm crop and products adds to this confusion.  In November 2016, Dr. Lorraine Nolan of the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, appeared before the Oireachtas health committee to discuss access to medicinal cannabis.  In her opening statement she advised, &quot;Cannabis is prohibited other than in specified circumstances where all activities relating to cultivation, manufacture and supply of cannabis, and products containing THC, are subject to licence.&quot;  However, the licensing procedures described by Dr. Nolan apply only to cannabis and have never applied to the trace amounts of 0.2% THC naturally found in agricultural hemp.  Medicines and food exist in entirely separate regulatory frameworks.<br\/><br\/>In 2017, Dr. Nolan again attended the Oireachtas health committee to discuss access to medicinal cannabis.  On that occasion, Mr. Eugene Lennon, principal officer in the medicines and controlled drugs unit in the Department of Health, was also in attendance.

In fact, in 2019 Hemp Federation Ireland asked the HPRA if it would license agricultural foods with trace amounts of THC.  The HPRA replied in writing that it did not do so and did not envisage a situation in which it would issue such a licence as it does not consider hemp-derived foods containing trace amounts of THC to fall within the scope of the misuse of drugs regulatory framework.<\/p> <p>  From an agricultural perspective, the European Commission formally recognises the capacity of the hemp industry to meet EU CAP, farm to fork and climate policy objectives.<\/p><p>The financial benefits of hemp cultivation to EU farmers and rural communities are also highlighted by the Commission and, in both of these contexts, the Commission advises that all uses of hemp are important to consider when we look at the future development of the EU industry.  In 2021, hemp was included in Article 75 of the CMO regulation by the Commission, and the THC content in EU hemp in the field will go to 0.3% in January 2023.  A Commission regulation establishing EU authorised limits for THC in hemp foods in Europe is already written and goes to final stage scrutiny before the EU Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed next week.<\/p><p> The Commission's support for the exceptional competencies of the hemp plant are very important considerations at this seminal moment of transformation in agricultural systems and practices.  Europe is leading global efforts to tackle climate change under land use, land use change and forestry, LULUCF.  The EU carbon cycles initiative is specifically geared to provide a basis for global buy-in and it envisages a globally operational carbon cycles framework going forward.  The objective is to reform completely land use management and our systems of agricultural food production and to repair our soils.  The second remit for farmers under the scheme is to grow biomass, which will green global industry, providing new fibre materials to replace fossil carbon.  The carbon cycles system is designed hierarchically, with high protein, low energy vegetable food production at the top of the cascade.  The world is witnessing the birth of a new currency, a new means of exchange, backed by a carbon reserve that farmers will hold in their lands.<\/p><p> Hemp sequesters more CO2 than any forest can and it is also the most complete plant-based protein known to man.  In every context of the carbon cycle cascade, the crop is beyond compare.  These competencies must be fully integrated at every point along the supply chain, from farm to fork and from seed to industrial solution, integrating farming and industrial practice at local level for a carbon neutral Irish, EU and global economy.  Hemp is one of the most valuable agricultural commodities in the context of carbon budgets and the context of climate change.<\/p><p> The European Commission, global corporations and global banks have called repeatedly for European member states to ensure the carbon cycles programme is launched in a completely open, honest, ethical and transparent way to inspire farmers with confidence and security in the transition process.  The Commission has insisted over and over again, at the very highest level, that the economic benefits of the new system must go directly to farmers and that those economic benefits must constitute additional farm income.  As the roll-out of the EU carbon cycle initiative gets under way across Europe, in Ireland earlier applications of unlawful economic sanctions by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, have enabled the Department to propose a development plan for our industry where two thirds of our traditional incomes no longer exist.<\/p><p> Hemp Federation Ireland would like to expand on how the environmental aspects of this industry actually function and how the industry should be developed to best capture the fully integrated environmental, economic and social returns for our country.  Today, however, our submission must focus on the extraordinary regulation of the hemp industry in Ireland since 2018.  From that time, almost every rule and regulation governing the operation of our industry has been changed without prior consultation or subsequent explanation.  This was achieved by suspending Ireland's observance of EU laws in direct and indirect ways, steering all conversations away from the agricultural and environmental potentials of the crop.  The Oireachtas record shows that the long-standing official representation of the hemp industry by Irish Ministers for Agriculture, Food and the Marine changed suddenly and dramatically in 2019.  All mention of our food produce is removed and the Misuse of Drugs Act is invoked for the first time, alongside terms such as &ldquo;strictest levels of control&rdquo;.  This change effectively rebrands hemp as cannabis and transfers responsibility for our agricultural industry from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to the Department of Health.<\/p><p> The Department of Health then began transforming the regulatory framework surrounding our agricultural markets and supply chains in consultation with pharmaceutical and tobacco companies.  No regard was ever shown for democratic principles throughout, none of the regulatory interventions have ever been justified by science, as is required by EU law, and, as a result, our national farm-based sector is no longer able to function.  The Irish farmers and operators encouraged into the sector by previous Irish Ministers for agriculture, with the support of Departments and Government agencies, are now facing 14-year prison sentences for possessing the very same CAP-regulated farm crops they were previously encouraged to embrace.<\/p><p> The lobbying returns show that, throughout this entire time, Irish Ministers, party leaders, senior civil servants and successive Ministers for health were engaging in consultations on hemp with a global tobacco corporation now repositioning to capture the emerging global hemp markets.  These same public officials have consistently refused to engage with Irish hemp farmers and business owners operating in the sector for decades - the people who built this agricultural industry and who earn their living in the sector.<\/p><p> In 2020, commercial control over all elements of our agricultural crop, our farm revenues and our industry value chain was transferred by the then Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation to pharmaceutical companies.  Enterprise Ireland removed all access to State enterprise support from all Irish hemp farms and businesses, including Covid-19 supports.  Only pharmaceutical companies can now access business support for any commercial activity related to any part of the EU hemp crop in Ireland.  When questioned in the Dail as to whether industry bodies were consulted beforehand, the then Minister for Finance replied that the Minister for Health decides who the relevant stakeholders are.  Many such issues are described in detail in Hemp Federation Ireland's letter of September 2021 to the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which is available on our website.  I have provided some examples for the information of the committee.<\/p><p> The EU hemp industry is protected under primary EU regulations and Article 34 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, TFEU, and by three separate EU Court of Justice decisions.  The operators who work in the sector on farms and in shops and businesses throughout Ireland are entitled to the protections afforded to all EU citizens under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.  I hope the committee will be able to protect the Irish hemp industry and prevent further transfer of our industry to pharmaceutical companies before the pending High Court review of the matter is decided in Ireland in July.<\/p><p> I thank the committee members for their time and attention in understanding what is a difficult and complex situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022022300002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Chris Allen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I welcome our guests.

The World Health Organization, WHO, and the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence, ECDD, which advises the World Health Organization on policy concerning narcotic substances and the operation of the UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, have stated there is no safety concern regarding any product with a 0.2% THC level.  Indeed, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has stated it has no concern about any product that can possibly be made from the EU-compliant hemp crop.  The issue in Ireland is this new interpretation of the misuse of drugs laws.  Clearly from the presentation I gave the committee and from the Oireachtas record of the Joint Committee on Health, the Department of Health's policymakers in 2017 did not consider this crop to be in any way a narcotic drug.

One is that a farmer must be choosing a seed form the EU novel food seed catalogue.  All of those seeds are guaranteed to be below the 0.2% THC level.  A farmer must also implement checks in fields and adhere to various stringent checks and balances to determine that the cultivation of the crop is in compliance with European regulations.  The 0.2% level is in the EU regulations.<\/p> <p>  The basic decision of the European Court of Justice was as follows.  France had tried to ban some cannabidiol, CBD, products made from hemp because it was illegal in France under the misuse of drugs laws to commercialise any part of the crop other than the seeds and fibre.  The European Court of Justice ruled that hemp-derived CBD made from any part of the plant is a legal product protected by Article 34 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the EU, TFEU, and that no EU member state may prohibit the free marketing of trade in hemp made legally in any other EU member state.

I am an organic dairy farmer and in my experience, there is no trouble getting a licence if one is honest on the form and wants to use hemp for fibre.  I use it as a rotational crop in my farming system.  I used it for bedding for cattle.  I use the seed when I can harvest it to feed pigs.  There is a lot of work going on all over Europe.  I was part of a European focus group looking at soil decontamination and the role of medicinal plants such as hemp in creating value added income for farmers.  It is a no-brainer for the farming community.  I live in north Kerry and before the pandemic, I had a queue of farmers at my kitchen door every week.  They want to bring their children home from all over the world to farm their land but they want them to make money.  They do not want them to lose.  I live in a drained peatland area which is getting wetter and harder to farm.  I do not want farmers having to apply for a licence.  Industrial hemp has very little CBD or THC if it is being grown for fibre.  It is on the drop-down menu for the basic payment now if one wants to grow it for industrial or seed purposes.  I grow if for the fibre, as I said.  Any farmer should be allowed to grow hemp and put it on their basic payment form; end of story.  The people who have to deal with all this paperwork for the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, are probably pulling their hair out with all of the applications.

To give an idea of the scale, 1 acre will supply approximately 100 consumers with food products, while 5 acres will build a house.

A few years ago, I remember we put in questions to try to see if this could be resolved.  To be honest about it, we are facing a brick wall.<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions.  Ms Carmody talked about peaty ground.  I am not an expert but I have talked to people in Clare, Monaghan and different parts who were growing hemp.  They were sowing an acre or maybe 2 or 3 acres.  None of it was large scale; let us put it that way.  I remember at the time that two blades were needed for cutting it, one for cutting it at the butt and another for the tops.  At the time, I saw CLAAS was making a machine for that.  I went to the bother of ringing America, where the machines were, and they cost something like $750,000.  My view is that machinery, such as combines or whatever, could be changed to get the flower part out on an elevator.  That type of machinery will not work on peaty ground; there would be no point.  It would have to be on tracks at the time of year hemp is cut because it would not be dry enough.  Has anything progressed on that?  My memory is that at the time most people were taking the flower and then cutting the other part.  It was the grace of God whether or not people got what they had cut on the ground.  They might be twisting and turning it but they might never get it.  Has anything progressed that way?<\/p> <p>  I presume the representatives are talking about a plan for where we are going with hemp.  At present, it seems to be individuals, in fairness to them, doing their own thing and creating their own markets without any help anywhere.  It needs an awful lot, such as one big operator or co-op coming in to set up the infrastructure that everyone can feed their stuff into for a while or something like that.  Ms Allen referenced a High Court case.  Will she tell me what is involved?  Is she saying that Ireland is basically in contradiction of all European law and not in compliance with the rest of Europe?  She also mentioned a High Court case.

It has been informative, if not a little disjointed.  That is my observation.  I read their submissions and I also took the time to research some of it.<\/p> <p>  I myself have grown hemp.  I am a professional horticulturist.  I worked in the National Botanic Gardens here in Dublin and in Kew and in Canada, and I lived in Greece and that is where I grew it.  My experience of growing hemp was very simple.  Why do we call it a weed?  Effectively, you throw it on the ground.  It must have strong contact with the soil, but it will grow in any soil.  It is a weed.  It is a handy crop and many would like to grow it.  I speak with some experience on it.  There are many varieties and types of hemp, as the witnesses will be aware.<\/p> <p>  Of course, we have the issue around the seed.  There is a real market for growing quality seed.  There are inferior seeds of hemp in Ireland.  I visited places where they have seed and there is a real industry in growing, harvesting and exporting seed.  Many other countries will want our seed and we need to look at this cleverly.  There are many by-products, as Mr. McCabe has said.  I have seen hempcrete and it is very successful.  We have the opportunities for animal bedding.  We see it in the bloodstock industry; I have seen it used successfully in Kildare.  We see it in the poultry sector; I have seen it used effectively in Monaghan.  I have seen it used for industrial matting.  I know nothing about it in terms of mushroom production.  We are always looking at new alternatives in mushroom production and mattings there.  There are many opportunities.  That is why the witnesses do not have to convince me.  There is a wonderful opportunity there when you look at it in terms of fibre, food, feed, both human and animal, in terms of mixes and how that is calibrated out, and then, of course, you have the oil.<\/p> <p>  The biggest problem with this industry is people's lack of understanding of it.  Effectively, hemp is a form of cannabis.  Let us call a spade a spade.  That is what it is.  That is where there arises ignorance to some extent and concern about public health and all the issues around all of that.  Of course, we are aware of the toxicity in terms of the seed and the flower and the restrictions, and how do we destroy the flowers of hemp.  I refer to the role of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of licensing and permits.  Of course, there is an element of all that seeping out, and there are problems.  There are many people growing cannabis in Ireland, there are many people growing hemp and there are many people who are irresponsible.  Having said all of that, there are many people who are very responsible.  I see it as an exciting industry.<\/p> <p>  Teagasc has done some amount of work on it, but it is a State agency.  It is cautious and that is the concern.  Going away from this committee, our remit here is agriculture, food and the marine.  Therefore, we must clearly be interested and particularly excited about the opportunities in terms of an alternative crop, or a short-term or intermittent crop.  Clearly, we need to do much more work.  We need to collaborate with our guests and others in terms of the work and seeing it.<\/p> <p>  They might touch on those issues.  How can we educate people more about this crop?  How can we bring people on board and allay their concerns?  How can we entice farmers and demonstrate to them?  Through education, in Teagasc and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, they will see this as a crop.<\/p> <p>  We are looking for new crops.  We are looking for new agricultural industries.  That is the really exciting part of this.  Clearly, our guests have their own experiences of it.<\/p> <p>  I want to wrap up by saying that I see the benefits of rural regeneration.  I see the benefits of the rural economy.  I see all of the benefits, including the health benefits.  We are all becoming so much more aware of what we eat.  We are what we eat and what we consume.  I see many other benefits and opportunities.<\/p> <p>  This must be regulated.  Like alcohol or any substance, it must be in the hands of people who are highly experienced and responsible.  That is a concern to us.  That is where we have to go.<\/p> <p>  I would like our guests to talk briefly about the issue of seed, the production of seed, their knowledge of that production, and their knowledge of the quality and the certification of that seed because with that there are significant market opportunities.  I thank our guests for their time.  I believe in them.  I believe in the product.  I believe in the real opportunities for agriculture in terms of an additional crop.<\/p> <p>  Hemp is historic.

I would say that is somewhere in or around 10 to 20 mcg per kg body weight per day, not the 1 mcg per kg per day that we are stuck with at present.<\/p> <p>  In fact, our company is paying for research.  There is a European Industrial Hemp Association.  There is a multicompany research project into novel foods that is ongoing at present.  What is interesting is that the full-spectrum products, in other words, the products that contain THC, are actually safer than the CBD isolates.<\/p> <p>  As with alcohol, what is it?  We do not want anybody to be feeling any side effects.  That is not in the interests of the industry.  We want everybody to know what is safe.  It is a labelling issue.

All hemp foods were classified as traditional foods in Europe in 1997.  In 2019 the EU's committee on novel foods had another look at hemp and classified it as a novel food.  That means it falls under EU regulation 2015\/2283.  Ireland now adopts a completely different position.  In Europe one needs to have a novel food authorisation from the European Commission.  That costs somewhere in the region of &euro;3 million.  Our Irish companies and farmers who have been active in the sector for many years now have those applications under way with the European Food Safety Authority.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, has said that Ireland does not agree with Europe that hemp is a novel food.  Hemp remains a traditional food in Ireland.  However, the FSAI then said that under the novel food regulations, it is going to start removing some of the CBD products from the market in Ireland.  Indeed, it has done that and it continues to remove CBD products that have authorisation in Europe.  This means that whatever small amount of potential trade is left to this industry after all of the extraordinary regulation will be gone.  There will be no potential for European trade from Ireland because the products to which Ireland does not apply the novel food regulations would require those regulations to be valid in European markets.  The whole industry is completely unnavigable, even for me as a member of a representative body.

Members should continue to wash their hands, avail of sanitiser outside and inside the committee room, be respectful of other people's physical space, and practise good respiratory etiquette.

The meeting has been convened to consider the Redundancy Payments (Amendment) Bill 2022, which was referred to the select committee by the order of the D&aacute;il on 3 February 2022.  This short and technical Bill will resolve an issue arising regarding some employees who were laid off when Covid-19 restrictions were in place or who may be laid off over the next three-year period.  Periods spent laid-off within the final three years of an employee's service do not count as reckonable service for the purposes of statutory redundancy payments.  This means that a person who was laid off because of essential Covid-19-related restrictions will not have that period counted as reckonable service if he or she is made redundant within three years of the end of the emergency period.  This Bill addresses that issue.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Damien English, who is accompanied by officials from his Department.  Would the Minister of State like to make a short comment on the Bill?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022022300002#A00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and other members for facilitating this Bill.  We are in a position to move it through Committee Stage today, all going well.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the Redundancy Payments (Amendment) Bill.  The Bill provides for a payment from the State which will ensure that workers being made redundant will receive the same statutory redundancy payment as if they had not been laid off due to Covid-19 restrictions.  Under existing redundancy provisions, a period of lay-off within the final three years of service before a worker is made redundant is not allowable as reckonable service.  Therefore, the lay-off period is not counted towards a worker&rsquo;s statutory redundancy payment.<\/p> <p>  Due to the necessary Government decisions to close and restrict certain sectors of our economy, some workers lost the opportunity to accrue reckonable service.  This Bill will provide for a Covid-19-related lay-off payment from the State which, in the event of the worker&rsquo;s redundancy, will cover lay-off periods due to Covid-19 restrictions.  Payments will be made from the Social Insurance Fund.  A worker does not have to have been in receipt of any form of State payment during the lay-off period.  The criteria are simply that the person qualifies for redundancy in the usual way and was laid off because of Covid-19 restrictions.<\/p> <p>  The amount eligible workers will receive will depend on the length of time they were placed on lay-off due to Covid-19 before the date they were made redundant.  The Bill does not change the fact that employers are obliged to pay statutory redundancy, which excludes lay-off periods in the final three years of employment, to eligible workers.  However, employers will not be liable for this additional payment.  The Covid restrictions which caused lay-off situations were completely outside the employers&rsquo; and employees' control.  Imposing this cost on employers would be unfair.  It would also conflict with wider Government policy, which, since the start of the pandemic, has been to minimise financial hardship on businesses and workers during the most challenging of times in order to protect those jobs.<\/p> <p>  This Bill provides the best outcome for both employers and workers.  It will provide the legislative basis for the Department of Social Protection to process applications and make this payment to workers as soon as possible.  It will be an employer-led online application process in the first instance.  This is the most efficient approach from a customer service perspective.  However, in the event an employer fails to make an application, I assure the committee that manual applications from workers will be accepted and they will not lose out.<\/p> <p>  Intensive work is ongoing on the development of the necessary systems, which was raised on Second Stage.  I confirm that officials in the Department of Social Protection expect to open the application process during quarter 2 of this year.  It will be in a position to do that in the next couple of weeks.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and her officials for their important work on this.  I thank Deputies for their contributions on the Bill on the previous stage.  I look forward to today's discussion.  One of the major changes that people asked is in amendment No. 4, which extends the timeline.  I am conscious that Members raised that.  There was unanimous support for this change.  I hope, if the committee accepts the amendment, that it will deal with the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022022300002#A00300","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":216,"content":"<p>A number of amendments tabled on Committee Stage have unfortunately been ruled out of order.

All of mine have been ruled out of order but I want to speak broadly, if I can, to the intention of those amendments.  I understand we cannot get into the substance of them and I do not intend to do that.  The amendments had a single purpose, namely, to deal with the issue of tactical insolvencies.  I fully accept that is not within the scope of this Bill.  Maybe the Minister of State will take a little time to update us on the plan for the action on collective redundancies following insolvency.  I am aware there is some work under way on that.  I got that in a reply to a parliamentary question and it would be helpful if we could hear that.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State is well aware of the issue.  We saw Clerys broken into two companies.  One was the operations and the other was employing the workers.  They never knew they were working for two separate companies.  They only knew they were working for Clerys, which many of them had worked for all their lives and given good and loyal service to.  Then overnight their jobs were gone.  The assets were transferred to the operations company, that was liquidated and the workers were left absolutely high and dry.  A similar but not exactly the same situation happened in Debenhams, but whatever the technicalities of it the upshot is the workers were left high and dry at the end of it.  We saw it with Clerys, La Senza, Paris Bakery and TalkTalk.  They are what are known as tactical insolvencies.  The purpose of the amendments I put forward were to deal with tactical insolvencies and situations whereby companies use the courts to engage in a tactical liquidation.  That means they can avoid paying what are, essentially, their debts.<\/p> <p>  This legislation recognises the fact that, through no fault of their own, workers found themselves on lay-off and they should not find themselves disproportionately impacted by something that was not their fault.  Likewise, in the situation of a tactical insolvency, workers who have given good and loyal service find themselves in a situation whereby the company goes out of business and they are left with absolutely nothing.  The majority of companies do not engage in this practice but legislation is required for those that do.  They are only small in number and I would not want to portray this is as all workers being in danger of this happening to them.  However, when it happens it is absolutely devastating.  The Minister of State will know this because he has met the workers from Debenhams and some of these other companies.  He knows what needs to be done.  Many of these cases end up being high-profile because the practice is quite shocking to people.  They find themselves in a state of shock.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate my amendments have been ruled out of order.  However, the Minister of State might take this opportunity to advise us about it.  According to the reply to a parliamentary question I tabled: \"Work has ... commenced on the drafting of the Terms of Reference for the Employment Law Review Group ...\".  That is to organise the membership.   The reply states the group hopes to be up and running \"on a non-statutory basis, in Q1 of 2022\".  We are heading into the last month of that quarter.  I apologise as I appreciate this parliamentary question does not relate directly to the legislation but it is in the general area of redundancy.  I ask that the Minister of State provide an update.  If he cannot, a response in writing would be good.  We all had huge sympathy for the workers from Debehams and we all saw what happened.  When we looked back we saw that was a repetition of similar - not exactly the same, but similar - situations in other companies.  As we move out of the pandemic, if there is going to be any pandemic dividend this must be part of it.  Work on tactical insolvencies and collective redundancies must be part of the pandemic dividend, if you want to call it that.  It should not have taken a pandemic to put it on the agenda but the workers deserve nothing less than that.  I thank the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022022300002#B00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":219,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate I am not going to go through every amendment that was disallowed.  They are not related to this Bill but I appreciate why she wants to bring them up and have them discussed.  I would be happy to return at a later stage to do that.<\/p> <p>  When I was at the committee discussing the Duffy Cahill report, I outlined our issues with that report and also outlined the changes we were bringing into place on that.  I committed I would return to the committee at a time that suited members.  When the committee has completed its own report on that I will be happy to look at that too and go through it with members.  I have not yet got it on my desk - maybe I have missed it or something like that - but I am happy to discuss it with the committee whenever that arises.  I will given an update on the plan of action following our report on that.  To be very clear, while there are many differences of opinion around the Debenhams situation in here, I repeat that if anybody has any evidence that is different from what I have I would like to have it.  I have asked for that on a number of occasions at committee, in the D&aacute;il and so on.  I would be glad to get it at any stage in order to be able to review it.  It has not been so today but often with this discussion, what is said does not match up with the evidence.  We will of course take any new evidence and review that.<\/p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste and I committed, when we met the Debenhams workers, to review the legislation in this area and, if we could at all, to strengthen the protections for anybody in that situation.  Nobody could have anything less than sympathy for anybody in that situation of redundancy.  We committed to doing that and as a result of that work there was a plan of action.  I do not have it with me but from memory I will give the committee the low-down on where it is at.  The employment law review group we have set up is being scoped at the moment.  It should be in a position to be able to discuss that with the committee here and bring it forward before the end of quarter 1 but certainly within quarter 2.  Quarter 1 was our aim and that work is ongoing with the membership and to have that set up and on a statutory basis.  We are pretty much on track to do that, be it at the end of quarter 1 or early quarter 2.  That will happen; it is a commitment that is there.  There have already been changes in the small company administrative rescue process, SCARP, legislation that was brought forward.  That effected some of the changes that were recommended as well.  The Company Law Review Group, CLRG, has also completed its report into this very complex area.  That report was with the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, as of the end of 2021.  We will bring forward recommendations and changes out of that as well.  It will be published when it is appropriate.<\/p> <p>  Like the Deputy, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, notes the number of cases in this situation is limited.  There are some and there is no point in denying that but it is not the norm.  If we can strengthen that then of course we will but the ODCE points out again that there is already legislation in this situation already.  That confirms what we have said on numerous occasions.  It is there but is not always used and that is what we have had to discuss with the unions quite a lot, in order to see whether we can we make that more user-friendly and more available.  I am happy to debate that with members, and so will the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, when it is appropriate.  The handbook was published, I think, in December as well.  It is a very useful guide for employees, who might not always be aware of the situation or the laws.  It will help them with their work, with their representatives and with their unions as well.  That is a quick summary of that.  Again, it is an area we are very much committed to so I am happy, at a later stage, to discuss it again with the committee when it is appropriate to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022022300002#B00300","speaker":"1505"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I thank the Minster of State.

This reflected the situation at the time of publication, when restrictions were easing and the economy was reopening.  I think that was back in September 2021.  However, we all know we suffered a setback as a result of the Omicron variant and some restrictions were necessary during December 2021 and January 2022.  This particularly affected the entertainment and hospitality industries.  This was well flagged by Deputies in their contributions on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  Therefore, to ensure that all periods of temporary lay-off due to Covid-19 restrictions are encompassed by this new payment, the amendment will extend the lay-off periods covered to 31 January 2022.  It also means the payment will apply to workers who are made redundant before 31 January 2025.  Those are the three years referenced earlier on.  This will increase the maximum any worker will receive to &euro;2,268 if he or she was on lay-off due to Covid-19 restrictions for the entire period between 13 March 2020 and 31 January 2022 and normally earned at least &euro;600 per week.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 provide for the deletion of the word &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; on two occasions where it occurs in this Bill.  This is not to downplay the emergency and exceptional nature of restrictions or the gravity of their effect.  It is because previous amendments to the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 refer to the &ldquo;emergency period&rdquo; in the particular context of section 12A.  Since the extension we are now proposing is no longer clearly linked to that specific timeframe, the deletion will avoid any ambiguity as to the period eligible to be covered by the Covid-19 lay-off payment.  The amendments here reflects the change we were looking at ourselves but also that members clearly raised a few weeks ago in the debate on Second Stage.<\/p><p>This amendment is appropriate and I recommend that members accept it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022022300002#B00600","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I welcome that the issues raised are being addressed.  The extension, though, is to 31 January 2022.  There are still people who are laid off now.  Where will that leave them?  I refer to situations where it is necessary for people to have recognition of continuous service.  Where does this leave those people?  Even if we were sitting here and we were able to say that the pandemic is 100% over - and the Minister of State will be aware from listening to medics that they will never be able to say that, while we as lay people may be - there are still people who are temporarily laid-off as a result of Covid-19.  I wonder if it would not be prudent to extend this measure a little while.  Will we not have people going back to work who are only slightly outside the provisions?<\/p> <p>  Most people are, hopefully, going to be back in work and going back to where they were working.  A small number of people, however, are still laid-off today who would not be covered by this proposal, in the event that they find themselves in this situation when they go back.  Would it not be worthwhile, therefore, to have a short extension of this measure, not forever or indefinitely, to encompass a point - and I know we are not going to have anything stupid like a \"Freedom Day\" or anything like that - when all workers should have gone back to work, or else it can be assumed they will not be going back.

The difficulty we have is that the legislation must be linked to the restrictions.  We are saying that lay-offs until 22 January 2022 are linked to Government restrictions.  They are not lay-offs because of Covid-19, but because of interventions by the Government which restricted businesses' ability to operate at full capacity.  Those restrictions have been fully removed since 22 January.  There are going to be ongoing issues relating to Covid-19 for God knows how many years in some sectors and some companies and there are other supports and initiatives which will see the Government step in.  Regarding this legislation and this link to Covid-19 restrictions, we had previously linked this to section 12A.  We extended that in tandem with the restrictions to 22 January.  I think it is a fair date; I am not sure how we could pick any other date or how that assessment could be made.<\/p> <p>  To be clear, then, the purpose of the Bill is to ensure that employees who were laid off due to Covid-19-related restrictions are not disadvantaged should they be made redundant.  Again, the State is taking up that cost.

I am simply asking about those people whose companies have not started back working yet.  The restrictions may have been lifted, but some companies are in the process of coming back into operation.  Supports are still in place for companies and for workers.  It strikes me that for as long as people are receiving a Covid-19-related benefit and are not in work, then that should be the mechanism by which it is judged.  I refer to the last Covid-19-related benefits being paid in the context where people want to go to work but cannot, and that that type of situation should be linked.  I appreciate that might be difficult to do.  There are people, however, who are in this type of situation.  The numbers might be small, but that was also true for the cases I highlighted.  It does not mean that the consequences have not been grave for each individual affected.<\/p> <p>  There must be a cut-off date, and I am not suggesting for a moment that this provision would be openended or indefinite at all.  I am only asking that consideration perhaps be given, not on this Stage, but when we are doing the final Stages, to those people who are currently laid off.  I refer to people who may be laidoff and on Covid-19-related benefits.  They should be encompassed by this legislation.  I think the numbers are small.  Again, I am not trying to say that these measures should be openended and last forever.  They should, however, last for the duration of the Covid-19 benefits because they are specifically linked to Covid-19 related lay-offs.  <\/p> <p>  We could find ourselves here in a year or two going back over the cases of people, a small number, who found themselves in difficulty regarding what might technically be considered a break in service.  People receiving a Covid-19-related benefit because they are not in work, who then go back to work and find themselves made redundant, will not have this period of service considered in the same way it was for everybody else.  It may be that this may not turn out to be an issue.  Hopefully, everyone will go back to work and find they will not need redundancy payments.  It strikes me, though, that a small number of people may end up in that situation and I ask that consideration be given to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2022022300002#C00400","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I understand the point the Deputy is making, but there is not the rationale to implement what she is suggesting.  As she said herself, none of us here could figure out what date to use for the ending of this measure or how we could judge that aspect.  The rationale the State has taken here is a pre-emptive one.  We recognise that neither employees nor employers are responsible for this situation.  The restrictions prevented people from working and they were temporarily laid off.  Section 12A prevented employees from triggering redundancies themselves.  That measure ended in September 2021, and it was the initial link with this legislation.<\/p> <p>  We have gone beyond that now in the last few months to try to include those impacted by the restrictions which remained in some sectors.  I do not think we can go beyond that, however, and I do not see how we could do so.  Since the lifting of restrictions, we have expected employers to make the relevant decisions that are right for their businesses, whether that is to bring their staff back to work or to make the difficult decision to make them redundant.  There will be fallout from the impact of Covid-19 well into the future.  Naturally, through all our Departments, but mainly through this Department's supports for businesses, the number of people affected by such decisions should not be high and we will do all we can to prevent people from losing their jobs and to protect those jobs.  <\/p> <p>  We have proven our intent in that regard.

Our guests are all welcome.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, I must read a note on privilege and some housekeeping matters.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to any identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside of the State are advised that they should also be mindful of the domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence that they give.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside of the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I will ask any member participating by MS Teams prior to making his or her contribution to confirm that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.<\/p> <p>  I welcome Mr. McNulty from the National Youth Council of Ireland who has joined us.

Eurofound is the European Agency for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions and the only EU agency based in Ireland.  Its role is to provide knowledge to assist in the development of better social, employment and work-related policies.  The agency is tripartite in nature, which means it is run by workers, employers and governments together.<\/p> <p>  The year 2022 has been designated the European Year of Youth by the European Union.  It aims to shine a light on the importance of European youth to build a better future, one which is more inclusive, greener and more digital.  I will be speaking about the impact the Covid-19 crisis has had on young people in the EU in general and Ireland specifically, as well as the broader issues facing young people.<\/p> <p>  Under the banner \"Living, Working and Covid-19\", Eurofound carried out a large online survey capturing the experiences of citizens across all EU member states at different points over the past 24 months.  With over 160,000 responses to date, of which 15,500 have come from Ireland, the survey revealed that throughout Europe and to varying degrees, citizens reported the following problems which I will share on the slides.  After Covid we found that they report high levels of loneliness and depression, coupled with low levels of optimism; deep concern about their financial and labour market future, notwithstanding the positive effect of supporting measures, which I will speak about later; high levels of job loss and a dramatic decrease in working time for many; and an increase in telework, which is placing a strain on workers with children.<\/p> <p>  Young people were once again one of the most adversely affected and vulnerable groups in society.  Still recovering from the 2008 crisis, they are experiencing persistent high levels of unemployment and difficulty in accessing housing.  As a result of the pandemic and consequent lockdowns, young people were hardest hit by the restrictions as they are over-represented in sectors such as retail, travel, hospitality and the performing arts, which were totally closed during the lockdowns.  Young people are disproportionately faced with job loss, a decrease in working time and insecurity about their professional and financial futures.  Young people&rsquo;s opportunities to gain experience and skills have been severely impacted by the impact of the pandemic on education, apprenticeships and training.  Young people report low levels of mental well&ndash;being, particularly feelings of loneliness and risk of depression.  In Ireland specifically, young people aged 18 to 34 had the lowest mental well-being, 6% lower than the EU average.  It should be noted that young women are particularly affected across a range of indicators, including work-life balance and mental health.<\/p> <p>  These are the negative points of the result of Covid but we have positive news as well as will be seen on our next slide.  Young people remain slightly more optimistic about the future than other age groups.  Optimism in Ireland among 18- to 34-year olds is lower than the other age groups but it is much higher than in the EU 27 as a whole.  Compared with the other EU member states, we have much higher optimism among young people.  Young people also report a higher level of trust in the EU and national governments, the details of which and exact figures can be seen in the information we provided to the committee.  In Ireland in particular, we noticed relatively high trust levels in the EU and national governments during the pandemic compared with other member states.  Our graph shows four iterations of the study and that the levels of trust and satisfaction with the pandemic support measures in Ireland are much higher compared with the other EU member states.  These figures are for the general population but the figures are similar for young people.<\/p> <p>  I will turn to the youth employment context.  During the 2008 to 2013 economic crisis, we saw how young people were more vulnerable to economic recession than other age groups.  Youth unemployment soared above 40% in many EU countries in 2013, with rates above 50% in Greece and Spain.  At that time, Ireland&rsquo;s youth unemployment rate was 26.8%.  In 2015, Eurofound calculated that the economic loss to the EU of youth disengagement was estimated at over &euro;142 billion a year.<\/p><p>This is the negative impact on the European economy from youth disengagement.  The EU&rsquo;s Youth Guarantee and a more positive economic climate had seen youth unemployment recover in recent years, reaching pre-crisis levels again in 2019.  With the Covid-19 crisis, although we see EU level youth unemployment largely returning to pre-pandemic levels, young people were more often working on less secure, temporary contracts that were easier to terminate, part-time or for low wages, all of which put them at higher risk of job loss and social exclusion.<\/p><p> Eurofound also looked into sectors and their breakdowns.  We saw that youth employment was over-represented in sectors most affected by the pandemic, such as retail, food and accommodation services, health and social work as well as arts, recreation and entertainment.  Moreover, the impact of lockdown closures on education and human capital accumulation is likely to have long-term implications for young people&rsquo;s employment participation.  If we zoom in on the most vulnerable section of young people, we need to focus on young people in Europe aged between 15 and 29 who are not in employment, education or training, known as NEETs.  In 2013, the share of NEETs aged between 15 and 29 was 16.1%.  By 2019, the rate had fallen to 12.6%.  Now, however, it has increased again as a result of the pandemic.  In our research, we found that there are about 2 million young people across Europe who are NEETs.  Two thirds of them, which amounts to more than 7 million young people across Europe, are discouraged and are not looking for a job at all.<\/p><p> The European Union adopted and implemented a number of initiatives, which are contained in my written submission, to reduce the number of NEETs across the European Union.  A new EU youth strategy was adopted in 2018 and sets out a framework for co-operation with member states on their youth policies for the period 2019 to 2027.  The strategy focuses on three core areas of action, centred around the words \"engage, connect, empower\".  To aid the economic recovery from the pandemic, on 1 July 2020, the new Commission launched a youth employment support package to provide a bridge to jobs for the next generation.  The Commission put forward a proposal for a Council recommendation, entitled a Bridge to Jobs - Reinforcing the Youth Guarantee, to replace the 2013 recommendation.  It extends the age range covered by the Youth Guarantee from age 24 to 29.<\/p><p> The EU has NextGenerationEU in place, which is the European recovery plan, and aims to invest more than &euro;800 billion to make Europe healthier, greener, and more digital.  Then there is ALMA, a European Commission initiative, which stands for \"aim, learn, master, achieve\".  This is particularly relevant to the NEETs population of the EU and tries to help these young people find their way to the job market, especially the most disadvantaged NEETs aged 18 to 30 who are vulnerable with regard to their chances of accessing work or training.<\/p><p> Employment issues are clearly critical to the situation of young people today across the EU and in Ireland, and I have tried to focus on this today, but Covid-19 has seen a multitude of other issues come to the fore, including higher levels of stress and related psychosocial risks, difficulties with access to housing, challenges related to raising children and caring for the elderly, job insecurity and, unfortunately, many more that define the world of young people today.  Eurofound will continue to research these issues in an effort to provide committee members and other policymakers with the data and analysis they require to respond effectively to the higher levels of trust of Europe&rsquo;s young people and to shape better policies to improve their lives and work into the future.<\/p><p> I want to flag that, at the end of last year, we published the Impact of Covid-19 on Young People in the EU, which is our latest research on the youth.  There is much more information on our website, where there is a dedicated section on youth unemployment.  I thank members for their attention, and I am ready to answer their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022022300002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ivailo Kalfin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":279,"content":"<p>Mr Kalfin provided a lot of statistics and useful information and I thank him for his contribution.

The National Youth Council of Ireland, NYCI, represents 57 youth organisations in Ireland and our member organisations support more than 380,000 young people throughout Ireland, with the help of more than 40,000 volunteers and 1,400 paid staff.  We have formal and informal relationships with national youth councils, international non-governmental youth organisations and representative bodies across the EU, which informs our works and allows for regular exchange on European issues.<\/p> <p>  The NYCI&rsquo;s primary means of working with young people in democratic engagement around the European Union is through the young voices - EU youth dialogue process, a programme developed by NYCI that creates opportunities for young people from the age of 16 to 30 who have an interest in change-making.  It brings young people into the policymaking process at a national and European level.  The young voices programme is a model for youth democratic participation that allows young people to grow and develop capacity, as well as fostering key skills towards achieving the long-term outcomes that address the policy concerns of young people.<\/p> <p>  The NYCI consistently engages in advocacy at a European level, including through sending delegations of young people to the European Youth Conference and engaging at a European level with the European Youth Forum to represent the voice of Irish youth to the European Commission, Parliament and all other relevant forums.  The NYCI has recently been particularly focused on the Conference on the Future of Europe, and as one of the NYCI&rsquo;s representatives to the European Youth Forum, I have been keenly following this process.<\/p> <p>  The NYCI is a partner with the European Youth Forum on the 25% project, which is to engage young people and collect ideas from across the EU.  The project is so named because 25% of Europe's population is made up of young people, but our voices are not equally heard or equally represented in political structures and institutions. This project has collected 1,000 ideas from across Ireland.  This very clearly illustrates that young people remain thoroughly engaged with the European Union.  It is incredibly important, therefore, that the European Year of Youth increases this engagement with the EU and makes sure young people are heard as we come out of the pandemic, leaving a lasting legacy of a year that benefits young people and the European Union as a whole.<\/p> <p>  The initial announcement of the Year of Youth was something of a surprise.  Speaking to other youth organisations around Europe, nobody expected the announcement for 2022 and it was met with cynicism in some quarters.  However, the youth sector has quickly adapted and developed hopes or expectations for this year.  The NYCI is a member of the steering group for the European Year of Youth and will work alongside L&eacute;argas, as the national co-ordinator of the year, and other members to ensure meaningful engagement with young people.  The youth sector plays a pivotal role in supporting young people and in mitigating the negative impact of Covid-19 on their lives.  It also emphasises the importance of face-to-face youth work for young people and highlighted that those most at risk were the most disconnected during the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  I spoke to a group of MEPs in recent weeks, and I summed up the views of young people from recent young voices and 25% project events and most young people engaged in issues around the European Year of Youth, which is that young people want to feel they are better involved in shaping the EU.  It is important the EU does not exist in a Brussels bubble to young people.  Instead, it must be something that visibly impacts their lives and is something in which they can be involved in shaping.<\/p> <p>  We hope for a concrete way forward at the end of the year that empowers young people and offers change across all policy spheres, and not just within the traditional confines of youth policies.  Since 2018, young voices have been advocating for a youth check and, more recently, the European Youth Forum proposed a youth test that would require an assessment of all policy that impacts young people on a European level.  This is just one way in which policymakers could show a commitment to young people.  The EU and our Government should seek to consult youth regularly, online and offline, and take these consultations into account.<\/p> <p>  It is also important that opportunities exist for young people to experience the EU, either through working or studying in other member states or other means, and that these opportunities are available to all young people.  We must strengthen these opportunities this year and we hope it would involve Ireland developing a plan around the reinforced Youth Guarantee and implementing it.<\/p> <p>  It is very important we ensure youth organisations, large and small, are empowered to make sure young people take advantage of this year.  We need buy-in from politicians and every Department to ensure they look to how they can empower young people.  The pandemic has shown that young people are key parts of society.  We made huge sacrifices.<\/p><p>It is important young people are shown that they matter and are heard throughout this year and into the future.<\/p><p> I thank members for their attention.

She will assist with me with this introduction and will help with any follow-up questions that members might have.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to join it to discuss the European Year of Youth.  Members already know that the decision by the European Parliament and Council to designate 2022 officially as the European Year of Youth aims to celebrate, support and engage young people across the EU, in particular recognition of the impact that the Covid-19 pandemic has had on the lives, experiences and opportunities of young people.  This year will result in European Year of Youth activities and initiatives that will be organised at national, local and European levels throughout the year for young people and those working with them to help them to discover more about their opportunities and how they can participate in them.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland, the European Year of Youth is co-ordinated by L&eacute;argas in partnership with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  For those who might not be very familiar with L&eacute;argas, we have been a national agency for EU programmes for more than 35 years.  We place a very strong focus on inclusion and diversity, and we adopt a supportive approach to our work.  We deliver European exchange programmes in adult, school and vocational education and training, as well as youth, volunteering and community work.  All the participants in our programmes include young people, school pupils, vocational learners, teachers, youth workers and generally those working with young people. <\/p> <p>  We in L&eacute;argas have a privileged position to witness how these exchanges and opportunities to connect people in different communities and countries can bring a European dimension, and that European bubble comes closer into the lives and work of people and organisations throughout Europe.  We see the European Year of Youth as a very exciting opportunity to amplify and bolster the voices and work already being undertaken by our beneficiaries and the work they do with young people.  We are also very mindful that we need actively to seek to embrace the opportunity to connect, engage and empower those who are not currently involved in EU programmes so that they too can build their own projects and enjoy opportunities such as Erasmus+, the European Solidarity Corps and many other national and local youth opportunities.  For them, the European Year of Youth has so much potential and, as I said, we in L&eacute;argas are very mindful of the responsibility we hold as national co-ordinator for the year.  It is a responsibility we recognise as very important now and, as our previous speakers have said, very important for our future.<\/p> <p>  We are part of a network of national co-ordinators across Europe, which is comprised of organisations like L&eacute;argas that are called \"national agencies\", youth councils and ministries.  In early January, each national co-ordinator had to submit a work plan for the year at national level to the European Commission.  We are still awaiting its feedback to see if it wants any additional activities or improvements to that plan.  Therefore, some of the things we might talk to members about today are still pending approval, but we will be ready to develop and deliver those activities in earnest as soon as we possibly can.<\/p> <p>  Some of the activities include the convening of a steering group that was previously mentioned.  That is comprised of individuals, organisations and representatives who can help to inform, guide and support the actions of the national co-ordinator through the year.  We also aim to establish a micro grants scheme to distribute small grants at grassroots level for locally organised groups of young people to develop youth-led activities and events that can promote the priorities and opportunities for the year.  L&eacute;argas will host specific and targeted European Year of Youth events across Ireland to attract young people and to help them find out more about how they can participate and discover new opportunities for themselves.  We also plan, naturally, to leverage the network of current beneficiaries of Erasmus+ and the European Solidarity Corps programmes and our other networks to engage with the year.  They can do that by taking part in events, developing their own events and branding existing events, all with a view to enhance the visibility of the year and its objectives.<\/p> <p>  For 2022, the European Commission has invested in the European Year of Youth.  The budget available to Ireland for the co-ordination role of the European Year of Youth is &euro;143,000.  It is worth noting that in 2022 we estimate a bursary of approximately &euro;23 million will be available to Irish organisations under the Erasmus+ and European Solidarity Corps programmes.

In European Year of Youth, we want to shine a spotlight on all of the spaces and ways that young people can individually and collectively express themselves.  We want to do this, in part, by creating a hub of easily accessible activities under the banner of European Year of Youth.  We want to create new opportunities at grassroots level to bring more young people into that spotlight and support them to see different paths to improve their participation.  We want to work with our amazing partners, youth organisations, arts and sports groups, as well as schools, to reach all of the sectors that are passionate about the empowerment of young people and make sure young people can access the information and opportunities they need.  Most significantly, we want to direct that spotlight onto the spaces that are not always seen.  We want to make sure the European Year of Youth is focused on inclusion and diversity and actively seeks out young people who feel unconnected or not involved or who do not believe Europe is speaking to or holds anything for them.<\/p> <p>  In L&eacute;argas, we know from experience that doing an Erasmus+ youth exchange, building a youth participation project in your community, having the chance to volunteer through the European Solidarity Corps or exploring Europe with a programme such as DiscoverEU, are powerful tools for personal development.  We have seen that the growth that takes place through these activities is truly transformational.<\/p> <p>  As national co-ordinator for the European Year of Youth, L&eacute;argas would like to ensure young people and those working with them are empowered in their rights to express themselves and their ideas.  Young people are already active in expressing themselves on important issues such as climate, equality, mental health, housing and education, to name but a few.  A European Year of Youth can help ensure a legacy of action and engagement with decision-makers in the policy areas and topics that are crucial for young people as full and active citizens.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee and we are happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022022300002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Emma Grainger"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Gilligan and Ms Grainger for their contribution.

I ask the representatives from L&eacute;argas to answer that question.  I do not blame L&eacute;argas but this seems to have been landed on a lot of people.  If someone as engaged as our NYCI representative is surprised by it, I can imagine the general populace is as well.  We are in the last week of February.  Will there be some sort of big initiative to raise awareness of this through our schools and colleges as we move towards the back end of the academic year?

I will be very brief in answering them.  Looking at the age groups, the optimism among young people in Ireland is a bit lower than the other age groups.  At the same time, the level of optimism in Ireland overall is much higher than in other EU member states.  We see the same phenomenon across Europe in that young people are a bit less optimistic because they have a number of challenges.  I mentioned already that they were particularly hit by this Covid crisis before they had recovered from the previous crisis.  They face challenges with job security, access to housing and career prospects.<\/p> <p>  We have done extensive research on teleworking and remote working and I was surprised to learn that young people have the most stress when working remotely.  Normally, young people are much more familiar with all the technologies etc. but the problem is that they do not feel part of the community at work.  They are not secure in how their work is appreciated and they do not know what their career development will be.  Many of them have small children to raise at home and teleworking creates additional problems there.  All of these factors impact both optimism and mental health and create psychosocial risks for young people.  Young people are resilient but we have to take into consideration that this crisis has created higher stress levels for them and they have to cope with those stress levels.  That is very clear in our research.<\/p> <p>  On the European Year of Youth, I cannot agree more that it has to be more visible.  The idea of the European Year of Youth is to see and spotlight the problems of young people.  Eurofound is known across Europe as the Dublin foundation.  We are based in Ireland and we try to be helpful to our host country and the institutions.  We will be active on Europe Day on 9 May and will host an open-door day.  Everybody is invited, including the committee members and people from their constituencies.  We already have some agreements with young people from universities.  We want to be able to present more information about young people across Europe, not only in Ireland.  Of course, the information and data we are collecting are entirely at the committee's disposal.  Whenever any members would like to have some more information, we would be more than happy to provide it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022022300002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ivailo Kalfin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645574400,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Calleary for his questions.  I will address the question on climate anxiety.  I know it was not directed at me but it is something we have talked about recently within the NYCI.  One cannot get through a large group meeting about topics that worry young people without talking about climate.  It is an intersectional issue that crosses over into so many other areas and young people are very worried about it, both with regard to their own futures, what their own lives will be like and whether there is a point because of that feeling of impending doom, but also for the future of others, including people in the global south and so forth.  That is something about which young people are very worried so I wanted to address that.<\/p> <p>  On the matter of the European Year of Youth being a surprise, it was a surprise in the context of the announcement made by the European Commission, not in how it has been addressed on either a national or European level by agencies since then.  The announcement was made late last year.  Other years have two or three years of planning and sometimes longer.

It is unfortunate that we are not starting at the beginning of the year but, as we mentioned earlier, we are hopeful that our work plan, and the events that are part of that, will soon be approved by the European Commission.  The focus is on getting the word out there as much as we can with existing networks, as well as establishing new networks.  We will be encouraging our beneficiaries to badge everything as the European Year of Youth to create a bit of interest and ensure the wording gets out there and people know where to go for more information.  Ms Gilligan mentioned the micro-grants earlier.  We are hoping to target those at beneficiaries that we may have had no contact with previously, such as small and informal groups of young people.  In that way, we will get the message out beyond the large youth organisations we already work with.  We are hoping to create a lot of buzz around the national and regional events for young people.  We hope to have at least 600 young people taking part in face-to-face events across the country, as well as all the online events we are going to be running.

While there is no particular ring-fencing, sustainability and the fight against climate change is one of a number of priorities specifically set out in both of those EU programmes.  That cascades through policies like the European youth strategy that was mentioned earlier.  It is a topic that has been of huge concern to young people and they are very engaged and active on it.  Many of the projects that apply to L&eacute;argas for funding under Erasmus+ or the ESC find that young people are very activated and engaged by issues like climate change.<\/p> <p>  The other issues that are of priority for us for this year and in the programmes we are delivering relate to delivering a more inclusive and diverse programme.  We want to reach newcomers and get young people who do not see this project or Erasmus as an opportunity for them engaged and help them identify the different opportunities they have.<\/p><p>There is a great grassroots youth work network supported by the National Youth Council of Ireland, NYCI, which is active and engaged in that area.  <\/p><p> The other priorities are around digital, as was referenced by our colleagues in Eurofound.  Young people have experienced challenges around remote working over the past couple of years.  There are assumptions that young people are digitally ready but there are some means of engagement that cannot be delivered through that kind of a format.  One does not necessarily feel the connection or belonging that is intended as part of these kinds of engagements.  The legacy part of the European Year of Youth will be developed through activities and engagement, bringing people together and helping them to find connection and feel empowered.  <\/p><p> It is a fantastic note that we have these bubbles of decision-making in the D&aacute;il or in Brussels.  It is wonderful to be invited to talk about it today and I hope we can maintain this connection and interest throughout this year and beyond.  We already know young people are asking for things through the 25 Percent project and asking for a youth check.  Perhaps next year we could have a more organised approach at European level and call for a European year of mental health or a European year for climate change.  Legacy elements can be communicated and developed through this year and we might need to come back to the committee for support in order to bring them into action.<\/p><p> I am grateful for the time.

I did not expect that.  I thank the Chairman.  I am due to speak in the D&aacute;il Chamber in a little while.  It is always good to listen to the debate before contributing, as we all know.  I thank our guests for their presentations.  I agree with Deputy Calleary that the European Year of Youth has crept up on us.  That is unfortunate because, as we all know, if we were well prepared, we could make the most of it but we are where we are, as they say.<\/p> <p>  Given we are now towards the end of February, perhaps the committee, L&eacute;argas and the NYCI could look at how this committee could play a role in helping to get the word out.  Today's meeting is obviously important but I wonder is there anything else we can do.  I do not want to speak for the committee but that is just a thought that struck me.<\/p> <p>  I have one or two questions.  I thank our colleagues from Eurofound.  I listened to Mr. Kalfin's presentation and he spoke about the Youth Guarantee and how the numbers of people not in employment, education or training, so-called NEETs, had decreased between 2013 and 2019 but obviously with the impact of Covid-19, that trend has been reversed.  Before the pandemic, that initiative was obviously a success.  Has Mr. Kalfin any information on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund?  The most recent iteration of the fund included NEETs.  If, for example, a country was applying to the fund for 250 workers who had lost their jobs, it could include the same number of NEETs.  That was a significant change.  Has the fund played any role?  Perhaps Mr. Kalfin does not have any information on that.  It could play a role in the future, given what Mr. Kalfin has told us today.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McNulty form the NYCI talked about his hopes and expectations for the year.  He talked about meaningful engagement, which is obviously important.  What does Mr. McNulty see as the practical outcomes of this year?  Does the council have any targets?  What is it working towards?  I will direct the same question to L&eacute;argas.  What do our guests hope to see at the end of this year or at this time next year as an outcome or outcomes from this year?  I recognise we are talking about lowering ring-fenced funding.  I think I heard a figure of &euro;143,000 for L&eacute;argas, which is tiny money.  I am not putting our guests under pressure with this question.  I am just asking for their perspectives.<\/p> <p>  Mr. McNulty also mentioned youth-proofing.  He mentioned a youth check, which I presume is the same as youth-proofing, though I am not sure.  That sounds a very good idea and a good outcome would be for that to be stitched through policy.  Has Mr. McNulty any further thoughts on that?<\/p> <p>  What do Ms Gilligan and her colleagues in L&eacute;argas see as the contribution of the European Solidarity Corps?  I was a Member of the European Parliament when we amended the legislation establishing that programme.  We had high hopes for it and I wonder how it is working out.  Our guests are the people who know how it plays out on the ground.<\/p> <p>  The issue of climate change was mentioned and this year might be an opportunity for young people to get involved.  Do our guests see this year as an opportunity for young people in that regard?  Obviously raising awareness is important but are there any practical programmes that people can get their teeth into and through which they can get their hands dirty, as it were?  That way, young people could feel they are not just being consulted and informed, important as those things are, but that they are also participants and actors, in the best sense of the word.<\/p> <p>  I was pleased to hear that this year will be an opportunity for young people who do not see themselves participating in programmes such as Erasmus to get involved.  I know from my experience as a teacher and a Member of the European Parliament that Erasmus does not reach those who feel it is not for them, despite the real effort that has been made, which I understand and acknowledge.  I was delighted to hear that is part of the programme.<\/p> <p>  I have rambled a bit but there is a lot of very good stuff here.  Perhaps the committee can assist with some of it but that is for another day.  I thank our guests again for their presentations.

I will try to cover everything.  I will first speak to the Deputy's question about practical action, especially around climate change and engaging young people directly in activity, which is important.  Talking and thinking about these things are important but feeling it and being involved as a participant is essential.  I know the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is this week inviting applications from youth organisations for funding under the youth climate justice fund.  That might be of interest to people listening to the debate.  The Department will communicate that invitation more broadly this week.  That will have a new emphasis in 2020 on young people with fewer opportunities to try to engage and have a broader reach into the full and wider community.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the European Solidarity Corps, which resonates, in some ways, as a surprise.  If the Deputy was a Member of the European Parliament at the time, she will know it was an initiative of the then President of the European Commission.  The programme was built on the bones of an existing action to encourage volunteering by young people within Erasmus+.  The programme had been up and running for 20 years at that stage.<\/p><p>What I can tell the Deputy about the journey of the solidarity corps is that at the outset there was a lot of investment and great ambition for the European Solidarity Corps.  Some areas of the programme as it was originally designed were much more engaging for organisations and young people than others.  We have a programme now that does not include the original work placement idea.  That is being delivered separately through the ALMA - aim, learn, master, achieve - initiative that was referenced by our colleagues in Eurofound.  This is a much more youth, community, civic organisations-focused programme and it supports young people to live in, work with and experience communities and cultures across Europe as they volunteer in organisations and communities on issues such as climate change, social justice or mental health issues.  They are involved in many different organisations in Ireland and across the EU.<\/p><p> Another wonderful initiative of that programme, and I thank the people who supported it, is the solidarity projects.  They are projects that can happen at local level.  They are designed, developed and implemented by the young people who are living in that community.  There are quite a lot of those types of projects at present, focused on areas such as mental health, equality, climate justice, social justice in the areas of direct provision and various other similar issues.  Many young people are involved in those projects.  The last thing I will say on that is that in the European Solidarity Corps we see quite high participation rates for young people with fewer opportunities, which is how we try to measure our reach into more inclusive and more diverse areas of co-operation and partnership.<\/p><p> I hope that covers the questions the Deputy asked.  If not, I am happy to follow up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022022300002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Lorraine Gilligan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645574400,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.  NYCI would be happy to make members of the committee aware of anything we are hosting relating to the European Year of Youth or anything in the future that may be of relevance in a European context.  The Deputy mentioned meaningful engagement and practical outcomes for this year.  One of them is the idea of youth-proofing or a youth check or youth testing - it is called many things.  The youth test was referred to by the European Youth Forum because it had a specific policy idea and a way of carrying that out at European level, but obviously it applies down to national level also.  That is something we would like to see.<\/p> <p>  Additionally, something that has already been achieved or almost achieved this year at European level by the European Youth Forum is a ban on unpaid internships.  It has had some recent successes both in terms of litigation it has taken at European level and also in terms of securing guarantees from national governments to ban unpaid internships, which is a substantial benefit for youth this year.  The other item we would like to see, in addition to that youth test, youth check or however one wishes to refer to it, is engagement with Europe and with national politicians with an interest in Europe or MEPs in a meaningful way, and allowing young people's voices to be heard at all those levels.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned climate change.  There needs to be a policy focus on lobbying in this area from the youth sector.  The European Youth Forum, which is our representative body in Europe, last year adopted its first policy programme and about a quarter of that was related to climate issues.  That tells how much of a focus there is within the sector on this.  It needs to come back to young people and enabling them to engage in conversations about climate change and other aspects of that area.<\/p> <p>  I will briefly address Erasmus+.  I was at an event with European Movement Ireland last week where I was facilitating.  I was around a table with eight or nine students from University College Cork, UCC.  One had been in Erasmus but all the others said they felt it was inaccessible or they were coming from backgrounds where they could not afford it or their parents could not give them a nest egg to go and the like.  Some of it is breaking down the barriers of fear and making sure people are informed, but also some of it is making sure it actually reaches, and that the funding is appropriate for, people who need it.  That has to happen at European level, but we also need those young people's voices feeding in at national level to say, \"I could not go and here is the reason\".  By the time policy change happens it will not benefit them, but it might benefit people a few years behind them or their children.<\/p> <p>  I am happy to follow up further if I have not fully addressed Deputy Harkin's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022022300002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark McNulty"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645574400,"counter":302,"content":"<p>In terms of visibility, our humble experience shows that the very interest of this committee in the European Year of Youth is already increasing the visibility.

These issues should be visible and seen, and our involvement with the committee and its members is very welcome.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked a question about the globalisation fund.  This is the fund which is supposed to help the transition after companies close down as a result of globalisation.  I have to go back to my years when I was serving in the European Parliament together with Deputy Harkin and working on these issues.  Unfortunately, there is no ring-fencing for young people and especially for NEETs in the use of the globalisation fund under the European regulations.  However, this might be a policy at national level.  I would add not only the globalisation fund but also the whole green transition, the green social fund which is currently being discussed in the European institutions, and the national recovery and resilience plans that are submitted.  A national policy could rely on EU funding to address the issues of young people.  Clearly, and this is what our research shows, they are one of the candidates to have dedicated, special policies and eventually a ring-fenced budget for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022022300002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ivailo Kalfin"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses from the three organisations.  In fairness, there is agreement around the fact that the European Year of Youth is probably not well known in the real world and there is an onus on all of us to play our part in highlighting it.  Beyond that, it needs to be something more than thinking of the young people.  There has to be something substantial relating to it.  The witnesses are talking about trying to engage those on the periphery or those who are at a remove.  That is always very difficult.  When we talk about Eurofound, working conditions and so forth, I believe there is a wider piece of work that must be done at a societal level.  We all have failed across Europe and in this State if we are talking about the need for family supports and community supports that can help families and communities that are on the periphery, where people do not necessarily have the agency and connections that many of us have growing up.  There are many roadmaps to education these days that might not have existed previously, such as post-leaving certificate, PLC, courses and the like, but there are many people who are utterly removed from that.  It is a piece of work that needs to be done across the board.  That is one of the issues.<\/p> <p>  The other issue which must be taken into account, and this is accepting all that has been said about the difficulties young people have been through, is the drugs pandemic, an issue we were dealing with in the D&aacute;il yesterday, and the impact it has on young people in particular.

That needs to be sold and said multiple times here.  The majority of people who benefit from member organisations of NYCI, by a good majority, although I do not have the statistics to hand, are from disadvantaged areas.  When you look at how we engage them, it has already been done through youth work.  We just need to invest in that, continue to widen that, as well as widen the number of people who have access to that.  There is clear case for that.

Some people do not get involved because they feel like they would not be welcome.  It is about saying, \"This is what this involves and how you become involved in doing it&rdquo;.  It is, therefore, a simple thing.  I have worked with organisation in the past where young people have to travel to be involved.  They have to go on public transport and they just cannot afford it.  If an organisation is able to afford to pay for that up front, that could change who will get involved overnight.  I have seen it.  Of course, there will be people and families who value that and who will become involved.  Equally, there will be families that do not.

They take part in Erasmus activities and they engage many of their young people in their exchange activities, their international activities and the activities that they do at a very local level.  We see the progression of the on-the-ground work, as well as the investment that goes into that relationship building with teachers, youth workers and tutors.  It comes into our programme at a certain point.  However, it does take a long time.  It requires that investment and funding is in place to cover the additional costs and the additional work and additional hours that need to be invested for that progression to happen and for those organisations to deliver on the work that they are doing.  <\/p> <p>  From our perspective, we can speak to and show evidence of our actions in inclusion and diversity.  We have a dedicated staff member who works with organisations and who engages with organisations well before they ever get involved in Erasmus activities or in European solidarity core activities.

It is an important educational experience for us all.<\/p> <p>  It is a little disconcerting that we are now heading into March and, as Ms Grainger told us, the work plan has not yet been approved by the Commission.  It is almost as if we are going to do youth at the last minute without having the normal preparation for a programme that begins with fanfare on 1 January.  That is the normal way that things happen with an evolving programme for the full year.<\/p> <p>  I am not clear on the Commission's perspective.  I do not expect any of the witnesses here to be able to tell me what exactly are it aims and objectives, or what designation it is expected to achieve this year, other than for it to encompass youth and reach out, etc.<\/p> <p>  I want to specifically follow up on Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s questions, which are important.  We are all concerned about the issue of a marginalised youth.  There are many young people, and many older people, too, who would bluntly glaze over at the European acronyms.  You could probably talk to any young or old person about Aim, Learn, Master, Achieve, ALMA, or not in employment, education or training, NEETs, and they would not have a clue what you were talking about.<\/p><p>We get into jargonisms with all these discussions.<\/p><p> Turning to specific questions, for decades we have been  looking at matters such as youth unemployment.  We have progressed a youth guarantee.  I know Eurofound can only provide data but the statistics indicate we have not really made great progress and the unemployment rate of young people is still significantly more than older people.  There is what used to be called unattached youth, which is more than simply those NEETs not involved with education and training but rather people not involved with anything, including youth work or anything else.  I am a great believer in the power of effective youth work in vulnerable communities.  I applaud Mr. McNulty and the National Youth Council of Ireland for what it has done.<\/p><p> Specifically, what more can we offer to ensure that more people understand what is available and that the Erasmus+ programme is not just for those who are connected?  There is the occasional view of people being from a disadvantaged community when, by and large, they are not.  Even Mr. McNulty spoke of a group of university students who could not avail of it and the fact they are university students means they are already a privileged subset of younger people in the country.  Do any of our witnesses wish to address the question of how to encompass more young people in the projects and programmes available under the auspices of the European Union?  How could we penetrate more deeply into the vulnerable communities that have correctly been underscored by Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;?  Many of the people we deal with have no notion of any of the matters we have discussed and how they could affect their daily lives.<\/p><p> This has a political undertone as well in that the arguments of many Brexiteers and much of the fundamentalism we are hearing comes from a feeling that these institutions are meaningless in their lives.  We must do something about that.  If we are going to focus on young people, how, specifically in this year, can we in this committee or the Oireachtas take some small steps to address those matters?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022022300002#H01300","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645574400,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.

Moving to another point, we are trying to put a shape on it ourselves at a national level and within different organisations.  We are trying to make people aware of it and this would be much easier if it had been led from a European level.  If towards the end of the year it is led from that European level it will be much easier to do with such outreach.  That outreach is important not only within this year but going forward.<\/p> <p>  I recently met MEPs and had an acronym thrown at me and I could not tell members what it meant.  The Deputy mentioned the acronyms as well.  I had to ask about the meaning and I am very engaged with European issues.  I attended another event recently with a round table of other students and qualified majority voting, QMV, came up.  Nobody around the table knew what it meant, let alone what it involved.  At the most basic level, the EU should have outreach so that every young person understands such matters.  There have been some calls for this to be done in schools but it still needs to be done later because there are people in their early 20s and late teens who do not understand how all this works.  There is an opportunity this year to provide education around that.<\/p> <p>  On access to Erasmus+, there should not just be access to the programme in the sense of college but rather it should be in the sense of other opportunities as well.  The National Youth Council of Ireland is keenly involved with Erasmus+ projects.  In October I was in Luxembourg meeting 13 other youth councils on different issues we are facing, speaking about policy areas, etc.  It was done through Erasmus+ and it would not have been possible otherwise.  Some councils that are well-funded might have the money but others just do not.  It is important to protect that funding at a European level.  We should also advertise it so more organisations - and not just the big organisations - go after that funding every single time.  The application process is quite difficult and many organisations worry about getting approval and putting out money.  It is important that Erasmus+ is looked at this year and we make sure every single organisation, large and small, can get it in that context.  It should also be accessible to young people.<\/p> <p>  Going back to the wider point, this is about outreach and approachability.  It is about really making sure we can get to as many people as possible.  The EU should not be a big black box, of which everyone is wary.  It will be a big challenge this year, especially where we are now, as members know.  If we want to speak about a good outcome at the end of the year, every young person should be aware of one more thing about the EU.  That would not be a terribly ambitious outcome to look for and it would be meaningful.  There is a great lack of awareness out there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022022300002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark McNulty"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":321,"content":"<p>Ms Gilligan looks very interested in coming in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022022300002#J00500","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645574400,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I will not repeat much of what has been said about how youth work is serious in its approach to really engaging different communities.

If it had been planned for two more years, other experiences would have to come into play.  With the optimism in L&eacute;argas as we try to approach being the national co-ordinator for the European year, we have it now and the initiative is a response to a specific experience that young people have been exposed to.<\/p> <p>  There are priorities attached to the year and I can provide those in follow-up communications.  They are in our submission documents if the committee wants to refer to them but I will not go into them now.  There is a strategy for us as a national co-ordinator for the year in terms of legacy.  As Ms Grainger said, we are not starting with an agenda for what this year will achieve.  We have our steering group and our outreach activities.  We want to provide the space for the kinds of messages that young people are prioritising to become the legacy.  It would be fantastic if this committee could remain engaged and we can follow up or check in with it in six months and let it know where things are at and the messages coming through.

We are trying to contribute to some positive movement.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is absolutely correct that speaking to a marginalised young person about NEETs, ALMA and Erasmus+ may not make sense.  We need the policymakers to know the position.  When we measure the percentage of needs of young people, it may not be to tell those marginalised young people their needs; that might be perceived as something offensive.  This should be for policymakers and we see very clear problems and issues.  In many countries they are addressed.<\/p><p>In other countries, they are much less so.  What we can bring as an additional measure is to exchange good and bad experience across the European Union and see how each country deals with that.  To deal with the problems of marginalised young people, you need the education system and the health system.  You need a number of national systems, in particular, that have to engage and target these problems.  This is very much away from the competencies of the European Union.  Of course, the European Union could help with all these problems, including with the support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency, SURE, instrument because it very much attenuated the impact on employment with Covid-19, allowing member states to be a little bit more generous in terms of supporting closing businesses, etc.  This was very important for young people.  This is a very efficient measure, but it is only one measure.  Solving this issue and bringing these people towards active work in the community needs much more than that.  By the way, the percentage of needs in Ireland today is a little above the average European Union.  The average European Union is 14%.  It was 16.1% two years ago.  In Ireland it is 14.1%.  That is exactly European Union average.  Across Europe this is 10 million people.  In Ireland, as you can imagine, 14% is quite a substantial percentage.  Two thirds of them are, as you say, people who are not interested and they do not go to the labour office.  They do not seek jobs.  Now they have some other opportunities, and this is also an area for research.  They can go to the green economy.  Some of them go to what they call the \"platform economy\" or the gig economy.  They can deliver food or something like that, but unfortunately, it is very often without working conditions.  It is unpaid work with no breaks and no regulation at all.  They find ways to make their lives, which are in the grey area, which is not regulated and which we do not see.  We need to shed a light on these problems.  There is enough information.  There are some instruments that would come from the European level but, in most cases, this is national policy, because you need to engage all these massive systems in order to address these people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022022300002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ivailo Kalfin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kalfin, Ms McCaughey, Mr. Mark McNulty, Ms Gilligan and Ms Grainger for coming here today.

As the Minister of State said, this is a Bill I support.  We hope the Minister of State will adopt an amendment later in terms of buy now, pay later schemes.  I welcome a late amendment from the Department of Finance with regard to bringing those types of products under the regulatory framework, which is really important.  I must say at the outset that it is a little bit frustrating that four years have passed.  It is four years or more since I called for regulations on personal contract plan products.  I engaged with the Central Bank and Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, at that point.  Indeed, the CCPC had issues and concerns about this for a number of years before that.<\/p> <p>  We need to find a way to be able to act faster regarding the regulation of financial products.  As the Minister of State indicated, there has been a massive increase in personal contract plans over the last number of years.  Many customers are not fully aware of what they are fully signing up to in terms of the lack of credit checks but also that they cannot sell their vehicle if they fall into financial difficulties.<\/p> <p>  We will have an added challenge in terms of personal contract plans with regard to the transition to electric vehicles, EV.  This very much needs to be carefully monitored and there is further work to be done.  Four years on, however, we are on Committee Stage and, as the Minister of State said, there is broad support for this Bill.<\/p> <p>  As I said, I welcome the fact that an amendment is coming in terms of purchase now, pay later schemes.  This is another area, particularly with Klarna entering the market here late last year, in which we see from other markets, particularly in Britain and elsewhere, that there has been an explosion of credit in the use of this facility.  Again, many people are not familiar with the impact this can have in terms of missing payments.  We will discuss that later but I broadly support the provisions of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022022300002#A00600","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1645574400,"counter":335,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1645574400,"counter":336,"content":"<p>SECTION 2<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":337,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022022300002#A00900","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":338,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 9, to delete lines 24 to 26 and substitute the following:&ldquo;  \t(c) either&mdash; <blockquote> \t(i) the originator, sponsor or original lender of the securitisation, or<br \/><br \/>(ii) in the case of a traditional NPE securitisation, the servicer, where it can demonstrate that it has expertise in servicing exposures of a similar nature to those securitised and that it has well-documented and adequate policies, procedures and risk-management controls in place relating to the servicing of exposures as required by Article 6 of the Securitisation Regulation,<br \/><br \/>is required to retain on an ongoing basis a material net economic interest in the securitisation of not less than 5 per cent.&rdquo;,&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote> <p>I will give a short explanatory note if that is satisfactory.

The section provides that the Minister for Finance may request that the Central Bank, using the powers under the Central Bank Act, to collect and publish information on credit hire purchase agreements, including PCPs and consumer hire agreements, or services provided by retail credit and credit servicing firms.  This will facilitate the publication of additional statistical data on the level of financial accommodation that is provided by the regulated businesses where the Minister considers that there is need for such additional data.  The Minister will use this power where there is a need to do so in consultation with the Central Bank.  The amendment will allow for a collection of publication of data either on a once-off or an ongoing basis, as provided in this section.  However, the amendment makes clear that this does not apply to personal data or to firm-specific data that is not otherwise relevant in the context of the provisions of section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942, which generally prohibits the disclosure of confidential information, except in specific circumstances.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has the power under this section either to request information on a once-off basis or on an ongoing basis where he or she feels there is a need to do so.  There may not be a need.  The Central Bank, separately under the legislation, can, on its own initiative, produce this report without a request from the Minister.

Let us forget about the scenario where the credit provider provides credit to the shop.<\/p> <p>  Let us look at Klarna, which is the biggest operator here.  Klarna provides credit to a customer to purchase an item from a shop.  This amendment will capture Klarna because the previous legislation said that it was the sale of a product.  Klarna were not selling a product or jacket and only provided credit.  This amendment is about the provision of credit so Klarna is captured so far.  The problem is that the amendment states \"other than where such credit is granted or made available by a person who has invited, by way of advertisement, consumers to avail of such credit\".  That is my concern.  Let us look at what happens in the market and at Asos, for example.  It is not Klarna that invites people to take credit with Klarna but Asos.  The credit is not being provided \"by a person who has invited...\", it is the actual retail outlet.  That is what happens in the market here and that is why I am concerned.  <\/p> <p>  I am looking at advertisements.  It is the shops which ask people whether they want to pay with Klarna and, if so, they have two options to either pay now or spread payments over a certain period.  It is the shop that invites the person and that shop is not the credit provider.  So the credit provider can say that is fine but I am not, as is stated in the amendment, \"a person who has invited, by way of advertisement, consumers to avail of such credit\". <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022022300002#D00700","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I can confirm that the legislation captures people who provide credit and the people who advertise the provision of credit.

Those people are not captured in the legislation.  The people who are captured are \"other than where such credit is granted or made available by a person who has invited, by way of advertisement, consumers to avail of such credit\".  The problem here is that when Topshop invites customers to get this credit it would be captured but Topshop would not because it has not made any credit available and Klarna, potentially, would not be captured here because it made the credit available but did not invite anybody personally to avail of the credit because the shop did so.

The intention of the entire legislation is to capture the direct and indirect providers of credit.  That is the essence of it.  Nevertheless, there is a concern that in a slightly different context, interest-free and cost-free buy now pay later, BNPL, credit which is advertised or provided or both by an entity other than the seller of goods to consumers will still fall outside the scope of the 1995 Act, and consequently, also outside the proposed scope of Central Bank regulation.  I am referring to companies, such as Klarna, that are not the providers of the goods, and are advertising that they will provide interest-free and cost-free BNPL credit.  It is where the finance company is advertising.  The amendment is designed to capture those companies that are advertising directly and publically and not the sellers of the goods.  We have been discussed the situation where the seller of the goods does the advertising.  This refers to the situation where the financing company itself advertises directly.  There is a concern that this was not captured previously.  For example, some BNPL providers may not charge interest or other costs to a consumer for the credit which is used to purchase a good but instead charge the retailer a commission on the sale of the good.

Under the arrangement that I have just mentioned, there is no credit being charged along the line.  The shop is going to pay commission back to the credit provider.  There is no interest charged anywhere in the system.  While such credit may not come at a cost to the consumer, there is nevertheless a concern that the consumer, if not adequately assessed, could overborrow.  We do not want consumers going around several shops and doing this and building up unsecured debt.  The concern is that some consumers could overborrow and may have difficulties in meeting their financial commitments.  This is to help prevent overborrowing.  Therefore, it is considered prudent to address this matter and ensure that any person which advertises the provision of BNPL credit to consumers, including interest- and cost-free BNPL credit, will fall within the scope of the Consumer Credit Act and within the scope of Central Bank regulation.  Really, we are talking about the practice whereby companies are providing the funding indirectly, no interest is being charged to the consumer, the shop is not charging the consumer any interest or credit, and the finance provider is not being paid by way of interest, but is being paid through commission from the shop.  We are concerned that if that practice escalates, people might overborrow.  The best way of preventing that is to ensure that the provider of that credit falls under the scope of the Central Bank regulation and the Consumer Credit Act.  There will be the normal credit checks in relation to the credit that people are building up.  We cannot do that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022022300002#E00400","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":431,"content":"<p>So, is Deputy Doherty buying the jacket?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022022300002#E00500","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":432,"content":"<p>With respect to the Minister of State, we know all of that.  The problem is that if Klarna does not advertise its services, it does not fall under the scope of the Central Bank regulation, under which the Government and all of us want to bring it.  It is conditional on advertising and inviting the person to take up the credit.  I am going to leave it at this point.  A note would be helpful to ensure that there is tight language.  Maybe it is already done.  However, from what I see in terms of the way it is written, there probably could be an area where companies such as Klarna could say that they do not advertise, because it is actually the retail website that advertises.  In Britain, it is the retail website that advertises the credit.  For example,  if a customer goes onto the Topshop website, they will be asked if they want to pay by Klarna.  It is the Topshop website that advertises it.  The customer clicks the button and it takes them to Klarna and a back office that is not advertised.  That is the problem.  If it is conditional on advertising and inviting the person in, I think it would be worth going back to officials in the Central Bank or whatever to make sure that it should not be contingent on whether it is Klarna or the shop that advertises - it should be captured.

Later, we will deal with the fact that APR is capped at 23% for these services, which I support.  At least it is being brought into line with other services.  Going back to the example of Klarna, it offers interest-free credit up to a point.  If you miss a payment, you are penalised.  The APR that Klarna charges is way above 23%.  Does section 11 include the groups that we have now included in the regulation of the service?  What happens is that late payment fees are charged in relation to this.  It is not just about bad credit checks or people borrowing too much.  People are heavily penalised.  Most of the customers are students or people on low income.  At a time of high inflation, this makes matters worse.  Klarna is just here and is new to people.  It is a different way of money lending.  It is fine if the customer is making their payments but a study that was done in Britain showed that one third of millennials who have used BNPL credit have been charged late payment fees.  The study showed that the customers are 18 to 24-year-olds, over one third were 25 to 34-year-olds and some were even over 65.  Many are students trying to get through college, and so on.

The amendment calls for the Central Bank, no later than six months following the date on which this section is commenced, to present a report to the Minister for Finance, examining: the buy now, pay later products in the market, with particular reference to but not restricted to the current state of the buy now, pay later products market including its component parts and recent changes in size and scale; the possible trends and future pressures in the buy now, pay later products market; to present an assessment of the benefits and harms evident or possible in the buy now, pay later products market and those that may be expected as the buy now, pay later products market develops; and to compare international approaches, including regulatory measures, in response to the issues examined where relevant; to make recommendations, as the Central Bank considers necessary or appropriate, to respond to the issues examined.<\/p><p>The amendment also calls for the Minister, after receiving a copy of that report to lay the report before each House of the Oireachtas.  If the Minister does not accept any recommendations of the Central Bank in the report the Minister shall within one month of being presented with it prepare and lay before each House of the Oireachtas a statement of the Minster&rsquo;s reasons for not accepting it.<\/p><p>I tabled this amendment because there has been a huge increase in the buy now, pay later, BNPL, market.  Just as we have seen with PCPs, we are seeing a large increase in this type of market.  Indeed, it is increasing exponentially.  This market is of particular concern at a time of rising prices.  When somebody goes into a shop and decides to buy a flat screen television on a BNPL basis, for example, the situation is that up to one third of younger individuals will miss payments and will be penalised.  This has an impact on their credit rating.  Across the water, an average of one quarter of all adults who use BNPL services have failed to pay on time and that goes up to 35% for those between the ages of 18 and 34.  Those figures are truly shocking but that is what is likely to happen in our market too, with significant consequences.  We need to be ahead of the curve in relation to this.  <\/p><p> As I mentioned earlier, over four years ago I called for regulation in relation to PCPs.  PCPs, which account for hundreds of millions of euro of credit, have been unregulated for the last number of years.  This legislation, when it passes with the support of the Houses, will deal with that issue.  The BNPL market is now being regulated as a result of this legislation and that is to be welcomed.  However, there are further issues that need to be looked at in the context of the impact this will have on the provision of credit and on consumers, particularly those on lower incomes as well as those who are not necessarily on a low income but who are younger and are taking the easy option to have the commodity here and now and pay for it over a period of time.  The evidence suggests that those payments are not running smoothly, that the penalties are significant and that debts are just handed over to debt collectors.  Those debts spiral and people get into a cycle.  What this amendment does is task those who are best placed to deal with this issue with looking at this market, at the growth in the market, the opportunities and benefits it presents, as well as the negatives and to respond back if they deem it appropriate.  Maybe they will say that everything is fine but if not, they are tasked with making recommendations.  Under this amendment the Houses of the Oireachtas is asking the Central Bank to do that work and report within six months.  I strongly encourage the Minister of State to support this amendment because there is a boom in the BNPL market which is giving rise to serious concerns relating to rising consumer debt and the consequences that can flow from that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022022300002#G02700","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":498,"content":"<p>Deputy Doherty&rsquo;s amendment concerns BNPL credit products and it appears that its primary purpose is to cause a report to be produced by the Central Bank that would, having assembled and analysed the data sought, make recommendations to address the issued examined.  Presumably the expectation is that, taking account of regulatory measures adopted elsewhere, there would be a recommendation to regulate BNPL providers.<\/p> <p>  This amendment is unnecessary and should be opposed because the Bill already provides for the regulation of BNPL credit providers.  This is being done by widening the range of financial agreements which will fall within the regulatory scope of retail credit firms, from its current scope of cash loan credit agreements directly provided to customers to one which will also include deferred payment credit agreements directly or indirectly provided to customers.  Therefore, this Bill will capture BNPL type credit.  Furthermore, the Minister&rsquo;s own amendment No. 4 will also provide that interest and cost-free credit agreements, including interest and cost-free BNPL credit agreements, will also be within scope where such agreements are advertised to consumers.<\/p> <p>  On the slightly separate point in Deputy Doherty&rsquo;s amendment regarding information and data on the BNPL market, it should be noted that section 9 of the Bill inserts a new section 36EA into the Central Bank 1997 regarding the collection and publication of information on relevant agreements.  In particular, it provides that the Minister may request that the Central Bank collect and publish information on credit and-or hiring agreements, which includes BNPL agreements, and such reports can be on a once off or recurring basis.  <\/p> <p>  Furthermore, it should be noted that under existing legislation the Minister can seek reports from the Central Bank, such as under section 6A of the Central Bank Act 1942 and section 81 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995, and therefore there is no need to have sector-specific provisions in law to provide for this.  Also, under the bank&rsquo;s supervisory powers the Central Bank can gather information as necessary without these specific provisions.  This information can be gathered at the behest of the Central Bank itself, without this provision.  The Minister, separately to this provision, can request the Central Bank to provide this information.  Therefore, there are two mechanisms already in place to facilitate the collecting of this data and the publication thereof.<\/p> <p>  In addition, the Central Bank regularly appears before various Oireachtas committees in relation to the performance of its functions, including its consumer protection functions, and members of the Oireachtas can avail of the opportunity to closely question the bank on all aspects of its work.  Regarding Oireachtas scrutiny of the Central Bank and the power of the Minister to seek this information, the Central Bank's supervisory powers already give it the authority to seek this information and publish it.  Accordingly, it is considered that the specific amendment proposed by Deputy Doherty, while well intentioned, is unnecessary.  I will be opposing the amendment on that basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022022300002#H00200","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":499,"content":"<p>That is very disappointing, if not surprising.  The irony is that Deputy Fleming, who is the Minister of State with responsibility for insurance, brought legislation before the House that only asks for a report on dual pricing.  He then went on radio and claimed that he was going to ban dual pricing but he had no hand, act or part in that.  He knows that it was me who made the complaint to the Central Bank.  I sat down with the Governor and convinced him to carry out the study.  The Central Bank published its report last year in terms of the way forward but the Minister of State did not even make a submission to the consultation process, unlike Sinn F&eacute;in.  The Minister of State produced legislation that asks the Central Bank to give the Government a report on how it is going when it is finally implemented in July.  This amendment is asking for the same thing.  It is asking for a report not just on the specifics contained in the legislation but also on wider issues in terms of the regulatory impact elsewhere, as regulators are clamping down on BNPL.  If the Government wants to deal with this in four years' time, in the same way it has dealt with the PCP issue, that is fine.  I am conscious that Fianna F&aacute;il was not in government then but it supported the previous Government.  It took over four years, since I began raising these issues, to bring forward legislation but we do not know that this legislation will have an effect this year.<\/p> <p>  Why would the Minister of State resist having a report of this nature?  Indeed, a better response from the Minister of State and one which would be acceptable to me would be not to put this into legislation but to give a commitment to ask the Central Bank to provide a report on the BNPL market, its potentials, pitfalls, the international regulatory framework and any recommendations it sees fit to make.  The bank might determine that there is a cause for concern here in terms of consumer protection and higher debt and it might determine that this market is going to grow based on what is happening elsewhere.  On that basis, I press the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022022300002#H00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"vote","time":1645574400,"counter":500,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 2; N\u00edl, 5.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p><\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022022300002#J00025","aye":["1462","1579"],"nay":["1584","1590","1626","1496","1553"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1645574400,"counter":501,"content":"<p>Section 17 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1645574400,"counter":502,"content":"<p>Title agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1645574400,"counter":503,"content":"<p>Bill reported with amendments.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Message to D\u00e1il","time":1645574400,"counter":504,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022022300002#K00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":505,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 101, the following message will be sent to the D&aacute;il:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach has completed its consideration of the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Retail Credit and Credit Servicing Firms) Bill 2021 and has made amendments thereto. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022022300002#K00400","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1645574400,"counter":506,"content":"<p>The select committee adjourned at 3.01 p.m. until 1.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 9 March 2022.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Select Committee on Health","time":1645574400,"counter":507},{"type":"unspoken","content":"<p>Th\u00e1inig an Roghchoiste le ch\u00e9ile ag 09:30<\/p><p>The Select Committee met at 09:30<\/p><p>COMHALTA\u00cd A BH\u00cd I L\u00c1THAIR \/ MEMBERS PRESENT:<\/p><p>Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la \/ Deputies Colm Burke, Cathal Crowe, Bernard J.

This transfer means that the Minister of State role will move, as will the relevant functions, which are essentially the interaction with the HSE.

Since the Taoiseach appointed me 16 months ago, this is what has been going on and I have been working with the Ministers, Deputies O'Gorman and Stephen Donnelly.

I also welcome that disability will no longer be the Cinderella in the Department of Health.  It will have the largest budget within the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which will put disability front and centre when negotiating budgets.

I am supportive of the Bill but I have a couple of questions.  This Bill is rushed.  We waited a good while for it but it was only published on 9 February and we are now on Committee Stage.  There has not been much opportunity to scrutinise the Bill, especially for the many advocacy groups working in this area.<\/p> <p>  The dialogue forum was established under the recommendations of the report from Dr. Catherine Day in 2018.  Now that the area of disability is transferring to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, will that Department be represented on the dialogue forum?<\/p><p> My second question concerns the disability capacity review.  We know that over 90% of people with disabilities are supported through general community health and social services.  All of these services will remain under the remit of the Department of Health when the transfer takes place.  What is often needed is a combination of specialist disability services and mainstream services, particularly for people with progressive conditions, meaning they will need to make significant changes over time.  What mechanisms will be put in place to ensure strong linkages and integration between disability services and mainstream health services?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022022300002#A01500","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":525,"content":"<p>The disability capacity review involves a whole-of-government approach.  The framework and action plan are being finalised with the support of funding because we know there is a lot of unmet need within that.  It is not just unmet need within the health element but also with regard to recruitment, training, housing provision, access to employment and social protection.  From a health perspective, it is a really welcome document.  Eithne Fitzgerald is finalising the framework and the action plan with us to go to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to seek funding for it.  I plan to divide it in three different phases in the first three years as opposed to doing it in a ten-year chunk and to front-load it to ensure we address that unmet need.<\/p> <p>  We know the expenditure of people who have children with challenging behaviours is no different from that of parents of children with multiple complex medical needs.  The expense and the under-resourcing and underfunding for these parents need to be addressed and to be front and centre.  At the same time, we need to address the rights of people.  The right to housing and the right to access employment are very well addressed, which is why we have the housing strategy and the comprehensive employment strategy.  I sit on both.  I am confident about the disability capacity review.  It has been a long time in the making and was eventually published.  The framework and the meat that is being put on the bone are very substantial.  It is not just sitting within one Department but must sit across all Departments.

Sl&aacute;intecare funding was afforded to the Department of Health.  We used it very wisely to address a specific issue raised by all Deputies on the assessment of need.  We will need to use that process again.  When we used the Sl&aacute;intecare model on the assessment of need, we successfully dealt with the issue.

We need a short-term solution but a long-term gain.  That is what I want to see happening, particularly in regard to the therapies, which is an area of concern for all Deputies.

We are putting in place the progressing disability services, PDS, model, which by all manner and means is very testing.  I am engaging continually every month at a national level with the HSE - it is very structured engagement - and every week with the Department to ensure this policy direction we have taken will work, most importantly for the families.

The provision of services is very problematic at the moment.  I sought details on the waiting lists.  The reply came back that the HSE does not have that information.  This is information that is with the various section 38 and 39 organisations.  How on earth can services be planned for if you do not have basic information and data on the waiting lists?  We are told that it may be ready at the end of the first quarter.  This goes back to the whole issue in the HSE around its appalling IT systems and how at any one time it cannot say how many staff it has in any particular area or how many are on the waiting list.  I am asking the Minister of State to recognise that this is a major obstacle to providing adequate services.  What you do not measure does not count, as the saying goes.  We need to put proper data systems in place so that we actually know the level of need.  Then efforts can be made to match that with the provision of services.

I am assured that by quarter 1 of 2023, all the PDS systems throughout the country will have the data and the information technology systems to collect that.  Then I will save Deputy Shortall and everyone else on their parliamentary questions because I want to have it live so that we see the waiting lists live - not the individuals but the numbers - so that people have a proper directory of when someone enters a particular CDNT team, what is ahead of them and where it is moving.  It is not in relation to accountability but it has to be in relation to seeing what is getting done.  We need to know there is a throughput but the clinicians themselves will want to see that too.  We must move away from a paper-based system because it does not serve any purpose waiting three months to get an answer.<\/p> <p>  On the response the Deputy received to her parliamentary question, early intervention is gone and it is all part of the PDS now.

Since the reform, the days of ageing out of a service has gone.  That is of little comfort to those who thought they were on an early intervention team.

A property should meet the needs of whoever needs to access it.  Deputy Hourigan talks to me clearly and at all times about the need for universal design.  Local authorities have a long way to travel on this issue and some are better than others.  They must ensure proper allocation and universal design.  If more local authorities addressed the need for universal design, more people could access properties and live independently, or could be supported to live independent.  A key focus of mine is to support people in independent living and to ensure there is proper personal assistant support for that.  We must also bring into the conversation how technology can support people to live independently.  Local authorities have roads to travel in this regard.  They do not have a target to provide, say, 5% of homes for people with disabilities.

There have been numerous cases of people breaking their ankles, legs and so on and so forth.

We must address the limitations on the extent to which disabled people can enjoy a normal living standard in their houses, insofar as it is possible for them to do so.

Theirs is a very energetic team and their office has been very good throughout the time I have been in the D&aacute;il when dealing with complex issues we occasionally encounter in our constituency offices.  They have been very engaging in that regard.<\/p> <p>  To follow on from the point our colleague mentioned regarding housing, we heretofore spoke about percentages of housing in a development needing to be equipped for disability or one's future needs.  I fully agree with Deputy Tully and the Minister of State that it is essential all housing stock be equipped for one's future needs.  None of us knows what lies ahead.  Some of us are born with limitations, while others, unfortunately, acquire them during their lifetime, and it is important the housing stock reflect that.<\/p> <p>  As a general housing point, this is an issue that arises time and again and it relates directly to Deputy Rabbitte's Ministry.  There are many empty nesters who have four-bedroom houses in council estates.  The spouse may have passed on, the children may have left and there could be someone down the road, often with a disability, who would love to be able to live in the house.  We need to re-examine the configuration of housing and of the idea that, when someone gets the keys for a local authority house, irrespective of when the person got those keys, the house will be his or hers forever.  In case the person's needs change, there needs to be flexibility built in.  I know of people in County Clare with profound disabilities who are still struggling to get housed.  There are ideal units in their town and village but they are taken up, often with many of the rooms vacant.  Flexibility needs to be built in to that.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the housing adaptation grant, the inclusion of sensory rooms last year was really positive.  I was a teacher in a former life and I developed our sensory room in Parteen National School.  The rooms are fabulous.  When a child is in a state of high anxiety or stimming, he or she can withdraw to that space, relax and come back ready to engage.  They have been in schools for only a few years, but it is incredible - revolutionary, in fact - that they are now being provided in homes, with Government support.  Does the Minister of State have any metrics to determine how that is going?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022022300002#K00200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":727,"content":"<p>I do not have any metric other than my constituency office, but the scheme has been very well received.  Having talked to my local authority, Galway County Council, I know it has been well supported.  For me, what brought to light the value of a sensory room, if the Chairman will indulge me for a moment, was on Sunday night last, when I was watching \"Room to Improve\" and the value of sensory rooms was addressed.   The little man on the programme went into the sensory room in the family's house and was able to regulate himself.  Ordinary viewers watching the programme would not have understood this unless they had experience and understood what life is like for a child with sensory needs.  We could see the value of that room and how the family could continue to function because they had the space to accommodate the room.<\/p> <p>  It is welcome that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has now seen fit, thanks to the Minister, to qualify sensory rooms as a need, and I expect there will be greater take-up of that now.  It is also important, however, that local authorities, within their housing stock, would acknowledge we need to build that capacity in to some of it.  In the past, for a husband and wife and two children, local authorities would say they were entitled only to a two-bedroom house.  Perhaps where there is a sensory need, we will need to designate another room as the sensory room.  Local authorities need to be open minded about meeting the needs of the family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022022300002#K00300","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":728,"content":"<p>I would like the Minister of State to champion the provision of sensory rooms more generally in respect of public buildings.  They are now in hospitals and many schools, and they are beginning to be built in homes.  There are many people who started their education in primary and secondary school being highly supported with intervention services and special needs assistants, SNAs, and went through our fantastic education system, for which I am a firm advocate.  They then go on to fulfilling careers in the public service and other areas, where they can function very highly and do a fantastic job, but there may still be times in the day or during the week when something can throw them.  There are staff in the public service, possibly even here in the Houses of the Oireachtas, who may have certain sensory issues.  Sensory rooms are very small in terms of the space they take up in a building but their impact is substantial.  I would love someone to be a champion for them.  A sensory room was recently installed in Shannon Airport.  People quietly go in before a flight and emerge feeling rested, calm and ready to board a plane.  It should be a feature of most public buildings in the general specification of design, and I ask the Minister of State to push that.<\/p> <p>  Her Ministry's transfer has been streamlined well and that is welcome.  I am conscious she is being flanked during the meeting by two departmental officials.  Has there been any departmental resistance or barriers of which we need to be aware as a committee?<\/p> <p>  Finally, turning to the section 39 charities and organisations that have acquired housing stock with support from the Government, it concerns me - I have said this to the Minister of State previously - that many of the residential houses that are acquired for people with disabilities are former bed and breakfast accommodation or seven- or eight-bedroom houses, which the general market of buyers would not go near.  We end up, therefore, with people who have profound needs being supported in an environment where the house is fantastic and the people around them support them but the house may be located 7 or 8 miles outside where they need it to be.  I can think of one former bed and breakfast accommodation in Clare - I will not say where it is - that is totally remote from where the needs are.  Nevertheless, the Department and the section 39 charities decided that because it has seven bedrooms, they would buy it, but that should not be the metric for whether to buy it.  It should meet the needs and, if anything, be town centred in order that the resident can walk out, have a coffee and socialise and mix with people.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for his forbearance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022022300002#K00400","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":729,"content":"<p>To clarify, I have experienced no resistance within either Department.

Perhaps one of them will be delighted to see me go and another will be delighted to see me come, but we will say no more about that and it is okay.  As for the HSE, as I explained earlier in response to Deputy Durkan, I have put in place a system that may be a little more granular than that which was there in the past.  I have a good working relationship with the HSE within the system that exists, because we need to get answers.<\/p> <p>  On the purchase of properties, it is important to put on record - I think the Chairman will understand why I am saying this - that there are many ageing families who care for people with disabilities, and we do not have enough property to support or meet their needs.  At all times, those individuals are trumped by crisis emergencies that come in ahead of them.  What I am trying to do with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, therefore, is to build in capacity while, at the same time, meeting the emergency needs.  When a provider sources a house, it does so in good faith.  It could be taking account of its book or its need for respite or residential care, and a property might not be available at that point in time, but it knows the needs of its families.  That is what providers are trying to address.  They are trying to relieve that anxiety, stress and pressure on families, and sometimes the property might not be at the desired location.  While we are building Housing for All and will, through the Government, I hope, deliver the houses that are required, it is my one desire that we ensure there are houses with universal design in town centre locations that meet the needs.  For once, we should not work off a key performance indicator, KPI, of debt to meet the needs of families but rather meet the needs and build in the capacity in advance.

It is not just the regulatory body, but the support could be from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Tusla or social workers.  Sometimes that relationship is not understood.  In the past, perhaps, we have looked on everything through the medical lens and seen everything as an episode, whereas, in fact, there were patterns establishing.

That is why in the past number of weeks, where we have seen an established pattern in the north west, there is the need for an independent review to understand that pattern and relationships.  I genuinely believe we do not understand patterns and relationships when it comes to the safeguarding of individuals in disability care settings.  If there was a comprehensive, independent, external safeguarding review carried out in same said location in the north west, we would take that learning.  It is not another report, but an independent review that I would like to oversee and deliver, whereby I would have assurances from my funder, the HSE, and the other providers that they understand safeguarding, patterns, relationships and how they would all work together to ensure the person at the centre gets the best possible care.  It is not seen as an episode but is seen, as it is dealt with, in the proper framework.  We can also reassure the families and rebuild the trust that when there is an adult loved one in residential or respite care, in the absence of legislation we would have regulation that would govern the delivery of the disability care settings and give back that trust.

The Minister of State will hopefully be doing that work on that day, but that is what it is about.  It is the legal piece.

There is a vast amount of unfinished business in the Department of Health.  Let us take for example the Brandon report, which originated in the Department of Health.

There are countless situations where there will be attempts to complain that we are dealing with a different situation now than previously, that there are different responsibilities and that different people are responsible for what happened in the beginning.  There is no excuse at all.  I do not cast blame on the Minister of State and I believe that the system must answer for itself.  In fact, the system in some cases can work very effectively and can answer for itself.  Things may happen, things may be brought to public attention and things are dealt with.  In other situations, on the basis of real advice, nothing ever happens on the basis that some day the guilt is implied or otherwise.<\/p> <p>  We have had recent experiences, and members will know more about them next week, whereby members of the public make complaints about things that are not going in accordance with what they see as the norm, and where there is no responsibility taken seriously, where people know when something is going wrong, have been alerted to the fact that something is going wrong and nothing happens again.  The question at issue is whether nothing is allowed to continue to not happen, and to prevail in that after the transition and I think that there is a danger that that might happen.  People have done it before, and people have done it several times, where in order to protect people various people object to publications etc. on the basis that there is implicit guilt in reports.<\/p> <p>  To my mind, whatever the feelings of people are, if there is a situation developing where the rights of the individual are seriously undermined or abused, and people of a vulnerable nature are abused, and people are not dealt with in the way that they should be dealt with by anybody, by an individual or individuals, or institutions then we have a duty, a job and a responsibility, as members of the health committee, to respond to it even though others may not think that the response is necessary.  We must do so even though others may feel that we cannot do anything because there are legal implications here and so do nothing.  We cannot have a situation like that ongoing and going forward, we certainly cannot have it.  I completely agree with the points on that issue made by Deputy Shortall.  I hope that we do not have to go back again because even as we speak these things are happening so I do not in any way impugn the Minister of State in this regard.

In a nutshell, when a function transfers, then it transfers warts and all.  I have been in the Department for the last 18 months and I have learned a lot from the experience.  I have learned that we produce an inert report and I can only see sight of it on a particular screen, as it is not published.  I agree with Deputy Durkan that there are times for getting under the bonnet and calling it out.  When we move to the new Department, it will be a case of putting the person at the centre, it will be the rights-based issue and it has to come with that approach.  The only way one can do that is when one has an open and transparent approach and that level of accountability.  I believe in that and I believe that the new Department is all about that.<\/p> <p>  To be fair to the Department of Health, with which I have worked closely over the last 18 months, its staff have supported me in that policy development piece while not having transferred and while supporting me in my transfer.  I have worked out of both Departments, while at all times wearing the rights-based hat albeit while working through a very medical lens.  Let us remember that this is what the Department of Health has funded for many years but that does bring problems.  There are problems.  There is no doubt but that there are systems that meet the medical needs but do not meet the rights-based needs.  I have referred to this already when I used the word \"episodes\".  That is how providers and care deliverers see certain things that happen in disabilities.  They see it through a medical lens.  We now need to see it more through a social care model and need to adopt a more holistic approach.<\/p> <p>  Yes, I am moving in the absence of safeguarding legislation but that comes down to a working relationship with the two Ministers.  I also have stated clearly that in the absence of legislation coming through the Department of Health, there is nothing to prevent the new Department from bringing forward its own regulations to address safeguarding in disability care settings.  We need to have a positive outlook as to where the shortfalls are and not be afraid to address them.  That piece is the technical piece.  Yet again, to talk to the piece mentioned by Deputy Durkan, we should not fall between two stools if somebody does something in the morning and it happens in the evenings.<\/p> <p>  I say to Deputy Shortall that there is a concern that nothing will happen on the day, that everything is done in good faith and that there will not be a twist in the tail.

There was one situation where colleagues raised a question and, if it had not been raised by them, the matter would not have been raised at all.  That particular situation was dealt with quickly, efficiently and effectively because it was raised.  I am sorry for going on about this more than once because I promised I would not come in again but I agree with Deputy Shortall.  An issue arises when we draw a line and end responsibility.

The policy responsibility transfers on foot of the transfer orders which are to be signed.  This section does not impact on that.  The whole transfer of functions will move disability policy responsibility, lock, stock and barrel, from the Minister for Health to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  This legislation goes alongside those statutory instruments.  The Ministers and Secretaries Acts provide for the transfer of functions.  A transfer of functions order will be signed which will transfer the functions.  This legislation provides for accountability to go along with those functions because it would not be appropriate to transfer over &euro;2.3 billion worth of expenditure and all of the significant responsibilities the Minister carries without giving him or her all of these powers.  That will happen.<\/p> <p>  It is not my decision to make the transfer but my understanding is that there is no intent to avoid holding people to account.  From legal advice, my understanding is that this section and section 63 are included to guard against such instances as something happening on the day of the transfer, the Minister writing to HIQA to ask for this terrible thing that occurred in this centre to be investigated but that letter being null and void because the Minister did not have the power to make such a request, the transfer having happened that morning.  In legal terms, this is called a saver section.  It means that something the Minister does is deemed to be lawful provided he believed he had the powers to do it when he did it.  There is no intention to somehow allow the Minister for Health to continuing carrying out his functions subsequently because section 65 provides that all of the powers being transferred cease the minute the transfer happens.  This is not some sort of back door to allow the Minister for Health to somehow retain these powers.  They will cease.  If the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth decided to write a letter directing that something be done before the actual transfer had not been signed - perhaps it was to be signed a few a hours later - he would not have had the power to do so at that moment.  Our legal advice tells us that the inclusion of these sections protects and safeguards against that.<\/p> <p>  I do not believe the sections will ever be used.  I think we would be okay if they were not included.  They are just included out of an abundance of caution.  It provides a particular safeguard.  What the Deputy has talked about will happen as a result of the transfer more generally.  As she has said, if the committee wishes to call in a Minister or an official to ask some questions, it will be the Minister or officials of the relevant policy Department who are called in.  Once the transfer happens, that will be a different Department.  However, it is not these particular sections that achieve that but the transfer itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2022022300002#O01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry McGreal"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":790,"content":"<p>I am still not getting the answers I was hoping for.

The specific theme of today's meeting is to discuss online disinformation and media literacy.  Ms Haugen is very welcome and I thank her for joining the meeting today despite time differences and everything else.  There is huge interest in what she has to say to the committee.  As she knows, we have been working on the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill.  We have heard a lot of what she has had to say through the media internationally and in Ireland.  Ms Haugen is very welcome and we look forward to hearing what she has to say.  I hope she can bear with me as I have some housekeeping to go through.<\/p> <p>  I remind members the format of the meeting is that I will invite our witness to deliver her opening speech, which has been limited to five minutes, and this will be followed by questions from the members.  The committee may publish the opening statement on our web page.  Before I invite Ms Haugen to deliver her opening speech, I want to explain some limitations on parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards to references made to other persons in evidence.<\/p> <p>  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Ms Haugen is reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that she should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if her statement is potentially defamatory in relation to any identifiable person or entity, she will be directed to discontinue her remarks.  Witnesses participating in the committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised they should be mindful of their domestic law and how it may applied to the evidence they give.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present in the confines of Leinster House to participate in public meetings.  I cannot permit members to attend unless they adhere to that constitutional requirement.<\/p> <p>  I remind members if contributing via Microsoft Teams to identify themselves when contributing for the benefit of the Debates Office staff preparing the Official Report.  I ask members to mute their microphones when they are not contributing to reduce the background noise.  I remind them to ensure their mobile phones are switched off or on silent.<\/p> <p>  It is a pleasure to have Ms Haugen with us today, albeit virtually.  We know she is speaking to us from the other side of the world and we very much appreciate her taking the time to be with us.  This particular debate and conversation with the committee is on disinformation, misinformation and online platforms.  We are really looking forward to hearing Ms Haugen's views and ideas on obligations we may mandate on social media platforms to protect users.  This is the main ethos and theme of our discussion.  With this, I open the floor to Ms Haugen and ask her to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022022300002#A00400","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645574400,"counter":945,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me.  I am excited to be here.  My name is Frances Haugen.  Last year I left my job at Facebook as I felt I could no longer be part of a system which harms children, stokes division and weakens our democracies.  I disclosed what I felt governments and the public should know about what is happening within these social media giants and the deliberate choices they make to maximise their profits at the expense of public safety and the never-ending pursuit of growth at any cost.  I hope my revelations have been valuable for committees such as this one.<\/p> <p>  It is clear governments all over the world had been searching for answers about how to tackle some of the biggest issues of the day and how to protect their citizens and their democracies, but they did not have enough information even to ask the right questions let alone write the answers.  This is beginning to change, with European nations leading the way in developing game-changing online safety regimes.  As the European home to some of the most powerful companies in the world, Ireland has a unique role to play in holding these companies to account.<\/p> <p>  As the online safety Bill acknowledges, self-regulation of social media has not worked.  Platforms cannot be trusted to act in the public interest.  They are often, as my revelations showed, fully aware of the harms caused by their products and services and yet choose to ignore these in favour of growth and profit.  The Bill is an important intervention, as is the EU Digital Services Act.  Both regimes say \"enough is enough\".  Their alignment is critical, not least because Ireland will need to implement the Digital Services Act but also because regulatory fragmentation does nothing to help Irish citizens.  It only creates complexity and uncertainty at a time when what we really need is clarity.  The Digital Services Act and Ireland&rsquo;s online safety Bill should align on key principles that allow quick, effective regulatory implementation.<\/p> <p>  There is, of course, no silver bullet to make the Internet safer.  The challenge is how to make things easier and not harder.  Alignment between Ireland and the EU will be crucial in smoothing this path.  Part of this alignment is about how to develop robust rights-respecting regimes that go to the heart of the business model of platforms, addressing the algorithms and design features that enable the spread of disinformation and hate.  We all want Ireland&rsquo;s Bill to succeed, and to do so it must focus less on content and more on how that content is shared, spread and amplified.  It is the systems of these platforms that should be the top priority and not the content.  These are systems that promote harm, target people with conspiracy theories and drive people to hate and abuse.  We cannot simply rely on the deletion or criminalisation of harmful content.  This is not only because it risks infringing on free speech but because it does not work.  Regulatory regimes that have focused solely on deleting content have failed.  There is just too much out there.<\/p> <p>  We have seen too many examples of how hypervirality and amplification of lies and hate can lead to division and polarisation online, and violence and harm offline.<\/p><p>The US insurrection and Covid infodemic are just a couple.  However, this is far from just a western issue.  In fact, some of the most egregious harms caused by the decisions made in the shiny glass headquarters in Facebook in Dublin have been in faraway places like Myanmar and Ethiopia.  The ethnic violence fuelled by Facebook in those countries are the opening chapters of a book too horrific to read.<\/p><p> That is why I came forward.  I can no longer be part of such a company.  It is also why I am urging the Irish Government to reflect deeply on its own role and on the responsibilities that come with housing these social media manipulation machines.  An important live decision currently rests with Ireland. <\/p><p> A few Rohingya youth from Myanmar have filed a complaint with the OECD national contact point in Ireland demanding justice for the genocidal violence unleashed against their community.  They are desperate for financial support to be able to continue their studies from refugee camps in Bangladesh.  Facebook has admitted it failed to stop horrific hate speech in Myanmar on its platform.  The UN concluded Facebook played a &ldquo;determining role&rdquo; in fuelling hate against the Rohingya.  Despite this, this trillion dollar company refuses to provide any meaningful remedy for fuelling violence, while pouring money into video games and virtual reality.  That is why these Rohingya youth are now appealing to Ireland to intervene.<\/p><p> Ireland has been part of the OECD for 50 years and has committed to promoting its standards for responsible business conduct.  It rests with Ireland to evaluate the facts and decide whether it will promote justice or the interests of a trillion-dollar profit machine.  I am hopeful that Ireland will do what the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar, promised when Ireland got a seat at the UN Security Council, which was to champion \"peace and security, conflict resolution and reconciliation.\"<\/p><p> Finally, as Ireland sets up the new regulator for its online safety regime, I would urge it to learn lessons from the criticisms of its other digital regulator, the Data Protection Commission, DPC.  The DPC is widely considered to have stepped back from its responsibilities in properly enforcing general data protection regulation, GDPR.  The tech companies on Ireland's shores, once again, got away with it.  As Ireland creates an independent, robust and effective online safety regulator, it must launch an independent review into the DPC so that it too can start to enforce the law thoroughly and boldly.<\/p><p> Governments and citizens around the world will be watching Ireland&rsquo;s regulatory regime closely.  It is reassuring that members are taking this agenda seriously, and I urge them to lead by example when holding these companies to account.  Members have the power and responsibility not only to improve the online safety of Irish citizens, but of people across the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022022300002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Haugen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":947,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Haugen for her opening statement and the chilling insights from her own experience.

They trained inhouse by Facebook.<\/p> <p>  Last night in our Seanad, I asked our Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media the following question.  Even if we pass the legislation in this country, are we fighting with one hand behind our back because we will not have the algorithm experts on the public pay roll to fight against companies that make a &euro;40 billion profit and can attract those people to come work for them?  As I said to the Minister, we would need to break into the chocolate factory and steal the Oompa-Loompas to get the magic formula to be able to fight Facebook.

Facebook never set out to sow discord or to pull us apart.  It never designed that.  It never thought that society was too stable, so it should pull people apart.  No one did that.  It faced a business problem that people were producing less and less content over time on Facebook and Instagram, which is a natural course for all social medial platforms.  It did studies trying to figure out how it could incentivise and elicit people to produce more content.  What it found by experimenting on people - treating them as test subjects and trying different ways of stimulating them to make more content - was that by giving them more likes, comments, re-shares and more engagement incentivised them to produce more content.  Unfortunately, when it started promoting optimising for engagement - those reactions - instead of just optimising for how much time someone spent on site, it had a side effect of ending up giving more distribution to more extreme content.  This is because the shortest path to a reaction is hatred.<\/p> <p>  The real question we are examining here is why Facebook did not act when it found out this was happening back in 2018.  At this point, it has been four years since this change happened.  Yet, it knew almost immediately.  Within less than six month, it sent researchers into Europe to talk to political parties and found that across Europe, people knew it changed the algorithm.  They said they used to be able to distribute content, such as a White Paper on agricultural policy - things that did not get the most clicks or most comments - and that people did not fight in the comment threads about the agricultural policy.  However, that stuff is important.  That is what society is built on.

My concern in regard to Ireland's Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022 is that it strongly focuses on content, that is, what content should be illegal, what type of content should be taken down and so on.  As stated by the Senator, we are having conversations about 2D screens when Facebook-Meta is trying to shift the conversation to this immersive metaverse video game kind of world.  What the Digital Services Act does well is that it focuses on risk assessments and the idea that what we need to do here is figure out how to close the feedback loop.  Currently, nobody but Facebook can see behind the curtain of its business.  Academics cannot study it and citizens cannot see more than their individual experience.  At present, there is no feedback loop whereby if something goes wrong on Facebook, anyone other than Facebook can observe it or suggest corrections.  The Digital Services Act's risk assessments close that circle.  It states that companies need to start disclosing what the risks are and they also need to be able to listen to concerns from NGOs and Governments and to state what those mitigations are going to be and have them assessed by an independent party.  A feedback loop would allow us to begin to shift the process and the way in which these systems work from being optimised for growth and profit to something that is more in the public good.  <\/p> <p>  The Senator spoke of the idea that individuals needed to be the solution.  That is not expansive enough to be able to help society in the way it needs to be helped.  I cannot overemphasise how addictive these products are.  Facebook's documents demonstrate that some of the most vulnerable people in our societies are the ones who get sucked the furthest down the rabbit hole.  Some of the characteristics that put people most at risk to being hyper-exposed to misinformation include the recent death of a spouse, being recently widowed, a move to a new city or the person being recently divorced.  It is the idea that when people are feeling the most vulnerable, they turn to this quick social fix, they turn to the online community instead of the in-person community.  The idea that individuals are the solution and they should boycott it is really dangerous.  It risks us leaving behind those who most need our care and need to be reintegrated into the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022022300002#C01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Haugen"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":971,"content":"<p>I again thank Ms Haugen for her work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022022300002#C01400","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":972,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Senator Hoey is with us virtually.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022022300002#C01500","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":973,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Haugen and I thank her not only for engaging with us today but, as stated by Senator Warfield, what could arguably be a great service to safety across the world and for giving us a glimpse into what happens behind the scenes.

It is important for us to understand how product choices, when integrated together, influence the impacts of encryption.  I strongly support the individual's right to access to encrypted communications.  The only chat app that gives me my core social media is Signal, which is an open-source form of encrypted messaging.  At the same time, we need to understand how product choices can increase the risk of encryption.  For example, let us contrast Signal and Facebook Messenger.  In the case of Facebook Messenger, you get a direct line to a giant catalogue of whatever people you want.  On Signal, if you want to talk to a 13-year-old, you will have to find that 13-year-old&rsquo;s phone number.  In the case of Facebook, you can go and follow whatever the latest meme is, find a group about that meme and then you will find a bunch of middle school kids.  You can go on Instagram and do the same thing.  We need to think about the interactions between systems.  We need to begin to think creatively about what tools we can provide to children in those encrypted spaces.  Therefore, I do not think this is a binary trade-off between X and Y.  This is why risk assessments are really important.  If we allow companies to build and progress on an encrypted pathway without having had conversations with the public, we will never build in systems that say, \"Hey, there's a bunch of these different tools that we could be providing to children in encrypted spaces\".  Yes, it will cost companies a little bit of money to develop them, but that is how we can make sure that we can have both safety and encryption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022022300002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Haugen"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":976,"content":"<p>That is incredibly helpful.

We spoke before about the idea that because Facebook operates behind a curtain, it gets to set the rules of conversation.  The ways we are talking about safety today have been shaped by Facebook's PR machine.  They have put the focus on the idea that AI and censorship, or the removal of content, is the solution.  They have said that the arguments we should be having are not about whether Facebook should be able to operate in the dark but about whether we are taking down too much content, or if we need to take down more.  They know that when we argue about censorship, we will never come to agreement.  However, we could have a conversation about the rules of the road, for example about whether Facebook should be allowed to operate without us being able to ask questions, but they do not want to have that conversation.  Therefore, when Facebook comes out and talks about AI as the solution, they are saying that they can come in and write a magical hate speech classifier or violence inciting classifier.  A classifier is a machine learning system or an artificial intelligence system.  It allows you to say that a post is inciting violence, so it must be taken down.  Facebook's own research says this strategy is deeply limited because language is nuanced.  As the Senator said, a sentence that could be totally innocuous in one part of a country could be very different and defamatory in a different part of it.<\/p> <p>  Even for American English - let alone Irish English, British English or Indian English - it can only take down 3% to 5% of hate speech.  Facebook's own documents said that because of these nuances in language, in a best-case scenario it would only be able to take down 10% to 20% of hate speech.  This is for the languages in which Facebook has chosen to invest.  What they did not tell the world was that in order to have artificial intelligence keep us safe, you have to rewrite those systems over and over again in each individual language.  Think of how many member states exist in Europe.  Think about how many languages exist in Europe.  Think of how many dialects exist in Europe.  A dialect has to be retrained.  Facebook has chosen not to invest in all the languages of Europe.  It has definitely not chosen to invest in all the dialects in Europe.<\/p> <p>  In 2018, Mark Zuckerberg wrote about engagement-based ranking, which is a kind of ranking whereby Facebook sees if it can get you to react more and rewards content that gets you to react more.  He said that is dangerous because people are subconsciously drawn to extreme content.  Even when Facebook asks people afterwards if they enjoyed this content, they say they did not.  Subconsciously, our brains are evolved to be drawn to that content.  This is super dangerous.  It is disrespectful to a linguistically diverse world.  Instead, we need to focus on how the algorithms work because those changes can apply to every single language and dialect separately.

When I was visiting France, as part of my visit in the fall, almost every single governmental minister who I met in France - and I met a bunch - almost every single one asked the exact same question.  They asked me whether I knew how many moderators speak French.  They said they had been asking for years, but Facebook would not tell them.  The reason Facebook will not tell them is because the number is so small that on certain pie charts. where they list all the money that is being spent on hate speech, there is no slice for French.  This is an interesting question.  The French authorities cannot get answers when they ask a basic question about many people Facebook has staffed to keep people who speak the French language safe.  I think approximately 1 billion people in the world speak French.  This is a major language.  If the French authorities cannot get the answer to that question, or if they cannot ensure there are enough moderators, how is a small ethnic group on the other side of the world supposed to get a minimal level of safety?<\/p> <p>  I will give a concrete example of how Ireland could have stepped in.  Ireland could have stepped in and said it was taking a leadership role to ensure a basic level of safety is ensured for platforms that exist in the country.  It could have said that Facebook had to disclose how many people were supporting each language in each dialect, because then we could have had a conversation about it.  If that had happened, it would have been disclosed that only one person in the company spoke Burmese.  That was one of the things that came out of the UN report.  You could also imagine a world where Ireland said it would start staffing a complaint hotline for people who work inside the company.  In the United States, if I work at a hospital, there will be a sign up in my break room saying, \"Did you see something that endangered patient health?  Call this number.\"<\/p> <p>  When I worked in counter-espionage at Facebook, I was literally on the other side of state actors who were trying to weaponise the platform to hurt other nations.  I did not know who in the government I could call for help.  We know that content moderators are on the front line of basic safety for people.  Someone might be getting stalked or threatened.  Moderators are the first line of safety.  Many of them are staffed out of Dublin.  Imagine if Ireland had provided a phone number and said that if you believe someone is in danger, you can call this line and we will make sure someone at least listens to you.  That could have been an avenue for the Facebook employee who was trying to raise the alarm about the Rohingya, but did not have a chain of command that they could escalate it up to.  The UN found that this employee did not feel heard.  Those are small, little things that Ireland could do.  It could require minimal transparency, at least, and provide a helpline for people who see things that are problematic.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022022300002#D00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Haugen"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":982,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Haugen.

Someone would have to say something ridiculous or extremist to get more attention but more people need to be engaged in this area.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask about online anonymity, particularly in the context of Facebook and Meta.  What efforts have been made to reduce the element of anonymity?  How difficult would it be for them to clamp down on it?  When I was launching my \"like\" page, I had to produce my passport and basically tell them what I had for breakfast but one does not have to do that across the board.  Indeed, with some social media platforms, the lack of individual tracing is just ridiculous.  Has there been a real effort on the part of Facebook to look into this area more?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022022300002#E00300","speaker":"1581"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645574400,"counter":985,"content":"<p>I understand the attraction of wanting to decrease anonymity on platforms like this.  I have heard a lot of different people suggest that we should have identification verification for all people on social media platforms.  However, one of the important things to remember is that we live in a really diverse world.  In most parts of the world, there are not computerised systems where we can verify an ID, where we can say \"Here's a picture of an ID, let's make sure that person is the same person.\".  As long as we live in a world where we cannot actually confirm with any computer method the ID of people, we are going to have a situation where someone who wants to get around any enforcement system will just use a virtual public network, VPN.  A VPN is a little pipeline that allows an individual to access the Internet from a different place in the world.  People can just pretend that they are coming from one of those places and can get an account that is not traceable.  Either we exclude those parts of the world from the system, which is not equitable, or we accept that making sure we know who people are online is extremely difficult.  I do not think it is realistically going to happen any time in the future.<\/p> <p>  The second thing is that platforms actually have a huge amount of information on people and companies like Facebook should have to work with governmental officials who provide things like search warrants.  They should be fast and transparent in providing relevant information when a crime has occurred, for example.  <\/p> <p>  There are two sides to this issue.  First, it is very difficult to confirm people's ID online and we should not pretend that this is a magic bullet.  Second, companies should disclose the information that they do have.  They know, for example, where people access things from and they can infer lots of things about people's friends.  They should disclose the information they do have when, for example, a warrant is presented and should not stonewall people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022022300002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Haugen"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":986,"content":"<p>On a separate matter, it seems that the more psychopathic the leader of a country is, the more of an online presence he or she has.

How does transparency relate to national security?  Usually when one thinks of national security, one thinks of secrets.  In the case of Facebook, it is important to compare what information it shares with researchers versus what information other comparable platforms like Twitter share.  I worked within the threat intelligence part of Facebook, with the people who are the first line of defence for finding information and influence operations.  This is a very commonly used technique by Russia for influencing how politics works in neighbouring countries and in other places around the world.  It is also used by China, Iran and many major adversaries who have decided to weaponise one of the most powerful things about western countries, which is their openness.  When I worked within the threat intelligence team, I saw a gross level of understaffing.  Facebook kept itself behind a curtain.  Twitter has said it will make 10% of all public tweets available to anyone in the world to research.  It is called the Firehose.  I was shocked to find out that many influence operations on Facebook were caught via Twitter because Twitter made data available but Facebook refused to do so.  People would analyse tweets and find networks.  They would find sets of accounts that acted in co-ordinated ways to spread messages that destabilised places like Ukraine.  People would then take those networks' IP addresses, give them to Facebook and point out that the accounts have the same names on Facebook and that the IP addresses are operating from the same places on Facebook.  It is unacceptable that we have to rely on Twitter's good actions to keep us safe with Facebook.  That is why any online safety realm must include safe harbour for researchers.  Facebook is suing researchers who try to keep Facebook safe.  It also needs to include mandatory, enforced transparency, like the Digital Services Act does.  Unless we have enforced transparency, we will not adequately find those influence operations that Russia uses to destabilise free societies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022022300002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Haugen"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":988,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Haugen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022022300002#E00700","speaker":"1581"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":989,"content":"<p>Deputy Mythen is next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022022300002#E00800","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":990,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Haugen for her guts and grit.

Facebook has lots of small solutions that would have radically reduced things like misinformation or inflammatory content, including things like requiring users to click on a link before resharing content, which Twitter did.  Has anyone been censored by that action?  Has anyone been oppressed because they had to click on a link before resharing?  No, but Facebook chose not to do that because it decreased the amount of content distributed on the system by a very tiny amount - we are talking tenths of 1% here - and that would have decreased profits.  We must have mandated transparency.  The public must have the right to ask questions and get real, validated data in return on an ongoing basis.  Facebook will tell us that they cannot give us this data on a monthly or weekly basis but that is a lie.

The change to the algorithm and atmosphere clearly led to incredibly partisan pages.  Partisan organisations were able to exploit it.

The latter happened in late 2017 and into 2018.  Before the US election of 2016, there were other problems with the system.  For example, it was found then that a huge proportion of people who joined neo-Nazi groups in Germany joined them because Facebook recommended those groups to the people.  Sixty-five percent of people who had joined neo-Nazi groups joined them because Facebook stated those groups had really excited people who really engaged a lot with Facebook and that they might like them too.  Those kinds of things were happening before 2016.  They unquestionably influenced politics around those times.  However, we have found since then that Facebook did not invest enough in safety systems and researchers who were asking these questions.  That is part of why we need to have mandatory risk assessments that do not just involve the company, because it is not going to see things it needs to see, but that also involve bodies such as NGOs.  That was before 2016.<\/p> <p>  In 2018, Facebook changed from focusing on how long it could keep you on Facebook to meaningful social interactions, where meaningful could involve hate speech or bullying.  It really just meant the question of whether Facebook could optimise for reactions.  Facebook, which had researchers in Europe preparing for the EU elections, identified within six months of the change that its systems were rewarding angry, partisan, divisive content over content that looked for reconciliation or a common path forward.  <\/p> <p>  Facebook has also known that advertisements are equally a problem and that a high-quality political advertisement is one that gets reactions.  As a result, extreme, polarising, divisive advertisements can be five to ten times cheaper than compassionate or empathetic ones.  We need to ask questions such as whether we want to subsidise angry, divisive content when we know we cannot have a democracy when we are partial towards division over reconciliation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022022300002#F00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Haugen"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":1001,"content":"<p>Ms Haugen just painted an incredibly bizarre picture of the period before 2016, when neo-Nazi pages were being recommended to people whom Facebook thought might relate to or like them.

One of the things we must remember is that the way the incentives are aligned now, the only numbers that have public accountability are profit and loss.  Those are the only things Facebook must mandatorily report in the United States.  Facebook has shown that for things such as its transparency centre, it selectively reports information, and I can answer questions about this, to paint a picture of the company that has little relation to it.  When we think about incentives, the people inside the company who find these problems were a part of the reason I came forward.  There are very kind and conscientious people working at Facebook who have no space to operate.  When they find these patterns and raise them, they might have to spend three or six months hammering on the doors to get anyone to pay attention.  When they do that, they can be labelled as squeaky wheels.  They are complaining and are not team players.  Unless we have mandatory transparency, there will not be a countervailing force to profit and loss that gives space to these people to operate.  We want to create a system of incentives whereby if someone sees a problem with, for example, neo-Nazi groups, as we are recommending, it is obvious and immediate that it needs to be escalated.  Today that is seen as a cost centre.  It is someone who is complaining and perhaps even exposing the company to risk.  Mandatory transparency makes it clear that we are watching and encourages the company to be creative and find solutions.  That is what good regulation does.

Perhaps I am coming at this from a different perspective.

I want to be really clear.  I really love social media.  I have worked with four social networks at this point.  The first time I wrote a programme that went out and read the Internet, it was on a social media site called Friendster a long time ago.  I was in Europe when I wrote it.  I thank you guys for sponsoring my education.<\/p> <p>  I want to be really clear.  When we have social media, it is about our friends, families and immediate communities and it is not that dangerous.  Things that cause these systems to be super dangerous are driven by a profit motive.  We could roll back in time to 2008, when we mostly saw content from family and friends.  Facebook runs experiments today when it rolls back the clock and gives boosts to content to people to which we are directly connected.  This is from people we know.  It is for free, and people get less hate speech, less violence and less nudity.<\/p> <p>  What is the problem then?  If we imagine a world where we only get content from family and friends, after 20 or 30 minutes, a person would finish catching up with those family and friends and go on to something else in life.  If Facebook wants to keep people on for hours and get more advertising dollars, it needs to find more content.  Facebook has begun forcing people into giant groups of 500,000 or 1 million people, and these are the pathways being weaponised, for example, by Russia.  Russia has figured out it can bootstrap these groups.  It has found hacks to build them very quickly and it forces out content to people.<\/p> <p>  What can we do to force Facebook back to a system that is more about our family and friends?  By requiring the company to disclose ongoing information about the performance of their systems and even those censorship systems, for example, we can begin to make it attractive for them to do some very basic fixes.  Let us imagine Alice writes something and Bob, her friend, shares it.  If Carol shares it again, it is a friend of a friend.  It might land in Dan's newsfeed and now we are beyond friends of friends.  If Dan had to copy and paste in order to propagate further - he cannot knee-jerk and hit a share button - that change alone would have the same impact as the entire third-party fact-checking system.  Facebook does not do it because it costs a sliver of profit.  It may be half a percentage point of profit because there is less content on the system.  It would be radically safer and more pleasant but it would be less profitable.<\/p> <p>  We must require mandatory ongoing reporting of metrics that can be audited by the public so Facebook feels shame when it knows somebody is watching.  It should be willing to use these little tricks they already know about and they work for everybody in the world and not just people who speak English.  The company will not do this unless it has to report something other than profit and loss.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022022300002#H00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Haugen"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":1023,"content":"<p>Ms Haugen has been involved with building social media platforms.

However, the reality is that because Ireland is the regulatory hub for these large tech companies, it has been flooded with GDPR violation complaints.  There are two problems.  First, a very limited number of judgments have come out of those decisions and those judgments, as they have emerged, have been deeply criticised by other parties inside the European Union.  Other parties are allowed to assess the judgments, confidentially, before they become public.  Time and again countries such as Germany, Italy and France have come forward and said that given the amount of resources and time that were put into the investigations, not enough substance is coming out of them.  Second, they are not coming out with enough teeth.  I believe that having an effective regulator is very hard.  I recognise that.  It is very expensive and hard.

It is a great example of where we do not necessarily need official enforcement with things such as driver licences in order to have much stronger protections for children under the age of 13 years.  One of the most shocking things I have brought forward for many people is the idea that Facebook has an estimated age on every person on the platform and it uses that estimated age, which is different from somebody's stated age, to do lots of analysis to target them with things like advertisements.  One can ask how Facebook is able to accurately predict somebody's age.  Things like who the person's friends are helps one estimate the person's age because not all the person's friends lied when the person was 11, 12 or 13 years old if the person snuck on.  Some of them waited until they were 13 years old.  It also knows the person's interests.  There are many ways to figure out approximately how old somebody is.  Facebook has found that, for some age cohorts, 10% to 15% of that age cohort were on systems like Facebook at the age of ten years old.  There has to be much stronger reporting.  Imagine if Facebook had to report for every cohort of 14-year-olds what fraction of them were on the platform at 13, 12, ten and nine years old.  It could be doing that right now and it would encourage it to be much more aggressive at finding underage people and taking them off the platform.<\/p> <p>  There are also systems such as facial recognition.  I have been sent multiple studies by start-ups that are investing in facial recognition and analysing facial features for estimating people's ages.  If we want to keep people under the age of 13 years off the platforms, I strongly encourage this because the rates of addiction in Facebook's own research are highest for 13 and 14 year olds.  Young people have less ability to regulate addictive behaviours.  That is why we do not let them smoke.  Similarly, there should be much more stringent controls for things like gating how much time somebody under the age of 16 years old can spend on these platforms because the self-regulation systems are not as mature.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022022300002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Haugen"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":1042,"content":"<p>Based on what Ms Haugen said about 13 and 14 year olds becoming addicted, should we set a limit of 15 years old as a minimum age for being on a social media platform and put the responsibility on those companies to make sure that they enforce that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022022300002#K00500","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645574400,"counter":1043,"content":"<p>I am not a child psychologist, and I encourage the committee to consult with experts who have much more education than I do.

At a minimum, things such as the rate limiting for people under the age of 15 or 16 years old is important, with an hour, two hours or three hours a day, some limit like that, but also being even more aggressive and saying that perhaps somebody should not join until the person is 15 years old.  I would support examining that question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022022300002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Haugen"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":1044,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Haugen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022022300002#K00700","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":1045,"content":"<p>This has been an insightful discussion with you today, Ms Haugen.  I begin by crediting your great bravery for coming out and speaking so publicly across the world.  All my colleagues have said you are doing the world a service, and particularly the next generation.  Hopefully, we will be in a position to protect them through your testimony here and to other parliaments around the world.  I will begin by quoting you.  In one of your discussions you said that Instagram can lead from healthy recipes to anorexia.  At another point you said that Facebook's internal research states that 13.5% of teenage girls said Instagram made their suicidal ideation worse, with 17% of teenage girls reporting that Instagram made their body dysmorphia worse.  They are the types of things we have been hearing from our witnesses' statements throughout our pre-legislative scrutiny.  There are a specific instances.  Can you extrapolate on the experiences you had with regard to the figures and particularly with young girls and how they are so affected in terms of body image?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022022300002#K00800","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645574400,"counter":1046,"content":"<p>I want to unpack that quote about how Instagram leads from things such as healthy recipes and healthy eating to topics such as anorexia.  Facebook has reproduced at least four times - perhaps more, as those are just documents I am aware of - what is basically the same study.  Facebook has said it publicly previously.  Mr. Nick Clegg, who I believe has some new fancy title at Facebook as head of global something or other, wrote a long blog post last year and I encourage the committee to read it, because I find it quite condescending.  It shows the type of attitude Facebook has towards the public.  It effectively said: \"You have been complaining about extreme content on Facebook, but you know what?  You picked your friends, you picked your interests.  This isn't on us.  It takes two to tango.\"<\/p> <p>  However, even as he said that, Facebook had multiple instances of studies that took a blanket count and followed a couple of innocuous things.  Perhaps on Instagram they searched for healthy eating and followed a couple of topics.  Then all they did was click on the content Facebook, Instagram and Meta gave them and came back the next day and did it again.  The nature of engagement they strengthen is that the algorithms are not smart.  They are just scanning for what one might engage with, what is going to draw one in.<\/p><p>The reality is that people develop things like anorexia and start cutting or engaging in other forms of self-mutilation is that there is something in our brains that is drawn to these topics.  Adolescent children are going through major phases of physical change, and that can be stressful.  Kids are following topics like healthy eating and just engaging with the content.  There is no two tangoing here; this is just the algorithms.  As they engage with it, they get led to more and more extreme content.  That is super dangerous.  These are young, impressionable children who instead of being supported as they go through a stressful experience in life are being drawn into an addictive platform that ends up hurting their mental health and even their bodies.  Anorexia is not about girls that are too skinny.  It is about women 60 years from now who are going to walk the Earth with brittle bones because of choices Facebook made or a 35-year-old woman who yearns for a child who cannot have one.  That is what anorexia is.  I encourage the committee to step in and to have a strong voice.  The regulator should be adequately funded and supported so that it can be tough and make sure that these platforms work for the people and bring out the best in us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022022300002#K00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Haugen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":1048,"content":"<p>Could Ms Haugen identify three &ndash; I am sure there are loads of them &ndash; design features that we could mandate on these online platforms to address that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022022300002#L00200","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645574400,"counter":1049,"content":"<p>I want to be clear.

One is that Facebook has chosen to focus on a censorship-based safety system, not what we are thinking about, which is the product traces it is making and arguing if they are acceptable risks.

This is a little bit like arguing about the number of angels that dance on the head of a pin.  We should be focusing on why it is that we are giving the most distribution to the most extreme content and not being able to have these defensible documents, as they call them, where they say: \"No, we've thought really hard about this.  This is what is violating and non-violating.\"  It is right to say that language is nuanced and especially in circumstances where it is not tailored to individual cultures.  There was a Member of Parliament in the UK who told me about how he was actively sent homophobic rhetoric, but because Scottish slang is not acknowledged by San Francisco, he was never able to get any protections.

The fact that Facebook can operate at the scale that it does, that it can touch the lives of 3.1 billion people and be completely opaque to us is unacceptable.  We are going to keep having whistleblowers come forward from Facebook until we have managed to get greater transparency.  There are not whistleblowers coming out of Apple.  That is because Apple is radically more transparent.  People can take their devices apart.  They can measure the pollution coming out of their factories.

I am an elderly millennial.  I remember the Internet in the 1990s.  The dream of the Internet was about the idea that anyone could reach out and impact people on the other side of the world.  With systems that are more transparent, like Twitter, which has a fire hose, anyone in the world can analyse one tenth of all the public tweets.  What happens when we open up and we say \"We are going to give access and we are going to do this collaboratively\", is that people come out of nowhere who help.  There are easily 10,000 people who closely analyse that fire hose on Twitter.  Because Facebook has chosen to be closed, however, it has both taken on a higher obligation because it is the only one that can currently solve these problems.  It has made life much harder for itself.  If we force Facebook to disclose more data, more people would take college classes where they would use that data.  Yelp, for example, does this.  Yelp has a data set where it lets people use its reviews.  As a result, 18-year-olds learn how to work with rough data.  Imagine if Facebook had 20,000 or 50,000 students around the world who are always looking at its data.  We would all be safer because we had forced Facebook to be more transparent.

Would one of the things we could ask Facebook to do be to change its algorithm from a tailor-made model that shows us what it thinks we want to see back to what it used originally, namely, a chronological algorithm whereby we saw what was posted by our friends chronologically?  Would that be a solution to try to take away some of the toxicity of the algorithms?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022022300002#L01300","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645574400,"counter":1060,"content":"<p>If we talk about chronological news feeds, Facebook is going to come out and say that it has run an experiment and that a chronological news feed has more bad content.

It is clear and crisp.  When we discuss engagement-based ranking and the idea that these algorithms are giving the most reach to the most extreme, polarising and divisive content, however, those problems are not just happening at Instagram and Facebook.  They are happening on TikTok and YouTube.  Breaking up Facebook does not solve that problem.  Mandatory transparency and having other countervailing centres of mass can solve it.<\/p> <p>  If I could do any one thing, I would probably open more channels for inviting public participation in safety.  For example, when we talk about the need to translate AIs into every language, there is a precedent of companies like Google developing tools that allow communities to transfer the companies' systems into the communities' own languages.  Facebook could have a strategy like that.  For example, there are 95 dialects in Ethiopia and six major language families.  Facebook could decide that the only way it could ensure adequate safety in Ethiopia would be to have community involvement in building safety systems.  That is probably the single fastest action to improve safety, but it would still not be rigorous enough.  We need ongoing transparency and measures like mandatory risk assessments so that we can evolve with time. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022022300002#M00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Frances Haugen"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":1068,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Haugen for being with us.  It is fantastic to have her and I thank her for all of the work she is doing in this space.  Her bravery and insight have had ripple effects across the globe.  Today is our chance here in Ireland, not just as a society or as legislators, but as a strategic location for the EU headquarters of many of the platforms in question, to use her industry experience and inside knowledge to make the online world a safer space.<\/p> <p>  Democracy is fragile and there need to be laws to protect it and citizens across the globe.  This is true whether you are in Ireland or Myanmar or on Capitol Hill.  Unfortunately, social media can become a weapon that threatens to destabilise democracy.  Engagement-based ranking is dangerous - Mark Zuckerberg told us this &ndash; yet we are living in a metaverse where what we see on our social media platforms are the posts that will get a corporation the most engagement and the most money.  He was right, in that it is proving dangerous to our values, our health &ndash; in particular, the mental health of our young people &ndash; and our democracy.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland, we used to look across the Atlantic at politics in the US and thank our lucky stars that our politics were not fuelled by money in the way it is there.  Unbeknownst to us, though, platforms like Facebook were changing that under the radar.  The sad reality is that someone can use money rather than messages to influence the national discourse and shape democratic decisions.  That is not the kind of society in which I want to live.<\/p> <p>  Social media poses great opportunities, especially for keeping families and friends connected, and it would probably pose nothing but opportunities if it was not monetised and did not become a global multibillion euro company, but it did, and that has meant that the threats are getting bigger &ndash; threats to democracy and stability through how easily people can engage in the viral spreading of disinformation, and threats to our health, including our mental health, through the generation of patterns of online hate messaging.<\/p> <p>  I was struck by what Ms Haugen said about safeguarding children of 12, 13 or 14 years of age and how modern technology like facial recognition could be adopted to make a digital age of consent work.  That is an interesting point because we in Ireland constantly struggle with the debate on how to get the digital age of consent to work without needing to share private data on children as proof of age.<\/p> <p>  I was interested in Ms Haugen's views on an individual complaints mechanism and how our new commission may end up drowning in complaints.  That is something that we hear constantly.  We want to strike the right balance between allowing people the ability to escalate their complaints without flooding the system to the point where it no longer works.  Ms Haugen mentioned a class action of complaints.  In Ireland, we have many great NGOs, for example, Webwise, CyberSafeKids, SpunOut and Bodywhys.  Is Ms Haugen suggesting that people complain to them and, if those people wanted it, the NGOs could escalate the complaints to the commission or is she saying that we need to have a system where we hit these companies where it hurts, that is, with significant fines, when we see that they are systemically failing to protect users?<\/p> <p>  I will run through a couple of questions and then hand over the rest of my time to Ms Haugen.  She is saying that the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill is overly focused on content.  That seems to be a concern for her.  I would like to hear more about that.  Ms Haugen is saying that we need to look more at the root of the problem.  How do we do that through legislation?  My blunt question is whether the Bill as it stands is fit for purpose.  Will it work?  Will the EU's Bill work?  Is it more important that the EU's Bill work and that the EU give Ireland the resources we need to ensure that we can manage online safety in terms of the social media companies that are based in Ireland but providing services throughout the EU?<\/p> <p>  My three main takeaways from Ms Haugen's exceptional testimony today are that the algorithm needs to revert to what it was pre 2018 so that reactions and engagements are no longer driving Facebook's metrics; investment needs to happen in AI around local languages and in moderating content so as to minimise the human cost of censorship; and we need mandatory risk assessments and the mandatory enforcement of transparency.  How do we as legislators achieve that?  What laws need to be introduced?  What else do we need to do and what else do we need to incorporate in EU law or our Bill so that we can have a real and lasting positive impact?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022022300002#M00800","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":1069,"content":"<p>I am sorry to say that Ms Haugen only has two minutes to answer all of that.

It has been thoroughly vetted, many people have spent a great deal of effort on it and it is very important for whatever Ireland passes to be aligned with the DSA.  The DSA has considered the question of how to stay abreast of these platforms in an ongoing way.  Members are right, in that the platforms are large and move very quickly.<\/p> <p>  Ongoing mandatory risk assessments &ndash; not just those done by the company, but ones where NGOs and other parties can chime in &ndash; are important.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Higgins asked about handling individual complaints.  It is not that difficult to write software that could provide people with a way of making complaints and then forming classes from those.  We could have a conversation about that another time, but there is a mechanism whereby there could be a broad range of complaints that would then be channelled to NGOs.  This would highlight that 10,000 people were all complaining about the same issue, for example.<\/p> <p>  Look to Europe.  In most industries, the polluter pays.<\/p><p>This is going to be a very expensive problem.  Algorithmic specialists are rare; there are few of them in the world.  They are incredibly well compensated.  I will give the committee example.  When I worked at Pinterest, myself and a team of three other engineers, were able to increase the total profits of the company by 6%.  We increased it by tens of millions of dollars with a project that took us a few months.  This is why algorithmic specialists are paid so much because we really can make these things radically more profitable.  Ireland does not want to take responsibility for paying enough people to be able to have a robust enforcer.  Taxing platforms to make sure that there is safe enforcement is the critical path forward.  Look to Europe.  The Digital Services Act is important.

The purpose of the meeting today is to engage with officials from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and representatives from the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, as part of pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the communications regulation (enforcement) Bill.  On behalf of the committee, I would like to welcome from the Department, Mr. Eamonn Confrey, principal officer, from the telecommunications and policy regulation division; Ms Megan Skelly, assistant principal, from the telecommunications and policy regulation division; Mr. Mervyn Hickey, seconded senior adviser, from the telecommunications and policy regulation division; and Mr. Joseph Stephens, principal officer and head of engagement, from the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC.  From ComReg, I welcome Mr. Robert Mourik, chairman and commissioner; commissioner Garrett Blaney, who is attending online; Ms Barbara Delaney, director of retail and consumer services; and Ms Caroline Dee-Brown, general counsel and director of legal services.  Our witnesses are all very welcome and I apologise once again for the slight delay.<\/p> <p>  I will read a note on privilege.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should be mindful of domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts of Leinster House will be asked reluctantly to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I would ask any member partaking via MS Teams to confirm, prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting, that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  <\/p> <p>  Members and all those in attendance in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Masks should be worn at all times during the meeting, except when speaking.<\/p> <p>  I call Mr. Confrey to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022022300002#B00100","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645574400,"counter":1082,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair for inviting my colleagues and I to assist the committee in the pre-legislative scrutiny of the forthcoming communications regulation (enforcement) Bill.  I am principal officer of the telecommunications policy and regulation division in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Megan Skelly and Mr. Mervyn Hickey, along with Mr. Joseph Stephens, head of engagement at the NCSC.<\/p> <p>  In my role as principal officer, I lead for the division with respect to the communications regulation (enforcement) Bill and the transposition of the European electronic communications code.  My colleagues, Ms Megan Skelly and Mr. Mervyn Hickey, have led on the policy and development of the Bill since its inception in spring 2021 and on the transposition of the code more broadly.  Mr. Joseph Stephens leads on the policy and development of the provisions of the Bill which concern network security, aligning with his broader role as part of the NCSC.<\/p> <p>  The communications regulation (enforcement) Bill, the general scheme of which was approved by the Government on 14 December 2021, aims to achieve five objectives.  The first and primary aim of the Bill is to transpose the enforcement provisions of the European electronic communications code, hereafter referred to as &ldquo;the code&rdquo;.  The code is a recast directive that will consolidate the framework directive, the authorisation directive, the access directive and the universal services directive, transposed into Irish legislation via the European Communities Act 1972.  The code provides for a European framework for the regulation of the electronic communications sector.  Key to its success will be its effective enforcement.  Enforcement of the previous directives was provided for in secondary legislation.  It had been the intention of the Department to replicate this approach to transposition for the code.  However, in spring 2021, advice was received by the Department from the Office of the Attorney General that this was not permissible and that primary legislation would be required to transpose the enforcement provisions of the code and to designate ComReg as the body responsible for the code&rsquo;s enforcement.  This Bill will address the issues raised in the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice.<\/p> <p>  The second aim to be achieved by the Bill is the updating and enhancement of ComReg&rsquo;s enforcement powers.  Providing ComReg with updated enforcement powers is a stated policy ambition of the Government and was included as a commitment in the 2020 programme for Government.  The Bill will propose a new civil sanctioning regime for ComReg that will include the ability to find non-compliance and impose a range of penalties, including administrative financial sanctions up to a maximum of &euro;5 million or 10% of annual turnover, compensation, refunds and the suspension and withdrawal of authorisations or rights of use, subject to court confirmation, as appropriate.<\/p><p>ComReg will also be permitted to enter into settlements and accept legally binding commitments from operators in lieu of progressing to adjudication.Providing ComReg with enhanced enforcement powers, particularly the power to find non-compliance and impose administrative financial sanctions, would bring the regulator further in line with many of its colleague regulators in the State.  The Central Bank, the Data Protection Commissioner and the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities are among the sectoral regulators that have administrative financial sanctioning powers.  The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill and the Competition (Amendment) Bill, both currently progressing through the Oireachtas, will give similar powers to the new media commission and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, respectively.  In 2018, the Law Reform Commission published its report on regulatory powers and corporate offences, in which it recommended that a suite of core powers be assigned to economic regulators such as ComReg, including the power to impose administrative financial sanctions.  ComReg has also publicly advocated for its powers to be enhanced in this manner.  At a European level, in the European Commission&rsquo;s annual Digital Economy and Society Index reports of 2018, 2019 and 2020, reference was made to ComReg&rsquo;s enforcement powers, most notably in the 2018 report, which stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tComReg is not vested with powers to impose fines, which is the courts&rsquo; prerogative, and ComReg is thus out of step with other NRAs with regard to timely and effective intervention. <\/blockquote><p>The third aim of the Bill is the transposition of security provisions of the code and the provision of a legislative basis for the electronic communications security measures, ECSMs.  These articles place general obligations on providers of electronic communications networks and services to take appropriate and proportionate security measures to manage the risks posed to their networks and services.  Articles 40 and 41 also place obligations on providers to report significant security incidents to ComReg.  The Bill proposes to allow the Minister to make regulations specifying the types of security measures that providers shall take, thus providing a statutory basis for ECSMs, which are a detailed set of technical security measures produced by the NCSC in consultation with ComReg and industry to secure the State&rsquo;s electronic communications infrastructure.  Finally, the security provisions provide additional supervisory and enforcement powers to ComReg to ensure compliance with the security provisions.  <br\/><br\/>The fourth aim of the Bill is to provide for a limited number of new consumer protection provisions for the sector.  The proposed alternative dispute resolution procedure, the publication of quality-of-service information and compensation for delays or abuses in the porting and switching process and missed installation appointments are all mandatory obligations in the code and must be implemented.  Only two obligations are not required by the code and these are the ability to set minimum quality-of-service standards that operators must meet and the establishment of a customer charter to set out the standards a customer can expect from the service provider and other specified information.  These provisions were developed in close co-operation with ComReg and seek to address identified customer service issues that routinely result in low customer satisfaction in the sector.<br\/><br\/>The fifth and final aim of the Bill is the updating of the Communications Regulation Act 2002, to align that Act with the code and make necessary amendments to ComReg&rsquo;s current functions and powers, improving its functionality and complementing the new proposed enforcement regime.  These will include,<i>inter alia<\/i>, a broadened information-gathering power, ability to reuse already gathered information, ability to better assist the Minister with policymaking and improvements to the notification, privilege and overcharging provisions.<br\/><br\/>By way of further background context to this Bill, two issues need to be mentioned: the infringement proceedings to which Ireland is currently subject for failure to transpose the code within the specified time; and the ongoing engagement with the Office of the Attorney General.  In respect of the infringement proceedings, the code was required to be transposed by 21 December 2020.  This was a complex project given the scale of the directive and Ireland, along with 24 other member states, failed to meet the deadline.  Infringement proceedings commenced against Ireland with the issuing of a letter of formal notice on 2 February 2021.  This was responded to on 7 April.  A reasoned opinion was issued on 23 September and a response to this was issued yesterday.  The reasoned opinion is the final pre-litigation stage in an infringement process, after which the Commission may seek to commence the litigation phase of the process, which can see member states subject to considerable fines and lump-sum penalties.  Mitigating against further delay to the transposition is vital if substantial fines are to be avoided.<br\/><br\/>In respect of the ongoing engagement with the Office of the Attorney General, work is under way to progress the drafting of the Bill in a timely manner.  We have been advised that certain legal constraints exist when developing an enforcement regime, given Ireland&rsquo;s constitutional jurisprudence and, in particular, the recent Supreme Court judgment in the case of Zalewski <i>v<\/i>. Adjudication Officer &amp;amp; Ors.  This results in limited scope for policy discretion in how enforcement regimes are developed.  We have been advised that this will result in the Bill as published being further aligned with the forthcoming Competition (Amendment) Bill than is provided for in the general scheme approved by the Government.  The extent of the divergence between the published Bill and the general scheme provided is still the subject of discussions between the Department and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  I thank the committee for its invitation to attend this afternoon and look forward to assisting in its pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022022300002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Confrey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645574400,"counter":1084,"content":"<p>On behalf of ComReg, we are happy to appear before the committee to discuss the general scheme of the communications regulation (enforcement) Bill.  I am joined by my fellow ComReg commissioner, Garrett Blaney, and by my colleagues, Ms Barbara Delaney, director of retail and consumer services, and Ms Caroline Dee-Brown, ComReg's general counsel.<\/p> <p>  ComReg is the national regulatory authority for electronic and postal communications.  We promote competition and investment in the sector.  We uphold end-user rights and manage the radio spectrum.  As the pandemic clearly proved, electronic communications are a vital input in almost every economic activity across all sectors of the Irish economy.  For individual consumers, access to high-quality connectivity is increasingly seen as essential, as it enables access to an increasingly wide range of services that are important for social and economic inclusion.  As the national regulatory authority for electronic communications, ComReg has among its principal functions both ensuring compliance by undertakings with obligations in relation to the supply of and access to electronic communications networks and services, and ensuring compliance with the competition law regime in the electronic communications sector.<\/p> <p>  Many of ComReg&rsquo;s activities are grounded in European legislation.  The European electronic communications code from December 2018 introduces an enhanced regime for the regulation of electronic communications across the EU and repeals and replaces the 2002 regime.  The electronic communications sector had seen rapid development in the years since the previous European regulatory framework was established and ensuring the code is properly transposed and the new regulatory framework in Ireland is fit for purpose is critical.<\/p> <p>  We understand that primary legislation is needed to give full effect to key aspects of the code and, thus, ComReg is happy to see the communications regulation (enforcement) Bill being discussed today.  It should significantly enhance our enforcement powers and introduce a range of new consumer protection measures.  Of course, the details of the Bill are important to ensure the desired outcomes for competition and consumers are achieved.  The importance of effective legislation to enable ComReg to carry out its core functions has been widely recognised, including by the Department, as we just heard, but also by the OECD, the European Commission, industry representative associations such as Alternative Operators in the Irish Market, ALTO, and the Law Reform Commission.  It is even mentioned in the programme for Government.<\/p> <p>  A key component of such legislation comprises effective, usable and robust enforcement provisions.  ComReg welcomes the Bill on this front.  We would like to see legislation introduced that will be not only robust to legal challenge but usable in practice and therefore genuinely effective.  In this regard, ComReg notes that two other significant pieces of legislation that contain enhanced enforcement powers for regulators in other areas have recently been published, namely, the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2022 and the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022.  ComReg notes that there are significant differences in the approaches of the Bills to certain aspects of enforcement.  To be effective and efficient, ComReg favours what appears to be the less prescriptive, less cumbersome and more easily workable regime found in the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill.<\/p><p>It is important to take into consideration the size and structure of ComReg and its current decision-making processes, which the general scheme of the Bill considers have worked well to date, when designing the best enforcement legislation.  ComReg welcomes the proposed upper limit for financial sanctions on a body corporate at &euro;5 million or 10% of annual turnover as proportionate, effective and dissuasive in the context of the electronic communications sector in Ireland, which as members know includes some of the largest utility operators in the State.  However, the deterrent effect of financial sanctions only works if they can be applied by means of enforcement mechanisms that are timely, efficient, and legally robust.  Strong deterrents are an important tool for ComReg to ensure industry complies with its regulatory obligations.  This will achieve the desired results for competition and consumer protection.<\/p><p> The general scheme proposes improvements to our regulatory investigation powers, and we welcome these as they will improve our enforcement capabilities.  ComReg also welcomes the introduction of the security provisions which have become ever more important as Irish society relies increasingly on secure networks.  ComReg requires robust enforcement powers to be effective in managing its security and integrity remit for the sector and as a key input to the NCSC.  Noting ComReg&rsquo;s last appearance before this committee, ComReg welcomes the inclusion of a substantial number of new consumer protection measures in this Bill, including a customer charter, minimum quality of service standards, a new compensation scheme that will entitle consumers to compensation for failings by operators, and an enhanced alternative dispute resolution mechanism for consumers.  On the basis of this scheme, Irish consumers of telecoms services should enjoy better protection and more choice going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022022300002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr.  Robert Mourik","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":1086,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Mourik.

This Bill hopes to achieve five strands but I will hone in on one of them.  On Monday morning I was out doing my clinics in Clare and somebody gave me a volume of paperwork about mobile phone masts.  I brushed it off and said we have been there and heard all of that.  We have heard all the tinfoil hat people, heard all of that and we have rubbished it.  I said I was not convinced by this.  Nonetheless, I took a few pieces of paper and said I would bring them to the committee because they are from eminent sources.  I said I am not into the hysterical stuff, only stuff that has come from eminent sources.<\/p><p>I refer the officials to Article 30(6) mentioned in the general scheme as I have a few points to make on it.  This relates to breaches representing an &quot;immediate and serious threat to public safety, public security or public health or risks creating serious economic or operational problems for other providers or users of [ECN, ECS] or other users of the radio spectrum&quot;.  Essentially, there is a framework here that provides protection to ensure things are within compliance levels, certainly with respect to non-ionising radiation and all the outputs of these radio signals.<\/p><p>Going back to Monday, I was given a volume of paperwork.  I chose to omit much of it.  This lady is from the Chairman's constituency and might be in contact with him very shortly as well.  I want to reference a few of these documents because about a decade ago we quite rightly eased most of the planning criteria required for mobile phone network infrastructure.  We were right to do so.  Every one of us has a mobile phone.  We need them and need to be able to use them actively when we are on the move without networks crashing.  I am glad there is an aim nationally to have all populated parts of Ireland receiving a 5G signal by 2030 and I hope we get to that point even sooner.  In the rush to get to a low-regulation ending so we could fast-track delivery of this, certain things may have been surrendered.  I put them as questions even though we may not have the answers to them in this meeting.<\/p><p>In June 2005 the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, a precursor to this one, submitted a report to the Government of the day.  It said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Joint Committee makes the observation that the planning processes for the erection of masts would not appear to be an open and transparent procedure.  The Joint Committee recommends that all planning guidelines and exemptions be re-examined with a view to ensuring that no &lsquo;electromagnetic emitting&rsquo; or &lsquo;radio frequency emitting&rsquo; equipment is sited near health centres, schools or other sensitive sites such as playgrounds or pitches etc. <\/blockquote> <p>That was 16 years ago.  That no longer applies.  The thrust of my contribution is while it is right to ease planning restrictions to allow infrastructure so critical to Ireland to exist and to do so in all parts of the country rather than just urban areas, at the same time, some of the prior health concerns need to remain under a lens of scrutiny.<\/p><p>The next item I will reference comes from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.  It was published ten years ago.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWhile electrical and electromagnetic fields in certain frequency bands have wholly beneficial effects which are applied in medicine, other non-ionising frequencies, whether from extremely low frequencies, power lines or certain high frequency waves used in the fields of radar, telecommunications and mobile telephony, appear to have more or less potentially harmful, non-thermal, biological effects on plants, insects and animals as well as the human body ... <\/blockquote> <p>I will stop there.<\/p><p>As I said, I was given this volume of evidence.  I did not accept most of it but are were certain eminent reports that need to remain under scrutiny.  I think the scientific debate on this was largely shut about ten years ago.  I tell ComReg and the Department that it needs to remain.  There needs to be a capacity here.  It is not all about infrastructure and consumers.  There needs to be a capacity to stay current with the technology and the potential health risks - which hopefully do not exist - that some eminent bodies, including the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, have in the past identified.  Have the officials' organisations the capacity to do that?  Have they the public health capacity to make decisions and to monitor at this level?  Without that, the legislation, when enacted, will be rather limp.<\/p><p>I have two further points and will then conclude.  The principle of co-location also came in about a decade ago.  It was a very good principle and ensured that in the part of County Clare I live in, which is similar to many parts of Ireland where there is a large population, companies had to work with each other and share space on a mast.  We all want to see antennae that give us a good signal but we do not want to see all these ugly masts popping up here, there and everywhere.  Proliferation of them certainly is not needed.  That principle was largely followed a decade ago but has been largely abandoned in the last two or three years.  Again, in my locality there are now about 18 antennae, masts and poles.  When I leave Ennis and drive four or five miles west, there is nothing.  There is disappearing infrastructure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022022300002#D00300","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":1088,"content":"<p>I remind the Deputy to leave time for a response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022022300002#D00400","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":1089,"content":"<p>Yes.

We need to keep some eye on the health risks, whether real or imagined.

I will make a couple of points.  The first thing to say is that the Department and Minister have no role in the individual roll-out plans of private operators with regard to masts or anything like that.  Clearly, individual projects or applications will have to go through the planning process, as the Deputy will be aware.  However, the Minister does have policy responsibility for matters pertaining to public exposure to non-ionizing radiation.  Policy in this area is informed by a lot of internationally recognised scientific research and evidence.  This includes guidelines set down by the ICNIRP.  I understand they were revised in March 2020.  Those guidelines provide scientifically based exposure limits that are applicable to both public and occupational exposure to electromagnetic fields, including from 5G.  These guidelines are based on evidence gathered from a range of peer-reviewed scientific literature.  Ireland has commissioned its own research into this with reports in 2007 and 2016 concluding that there is insufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship between exposure to low-frequency electromagnetic fields and adverse health effects.  While there is insufficient evidence pointing to a causal link, this is obviously something that needs to be monitored continuously.  In May 2019, the Minister assigned a new statutory function to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to monitor scientific, technical and other developments on these matters and to advise the Minister accordingly.  Clearly, the EPA is fairly proactive in providing information to the public.  In fact, it commenced a national monitoring programme for electromagnetic fields in 2021.  I understand a report on that was expected late last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022022300002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Confrey"},{"type":"speech","time":1645574400,"counter":1098,"content":"<p>I will conclude by thanking the witnesses.

I have a couple of sets of questions.  The first set of questions is for the Department.  When the officials were in with us before, they indicated a timeline.  Will they give us an update on their sense of the timeline and where we are in the preparation of the heads of this legislation with the Government?  How does that relate to the potentially substantial fines they have mentioned?  Will they explain further what is meant in the last paragraph of the opening statement which refers to new advice from the Attorney General and the implications of the Supreme Court judgment leading to a difference between the published Bill and the general scheme?  How does that relate to the timeline and the types of consideration the Department has to undertake in that regard?  We heard the representatives of ComReg indicate that it has a preference for the model of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022.  Does the Department support or agree with this or intend to incorporate it into the Bill?<\/p> <p>  My next questions are for ComReg.  The witnesses have covered ComReg's perspective on the Bill in their opening statement.  We have heard from them before with specific regard to customer service, response times and the quality of response, particularly from broadband and telecommunications providers.  As it stands at this stage, the Bill would give ComReg additional powers to address those issues.  What might customers expect in that regard?  With regard to the nuisance calls people have been getting, which seem to have quietened down a little bit, what might customers expect from this legislation in practical terms if it is fully enacted?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022022300002#E00700","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645574400,"counter":1100,"content":"<p>The first of the three questions related to the timeline.  As I have indicated, the general scheme was approved in mid-December 2021.  Since that time, and in advance of it, we have been engaged in intensive discussion with the Office of the Attorney General and others on the development of the scheme.  I may be corrected by my colleagues on this but, at the moment, the legislation is on the Government's priority programme and we are working towards a timeline of early April for the expected publication of the Bill.  That is certainly our understanding and expectation based on our interaction with the Attorney General's office.  I assure the Deputy that the Bill is being given a very high priority.  In fact, the Attorney General himself has been heavily involved in much of the discussion on this.  It is worth saying that there are three pieces of legislation in this area moving through the Oireachtas at the moment: this Bill; the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022, which was published in January; and the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2022, which was published a number of weeks later and to which the Bill before us today is very closely aligned.  It is a question for the Government and the Attorney General to make sure the regimes that are being introduced as are aligned as possible.<\/p> <p>  I will pass over to my colleague, Mr. Hickey, in a second to take the Deputy through the implications of the Zalewski case he mentioned.  Making sure the regime being brought forward is legally robust and can withstand challenge is quite high in the Attorney General's mind.  Reading into the Deputy's third point, on whether we support the request from ComReg, what we are ultimately seeking to achieve is a regime that is robust and enforceable but also workable and appropriate for the market that is being regulated.  I will pass over to Mr. Hickey on the specifics of the Zalewski case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022022300002#E00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn Confrey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645574400,"counter":1101,"content":"<p>We have to look at administrative financial sanctioning regimes in the context of being pre or post the Zalewski case.  There are many extant financial sanctioning regimes but, if they predate that decision, they must be looked at against that background.  I will not go into any deep exploration of the case but the key takeaway for us and what has influenced what we are doing is that the regime of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, was challenged.<\/p><p>The Supreme Court concluded that what was being engaged in by the WRC was the administration of justice.  There had been some doubts as to whether that would be the case but the Supreme Court has confirmed it is.  Because it is the case, a limited exception is granted under Article 37.1 of the Constitution for judicial functions of a limited nature to be carried out by administrative regimes, such as in the case of the Bill that has been proposed and is before the committee today.  If that is to be the case, however, those functions are now subject to many requirements for fair procedure, which may previously not have been clearly required but now are clearly required.  The scheme we presented, therefore, had to undergo a rigorous analysis and continues to be rigorously analysed to ensure it is robust.  The Competition (Amendment) Bill, which is further along, will show the signs of that development.  We are engaging with the Office of the Attorney General on such matters that are common to our scheme and those requirements will have to apply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022022300002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mervyn Hickey","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645574400,"counter":1103,"content":"<p>I will take the first of the Deputy's three sets of questions before handing over to my colleague to talk about the practical implications.  Finally, I will address the question on nuisance calls.<\/p> <p>  Our general perspective on the Bill, which deals with two elements, is very positive.  It will give ComReg both better enforcement powers and some additional powers in the area of consumer protection.  These issues, in my view, go hand in hand.  There can be many different powers - we have them, for example, in the competition area and we will also, we hope, get some additional ones in the consumer area - but we will not be able to apply them as effectively if we do not have good enforcement legislation as a counterbalance.  In that sense, we are very happy with what the Bill aims to do.  The devil, as always, is in the detail, and we have just heard a debate on the most effective way of implementing that enforcement legislation.  All we ask of the Department and the Oireachtas is that they will come up with a regime that is legally robust but also workable for us.

In tandem with the enforcement regime, there are new obligations and new rights for consumers that will be very positive, the first of them being a customer charter.  That is the single place that customers of electronic communications providers should be able to go in order to understand what they can expect, and then compare the different service providers.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, the other complementary provisions are really important, such as the quality-of-service standards.  A service provider can commit to a particular level of service, whether in regard to answering the phone or emails or whatever.  The Bill will provide that if ComReg does not believe the provider is sufficient in making those commitments, it will be able to come onto the pitch and set minimum standards.  Service providers can go beyond those minimum standards, but there will be a standard below which they cannot fall.  I am just using the example of customer service but we would hope there will be other headings within the charter.<\/p> <p>  As for what would happen if providers fall below the standard, that is where the compensation scheme would come in.  The proposal is to have a compensation scheme where compensation is given automatically where the provider falls below the minimum standard that was either set or committed to in the first instance. That would be something an individual customer could benefit from.  We hope the regime will not only give benefits for consumers but drive the overall standards upwards, with competition in regard to the standards, which heretofore we have felt was lacking.  Finally, the enforcement powers that will come in will allow us to take action not just from the consumer perspective of getting compensation but also by allowing us to take action if the provider has not implemented the charter or the standards.<\/p> <p>  In summary, the Bill will address the gap that was identified and highlighted by the committee.  We are happy to see the proposals will go towards addressing that gap.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022022300002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Barbara Delaney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645574400,"counter":1105,"content":"<p>The issue of nuisance communications is not, strictly speaking, part of network security or of the Bill, but I might give the committee an update on it.

It is not something we have the ambition to be able to resolve straight away, given that once we find one solution, fraudsters will find other ways around it.  Nevertheless, we think we are looking, along with industry, at the most promising ways of reducing the number of nuisance calls and text messages.  The task force meets monthly.  It is, of course, up to operators to implement the measures, and after six months or a year, the task force will report back.<\/p> <p>  We have done much analysis with other regulators, both in the United States and in Europe, and we have been able to identify a number of pragmatic solutions that can be implemented quickly in order that, we hope, consumers in Ireland will see a reduction sooner rather than later.

Many of the points I had intended to raise have been covered.  There was a reference to the transposing of the EU code and the updating of the 2002 Act.  They are kind of background issues that the consumer will not really be concerned with.  While they are important, they are quite technical and will not be very impactful on the ground.  There is also the issue of sanctions.  To clarify, ComReg deals with landline companies, mobile network companies and broadband provision, as well as text messages within the mobile network.  I understand the Virgin Media provision of television services and cable television does not come under that.  I wished to clarify that, given some of these providers also provide broadband and phone lines along with cable television and so on.<\/p> <p>  What will ComReg be able to do in future that it cannot do now?  What will be the difference in the day-to-day operation of the regulator?  Will it have sanctions it can issue or sanctions it can issue more quickly?

I have heard endless examples of people having just given up because they cannot spend 30, 40 or 50 minutes doing that.  It seems to happen all the time, not just at 9 a.m. on a Monday.  Will ComReg be able to set minimum standards such that a call must be dealt with within a certain period, such as five, seven or ten minutes?  We all appreciate that call centres cannot be staffed with thousands of employees 24-7 and there will always be spikes where a network goes down and so on, but will ComReg be able to set minimum standards?  Will it be able to insist, for example, that disputes must be resolved or brought to the next level within a certain period?  Not every dispute will be resolved satisfactorily, but at least there could be some level of closure whereby there would be a response to say the reason it will not be resolved to the person's satisfaction relates to the fact that, say, the person failed to read the documentation, the contract or whatever the case may be.

Why would the Department bring forward the general scheme of Bill and get it approved by the Cabinet when a Supreme Court case, which appears to be germane to this legislation, had yet to come?  It is an issue I have for this committee.  If we are doing pre-legislative scrutiny, we should be doing it in its totality.  If we are doing pre-legislative scrutiny on a Bill that is fundamentally going to change when it comes to published legislation, it is not pre-legislative scrutiny in the round as far as I am concerned.  I want to lay down that marker.  It is hugely important.  It is part of our role as a committee.  Pre-legislative scrutiny was introduced so that committees would assist in the process of making legislation more robust.  The general scheme of the legislation was approved in December by the Cabinet.  If we are suddenly finding a situation where it is being said that the Zalewski Supreme Court case, which was decided five months earlier on 12 July 2021, may change what is published in the legislation, it is hard to see how we can be in a position to do proper pre-legislative scrutiny.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the legislation, the Department came to us about a waiver scheme because the Department said that the EU was looking for the legislation to be put in place.

The investigatory team will form a preliminary view of whether there has been a regulatory breach or not.  It will either dismiss the case or bring the matter to the commissioners' attention.

That adjudication panel will then consider all the evidence and the recommendations and decide whether a penalty should be imposed.

As a result of that, some fraudsters, many of whom are very well informed about what the technical capabilities are, can come up with those scam calls.

Can we deal with the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC?  Obviously, it became an overnight sensation after the attack on the HSE.  Every expert we spoke to who came before this committee and in other fora stated that they did not believe the NCSC had the resources that were required.  We have seen a reasonable increase in resources, such as money, people and buildings etc.  Does Mr. Stephens believe the NCSC is in the place it needs to be to do the job it has to do, in the context of dealing directly with major infrastructural companies and ensuring they carry out best practice as regards protecting us?<\/p> <p>  My second question is about the risk we are facing.  We believed at the time that the HSE attack was carried out by subcontractors who come from a part of the world that is currently in the news.  We are talking about hacker teams that operate as subcontractors.  They may operate privately but certain states can avail of them when necessary.  It is obviously a huge risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022022300002#N03100","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645574400,"counter":1368,"content":"<p>In terms of the first questions on our capabilities, the Government made a decision in July 2021 to increase the capacity of the NCSC.  It was a five-year plan to increase our numbers by the end of this year to approximately 45 people from our initial base of 25 people.  We launched a number of recruitment competitions, which included a permanent director.  Mr. Richard Browne is now in that position.  We also launched a number of competitions at principal officer level on the technical and the management sides.  This is in addition to a number of senior management positions as well as cybersecurity specialists.  We have a lot of recruitment going on and we are ramping up in terms of capacity.  As for resourcing, we received the funding we requested.  I would say we are in as good a place as we have ever been in terms of our ability to respond.<\/p> <p>  I can speak a bit about the HSE attack, which the Deputy mentioned.  Essentially, how these groups operate is that they have what are known as \"affiliates\".  They are almost like franchisees who will carry out the attack for a larger group, and then the larger group will deploy the malware.  As was said, they can be hired on dark web forums or through direct connections.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised the rising tensions in Europe.<\/p><p>We are currently operating at a heightened state of preparedness.  As a result of the recent incidents the Deputy has mentioned and ongoing tensions in eastern Europe, we have contingency plans in place.
