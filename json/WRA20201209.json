I have met with representatives of the Irish Postmasters Union (IPU) on a number of occasions to discuss the matters raised in the\u00a0 Grant Thornton report which was commissioned by the IPU.<\/p>  <p>  A lot of work has been done over the past few years to develop the network and this has had a positive effect for both postmasters and customers. This momentum needs to be maintained and if An Post, the postmasters and Government work together we can ensure that the network can emerge as a central hub for a wide variety of valuable community-focused services. <\/p>  <p>  Government believes An Post has untapped potential to do more and make a further significant contribution across many areas of public, business and community life in Ireland. \u00a0What we are doing now is working with An Post \u00a0to investigate the scope to channel additional services through the network.\u00a0 As with any business the post office needs to\u00a0develop commercial strategies to enable it to grow and maintain its relevance for its users. All options will be considered fully and efforts will be redoubled to give effect to our commitment to ensuring a sustainable and viable post office network. <\/p>  <p>  In the circumstances, there are no\u00a0proposals to introduce a Government\u00a0funded subsidy for the post office network.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900069#WRB02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Management","counter":38,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900069#WRB03100"},{"type":"question","counter":39,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[42390\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900069#WRB03200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the steps he will take to address the robbery of catalytic converters from hybrid cars using his powers over waste regulation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":40,"content":"<p>Issues concerning the theft and handling of stolen property are matters for\u00a0the Minister for Justice.

It applies to businesses who, under the specific terms of the regulations, are required to prohibit or significantly restrict members of the public from accessing their business premises, with the result that the business is required to temporarily close or to operate at significantly reduced levels. Support provided under CRSS is intended to enable businesses to meet normal fixed costs associated with their business premises such as rent, insurance, utilities and so on, during the period which they are subject to such restrictions.<\/p><p>Domestic travel restrictions or social distancing measures are not the level of restrictions to which the CRSS refers.\u00a0 To be eligible to make a claim under CRSS, the applicable restrictions should require the business to either prohibit, or significantly restrict, customers from accessing the business premises in which the relevant business activity is carried on.\u00a0 <\/p><p>These has been an easing of restrictions on businesses, with a phased move to Level 3 restrictions nationally from 1 December, with some restrictions easing from 4 December and 18 December respectively. From 4 December, bars, cafes and restaurants which serve substantial meals prepared onsite are allowed to open for indoor dining.\u00a0 A substantial meal is defined in the current public health regulations as a meal which might be expected to be served as main meal\/ main course at lunch or dinner and for which it would be reasonable to charge a sum that is not less than &euro;9.\u00a0 The meal must also be substantially prepared on the premises in a &ldquo;food preparation area&rdquo;.\u00a0 A food preparation area is defined as an indoor part of a premises which is structurally adapted and used for the purpose of preparing food for consumption by customers on or off the premises. It does not include a tent, caravan, vehicle, storage container or other temporary structure. <\/p><p>A pub serving substantial meals, which are prepared in a food preparation area located in the pub premises rather than ordered in from another business, was allowed to reopen on 4 December and, from that date, ceased to qualify for CRSS. However, the pub would be eligible to claim an additional week&rsquo;s support under CRSS (referred to as a &lsquo;restart week&rsquo;) to assist it in meeting the costs of reopening. <\/p><p>Any business that can reopen without having to prohibit or significantly restrict access to their business premises, but chooses not to reopen, will not be eligible to claim under CRSS.<\/p><p>Pubs that do not serve substantial meals that are prepared in a food preparation area located in the premises are not allowed to reopen and, therefore, remain eligible to claim under CRSS.\u00a0 <\/p><p>If a pub is prohibited from opening under the current public health regulations because it does not meet the criteria in relation to serving substantial meals then, I understand that it is Revenue&rsquo;s view that the pub continues to qualify for CRSS.\u00a0 This is regardless of whether the particular pub had put in place arrangements with a food supplier to provide meals to customers at the pub in order to open in the past.\u00a0 Under the current regulations, to be allowed to open, a pub must serve substantial meals that are &lsquo;substantially prepared&rsquo; onsite in a food preparation area &ndash; serving meals that have been prepared elsewhere does not qualify.\u00a0 If a particular pub does not meet the criteria to open then it should qualify for CRSS (where the other criteria are met). <\/p><p>On 4 December, I announced an additional seasonal support for businesses who cannot reopen through December.

Each school is required to have a COVID-19 Response Plan for the safe operation through the prevention, early detection and control of COVID-19 in line with public health advice. This guidance is focused on the practical steps schools must take to minimise the risk of transmission of infection.<\/p><p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre and HSE has published guidance in relation to the return to school for at risk groups.\u00a0 The advice confirms that for the vast majority of children, can return to school and it is important for the overall health and wellbeing for children to attend school. This is consistent with public health advice internationally.\u00a0 The guidance is available at the following link.<\/p><p>My Department has published guidance to support schools in making adapted education provision for pupils\/students with an underlying medical condition who cannot return to school because they are medically certified as being at very high risk to COVID-19.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The guidance for primary schools on supporting such pupils is available via the following link:  <\/p><p>The guidance for post-primary schools on supporting such students is available via the following link  <\/p><p>The guidance provides that supports will be provided for these pupils\/students through designated teachers from within the staffing resources of the school. Schools have discretion to manage and redistribute their teaching support resources in order to best meet the learning needs of their pupils\/students, including pupils\/students at &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo; to COVID-19. Facilitating engagement with and among pupils is essential to their learning experience and maintaining their social and emotional development. <\/p><p>Teachers can facilitate this through online interaction, providing feedback on work completed, organising project work that pupils can complete as part of a group and providing learning experiences based on pair work and group work. Early and ongoing two-way communication between the pupil&rsquo;s school, class teacher, designated teacher where relevant, and the home will be essential to supporting the pupils&rsquo; engagement with their learning and their continuous connection with their classmates and school community. <\/p><p>Overall responsibility for ensuring that pupils\/students who are at very high risk to COVID-19 receive appropriate support to engage adequately with learning remains with the school in which they are enrolled. <\/p><p>My Department has also published guidance in respect of the COVID -19 operational supports for Primary and Post Primary schools to fully and safely reopen in a sustainable way while minimising risk associated with COVID-19. This is available at\u00a0www.gov.ie\/backtoschool <\/p><p>The operational supports include funding of approx. &euro;84.7 million so that schools can employ replacement teachers, SNAs and administrative staff. There is additional funding of &euro;41.2 million, for substitution in primary schools. This will provide more certainty on the availability of substitutes for primary schools and cover substitutions that are not covered by existing schemes. The Supply Panel Scheme has been expanded nationwide and over 300 posts have been allocated to provide substitute cover through these panels. The purpose of supply panels is to support schools to manage the sick leave and other absences by having a supply of teachers to meet substitution needs when required. Schools will continue to be able to access substitute teachers through the normal process, particularly if they are not connected to a supply panel.<\/p><p>On 21 August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School.<\/p><p>These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019\/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020\/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures will have affected students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place will play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.\u00a0 <\/p><p>As schools have significant autonomy in determining how to sequence and pace learning for students in their schools, no centrally prescribed adjustment of the curriculum and courses of study would have been effective for students taking the certificate examinations in 2021. Consequently, the most appropriate way to reflect and take account of the challenges for students that have occurred in 2019\/20 and may occur in 2020\/21 was to incorporate adjustments to the certificate examinations in 2021.<\/p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents\/guardians, teachers and schools.<\/p><p>Further clarification on the assessment arrangements for 2021 for certain subjects will issue shortly. <\/p><p>It is my firm intention\u00a0to operate the conventional 2021 state examinations, with appropriate contingency built in, in line with prevailing public health advice. This is shared by the SEC, which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations.<\/p><p>The SEC has valuable learning from the experience of running the 2020 November examinations, notwithstanding that the numbers taking these examinations is significantly lower than the number due to sit examinations in 2021.\u00a0 The measures relating to COVID-19 that have been put in place for the November examinations will be considered as part of the planning for examinations in 2021.<\/p><p>The SEC has commenced its contingency planning for the 2021 examinations, recognising that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to COVID-19. \u00a0It is not intended that there would be any change to the length of the written examinations. Project briefs for relevant subjects have issued earlier than usual and practical coursework will be submitted two weeks earlier than normal as a contingency measure. Teachers are being encouraged to plan and undertake these projects as early as possible in the programme of study.\u00a0 These changes to the Leaving Certificate assessment arrangements for 2021 are deigned to provide reassurance to students, their parents\/guardians, teachers and schools.<\/p><p>In addition, an advisory group of key stakeholders, which advised on altered arrangements for the 2020 state examinations, was reconvened on 25 November in an online meeting to perform a similar role in respect of the 2021 examinations. The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the NCCA and the Department, including the National Educational Psychological Service. Representatives from the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science are also represented on the advisory group to ensure liaison with the third level sector.<\/p><p>Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education and Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.\u00a0 All

post primary schools is a central element of the continuum of education provision in place to support children with special educational needs.\u00a0 This continuum extends from fulltime placement in mainstream classes and special classes through to full time enrolment in special schools with a\u00a0number of options in between. <\/p>  <p>  My Department supports this continuum through a range of dedicated supports in line with the needs of the child.\u00a0 \u00a0These supports include the provision of teachers, special needs assistants and psychological support from the National Psychological Service.\u00a0 In addition, there are specialist supports provided by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE)\u00a0including extensive professional development programmes for principals and teachers and advice for schools, parents and families.<\/p>  <p>  The overall aim of the continuum is to ensure that every child is supported in the journey of realising their potential through education in an inclusive and caring school environment. <\/p>  <p>  I am keenly aware of the huge contribution made by\u00a0all\u00a0Principals, including teaching Principals, in supporting this continuum. <\/p>  <p>  Currently, the allocation of an administrative principal to a school is on the basis of a school's enrolment on the previous 30th September, as set out in Appendix B of the staffing schedule.\u00a0 The enrolment required for the appointment of an administrative principal is currently 176, 143 and 116 in ordinary schools, DEIS Band 2 schools and DEIS Band 1 schools respectively.\u00a0 Where schools are operating 2 or more Autism Special Classes, the required enrolment for the allocation of an administrative principal is reduced to 113 for ordinary and DEIS Band 2 schools and 81 in DEIS Band 1 schools. <\/p>  <p>  There are no plans\u00a0to change these arrangements at this time.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As part of the additional funding to schools this year, &euro;10.2m has been allocated specifically to support Principals and Deputy Principals who undertake teaching duties in primary schools.\u00a0 This funding will provide each teaching principal with a minimum of one release day per week, and release days for Deputy Principals in those schools that have an existing administrative principal for this school year.\u00a0 More than 1,700 primary schools with teaching principals have benefitted from the increase in\u00a0release days.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Teaching Principals in schools with special classes are allocated a further 4 release days, in addition to the 37 allocated to each school with a teaching principal.<\/p>  <p>  There are arrangements in place for schools to cluster their principal release days into a full-time post which will assist teaching principals to more effectively plan their release days for the benefit of the school.\u00a0

school meals programme provides funding towards the provision of food to some 1,557 schools and organisations benefitting 227,000 children.  The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement. <\/p><p>In recent years entry to the school meals programme has been confined to DEIS schools in addition to schools identified by Department of Education and Skills as having levels of concentrated disadvantage that would benefit from access to the programme.  <\/p><p>Prior to the introduction of DEIS in 2005, all schools and organisations that were part of one of a number of Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; initiatives for disadvantaged schools were eligible to participate in the programme, which included Breaking the Cycle, Giving Children an Even Break, the Disadvantaged Area Scheme, Home School Community Liaison and the School Completion Programme.  These schools and organisations have continued to remain in the programme. <\/p><p>Participation in the scheme is entirely voluntary with the onus being on the individual eligible schools to make an application.  Schools and organisations must reapply for funding in advance of each school year and are required to submit detailed records at the end of the school year.  Funding is based on a rate of payment per meal, per child, per day.<\/p><p>The number of schools, primary schools, post-primary schools, special schools and alternative education settings that provide

Tusla, the Child and Family Agency has statutory responsibility under the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 for the care and protection of victims of DSGBV. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am\u00a0pleased that my Department has been able to allocate additional funding of &euro;4.7 million to Tusla\u00a0to support DSGBV services across the country in 2021. A total of &euro;30 million will be made available by DCEDIY to Tusla to fund DSGBV services. This includes a &euro;2.7 million increase in core funding, bringing core service provision to &euro;28 million, with an additional &euro;2 million of one-off contingency funding being made available to help services cope with the ongoing effects of COVID-19. This increase in funding reflects my personal commitment on this issue. I am hopeful that these additional resources will enable services to continue their valuable supports for victims and their families at a very vulnerable time in their lives.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that not all\u00a0funding to this sector issues via my Department. \u00a0The Department of Justice allocates funding to\u00a0combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and support victims of crime, including victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. Many voluntary organisations in the DSGBV sector have also received capital\u00a0funding via the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS), which is administered by local authorities on behalf of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.<\/p>  <p>  While funding will be crucial to our success, it is imperative that we have the right structures in place to respond as effectively as possible to DSGBV. Under the Programme for Government, we have committed to undertaking an audit of responsibility for DSGBV across Departments and State agencies. The procurement process to secure the expertise to conduct this audit is under way, in conjunction with my colleague the Minister for Justice. We expect that the\u00a0audit will be completed early next year, and the Government will act on the basis of that audit.

This included an adaptation framework to assist institutions to continuously adapt to meet the challenges posed by this pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  Though HEIs are planning for a phased and incremental increase in face to face learning on campus for some priority groups in Semester 2, for the remainder of this semester on campus activity is prioritised for essential learning and activities including mandatory skills, practical, mandatory training and assessment.  Further and higher education institutions should continue to deliver the majority of their classes online. Given the scale and diversity within third-level provision, higher and further education institutions will be equipped to determine in which circumstances onsite presence is required.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has been informed by LYIT that nursing students are assessed in accordance with the NMBI approved course schedule and curriculum. This includes facilitation of pre-Christmas examinations for Year 2 and Year 4 student nurses in advance of clinical placement commencing 28 December (for Year 4) and 4 January (for Year 2) respectively. Both these student year cohorts are going on clinical practice placements and starting internships\u00a0(Year 4).\u00a0Each cohort of students will have one examination online and this can be completed remotely, off campus with the remaining two written examinations over two days, to ensure that those travelling will only require one overnight stay. Any students who have any mitigating or extenuating circumstances will be afforded the opportunity to defer without disadvantage or prejudice to Autumn 2021 and to progress on clinical practice placements as planned.\u00a0Special accommodation has been arranged for any student who has requested or indicated any such mitigating or extenuating circumstances.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department has been further informed by LYIT that written examinations were scheduled in line with curriculum module assessments as they could not be scheduled after clinical placements commenced in January 2021. Students will then be in different HSE Clinical settings through Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim. Therefore, it would not be in accordance with best practice or NPHET guidelines to request students to return for assessments once placement commenced.  Furthermore, this cohort of Year 4 student nurses will be paid employees of the HSE as intern nurses from January to August 2021 and unable to attend for examination during their internship.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  LYIT is confident that written assessment can proceed adhering to HSE and NPHET guidelines respecting social distancing and examination regulations and guidelines.

The feedback from prisoners has been very positive as the visit allows people to connect with their families in their homes. The feedback from families has also been positive as it allows families to continue to support prisoners without having to make long journeys to prison to avail of a visit. The\u00a0IPS introduced a support line to provide information to families on how to connect to the video visit and assist with any connection difficulties. <\/p><p>A number of other initiatives include:<\/p><p>- Useful guides and videos, in a number of languages, and these are available on the Prison Service website. <\/p><p>- New methods for the electronic transfer of money making it much easier for families to provide monies to family members for Tuck shops.\u00a0<\/p><p>- Additional phone calls to allow prisoners to keep in contact with loved ones, with\u00a0an additional daily phone call to all those in custody during the Christmas period. <\/p><p>I recognise that physical visits are hugely important to prisoners and their families and I am pleased to advise that the\u00a0IPS has announced that arrangements have been made to allow all those in custody to book a physical family visit between the 16<sup>th<\/sup>December and the 6<sup>th<\/sup>of January. <\/p><p>Each prisoner will be entitled to one physical visit during the period, which will be 15 minutes in duration.

I know that it has significant potential for income generation on farms, for the creation of rural jobs, and for the provision of woodlands for public enjoyment.\u00a0It also has a key role to play in meeting our national climate change and biodiversity objectives.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  My Department receives forestry applications and issues new licences every week.\u00a0There are\u00a0currently\u00a0around\u00a04,700 licences on hand for processing.\u00a0 Some\u00a02,000 licence applications\u00a0require ecology input and, on which, a backlog has developed. The\u00a0remaining 2,700 licence applications\u00a0do not generally experience the same delays as the first group. By way of context on our output, we have issued 2,393 licences this year to date.\u00a0Some 633 of these licences have issued since the introduction of the new Forestry legislation at the beginning of October and I am confident that this positive trend will continue. <\/p>  <p>  Our overall\u00a0approach to tackling this is subject to continuous improvement and review\u00a0\u00a0with the aim of increasing the output of these licences on a weekly basis.\u00a0 Adequate and appropriate resources are key. At the beginning of the year, there were just two\u00a0ecologists working on ecology files\u00a0but this figure is now sixteen.\u00a0Additional forestry inspectors have also been hired to support this work.\u00a0 This\u00a0delivered increased output in October and November compared to other months this year. In relation to felling, the licences issued so far this year represents over 4 million cubic meters of timber. <\/p>  <p>  We also implemented significant changes to the functioning of the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC)\u00a0and acted quickly to propose and implement the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. I have significantly resourced the FAC and four appeals committees are now set up and hearing appeals. This is an increase from one Committee that was previously in existence.\u00a0 Since putting these additional resources in place, the FAC has held 61 hearings and has 42 hearings scheduled for December.\u00a0 This is significantly reforming how the FAC does its business and will result in a more fit-for-purpose, environmentally sensitive and sustainable forestry licensing process which serves all stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  While there is\u00a0still has some considerable way to go,\u00a0I am encouraged by this\u00a0progress and intend to sustain and build on this output of\u00a0licences issued each week.\u00a0To this end, my Department will recruit additional ecologists and support staff in the New Year.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It is a key priority of mine and my Department to ease the pressure on the sector as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900077#WRK05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":576,"qnumday":247,"qnumall":"[42204\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900077#WRK05300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when the planning grant to cover new environmental reports in forestry will come into effect as set out in the Mackinnon report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":577,"content":"<p>The introduction of an environment report supported by a planning grant is one of the 22 '\u00a0Ways Forward'\u00a0included in the Mackinnon Review of the afforestation approval process.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Minister of State Hackett\u00a0has recently appointed Ms.\u00a0 Jo O&rsquo;Hara, who led the implementation of a similar review\u00a0of Scottish forestry,to advise on an Implementation Plan for the Mackinnon report.\u00a0\u00a0We expect her recommendations to be delivered by end-February 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900077#WRK05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme","counter":578,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900077#WRK05500"},{"type":"question","counter":579,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[42322\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020120900077#WRK05600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of an application for the TAMS grant for a bulk tank by a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":580,"content":"<p>The person named submitted an application under the Dairy Equipment Scheme and approval issued dated 4th July 2019.
