The IASLT welcomes this invitation by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health to address concerns about the HSE's standard operating procedures on the assessment of need.  Our colleagues from the PSI and the Association of Occupational Therapists Ireland, AOTI, along with the parent group, DCA Warriors, addressed the committee earlier this year on 27 June.  I thank the members for meeting us today and giving us the opportunity to meet with them.<\/p> <p>  The IASLT is the recognised professional association of speech and language therapists, SLTs, in Ireland.  It provides up-to-date information for the public to aid in the understanding of speech, language and communication needs, as well as that of feeding, eating, drinking and swallowing disorders.  Some of its aims include: establishment and maintenance of professional standards in SLT practice within Ireland; evaluating, accrediting and monitoring of speech and language therapy training courses in Irish universities; representing the profession at national and international level; supporting continuing professional development through education and research; and co-ordinating the gathering and dissemination of relevant information to promote the exchange of professional information.<\/p> <p>  As the committee heard, my name is Vickie Kirkpatrick and I am the chairperson of IASLT.  I am joined by long-standing IASLT full member, Ms Deirdre Kenny.  We are delighted to have this opportunity to speak to the committee about the concerns of our members and the risks the assessment of need, AON, SOP poses to the children and families we support.  Having recently reviewed the transcript and video of our health and social care professional colleagues' presentations in June, the IASLT wishes to echo many of the concerns presented and expand on those specific to SLTs.<\/p> <p>  First and foremost is consultation.  Concern was raised by our members about the absence of formal consultation.  While 8 September 2017 is reported as the date of the HSE consultation on the AON SOP, members have reported that notice of this meeting was poorly communicated.  The short notice meant that front-line clinicians who had pre-arranged appointments and front-line obligations could not attend.  Furthermore, the IASLT never received formal invitation to this meeting, nor has it received a copy of the AON SOP to date.  Information on the AON SOP came to the IASLT's attention via our own members.  <\/p> <p>  The lack of consultation with SLTs is further evidenced by the inadequate definition of communication in the SOP.  SLTs hold expertise in speech, language and communication needs, and absence of a proper definition poses risks to the identification of such needs.  Further consultation could be considered through partnership with the HSE's own health and social care professional, HSCP, office, which co-ordinates many working groups with representation from various health and social care professionals, including SLTs who represent the IASLT.  They work collaboratively with stakeholders to facilitate a unified voice for health and social care professionals.  One of the office's key aims is the co-ordination of HSCP input to design, plan and implement strategy within the HSE.  Collaboration between the HSE disability operations and the HSCP's offices would ensure appropriate governance, terms of reference and operational recommendations are in place.<\/p> <p>  The IASLT welcomes the plan for progressing disability services and recognises the need for standardisation of assessment of need.  Appropriate consultation and collaboration are vital, however, for appropriate and effective change management to ensure the best outcomes for the children and families we support.<\/p><p>The need for resources - those being human, infrastructure and IT - to support the implementation of Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People was widely discussed at the committee's previous meeting.  We welcomed the acknowledgement by Dr. Morgan that disability services have been under-resourced and are hopeful that the 100 posts announced in the recent budget are part of a multi-year programme of investment.  As previously mentioned by our colleagues in the Association of Occupational Therapists of Ireland, AOTI, chapter 9 of A National Model of Care for Paediatric Healthcare Services in Ireland outlines the need for detailed workforce planning for health and social care professionals at primary, secondary and tertiary care level.  The operation of this standing operating procedure is challenged by these resource issues across both social and primary care.<\/p><p> One key challenge to speech and language therapist, SLT, staffing is the length of time it currently takes to replace vacancies.  It can take six to eight months from one staff member walking out the door to a replacement SLT arriving.  Experienced, knowledgeable staff members who avail of promotional opportunities are often replaced with less experienced staff who need more time to upskill in the clinical area and join the new team.  The new clinician may not have been trained up in some of the assessments required to determine the presence of a disability.  The standard operating procedure as outlined cannot work without a properly trained team with the necessary skill mix.<\/p><p> We know from talking to the families we work with that they want the right care for their child in the right place and at the right time.  If children could access the intervention services they need in a timely fashion there would be a reduced number requesting assessments under the Disability Act and the need for this standard operating procedure would be greatly reduced.<\/p><p> Margaret Lennon of DCA Warriors identified the need for Irish data on the numbers of children presenting with disability.  If we are to adequately meet the needs of children and families we need to collect information on prevalence and incidence of disability and its subtypes in Ireland.<\/p><p> As to best practice guidelines, Irish Association of Speech and Language Therapists, IASLT, members are bound by the IASLT code of professional conduct and ethics of 2015.  As practitioners in the Republic of Ireland, speech and language therapists must hold registration with the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, CORU, under the Health and Social Care Professional Act of 2005.  The assessment of need standard operating procedure is in breach of the following sections of the code - to \"act within the best interest of the service user\"; and \"a member shall also appropriately address concerns regarding policies, working conditions, actions or inactions of others which compromise the care of service users or public safety\".  For speech and language therapists, as with other health and social care professionals, assessment is a dynamic and ongoing process whereby clinicians rely on their training and experience to assist parents in setting goals to meet the child and families&rsquo; needs.  The preliminary team assessment as outlined in the standard operating procedure is in many ways a breach of this.  In many instances a complete diagnostic assessment is required to ensure appropriate differential diagnosis.  Differential diagnosis is essential for clinicians to make recommendations regarding appropriate pathways of intervention.  Without complete diagnostic assessments, children and families will be unable to access additional services such as home tuition; autism spectrum disorder, ASD, special classes; or, other specialist placements.  Such recommendations are not possible without comprehensive diagnostic assessment.  The standard operating procedure will result in delays in accessing appropriate interventions as well as accessing the most suitable educational placement, thus placing additional stress on the families.<\/p><p> Finally, the code of professional conduct and ethics further states that \"members should take any time necessary to sensitively communicate their decision\/s with the service user and family members, in the context of the constraints of confidentiality\".  The standard operating procedure is intended &ldquo;to ensure that children and their families access appropriate services as quickly as possible&rdquo;.  However, in its current form, in some areas, it will place additional demands on teams that are already struggling in provision of services.  An audit of assessment of need practices across the country would highlight areas where assessment of needs have been of benefit and the reason for the bottlenecks.  An audit would ensure all children with suspected disabilities access services in a similar manner, as well as highlight the barriers in other areas where assessments of need are either under or over utilised, and establish why this is so?  The absence of an audit results in a &lsquo;one size fits all&rsquo; model without considering local differences.  Furthermore, the limitations of the preliminary team assessment will breach best practice regarding the HSE&rsquo;s own policy on informing families. <\/p><p> We have outlined the main issues for speech and language therapists in relation to disability services, but also want to summarise some recommendations, many of which have already been identified by the HSE.  These include detailed workforce planning; collection of data on incidence and prevalence of disability in Ireland; developing an implementation plan for progressing disabilities services utilising existing structures including the health and social care professional, HSCP, office; and, consultation in relation to proposed changes using the HSE change model.<\/p><p> In conclusion, IASLT recognises the need for standardisation of procedures for the assessment of need process.  However, the increased demand for assessments of need must be evaluated and an appropriate response put in place.  IASLT welcomes formalising structures for appropriate consultation with the HSE, the HSE&rsquo;s disability operations officer, as well as with the Minister for Health to ensure services developed adhere to best practice guidelines for both our clinicians and the children and families they support.<\/p><p> Ms Kenny and I welcome the opportunity now to discuss this further and answer any questions further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Vickie Kirkpatrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Kirkpatrick and I call on members of the committee to make their observations.

It was my idea originally to highlight what are obvious difficulties with the new proposed standard operating procedure.  The original meeting was my idea.  Apologies if our guest speakers were left out on that occasion and I hope that we can all move on together.  It was not intentional.  As highlighted by Ms Kirkpatrick and Ms Kenny this is not just about speech.  People think that speech therapists just deal with speech but as the disabilities spokesperson for Fianna F&aacute;il, I am aware that the witnesses' profession does much work with swallowing, eating and all functions of the throat.  Sometimes the general public are not aware of that which is good to highlight.<\/p> <p>  The assessment of need is a major problem in any event and these new proposals are making a bad situation worse, in my mind.  It is like a yellow pack assessment of need, for want of a better word.  In the opinion of our guest speakers, do they see conflicting requirements from clinicians in general and do they believe that the preliminary team assessment is contrary to the spirit of the Act, especially concerning the 90 minutes that is so short, and in my opinion, very insulting to have such a limited time for assessment?  I am aware that Ms Kirkpatrick and Ms Kenny spoke about meetings on short notice, etc.  Was the whole thing drafted without any concrete consultation with their association?<\/p> <p>  The standard operating procedure proposes that only children who have \"complex and significant needs\" access an assessment of need.  In my opinion, complexity is very subjective.  This will lead to problems and I would like to have the association's views on this point.  Does the association believe this will lead to misdiagnosis and wrong diagnosis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#H00300","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539763200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Murphy O'Mahony.  I will start with the easiest point as to the process.  The document was created without any consultation with us.  Members have reported that it has been a knee-jerk reaction towards trying to manage the large increase recently in those waiting for further assessment of need.<\/p> <p>  On the preliminary team assessment suggestion, having not been around the table when this came into being, the Act deals with the determination of disability, and the steps required to do that.  It is never straightforward.  Often best practice requires a multi-disciplinary approach to do that.  One of the solutions would be the implementation of disability network teams under Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People, if that was implemented.<\/p><p>The objective is for parents to have one point of access.  Over time there have been delays in accessing services.  Our members are seeing parents going an AON route to ensure they can access services rather than going with the provisions of the Disability Act 2005, <i>per se<\/i>.  It is very likely that without an audit people might wait in an AON queue when it was never designed for that purpose, particularly with regard to the level of complexity of the needs of the people in that queue.  It is one aspect of the wait list numbers.<br\/><br\/>The risk of misdiagnosis is widespread with the current form of standard operating procedure.  As I mentioned in my opening address, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and social workers are currently regulated.  Physiotherapists and psychologists will soon be regulated.  This is to protect the public and ensure we do not engage in any practices that might put people at risk.  It is our duty to highlight the risks that this presents.  Even if the time changes, autonomous practice is required to ensure clinicians have the scope to meet the emotional needs of families.  We heard that very much from the DCA Warriors.  It is correct that speech and language therapy is not just about communication or feeding, eating, drinking and swallowing.  A therapeutic relationship is formed with people because of the nature of communication.  Working with younger people this takes longer to develop that trust in the family context.  We need to gather the information in a timely fashion.<br\/><br\/>I would be as bold as to suggest that the issue with the wait list in AONs is not how long it takes us on the other side to do an assessment but rather the volume.  Clinicians work as teams to ensure best practice and that work is the most important aspect of the process.  If we audit and quantify it, this would not be the piece delaying the numbers at the door.  Does that make sense?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Vickie Kirkpatrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#J00200","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539763200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>With regard to the preliminary team assessment, my understanding is that the idea came from services being reconfigured under the progressing disability services programme.

The initial assessment was fairly time-bound and it led straight to interventions.  The difference comes in that most parts of the country have not been reconfigured.  These people are waiting on the AON and are not accessing intervention straight away.  Between getting assessment of need and the time accessing intervention, there could be a gap of one, two or even three or four years in places.  In doing a short summary assessment at the start, one cannot give the family something to go away with for the next four years.  If there were reconfigured teams behind this, they could meet the families and set them on an intervention pathway very quickly.

It falls at the first hurdle under the definition.  I thank the witnesses for coming in.  When we discussed this previously, one of the matters raised concerned the inconsistencies throughout the country.  My question is simple and concerns models of best practice.  Do we have individual models of best practice?  Where we have models of best practice and where they are working, is that just associated with resources?  One often hears the process is working in a certain area and the work in that area should be modelled; this implies that everybody else is not working hard or smartly enough.  Generally, when we drill down, we find the areas where a new scheme, idea or policy works generally have an association with resources.  I am interested to know if that is the way the witnesses see it.  Does this explain the geographical inconsistencies?<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the recent budgetary announcement and the possibility of recruiting additional personnel.  I assume the same difficulties regarding recruitment and retention exist in speech and language therapy as in other areas.  Will the witnesses comment on that briefly, although I acknowledge it is not the specific issue before us?  In the context of a multi-annual programme, I share the optimism of the witnesses but it is all it is.  What was announced was just a one-off number and there was no hint there would be any multi-annual funding associated with it.  Will they comment on that?  The introduction of a new or rearranged SOP will not change anything unless there are resources and staff but I am interested in their comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#J00700","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539763200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I will address the matter of numbers and models and Ms Kenny might speak to recruitment.  With respect to best practice models, from the numbers given to us by the disability operations office in June that were shared with the committee, it is not hard science.  Those with the lower numbers are in places that have reconfigured.  One of the barriers for clinicians on the front line, or even most important for families, is the one point of access.  We echo Dr. Morgan's point that it is not only about human resources for those posts; it is also about restructuring and models of best practice.  We had that model with its publication in 2005 through to 2009.  The greatest challenge is that a change of that magnitude requires front-end investment and project management, as well as lead-out.  It cannot be done in a vacuum.  It is a big restructuring process.  My suspicion is the places where there has been change are smaller and it has not been as cumbersome to restructure them.  This is all the more reason for proper project management and investment to manage the change required.<\/p> <p>  We heard figures in the previous session about investing now because of what the cost would be later.  It is again about ensuring that a workforce is in place.  The workforce in health and social care has increased exponentially over the past 15 years with Irish clinicians training at top universities.  The programmes are recognised.  The IASLT enjoys mutual recognition with the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia.  Our graduates are recognised and, therefore, we have the power to produce highly qualified professionals.  It is about the structures in place and not necessarily about a targeted number of posts.  It is important that there be a structure to facilitate one point of access for families.  The tiered model moves into a social model of care rather than an impairment model.  The other struggle is even in terms of legislation.  The Disability Act 2005 was a great advance for people with disability in Ireland but as legislation it needs to continue to grow and modernise.  It is an impairment-based model in terms of what people can and cannot do, which is difficult when a person is three years old.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Vickie Kirkpatrick"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539763200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>It was a good question about recruitment and retention.  The last time there was workforce planning, it followed the Bacon report of 2001.  There have been recommendations from the HSCP to look at workforce planning nationally.<\/p><p>We are working on old information.<\/p><p> The reason clinicians generally leave is because they might be looking for promotional opportunities or they want to move around the country.  Their initial placement might be somewhere they do not ultimately want to live.  There is anecdotal evidence that the urban centres might be suffering because it is so difficult for people to afford live in Dublin.<\/p><p> The second half is around replacing those who leave posts.  There might be a post that becomes available and there is interest in that post, but the length of time recruitment is taking is an issue.  There is a national recruitment service, the Health Business Services, HBS.  There are panels in place and when one person walks out the door, one must submit the paperwork locally.  It has to go through local pay bill.  That can take however long, depending on where budgets are at the local area, before it ever goes to national recruitment.  When a person walks out the door, one has a whole-time equivalent post but it may take six to eight months for somebody else to arrive in to that post.  Not only is nobody being seen in that length of time in that particular setting but when the new person comes in, he or she needs to be inducted.  It might take longer to upskill.  I refer to all that extra time on top of the length of time the post has been vacant.<\/p><p> The speech and language therapy is in primary care and social care.  Where a child at 12 months is not talking, the public health nurse may say that he or she will refer the child to a speech and language therapist in primary care.  When the child comes to that speech and language therapist, she may recognise that it is a much more complex disorder - potentially autism spectrum disorder - and then look to refer on to a disability team.  Depending on waiting lists, the child may have waited 12 months to see an SLT in primary care and then have to wait another 12 months or longer after he or she is assessed.<\/p><p> In terms of the work practice, as speech and language therapy, nationally, in primary care, we have looked at a review of how we can deliver services better.  There is a report sitting in the HSE that has yet to be published which looks at how we can improve the way we work in primary care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#J00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Kenny","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses from the Irish Association of Speech and Language Therapists.  I have a long association with the disability Bill - one withdrawn, there was a second one and then, finally, it passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas in June 2005.  That was a time of great hope and expectation, that has been badly dented in a number of ways.  Emotionally and otherwise, that is where I am coming from in this discussion.  The focus on starting with the children and moving along was a practical one in the Act and made sense.<\/p> <p>  I will respond to some of the points the witnesses made.  Ms Kirkpatrick referenced Dr. Cathal Morgan stating here in June last that disability services were under-resourced and hoped that the 100 new posts in the budget which we are all delighted with would be part of a multi-annual provision.  Ms Kirkpatrick is at least hinting that there is more needed to do this work.<\/p> <p>  Then there was talk about replacement and churning of staff, with experienced staff moving on and less experienced staff coming in.  Ms Kenny mentioned it takes six to eight months from when somebody goes out the door to get his or her replacement.  My question is twofold.  The first is a difficult one to be scientific about the answer.  In terms of the need for professionals and therapists to deal with this issue, is the bottle half full or half empty?  I accept there are many other issues as well.  It is important to get some sense of what step change the witnesses feel needs to be made.  Second, is allowance made for the effect on teams, including various allied health professionals and clinicians, of somebody stating, \"I am out of here.  I am moving on.  I am going somewhere else.\" or has everyone their fingers crossed every day hoping that their staff will stay there forever?<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the risk of misdiagnosis being prevalent.  I do not know what is meant by \"misdiagnosis\".  What I mean by that is often it is about getting from symptoms to a cause.  Somebody presents with a symptom or symptoms.  Ms Kenny talked about someone being referred to her by the public health nurse and Ms Kenny stating there are possibly other things going on here and she cannot deal with it.  It is easy to talk about the person having a condition.  In many cases, the person might have symptoms on foot of which he or she needs interventions but that is very different from knowing what are the root cause or causes.  What is the impact?  How is that dealt with?  When we talk about early intervention, there is this idea that it is a matter of whether one can get in to see the speech and language therapist, then it takes time to go and be seen again, and the children have gone through two or three pairs of shoes in the meantime.  How does the operation of the Act deal with the greater complexity in getting from symptom or symptoms to a diagnosis?  I suppose what I am getting at is often one needs to intervene before one has the final diagnosis.  Is that an impediment or how do they work around that?<\/p> <p>  The final little cluster of questions I have relates to what the witnesses stated on a number of occasions about restructuring.  I want to use the words \"culture\", \"approach\" or \"attitude\" in the same discussion.  Are there different areas in the HSE where maybe the same resource gets worked better?  Clearly, I started off with issues about resourcing but I suppose I am suggesting that is not everything.  It is about how one harvests and uses the resources.  Are there places that are better able to get product from those resources, by which I mean better support the children and their families?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#K00200","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539763200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I will start with the resources and how that links in to where things are working.

There are staff one might be looking at who one knows will be going when the right opportunity arises.

Depending on how services are set up, that child may get some intervention at primary care level while he or she is on another waiting list.

We can manage those symptoms to a certain level and give the child's family some ideas and strategies.  However the long-term management of the needs of that child and family needs to be done in a specialist centre where a team works together, as opposed to one clinician offering the family some supports.

It is a dynamic process, working with people around their communication and language development, especially around their social and communication skills.

A cohort of experts analogous to a cancer expert, as Ms Kenny put it, does exist, but the wait times for their services are long.<\/p> <p>  The Disability Act 2005 created a mechanism to capture the need that was not there previously, the legal right to an AON.  However, my understanding is that it was designed for complex disability, with the non-complex cases to be managed within primary care.  Our models for intervention have evolved, developing a social strength-based aspect.  We are always working towards people's strengths and their ability to achieve, not their impairments or their disability.

I have a couple of questions.  The witnesses made reference to collating data but collecting data is equally important.  To what extent have they been in a position to collect as much data as possible, as quickly as possible?  The collation comes after that, but the collection is obviously the first part of it.<\/p> <p>  Has the IASLT had competition from overseas for the skills set within the sector?  Most other sectors have had challenges from overseas and difficulty in retaining staff.  I would like the witnesses to comment on that. <\/p> <p>  Waiting times seem to be a problem everywhere.  Is this entirely due to a shortage of staff?  Are there other issues?  Is it a shortage of staff plus appropriate skills, or a combination of all of those?  <\/p> <p>  I had occasion in the past to visit other countries where different treatments are available.  In the old days, oddly enough, Hungary developed a particular set of skills and treatments that seemed to be better or had more effect than what was available in this country.  In some cases they had a dramatic effect.  I would like a comment on that.<\/p> <p>  I have recently been dealing with the case of a child with ASD who has been receiving home tuition, having previously been in a special class.  When moved to home tuition, the child improved dramatically.  The child's condition worsened in the special class, apparently because of having to compete with the surroundings.  There had not been the same level of individual attention one would expect from home tuition.  I would like the witnesses to comment on that.<\/p> <p>  Reference has been made to a report that is on the shelves of the HSE.  How long has it been there?  When is it likely to be published?

In regard to collating data and drilling down into it, IASLT is not privy to its own specific data.  The recommendation is to form a clear understanding of where the health and social care professionals are currently situated in the HSE and in the sections 38 and 39 organisations.  It is desirable to map that to ensure disability teams are set up on the basis of best model practices.  As we mentioned, the national model of care for paediatric healthcare services in Ireland recommends a ratio of 1.5 speech therapists per 100 children with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  As I said in reply to Deputy O'Reilly earlier, the need for project management to implement that change must be examined.  It is important to set up systems that can measure our effectiveness and link with Irish universities to deliver training and programmes that are evidence-based and play to people's strengths.  That is what we need to allow people to live life to the full based on their ability in the spirit of the UNCRPD.<\/p><p> In terms of challenges for overseas, during the crash a number of Irish clinicians emigrated, particularly to the UK, Australia and New Zealand.  We were privy to that as they wrote to us seeking letters proving their membership of their professional body.  While I do not have figures with me, I believe the numbers emigrating have decreased considerably in the past two or three years and Irish graduates are finding employment within Ireland.  <\/p><p> In terms of the personal example the Deputy gave of a little boy with autism moving from a special class in a school to home tuition, there could be many reasons for that.  Again, without assessment or making choices or a long-term plan for what that child needs both at home and in school, it is difficult to say why the family felt that was particularly successful.  Certainly, in my clinical experience, I have found that setting up structures is extremely important.  This means setting up a team, drawing up an education plan and a home plan to ensure the steps are in place to support the child at home, at school, in the community, at the swimming pool and at the airport.  Again, I am giving an answer in the broader sense and I apologise for being unable to answer the question specifically.<\/p><p> On ways of working and the shortage of staff, I ask Ms Kenny to address our current numbers in workforce planning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#L01500","nonspeaker":"Ms Vickie Kirkpatrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539763200,"counter":41,"content":"<p>On the question of staff shortages versus skills shortages, it is probably a little bit of both.  In addition to the time needed to recruit, we also have a number of staff on maternity leave, parental leave and sick leave.  In many cases, these staff are not covered or may only be covered for a short period.  When covered is provided, it is done by agency staff who would not be familiar with the area, the team or the children.  While this cover is of some benefit, these staff need significant upskilling.  When the team gets new permanent staff we upskill them as quickly as possible.  Most areas have induction and supervision processes in place to provide this for new staff.  In some areas the ratio of senior staff to staff grade employees across the health and social care professional, HSCP, structure is such the number of senior staff available to support these processes is limited.  Senior staff generally have more experience and clinical skills whereas someone at staff grade could be a new graduate therapist.  We have a supervision structure between senior staff and staff grade therapists across most of the HSCP structure.<\/p> <p>  The report I was referencing is a primary care speech and language therapy review.  I understand it was completed in June 2017.  Again, the IASLT was not involved in it.  The HSE requested speech and language therapists in its organisation to examine this so we do not know what is in the report either.  We know that the people who were involved in writing the report also want it to be published in order that we can look at it as a profession and see how we can make changes.  That is at the level of primary care, which will obviously influence children who are accessing disability services.

By the time I have met parents in my day job, they have navigated a daunting labyrinth.  As a clinician, I then have to peel away all those walls to work with them because they are so hardened by the journey to get that far.  It should not be that hard.<\/p> <p>  The second most important issue is the focus the Disability Act places on developing people's strengths and playing to their ability.  As clinicians, there is a culture there - somebody used the word \"culture\" earlier - but it needs to be celebrated and watered, so to speak.

In some areas a child will be seen for assessment within four months.  In the majority of areas, the aim is to see children within 52 weeks.  It takes longer than that in a small percentage of areas.  In one area, people will wait three or four months, while in another area people will wait for a year.  After that assessment, if a child requires therapy it again depends on geography.  In one area, the intervention may take place within six weeks of the assessment, while the waiting time may differ in another area.  The health statistics show that more than 90% of children are seen for their first therapy session within 52 weeks but approximately 10% of referrals are waiting longer than that, including some who are waiting for up to two years.  Again, that intervention depends on where one lives.<\/p> <p>  The way speech and language therapists often work with families on these types of difficulties means that it is not a matter of a one-off intervention.  It is not the case that a child comes once, we give the answer, and we never have to see the child again.  Some of these children are coming for long periods of time.  The way the system and the waiting list operate means that, in those areas where resources are stretched, a child might wait 12 months for assessment, a further 12 months for therapy and then he or she might only get six or eight sessions.  The child then goes back on the waiting list for another year.  It is very much based on geography.  In some areas, a child will be seen very quickly, whereas a child living elsewhere may wait much longer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#M00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Geographically, which areas are doing well and which are doing poorly?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#M01000","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539763200,"counter":47,"content":"<p>From the most recent statistics, I understand community healthcare organisation, CHO, area 6 is doing well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#M01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":48,"content":"<p>Could Ms Kenny say that again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#M01200","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539763200,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I do not have the figures with me but I know that CHO area 6 is one that is doing well.

It is not that it is difficult to hire staff.  Posts can be filled when they become vacant but part of the problem is the length of time that takes.

In areas where there are very established staff who are not going anywhere, one tends to have more maternity leave, parental leave and sick leave.

We know that the more clinicians one recruits, the more children will come to the door.  The easier it is to access services, the more people will start recognising that they are having difficulties.  There is a proposed model in this report to change the way we work to meet the needs of more children.  A recent schools project initiative created some extra posts for speech and language therapists and occupational therapists to determine if working in schools is more effective.  In some of the very disadvantaged areas of Dublin, for example, greater numbers of children are presenting with communication difficulties compared with their peers in other areas because they have not had the same opportunities.  The project is looking at whether therapists working in schools and training up teachers and parents will improve outcomes and is also looking at how that will fit with primary care services.  We recognise that we could do more at a universal and targeted level and this project is looking at whether changing the way we work will be beneficial.

In terms of disability services waiting lists, there are 1,700 people waiting for assessments of need in Cork and Kerry but there was a reluctance to hire people because the proposed restructuring of the health service meant that the HSE did not know where they would be located.

Fianna F&aacute;il wants a public healthcare system that can deal with this.  However, as with inpatient and outpatient services, the waiting list numbers are going up and up.  One of the short-term measures that is working is the NTPF.  Anecdotally, I am hearing that a fair number of our nurses working in the public system are moving over to the private system because the working conditions are better.  Staff are treated well and staffing ratios are much better.  They may not be getting more money but the working environment is much better and does not have the highly objectionable stresses and strains that are a feature of the public system.<\/p><p>Is it the case that we have enough speech and language therapists in the country to serve the population and that we are seeing a migration of them everywhere or in some places from public health posts to operating in private practice?

Telling people they have a disability without the dynamic assessment we spoke about earlier and without planning for intervention means they will just sit somewhere else, so to speak, and then we will run the risk of privatisation of interventions.  The way it might differ from the medical model is that someone going for hip or heart surgery will get better but people with a disability may have a lifelong condition and they might need to dip in and out.  A system that, from the get-go, can give people strategies because the structure contains a one-point access would be simpler.<\/p> <p>  A Band-Aid solution would be very short-sighted in terms of supporting families for an assessment.

I apologise for missing some of the meeting.  I was in the Seanad dealing with the availability of therapeutic services for children with autism in a school.  The Minister for Health had come to the House to deal with the queries I had on the matter.  One of the responses he gave me was that a review is being carried out that is supposed to be delivered in the second quarter of 2019.  Is the IASLT involved in looking at each area?  They witnesses may have dealt with this question, and if so, that is fine.  I will go back over the transcript.  I imagine that in each HSE area the ratio of speech and language therapists per head of population is the same.  Has the southern region been looked at in this regard?  Are the numbers far lower in real terms compared with other areas?  The Minister has announced that more than 100 speech and language therapists are to be employed.  We need to prioritise where they should go.  Has the IASLT been involved in any discussions on this issue?<\/p> <p>  A major concern I have with the HSE is that it has taken on an additional 12,000 people since December 2014, which is greater than the entire workforce of the Irish Army.  I wonder about value for money.  For argument's sake, we may have an area with a higher ratio of speech and language therapists than other areas but a longer waiting list.  Has any examination of this been done with regard to whether there is a particular way the service is being organised that leads to the delays being caused?  I came across an issue in dermatology where one particular area had many more specialists than other areas but the number of cases they were dealing with was less than 50% of what was being dealt with in another area that had fewer specialists.<\/p><p>That is one issue that needs to be examined.  If we employ additional speech and language therapists, what level of backup facility and ancillary staff supports would need to be put in place?  It is like appointing a medical consultant to a hospital but not providing additional beds, nurses or accommodation to carry out a clinic to ensure he or she can do his or her job.  Has this been examined when dealing with the HSE or the Department?  One can have a therapist appointed but there might not be facilities to carry out the work and or the support staff to arrange simple things like appointments.

The hospital board has a mission, which is to provide paediatric health care to children across the State.  It is a mystery to me why the hospital would need to become a member of a company.  It seems that it would be operating nearly as a separate entity and this is why I call it into question.  I would like the Minister to explain it for me. <\/p><p>We understand the need for the provision for borrowing, but it does seem that this section appears to create nearly a separate entity that would be at arm's length and therefore we have concerns about this section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018101700003#B01600","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1539774000,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  The new body will have to have an arrangement with multiple universities, academic institutions and research entities due to its national remit in the education of health care professionals in paediatrics and engagement in paediatric research.  The formal arrangements between the universities and the new body will require some corporate identity to be decided.  While this is not yet clear, it is considered prudent to allow the new body to become a member of a company subject, of course, as members can see, to the consent of the Minister.  The provision also keeps options open for the type of structure that may be required for a body to carry out philanthropy for Children's Health Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Under amendment No. 4, the provision allowing the new body to borrow for current as well as capital purposes is considered useful but as members can see from the Bill it is strictly controlled.  The ability of service providers to respond to strategic investment opportunities in the public interest within legal control limits must be seen to be a progressive step in managing hospital facilities into the future.  I understand there may be a concern that the retention of this provision will allow this and other Governments to under-fund the hospital and exploit the provision by instructing the new body to borrow money for the purposes of providing health care services.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The new body will be funded by the State as a section 38 agency as the three children's hospitals currently are through a service level agreement reached with the HSE.  The primary driver for a service provider to borrow is to drive better value in services provided to patient in a cost effective and timely manner.  This provision allows the board to respond to strategic opportunities or needs as they arise.  Borrowing for current purposes could be considered in scenarios where the hospital cannot generate sufficient internal funding resources in the short term to develop a service but is able to demonstrate longer-term viability and an ability to repay.  The ability to borrow within controls creates this opportunity.  Circumstances in which the new children's hospital would make a case to borrow money or engage in activities that have an element of borrowing could also arise in regard to leasing or licensing of commercial areas or leasing of equipment.  This could also encompass investment in a strategic service initiative or expanding operational capacity in a service that has hospital income generating potential such as attracting international patients to avail of cutting edge high technology services or the specialist paediatric expertise and experience that will available in the new hospital.  There is also the need to consider possible scenarios whereby the new body could require the potential to borrow to invest in extending existing services further in order to generate hospital income by providing cross-jurisdictional services for example for children from Northern Ireland as part of an accountability framework.  Such scenarios would be subject to approval of a business case, demonstrating return on investment with the potential to repay borrowings and generate hospital income.  The Bill allows for proper and fully accountable governance and management within the framework of national policy.  It is acknowledged that since the new body will be largely funded by the State, its borrowing would form part of the overall public debt of the State, as assessed by the EU and other bodies and the State must exercise control before such liabilities are undertaken.  The Bill therefore includes a provision for borrowing subject to the approval of the HSE, Minister and approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Finance.  It is therefore considered appropriate to provide for the potential to borrow in the Bill.  Accordingly I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 3 and 4. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018101700003#B01700","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1539774000,"counter":114,"content":"<p>The Minister refers to the current children's hospitals and the fact that they operate as section 38 agencies.

It relates to the appointment process of board members to the board of Children's Health Ireland.  As provided for in the Bill, all members will be appointed by the Minister.<\/p><p>Section 13 refers to membership of the board on establishment day - the first board.  The Bill has been drafted so that the existing Children's Hospital Group board, a non-statutory administrative board first established in 2013, will become the first board of Children's Health Ireland.  This board comprises persons who were either appointed or reappointed in summer 2017.  This is a competency-based board and includes some members of the boards of the three children's hospitals, a member from Northern Ireland and a member with international expertise.  The board is currently overseeing the complex integration of the three hospitals and transition of existing services into one single body.  Retaining that membership will allow the board to maintain continuity, and ensures that the first board will have the required competencies to undertake the leadership role required over the next few years.  <\/p><p>It is possible that the proposed amendment is intended to ensure that all boards, and not solely the first board, are appointed under the mechanism outlined therein. <\/p><p>The Bill provides that all board members be appointed by the Minister for Health and, in the interests of securing the necessary skills and experience on the board, board members will be appointed on the basis of competencies, experience or expertise deemed relevant to the body's functions.  While all are to be appointed by the Minister, the Bill provides that the board of the new entity will nominate eight out of the 12 board members.  In drafting this legislation, we have been conscious of the need to achieve the integration of the three hospitals in a way that respects the values and cultures of each.  One such example is the arrangements for appointing board members.  Accordingly, the Bill provides for a role for the board in the appointment of board members, as is currently the case in the children's hospitals.  <\/p><p>The integration of the three children's hospitals into one new entity is a major change programme, with significant cultural and operational factors.  The three children's hospitals coming together have been at the forefront of paediatric healthcare.  Each has demonstrated enormous commitment to, and has established a strong track record and a proud tradition in the provision of, healthcare services to children and young people in Ireland.  The three hospitals are key stakeholders in this project, and their agreement and support are fundamental to a successful transition. <\/p><p>Looking at the meaning behind the amendments, I am at one with the Deputy that it is important that the board would be cognisant in its work of the needs of its staff and its patients.  The Bill provides for the body to be given broadly-worded functions in such a way that provides clarity, authority and certainty in its key roles.  One such role is the nurturing and development of staff.  Section 6(2)(<i>d<\/i>) requires the new body to &quot;facilitate, foster and promote, through education and other programmes, the personal and professional development of its employees...&quot;.  <\/p><p>The new children's hospital is the largest and most complex healthcare project undertaken in Ireland to date.  It is recognised that staff may be unsettled by changes to operating and service models and the location of their work and staff well-being is a key consideration during the transition phase and beyond.  In parallel with the capital project, the Children's Hospital Group has a comprehensive integration programme under way supporting staff in the transition and integration of the three existing hospitals.  Work includes to develop and deliver the employee engagement strategy and plan, define a list of representative bodies that will need to be engaged with or consulted and define and document the strategy and plan for this process and develop and deliver the change and people management strategy <\/p><p>Section 6 relates to object and functions of the new body.  Its functions include that it will provide for patient safety and quality of patient care and &quot;promote excellence in the practice and provision of paediatric services&quot;.  The new body is also required to &quot;advocate on behalf of children and young people about healthcare issues&quot;.  It is clear from this that the focus of the new body is on the care of its patients, ensuring that the clinical operation of the hospital is driven by the objective of improving, promoting and protecting the well-being of children.  This will be a function of the entire board and not the remit of one particular board member. <\/p><p>Regarding the appointment of a Dublin city councillor, as Children's Health Ireland is the single national tertiary hospital for the country and a specialist service provider for children from all over Ireland, it would not be appropriate for local councillors to be represented on the board. <\/p> <p> There are other ways to ensure that local representatives can contribute.  As Deputies may be aware, in 2016, the new children's hospital project monitoring committee was formed as a communications channel between the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and local residents and representatives on the construction of the new children's hospital.  Members of the committee include representatives from Dublin City Council, the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, councillors and nominated local residents.  The objective of the committee is to develop a process for communication and dialogue to address residents' concerns and issues during the construction phase.

Children's Health Ireland, CHI, will be preparing financial statements that follow the standard rules and will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Section 9 of FRS 102, which is the financial reporting standard, deals with the requirement to prepare consolidated financial statements.  Under that section, the new body will be required to present a financial statement for itself and any of its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.  This means that the CEO is already required to give evidence on the economy and efficiency of a subsidiary of the new body in the use of its resources and the systems, procedures and practices employed by a subsidiary of the new body for the purpose of evaluating the effectiveness of its operations.
