We have received apologies from Senator Neale Richmond.  We had the arrangement in place today to engage directly with the Irish MEPs in Brussels but unfortunately modern technology has let us down.  We were going to use the video link which is supposed to be state of the art but it is not.  I thank the technicians who tried to get us connected but unfortunately it did not work.  Many years ago we were able to send somebody to the moon but today we were unable to speak to the MEPs via video link.  I remind members to ensure that their mobile phones are switched off.  We wanted to engage with the MEPs today as it would have been important to have direct contact with them at this point in time but unfortunately it was not to be.<\/p><p>We have an engagement today with the European Court of Auditors about the annual report on the European Union's use of public funds.  I am delighted to welcome Mr. Tony Murphy and his colleagues to the joint committee today.  Mr. Murphy is the Irish master of the European Court of Auditors and this is his first time before this committee in his new role.  Last year he accompanied the former member, having been nominated and I am pleased to see that his nomination was positively viewed by the European Parliament and I appreciate his commitment to continue this annual engagement.  Mr. Murphy comes to this role with a lifetime of dedication to audit work, first in the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General here in Dublin, then in the European Commission and more recently in the European Court of Auditors.  The European Court of Auditors plays a vital role and important function in assessing the spending of public money by the European Union, whether the money is being spent correctly and the effectiveness of the EU's financial contributions to initiatives.  The court provides an interesting perspective on how the EU is doing financially.  This engagement will be useful for members of the Oireachtas and it also would have been useful for the MEPs.  Before I ask Mr. Murphy to make his opening statement I will remind members of the rules on privilege.<\/p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p><p>I ask Mr. Murphy to go ahead and make his opening statement.  We will then come to the members for questions.  I welcome everybody in the Public Gallery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018101700002#B00100","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539781200,"counter":6,"content":"<p>Good afternoon.  I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for this invitation.  It is a real pleasure for me to be here today for the first time in my capacity as the Irish member of the European Court of Auditors to present its annual report for 2017.  I echo the Chairman's sentiments that it is a shame that we could not engage with our colleagues in the European Parliament which I will do on another occasion.  Indeed, I thank the committee members for their best wishes conveyed to me when I was last here in January during the final stages of the nomination process.<\/p> <p>  Before I start with the presentation of the main findings of the annual report, I would like to introduce my two colleagues who are here with me today.   Wolfgang Stolz is the head of my private office and Peter Borsos is my assistant and he is in the Public Gallery.  I would also like to inform the committee that I have been assigned to chamber 2 in the court of auditors.  Chamber 2 is responsible for investment for cohesion, growth and inclusion.  We keep a very close eye on what happens in chamber 1 which is the sustainable use of natural resources and that concerns where most of the EU funding to Ireland comes, mainly in agriculture.  My portfolio covers Chapter 6 of this annual report which we are discussing today and it covers the annual statement of assurance on cohesion policy which, along with natural resources, is one of the major EU policy areas.  However, in terms of spending it is not the most significant for Ireland, representing only about 3% of Ireland&rsquo;s total EU expenditure in 2017 which was about &euro;51 million.  In addition, I will have responsibility for some special reports in the near future including one on child poverty.<\/p> <p>  As members may know, the European Court of Auditors is the independent external auditor of the European Union.  We produce a broadening range of products including the annual report, which we will discuss in detail today and also special reports, which we will discuss to a lesser degree.  We also give opinions on legislative proposals, specific annual reports on agencies and joint undertakings, landscape reviews and rapid case reviews.  That is an overview of the type of outputs that we produce on an ongoing basis.<\/p> <p>  The annual report is the main output for the year and our main product.  It uses around half of the court's annual human resources.  It reflects the outcome of audit visits to member states and the Commission.  I am very happy to be here presenting it just two weeks after its publication on 4 October.  The aim of our work is to provide an opinion on two questions: whether the accounts are accurate and reliable and to what extent there is evidence of money being received or paid out in error, known as regularity and legality.  We have given a clean opinion on the EU&rsquo;s accounts since 2007 and in our 2017 annual report, we also conclude that the EU accounts present a true and fair view of the EU&rsquo;s financial position.  Revenue for the EU budget in 2017 totalled &euro;139.7 billion and had an estimated level of error of 0% so it is not a problematic area in any shape or form.  This revenue was raised based on gross national income, GNI, of 56%, VAT of 12%, traditional own resources of 15% and 17% from other sources.  That is the breakdown of total income contributions to the EU budget.<\/p> <p>  In terms of spending for 2017, expenditure totalled &euro;137.4 billion euro, which represents roughly &euro;270 for each EU citizen and is equivalent to 2% of total Government spending and 0.9% of EU gross national income.<\/p><p>Members can see that the audited population totalled &euro;100.2 billion.  Of that sum, &euro;56.5 billion, or over 50%, concerned natural resources of which Irish farmers and beneficiaries received over &euro;1.5 billion from the EU.  Competitiveness accounted for &euro;14.9 billion and cohesion only &euro;8 billion.  That was abnormally low due to the low level of accepted expenditure in 2017.  Many member states did not submit any expenditure in respect of cohesion.  <br\/><br\/>Until last year, our opinion on the regularity and legality of spending had been adverse, meaning we found widespread problems for every year since 1994.  Now, for the second year in a row, we issue a qualified opinion on the regularity of the transactions, meaning a significant part of the 2017 expenditure we audited was not materially affected by error.  Moreover, the level of irregularities in EU spending continues to decrease.  The estimated level of error in payments during 2017 was 2.4%, down from 3.1% in 2016 and 3.8% in 2015.  It could even have been lower because sufficient information was available to prevent &ndash; or detect and correct &ndash; a significant proportion of errors in, for example, rural development payments.  If this information had been used by national authorities to correct errors, the estimated level of error would have been below the so called 2% materiality threshold for an even larger share of the EU budget.<br\/><br\/>Problems remain, and that is mainly where payments from the EU budget are made to beneficiaries based on their declarations of costs previously incurred, such as in rural development and cohesion.  Other activities funded in this way are research, training schemes and development aid projects.  In respect to Ireland, no real problems were detected for this period in transactions tested.  There are, however, still a number of horizontal issues in the report which have implications for Ireland.  Some of these may increase in importance given, among other aspects, the ongoing multiannual financial framework, MFF, negotiations for post-2020 and Brexit.  In 2017, Ireland received roughly &euro;1.81 billion worth of EU funds and at the same time contributed around &euro;2 billion to the EU budget.  That makes Ireland a net contributor of &euro;244 million, which is 0.07% of Ireland&rsquo;s gross national income, GNI.  We are just about moving into the territory of being a net contributor.  I stress this is an accounting balance exercise and obviously does not take into account the numerous benefits associated with EU membership.<br\/><br\/>Absorption is another important issue.  By the end of 2017, the overall average absorption rate for the 2014-2020 MFF was only 16%, which was even lower than in the corresponding year of the previous MFF in 2010 where it was 22%.  The good news is that Ireland is performing above average in absorbing European Structural and Investment, ESI, funds with 30% of cumulative payments of the planned ESI fund spent by the end of 2017.  Ireland is third highest in absorption in the EU after Finland and Austria.  Nonetheless, the absorption rate in Ireland in 2017 is still six percentage points lower than it was at the same time in 2010 in the previous MFF.  The EU budget continues to face significant pressure owing to the value of payments committed for future years, the so-called<b><\/b><i>reste &agrave; liquider<\/i>, RAL. <br\/><br\/>The overall financial exposure of the EU budget has also grown, with significant long-term liabilities, guarantees and legal obligations.  I refer to the almost full use of the amount available for commitments, combined with the low level of payments and increased outstanding budgetary commitments to a new record of &euro;267.3 billion.  That is over twice the annual budget of the EU.  In respect of Ireland, we are performing relatively well compared to other member states.  We had outstanding commitments of &euro;926 million at the end of 2017 and during 2017 we had payments of &euro;297 million.  Our outstanding commitments represent 1.2% of Government expenditure.  It is not such a significant issue for Ireland when we compare that to some of the other member states where outstanding commitments represent over 20% of Government expenditure.  <br\/><br\/>From our testing of 703 transactions, we found 13 instances of suspected fraud, which the court reported to the EU anti-fraud office, OLAF.  These were the main findings of our annual report.  Another useful output we provide are special reports.  These relate to topics across all policy areas.  They do not concern legality and regularity but are related to performance audits and look at aspects of economy, efficiency and effectiveness of policy implementation.  In 2017, 28 such reports were published and the estimate for 2018 is about 35.  While Ireland is not always included as a sampled member state, because generally five member states are covered in each report, there are often lessons learned and best practices identified which are of a horizontal nature.  In 2017 and 2018 there have been three special reports in which Ireland was visited, namely youth unemployment, broadband and public private partnerships.  In respect of agriculture, while Ireland is not directly sampled, some interesting reports were published including on rural development programming, greening, the basic payment scheme, a briefing paper on the future of the Common Agricultural Programme, CAP, and the recent opinion on new system of own resources of the EU.<br\/><br\/>Upcoming reports relevant for Ireland include an opinion of the court on the Commission's CAP proposal.  Other upcoming reports with a more general public interest are EU passenger rights and the EU system of measuring vehicle emissions.  We have a broad range of policy areas in which we issue reports.  I thank the committee and we look forward to answering any questions the members may have.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018101700002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539781200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murphy for the overview.

It is an extensive and important report.  I have some questions.  On cohesion, Mr. Murphy mentioned that we do not feature so much in that any more.  We realise the reason is that we have achieved a certain level of economic development.  Are there any other countries that stand out and that still avail of cohesion funds, to a greater or lesser extent?  What, if anything, have we in common with them?<\/p> <p>  Would Mr. Murphy like to expand on child poverty, which was studied?  A report was done in the middle of the downturn, which was a serious, difficult and challenging time for everybody.  To what extent, if it is known, has the situation altered in the meantime?  In respect of revenue and the EU budget in 2017, &euro;139 billion etc., and the GNI calculation - which is moving away from gross domestic product, GDP, and gross national product, GNP - will Mr. Murphy give us some idea as to what difference it makes for Ireland to use GNI as opposed to GDP or GNP?  I do not necessarily want Mr. Murphy to go into a major detailed explanation but there are some obvious comparisons. <\/p> <p>  There are obvious improvements.  Other people wish to speak and I do not want to cover their territory.  One thing has come to my attention in recent times in respect of spending and banking throughout Europe.  It has been said by some people that regulation was non-existent when the Irish and European economies crashed.  Some say there has now been an extreme reaction in the other direction, to the extent that restrictions are impeding necessary growth.  It might be wise to make a comment on that.  <\/p> <p>  My last point is on broadband, which the European Court of Auditors has already studied.  That is a moot question now.  It has been ongoing in this country for some considerable number of years.  I was spokesperson on that area myself several years ago when much attention was drawn to broadband.  It is still an issue.  It still has not been concluded in the way we would have expected.  I do not want Mr. Murphy to make any political comments, but the European Court of Auditors might have a perspective on the extent spending and policy at European level is likely to affect it.  Another issue that causes us quite a problem in this country is the issue of housing.  I refer to the degree to which housing has been hit by inflation as a result of a lack of competition in the market for new house building.  That is the only thing which affects the prices.<\/p><p>The purchase of existing houses does not affect that, as we all know, whereas extra houses in the housing stock do.  We are told all the time that European restrictions impede the extent to which the State may get involved in the direct building of local authority houses.  This issue has been tossed out to us on a regular basis but I have strong reservations about it.  It is in the national interest to access the necessary funds, of which there are considerable amounts available at low-interest rates of almost zero.  If ever there was a situation where it was necessary, in the national interest of our economy, to avail of well-priced funds, it is now.  There are many reasons, such as making the economy competitive and improving our society in order that we, as an economy, can develop, as opposed to a situation where a large portion of the family income - up to 50% in some cases - goes towards paying for the mortgage or rent, as the case may be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018101700002#C00300","speaker":"1322","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539781200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murphy for his presentation.  The auditors are dealing with revenue of &euro;139.7 billion, which is a big budget, and he has flown through the detail of it quickly but it is of benefit to us.  There is much information in the reports and the subsidiary reports to which he refers.  It is good to see the regulatory and legal position is improving compared with last year, which I think the citizens will be happy with.<\/p> <p>  On the MFF post-2020, the Taoiseach said Ireland would be prepared to increase its contribution to the EU budget, which we must be conscious of in our work in subsequent years.  Is there anything in particular that we need to be alerted to if we increase our contribution?  Is it just that we should be more vigilant in future or is there anything else that Mr. Murphy would like to advise us on in that respect?  <\/p> <p>  I am sure the Chairman will be interested in bureaucracy and form-filling, and the balance between efficiency and being friendly to the citizen.  Are things improving or otherwise in that regard?  Citizens complain about the amount of bureaucracy and form-filling and the fact that it is quite daunting.  Are there any moves to try to improve the situation or is the trend going the other way, with more form-filling and bureaucracy required?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Murphy mentioned a report on youth unemployment.  Will he give us the headlines of it?  During the recession there were many employment activation measures brought forward by the Government, some of which were funded by the EU.  Are we getting value for money for EU-funded employment activation measures, particularly for youth unemployment?

There is a general consensus about public private partnerships, PPP, not least in education, in which I have a professional background.  I have heard principals do nothing but sing the praises of PPP projects and how they deliver for them.  If PPPs were to be used, for example, to install toll bridges on the M50, taking the macro-view of PPP rather than the micro-view, there might be limited benefits.  I am interested, however, in exploring how those limitations find their way into the system, whether the system has recognised them, and whether they are likely to discourage future PPPs because it has been widely said that PPP is the way to get infrastructure that we need but cannot afford.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Durkan made a point about the Cohesion Fund.

The obvious thing that I wish to put into the mix of the questions is the whole issue of Brexit.  What is the representatives' up-to-date opinion and insight into what has happened over the past 24 and 48 hours, leaving aside what has happened in the past weeks and months?  What way do they see that going?  <\/p> <p>  During the briefing I listened with interest to what was said about fraud, a point which has been highlighted by Senator Craughwell.  Are there any lessons to be taken from the cases of fraud?  It is important to note that there are not many cases and there obviously seem to be many measures, checks and balances, which is to be welcomed.  One issue always arises, however, when we talk about auditing, checks and balances, namely, our farming community.  When we deal with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Europe or regulations, it has bothered me since I first entered politics that if anyone makes a mistake filling in a form or an application or doing anything else, it is classified as a mistake.  On the other hand, when a person in our farming community submits an application form with an error - a genuine, honest-to-God mistake - it is looked upon immediately as fraud.  It is looked upon as if it is somebody trying to swindle something but in 99.9% of cases it is no such thing.  It is a genuine mistake, such as a mapping error or an over-claim, which might be completely innocent and not somebody out to jip the system or trying to do something that is wrong.  It has always bothered me that when one family is filling in an application form for anything it is a mistake, but when a form is filled out in a farming household and something goes wrong, they are told that there is something bad or wrong about it, that it is fraud and that they are out to con the system.  I hate that and it has always been the case.<\/p> <p>  I deal with many farming queries from County Kerry and personnel working in agriculture, whether they be at home or abroad.  It bothers me so much that they are looked upon in this way.  It is the same with the fishermen, where if an Irish fisherman is doing something it is classified as illegal while if somebody else does the same thing, it is a mistake.  If a form in regard to tonnage is filled in incorrectly, it is fraud but if someone else does it, it is a mistake.  I would like to hear Mr. Murphy's views and opinions on that because it bothers me greatly and upsets our farming and fishing communities.<\/p><p>Mr. Murphy will have an insight into the future of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, given his new and enhanced role.  How will it filter down to all levels?  What exactly will the policy be in the future and how does he think it will work out?  How are we going to work with it?  What advantages and disadvantages does he see?  The matter is of great interest.  I would be grateful if he combined the issues.  <\/p><p> Other members are attending other meetings they could not get out of, while others are chairing meetings.  That is why the attendance is not what it usually would be.  We cannot help that, but we very much appreciate the efforts Mr. Murphy and his officials have made to be here.  I apologise again for the mistake made about the connection to the MEPs.  It was a matter beyond our control.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018101700002#D00600","speaker":"1319","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539781200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Erasmus+ was discussed at length, but it is an area of particular interest to me, as it marries with the issue of youth unemployment and is an programme for apprenticeships.

We have certain living standards that eastern Europe does not yet have, as is quite obvious if one visits any eastern European country.  The table shown reflected this in indicating how important funding was when compared to total government expenditure.  In eastern Europe the level of funding can reach 20%, whereas here it is 1%.  It is a significant issue in some of the member states concerned.<br\/><br\/>The discussion on the Multi-annual Financial Framework, MFF, is ongoing.  We have seen some briefing papers, on which we have made some contributions and suggestions, but we are not a party to the negotiations.  We will wait and see how it works out.  The final breakdown of the MFF budget and the future of the CAP are interlinked.  We are sometimes asked for opinions on specific things which we give, but at the end of the day it is for legislators in the Parliament and the Council to ultimately decide.

It is becoming more important because we have recently become a net contributor.  A review is ongoing of how owned resources will be used to fund budgets in the future.

Regardless of whether they will be based on taxes on plastic or there will be a consolidated tax base, it will all impinge on the GNI* element of total contributions.

These are policy areas within the domain of member states.  We have a national broadband plan, to which the European Union is contributing something, but it is the Irish national broadband plan.  Targets were set for the EU 2020 agenda to cover the broadband speeds that would be available by 2020.  It has been updated to cover the years to 2025.  There have been some issues recently in broadband provision, but we carried out our audit some time ago.  It looked like the programme was going to plan.  In our report at the time we said Ireland would probably not make the 2020 targets in full but that it was in a good position to make the 2025 targets.

Broadband plans are submitted to the Commission which has an input and monitors the type of plan proposed.  Germany is vectoring with cable from the phone system; it is not using fibre, which is a little surprising.  When we considered the matter, it seemed as if things were quite positive.  The process was co-ordinated and fibre was being used.  It seemed that, even if we would not meet the 2020 targets, it was more than likely that we would meet the 2025 targets in full.<\/p> <p>  On public private partnerships, PPPs, the member who raised the matter did not want to go into too much detail, but the Chairman was correct when he said the reports we issued were distributed.  We try to circulate them as far as possible.  A report on public private partnerships was released in March and it reached conclusions which were not particularly positive.  It stated there were limitations with PPPs and that in some cases projects became more costly.  The idea that PPPs would solve all problems was not borne out in practice.  <\/p> <p>  Fraud was mentioned a couple of times.  We are auditors.  If we come across a case where things look a little suspicious, we err on the side of caution and refer it to the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, but that body may not believe there are grounds to launch an investigation.  It is not the case that each case is automatically investigated for fraud.  However, what said was true - the number of fraud cases is not high.  We are never going to totally eliminate fraud; all we can do is try to ensure it is kept to an acceptable minimum.  Taxpayer's money should not be subject to fraud; therefore, we have to make sure we have a system in place which protects EU and national funds as much as possible.  This feeds into some of the issues raised by the Chairman about whether things can happen in error or by way of an innocent mistake.  Some can take those instances as an indication that fraud is occurring when that is not the case.  When it comes to legality and the regularity of payments, it is black and white.  There is a formalistic approach; something is either right or it is not.  When we talk about an error rate of 2.4%, we are not talking about fraud.  Some of the projects in which we have found errors are very good ones in that they have delivered exactly what was expected, if not more.  It is just an indicative figure; one has to go behind it and into the details to find out what it really means.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018101700002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1539781200,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Is the figure of 703 taken from a random sample?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018101700002#E01000","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539781200,"counter":26,"content":"<p>No.  Obviously, we cannot audit all transactions and payments throughout the European Union.  What we audit is the EU budget and the figure is 703.  Sometimes we are asked how particular member states are doing.  For example, we are asked, \"How is Ireland or Romania doing?\"  We cannot give a definitive opinion because we are not sampling on the basis of member states but on the basis of the EU budget as a whole and then different policy areas.  In fact, one of the issues that may have contributed to the fact that Cohesion Fund spending was so low was that we had introduced a new approach to our audit of the fund, whereby we would rely more on systems.  We are looking to try to avoid a bureaucratic burden on beneficiaries in order that they will not face multiple audits by other authorities in the member state, as well as by the Commission.  The idea was to try to use the work of the audit authorities and if that work was good enough, we would re-perform what they had done and if that was good enough, we would not have to go near the beneficiary.  We had mixed results.  As I said, it was a random sample, but in the case of the Cohesion Fund, we audited transactions which had already gone through the system.  They had been audited by the other authorities.<\/p> <p>  We issued a report on Erasmus+ only a couple of months ago.  It is a flagship programme for the European Union in that it is a programme that connects with citizens.  Nearly all of us know people who have been on an Erasmus exchange programme.  That is what we need more and more to have programmes where people will really see the benefits and that the European Union is adding value.  We are all for Erasmus+ pilot scheme being expanded.  I hope it will continue.<\/p> <p>  I think I have more or less covered the MFF post-2020.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey asked about the increased contribution.  We will have to wait and see as negotiations are ongoing.  We will have to wait and see how the hole created by the withdrawal will be filled.  Obviously, the headline on the press release from the President in the report is that the European Union should not make promises on which it cannot deliver.  There must be a realistic approach.  We have to realise the extent of the EU budget and what one can do with it.  Member states also need to be realistic.  They have to contribute to the Commission.  The President of the Commission, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, stated in his speech that the Commission could not be blamed for everything and that we needed resources to be able to do certain things.  One cannot cut the budget and then say one wants more.  Everybody is in favour of greater efficiency; however, the expectation gap is widening between what can be and what is being delivered.  <\/p> <p>  The Chairman asked about Brexit.  We are in the same position.  While circumstances change every day, we wait and see what will happen.  We will be involved when the deal is finalised, whether to validate figures or in some other role.  We have a Brexit task force which follows the process and any new audit we start.  Basically, we see whether it could be affected by Brexit.  We have had a few cases, where we audited the agencies based in London.  They are relocating, one to Amsterdam and another to Paris.  Brexit is already real for us in certain areas, but in others we must wait and see.  For us, at the end of any transition period we will still be able to audit EU funds which are being spent in the United Kingdom.  As members know, programme periods run on until 2020 and expenditure can probably be claimed up to 2023.  We will still have to check it as long as the United Kingdom is receiving EU funds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018101700002#F00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1539781200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Surely the advice of the European Court of Auditors must be sought, given that the impact of Brexit may be catastrophic when there is no funding coming from the United Kingdom.

When that happens, we will know the extent of the budget and have to be serious about what we can deliver with it, whatever it might be.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman asked about the Common Agricultural Policy.  The Commission has made a proposal about greater subsidiarity at member state level, whereby matters would be left to a member state to design its own measures.  It would make it more flexible in a way, but, on the other hand, it is also stating a figure 70% would still have to go towards direct payments.  There is some degree of flexibility under the new scheme.  Again, it is only a proposal from the Commission at this stage, but we will soon give an opinion on it and the final negotiated outcome.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of form filling and people making mistakes, at all times we try to promote simplification.  We have had a couple of audits.  We have a briefing paper on simplification in the post-2020 delivery of cohesion policy.  The papers offer opinions or advice which may or may not be taken on board.  We can only advise; we cannot insist or audit later.  We would be compromised and have a conflict of interest.  We are, however, in favour of simplification.<\/p> <p>  Youth unemployed was a case in point and an issue we discussed earlier.  Employment policy is the prerogative of national authorities.  The European Union makes a contribution, through which it tries to have some say on policy.  The youth guarantee was an idea based on a Council decision.  The member states agreed that they would all try to ensure everybody under 24 years of age would have a job, be in training or doing something within four months.  Our conclusion again was, going back to expectations, that the publicity and hype beforehand gave the impression that it would solve everything, a like like PPPs.  We said it was too much and that it would never work overnight.  These things take time.  It meant that there would have to be structural reforms in the labour market in many member states.  In Greece and Italy the youth unemployment rate is over 50%.  It takes a great deal of time to find jobs in the first place.  <\/p> <p>  I think the Deputy mentioned that Ireland was good at activation measures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018101700002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1539781200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Yes and also at measures aimed at progression.

What the Commission thought was very good here was the way the population had been identified.  In many member states the administration does not know where the unemployed youth are.  There is a significant problem in identifying the NEETs, young people not in education, employment or training.

We are glad today to have engagement with Mr. James Temple-Smithson.  With the European Parliament elections coming in May, this is a good time to start our engagement on planning for that election.  The European Parliament Constituency Committee has made its recommendations on how to organise the constituencies, and specifically how to reallocate the additional seats given to Ireland in light of the UK leaving the EU.  No doubt once the Government has considered those recommendations, the required heads of Bill will be published.

I am delighted to have the opportunity to talk about the European elections, which I realise for most normal people are some way over the horizon but for us are really imminent.  We are at cruising altitude and working hard and will continue to do so.<\/p> <p>  It is a shame about the video-conferencing with MEPs but I note that intensive efforts are made by colleagues here to include MEPs in these meetings.  Lesser people would throw their hands up and give up, but that is not what happens.  I note that the continued efforts made are very much appreciated on the European Parliament side and thank the committee for its continued efforts.<\/p> <p>  The European Parliament elections take place across the EU on 23-26 May next year.  Traditionally, before European elections, the European Parliament runs an information campaign, which we run centrally from Brussels and then at a decentralised level in our 35 liaison offices in the member states.  I use the term \"information campaign\" deliberately and advisedly to distinguish it from the political campaign that precedes the elections.  It is worth underlining at the outset here that our campaign is strictly non-political and non-partisan and consists purely of providing information, but information that we hope is presented in a creative way and is well targeted at the audience we are trying to reach<\/p> <p>  We seek to inform people about the work and role of the European Parliament and the remit of MEPs, as well as some of the legislative and policy achievements of the Parliament, particularly during the past five years, and we highlight the date of the election and explain the electoral process.  In that regard, the big innovation next year will be the two additional seats that were allocated to Ireland by the European Council decision in June and the changes to the constituencies that flow from that.<\/p> <p>  For the time being we are proceeding on the basis that we think polling day will be on 24 May and that the constituencies will be as proposed by the Constituency Commission at the end of last month, but of course our job will be much easier once these elements are legally confirmed.<\/p><p>Similarly, in the field of known unknowns, we are anticipating local elections<b><\/b>on the same day but we are also waiting to see if there will be one or more referendums too, which would obviously have a bearing on the political landscape.<br\/><br\/>Committee members will be aware that turnout in European elections in Ireland has tended more recently to be above the EU average.  It was 52% at the last election against an EU average of 43%.  However, as with Europe and the rest of the western world, the trend is for a gradual decline in participation and we are trying to contribute to redressing that.  Part of the explanation for the higher turnout in Ireland is the generally positive attitude towards the EU.  The Chairman referred earlier to the latest Eurobarometer survey which was published today.  The field work was done in late September and the survey confirms what we know to be an overwhelmingly positive sentiment in Ireland towards the EU.  A full 92% of those surveyed felt that Ireland has benefited from EU membership.  The Chairman interpreted the next statistic differently from me.  I understood that 40% of Irish respondents said they were not interested in the upcoming European elections, which is slightly higher than when we last asked the question in April.  <br\/><br\/>We have a twofold challenge in the forthcoming election information campaign.  The first is to reach out to the people who say they are not interested and to try to interest them by explaining what is at stake in European elections.  The second is to galvanise those who are interested but who, for one reason or another, may not actually make it to the polling station on election day.  We will be targeting both deliberate and inadvertent abstainers.  Of course, the campaign is aimed at the entire voting age population but there is one demographic segment in Ireland where voting in European elections is well below the EU average, namely those under 25.  Turnout was only 21% for this group in 2014, as compared to 37% for those aged 25 to 39, 60% for those between 40 and 54 and 76% for those over 55.  In that context, we perceive a need to place particular emphasis on younger and first-time voters.  We are not the first people to come along and say that we need to do more to encourage young people to vote.  There is a lot of evidence which suggests that if people vote the first time they are eligible, they are much more likely to continue voting.  Conversely, if they do not vote the first time they are eligible, they are much less likely to pick up the habit as they get older.  This is part of a longer-term effort and is something to which I am personally very committed.  We run a number of programmes to try to address this issue, not least of which is our ambassador school programme of which members may be aware.  We have a shared interest with colleagues in the Oireachtas on this front and we have had some very productive discussions with Mr. Conor Reale from the outreach section of the House of the Oireachtas.  We have identified some areas of shared interest and we are looking forward to working together to deepen that relationship and see what we can do together.<br\/><br\/>A central plank of our campaign is the website<i>, www.thistimeimvoting.eu, <\/i>where people can pledge to vote and encourage their friends and family to do so too.  This has been launched across the EU in the past fortnight but we are waiting until after the presidential election to launch it here because we did not want to run the risk of causing confusion by having a big promotion of the website in the run up to that election.  There will be three phases to our campaign, the first running from November to February when we will be encouraging people to make sure they are registered to vote.  The core phase will be from February to April when we will be focusing on what is at stake in the European election and why voting matters.  After Easter and into May we will step back and leave the field to the political parties and will concentrate on promoting the date of the election and reminding people to vote.  <br\/><br\/>We hope to work with the grain on the aforementioned phases.  We have had some productive discussions with officials in the Department for Housing, Planning and Local Government about how we might work with them, particularly during the voter registration phase of the campaign.  We intend to be in touch with local authorities and any referendum commission that may be in place at the appropriate juncture.  We are also working with a range of civil society actors and stakeholder organisations on <i>www.thistimeimvoting.eu<\/i>and providing them with resources for the European elections.  Like all campaigns these days, the online component is extremely important but it is certainly not the only one.  If we are to reach everybody, we cannot run a campaign exclusively online.  There is always room for good old fashioned printed material.  One of the things we will be offering on that front is a county-by-county leaflet explaining the mechanics of the election in each county and outlining what the EU has done for that county.  We will also be engaging with journalists, preparing radio advertisements and campaign videos and so on.  Although it is clearly true that a growing number of people get their news and information online, the majority still get their news from radio and television which, along with newspapers, are the more trusted sources of information.  These media will therefore be a big part of the mix for our campaign.  <br\/><br\/>We also intend to promote as much as possible the so-called Spitzenkandidaten or lead candidate process, which featured for the first time in the last European elections.  The European Parliament strongly endorsed this process in a resolution in February 2018.  It will feature prominently in our efforts to promote interest in the European elections.  There is a very strong case for a debate between the lead candidates taking place in Ireland in the run up to the European elections, not least because this will happen immediately in the aftermath of 29 March next year.  The next Commission President will be a key figure in terms of what happens in the next phases of the Brexit process.  That is obviously of acute interest.  A debate taking place here will also take place in English and will be accessible to broadcasters from all around Europe and is capable of generating interest far beyond Ireland and could be a Europe-wide event.  It is not something that our office can host but we would encourage others to do so and are certainly ready to provide advice on same.  We have started some conversations about it.  The two big elements that we are trying to put in place are buy-in from the European political parties, who we hope will encourage their candidates to commit to such a debate and buy in from a major media partner because that is what makes political debates fly.  We have started some work behind the scenes on that.  It would be a serious lacuna if there were not to be a debate among the lead candidates in Ireland in the spring.  <br\/><br\/>The information campaign runs up until the election but does not stop there.  After the election, we have a job to do to communicate about the new Parliament, the new MEPs representing us in Europe, as well as the new Commission President and his or her programme and hearings for the new Commissioners.  The communication plan runs through to the end of next year.  As members can see, there is a lot going on and for those who want to follow our preparations for the European elections, we produce a monthly newsletter outlining the latest developments.

I hope that in the run-up to the elections, the general public will be informed of the importance of these elections in terms of the economic benefits accruing to this country and to Europe generally.  It would be useful to compare income <i>per capita<\/i>in 1989 or 1990 for countries in the EU, countries in the European Free Trade Area and the United States with today's income<i>per capita<\/i>data.  Ireland is one of the top performers, despite the crash and everything that went with it.  I hope that such data will be included in any information made available to the public and that it will be in readable form and readily accessible.  I agree entirely with Mr. Temple-Smithson that there is nothing to beat a leaflet or poster with general information to galvanise voters.<\/p><p>There is a particular interest in encouraging younger voters to participate.  I was disappointed to note the lack of interest among younger voters compared with the UK, for example, where the younger voters were the ones who took the interest in future membership of the European Union when the older voters did not.  It seems to be the opposite in this country, which should not be the case, particularly when we have such large a young population compared with other countries.  Does Mr. Temple-Smithson feel there is anything that could encourage the younger voter from the perspective of an investment in their future and the benefits apart from the participating in the democratic process generally but from deciding in this democratic process now for their benefit and for that of the country.  <\/p><p> Finally, not all countries are voting on the same day.

What is Mr. Temple-Smithson doing to increase reporting and coverage of European Parliament proceedings?  For the first time in a long time, Irish people are aware of an MEP from outside Ireland, namely, Guy Verhofstadt.  We can pronounce Mr. Verhofstadt's name now because he is so central to the Brexit negotiations in which Irish people have taken an interest.  It is a pity that European Parliament elections here tend to be dominated by personalities, national issues and even local issues, which is probably to be expected to an extent since the local elections take place on the same day.

If young people aged 16 and upwards are brought into the electoral process, we have them for life.  Let us hope this Government or the next will revisit the matter.  It is of great importance that we engage people in the democratic process as early as possible and it would be great to see Europe take a lead in this.  There are countries which already have the vote at 16 years and the world has not ended in any of them, nor were any lives lost.  It broadens the democratic process.<\/p> <p>  The one difficulty I have always had with Europe is the Commission and our appointment of Commissioners.  It is not something we can deal with through this process but I have always felt that the democratic imperative was missing there.  In some cases, the Commissioner role is a nice job for a good old crony who has spent his or her life in Irish or British politics and a means of getting a good pension.  That is not how it should be.  We should send people who are selected by a democratic process, even if it meant something like the Senate election that takes place in this country.

Are there particular concerns about hacking in the European Parliament elections?  That could have a very damaging effect in future elections, if not this time perhaps.  We have seen how fake tweets or similar issues can affect an election.  It is something that should be discussed.  This will be the first time that the UK will not have a European Parliament election at the same time as Ireland.  Is Brexit likely to have an impact on the election here?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Temple-Smithson's independence is absolute, but how does he work with MEPs, candidates and potential candidates in elections?  How does he strike a balance and ensure he keeps his independence intact?  How do we get more people interested in European elections?  I have my own ideas on that but I will keep them for another time in case I am asked to be director of elections for a European campaign.  I do not propose to let other people know the secrets that I might have in my head so I will wait until somebody offers me that role.  It is something I have done in council elections and other elections for family members.<\/p><p> When it comes to getting people interested in European elections, a great deal of work has to be done.  This is because in the past there would definitely have been more excitement at a busy funeral than for some of the European elections.  Certainly, they would have left a good deal to be desired in my humble opinion.  We will see what the future will hold.  A great deal of work can be done.<\/p><p> Reference was made to a rate of 52% in Ireland and how this is higher than elsewhere.  However, it is still a poor show.  People have worked hard in the past.  People gave up a great deal so that we could vote, whether in local, national or European elections.  People should really be willing to push the boat out and vote for whomever they wish - whether individuals or parties - regardless of their allegiances.  That is well and good.  My God, people should push the boat out and declare that they want to be part of it.  They should outline the reason they want to be part of it is because they want to engage, have their say and place their trust in a person, whether a lady, a man or a party.  That person or individual will be the one to represent them and their interests.  Afterwards, they will be able to say that the person did what they wanted or did not do what they wanted and so they will vote for someone else on the next occasion.  If a person stands on the sidelines and, come voting day for the European elections, simply either does not bother or decides not to vote, then it is an awful attitude.  That is actually sad.  I hope the rate will be higher than 52% in this election.  We would want it to go a great deal higher.<\/p><p> If Mr. Temple-Smithson can do anything to push up the rate, I would very much welcome it.  A great deal of this is down to the parties and the individual candidates.  We have seen in recent times major parties standing back from elections and not fielding candidates.  I have some ideas on that.  I am of the view that it is abdicating responsibility in respect of an important role.  In any event, that is a debate for another day.

It is wrong for any group of people not to put a candidate in the field.  It was different for the politicians of all persuasions long ago, when resources were limited and the tools at people's fingertips were not even a fraction of those that are available today.  People went out and made the effort.  They went out on bicycles to canvass.  They held open rallies.  People walked for miles and miles to listen to their chosen candidate or to someone from the party to which they were affiliated.  Thousands of people in towns and villages came out and heard inspiring speeches.  The people were inspired by the candidates.  In those times, they used to fight over their politics.  They would fight their corners and debate matters in every sense.  It was great in a way because it showed that they were interested and committed.  On polling day, they could not wait to vote.  Regardless of whatever jobs needed to be done, they put on their best clothes and headed to polling stations because they wanted to vote for their people.  They believed they had a great day's work done when they had voted.  Regardless of whether the preferred person won, lost or whatever, they had engaged with the system.  I am thinking back to a time when people were unable to jump into a motor car and drive to a polling station.  They had to go across country in bad weather wearing poor clothing in order to vote.  Yet, they did it and they were proud and glad.  When we think about voting, we should think about those people and be more interested in our democracy.<\/p> <p>  That is enough of my ranting for today.  Those are my feelings on the matter.

I will run through the points Deputies have made.  It is absolutely the case that overall the benefit of EU membership to Ireland has been significant.  Let us compare Ireland in 1973 with Ireland today.  That is part of our day-to-day work and is absolutely what we intend to do in the campaign.<\/p> <p>  The question of younger voters is puzzling.  When we ask younger people in surveys, they are always the most enthusiastic Europeans.  They say they are pro-European and identify themselves in the group that is interested in and intent on voting.  How do we then galvanise them to actually get to the ballot box?  There are mechanical and structural reasons.  They might be away at college or they might not understand the register.  There might be some process issues.  There is a job to do on that front and we work with the Union of Students in Ireland and the National Youth Council of Ireland on initiatives in this area.  Certainly, one important part of this is making the case to them that their future is at stake.  Young people in the UK have buyer's remorse, if that is the correct term, for the fact that they did not turn out and vote in the referendum and now they are set to face the consequences.  It is a complicated problem but we have some ideas to pursue on that front.<\/p> <p>  Why do countries not vote on the same day?  It is simply a matter of tradition.  From time to time the idea has come up.  I referred to the report resolution in the Parliament in February.  If I remember rightly, an amendment was proposed that the poll should be on the same day everywhere but it was voted down.  Every time this issue comes up the possibility is raised that it would be more coherent.  Perhaps the moment will arrive and the politics will align so that it can happen.  It would certainly make things more straightforward.  However, we could have the strange situation of the polls closing, presumably if were to be on a Friday.  Then, the local votes would be counted and there would be interest for people in the immediate aftermath.  However, we could not start to count the EU Parliament ballots straight away.  We could verify them but we could not start counting until polls close in the last country, which could be at 11 p.m. in Italy.  Then, the count could go on until the middle of next week and so on.  Certainly, there is an argument that it would make the case easier and that it would feel more like a European experience if everyone voted on the same day.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Verhofstadt is a rather media-friendly personality.  When he came to Ireland last September, there was considerable interest in him and in the way he articulates things.  He is a skilled political communicator.  We are always trying to identify other MEPs who have something to say.  Ms Danuta Maria Huebner is the chairperson of the EU Parliament Committee on Constitutional Affairs.  She visited some weeks ago.  There was a reasonable amount of media interest in her but not the same as for Mr. Verhofstadt.  Tomorrow morning, the Taoiseach will meet the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Tajani, and we will be promoting that and what Mr. Tajani has to say after that meeting.  We do try.<\/p><p>It is important to help promote that the whole of the European Parliament is relevant to people in Ireland and we promote not only Irish MEPs but  MEPs from other countries.  Our remit extends to the big issues of the day.  We take account of the Eurobarometer, which we have discussed, identify issues of concern to the population in general, the issues people have said are priorities and we communicate what the European Parliament has done in those areas.  There is a saying that eaten bread is soon forgotten.  It is true that what we are saying is what has happened in the past and perhaps the rest interest is in what will happen in the future.  <\/p><p> To move on to the point the Chairman made, let me be clear, we are the supporting cast in this.  The actors are the politicians.  We can set the stage but it is for them to articulate what they think should happen on those big issues.  We are certainly in the market to provide information about decisions the European Parliament has taken on migration or, as was mentioned, the rise of illiberal democracy and what the EU has done in respect of Hungary and Poland. <\/p><p> I have not heard the OSCE mentioned regarding European elections.  I would have to look into that and come back to the member on that.  I am not familiar with that but I will make a note of it.  <\/p><p>The issue of a combination of elections being held on the one day is a difficult one.  It slices both ways.  On the one hand, having local elections on the same day as the European elections promotes turnout but it makes the debate harder to get across because we are competing with the local elections.  The same applies to the holding of  a referendum on the same day.  If a referendum was to be held on lowering the voting age to 16 on the same day as the European elections, that might help us garner interest among younger voters but that is not likely to happen.  Lowering the voting age to 16 is not an issue for us.  It is not our remit.  We do a great deal of youth  engagement work and when we talk to people in that age bracket and ask them what are issues they care about, that is always one of the top two or three issues 16 to 19 year olds raise.  That is just a passing observation. <\/p><p>  On the issue of the way Commissioners are appointed, the Parliament would point to two factors.  There has been much more interest in the nomination process on the past two occasions.  The European Parliament had added democratisation to that process through the hearings we have had.  I have been around for a long time and 12 years ago there was little evidence of interest in those hearings whereas now there is a great deal of interest.  I anticipate there would be interest in the hearing for whoever is nominated to be the Irish Commissioner.  We actively promote that.  For example, we pay to promote the hearing live online to make that as accessible as possible to people.  There is certainly much more interest in the Commissioner from one's country and if there is some controversy there would be more interest in that.  The person nominated does not only have to get through the appointment, he or she has to be ratified by the European Parliament.  Also, we would argue that the \"Spitz\" process in terms of the lead candidate process is an important democratising element.  In the past the European Council nominated the President of the Commission after a closed meeting but with this process these people are making their case for their vision of the future of Europe months beforehand and that is a much more open process.<\/p><p>On the Chairman's comments, we are acutely aware of the whole issue of hacking, fake news and nefarious interference in elections issue.  In areas where there is a legislative solution, that is for a matter for the Commission to act.  A conference was held in Brussels yesterday or the day before at which Commissioner King specifically proposed some actions and other Commissioners have proposed specific steps that need to be taken before the European elections.  There is an awareness there will be interest in some quarters in trying to manipulate the European elections.  We are certainly taking steps in the European Parliament to engage with social media or firms and so on.  One of the measures we can take against fake news is to promote awareness of the phenomenon.  We held an event in June on that issue, in which there was a great deal of interest and at which a number of Deputies and Senators spoke.<\/p><p> On Brexit, the fact that it will happen on 29 March next year just before the European elections can only increase interest in the European elections.  It may help to demonstrate and underline even more the importance of membership of the Union.  If nothing else, Brexit, as the Eurobarometer today shows, has underlined to people what the benefits of EU membership are and what they stand to lose if their country is no longer a member of it.<\/p><p> Regarding candidates and potential candidates for the European elections and MEPs, the last session will end Easter week next year.  We will deal with members in their routine work until the end of that session which will be Holy Thursday.  After that they become candidates.  We provide information for all candidates.  We can provide information about what happened in a certain vote, what was achieved in this or that area, but we would not provide the support we provide to MEPs until after the elections.  That would be for former MEPs standing again or for new candidates.  We treat everybody the same in terms of providing the same level of information.  Perhaps I could buy the Chairman a cup of tea and pick his brains on ideas for how we might galvanise people in terms of these elections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018101700002#K01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Temple-Smithson","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1539781200,"counter":65,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539781200,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I would be very interested to hear the Chairman's ideas on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2018101700002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. James Temple-Smithson"},{"type":"speech","time":1539781200,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Temple-Smithson for his engagement with us today.

Having recently reviewed the transcript and video of our health and social care professional colleagues' presentations in June, the IASLT wishes to echo many of the concerns presented and expand on those specific to SLTs.<\/p> <p>  First and foremost is consultation.  Concern was raised by our members about the absence of formal consultation.  While 8 September 2017 is reported as the date of the HSE consultation on the AON SOP, members have reported that notice of this meeting was poorly communicated.  The short notice meant that front-line clinicians who had pre-arranged appointments and front-line obligations could not attend.  Furthermore, the IASLT never received formal invitation to this meeting, nor has it received a copy of the AON SOP to date.  Information on the AON SOP came to the IASLT's attention via our own members.  <\/p> <p>  The lack of consultation with SLTs is further evidenced by the inadequate definition of communication in the SOP.  SLTs hold expertise in speech, language and communication needs, and absence of a proper definition poses risks to the identification of such needs.  Further consultation could be considered through partnership with the HSE's own health and social care professional, HSCP, office, which co-ordinates many working groups with representation from various health and social care professionals, including SLTs who represent the IASLT.  They work collaboratively with stakeholders to facilitate a unified voice for health and social care professionals.  One of the office's key aims is the co-ordination of HSCP input to design, plan and implement strategy within the HSE.  Collaboration between the HSE disability operations and the HSCP's offices would ensure appropriate governance, terms of reference and operational recommendations are in place.<\/p> <p>  The IASLT welcomes the plan for progressing disability services and recognises the need for standardisation of assessment of need.  Appropriate consultation and collaboration are vital, however, for appropriate and effective change management to ensure the best outcomes for the children and families we support.<\/p><p>The need for resources - those being human, infrastructure and IT - to support the implementation of Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People was widely discussed at the committee's previous meeting.  We welcomed the acknowledgement by Dr. Morgan that disability services have been under-resourced and are hopeful that the 100 posts announced in the recent budget are part of a multi-year programme of investment.  As previously mentioned by our colleagues in the Association of Occupational Therapists of Ireland, AOTI, chapter 9 of A National Model of Care for Paediatric Healthcare Services in Ireland outlines the need for detailed workforce planning for health and social care professionals at primary, secondary and tertiary care level.  The operation of this standing operating procedure is challenged by these resource issues across both social and primary care.<\/p><p> One key challenge to speech and language therapist, SLT, staffing is the length of time it currently takes to replace vacancies.  It can take six to eight months from one staff member walking out the door to a replacement SLT arriving.  Experienced, knowledgeable staff members who avail of promotional opportunities are often replaced with less experienced staff who need more time to upskill in the clinical area and join the new team.  The new clinician may not have been trained up in some of the assessments required to determine the presence of a disability.  The standard operating procedure as outlined cannot work without a properly trained team with the necessary skill mix.<\/p><p> We know from talking to the families we work with that they want the right care for their child in the right place and at the right time.  If children could access the intervention services they need in a timely fashion there would be a reduced number requesting assessments under the Disability Act and the need for this standard operating procedure would be greatly reduced.<\/p><p> Margaret Lennon of DCA Warriors identified the need for Irish data on the numbers of children presenting with disability.  If we are to adequately meet the needs of children and families we need to collect information on prevalence and incidence of disability and its subtypes in Ireland.<\/p><p> As to best practice guidelines, Irish Association of Speech and Language Therapists, IASLT, members are bound by the IASLT code of professional conduct and ethics of 2015.  As practitioners in the Republic of Ireland, speech and language therapists must hold registration with the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, CORU, under the Health and Social Care Professional Act of 2005.  The assessment of need standard operating procedure is in breach of the following sections of the code - to \"act within the best interest of the service user\"; and \"a member shall also appropriately address concerns regarding policies, working conditions, actions or inactions of others which compromise the care of service users or public safety\".  For speech and language therapists, as with other health and social care professionals, assessment is a dynamic and ongoing process whereby clinicians rely on their training and experience to assist parents in setting goals to meet the child and families&rsquo; needs.  The preliminary team assessment as outlined in the standard operating procedure is in many ways a breach of this.  In many instances a complete diagnostic assessment is required to ensure appropriate differential diagnosis.  Differential diagnosis is essential for clinicians to make recommendations regarding appropriate pathways of intervention.  Without complete diagnostic assessments, children and families will be unable to access additional services such as home tuition; autism spectrum disorder, ASD, special classes; or, other specialist placements.  Such recommendations are not possible without comprehensive diagnostic assessment.  The standard operating procedure will result in delays in accessing appropriate interventions as well as accessing the most suitable educational placement, thus placing additional stress on the families.<\/p><p> Finally, the code of professional conduct and ethics further states that \"members should take any time necessary to sensitively communicate their decision\/s with the service user and family members, in the context of the constraints of confidentiality\".  The standard operating procedure is intended &ldquo;to ensure that children and their families access appropriate services as quickly as possible&rdquo;.  However, in its current form, in some areas, it will place additional demands on teams that are already struggling in provision of services.  An audit of assessment of need practices across the country would highlight areas where assessment of needs have been of benefit and the reason for the bottlenecks.  An audit would ensure all children with suspected disabilities access services in a similar manner, as well as highlight the barriers in other areas where assessments of need are either under or over utilised, and establish why this is so?  The absence of an audit results in a &lsquo;one size fits all&rsquo; model without considering local differences.  Furthermore, the limitations of the preliminary team assessment will breach best practice regarding the HSE&rsquo;s own policy on informing families. <\/p><p> We have outlined the main issues for speech and language therapists in relation to disability services, but also want to summarise some recommendations, many of which have already been identified by the HSE.  These include detailed workforce planning; collection of data on incidence and prevalence of disability in Ireland; developing an implementation plan for progressing disabilities services utilising existing structures including the health and social care professional, HSCP, office; and, consultation in relation to proposed changes using the HSE change model.<\/p><p> In conclusion, IASLT recognises the need for standardisation of procedures for the assessment of need process.  However, the increased demand for assessments of need must be evaluated and an appropriate response put in place.  IASLT welcomes formalising structures for appropriate consultation with the HSE, the HSE&rsquo;s disability operations officer, as well as with the Minister for Health to ensure services developed adhere to best practice guidelines for both our clinicians and the children and families they support.<\/p><p> Ms Kenny and I welcome the opportunity now to discuss this further and answer any questions further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Vickie Kirkpatrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Kirkpatrick and I call on members of the committee to make their observations.

It was my idea originally to highlight what are obvious difficulties with the new proposed standard operating procedure.  The original meeting was my idea.  Apologies if our guest speakers were left out on that occasion and I hope that we can all move on together.  It was not intentional.  As highlighted by Ms Kirkpatrick and Ms Kenny this is not just about speech.  People think that speech therapists just deal with speech but as the disabilities spokesperson for Fianna F&aacute;il, I am aware that the witnesses' profession does much work with swallowing, eating and all functions of the throat.  Sometimes the general public are not aware of that which is good to highlight.<\/p> <p>  The assessment of need is a major problem in any event and these new proposals are making a bad situation worse, in my mind.  It is like a yellow pack assessment of need, for want of a better word.  In the opinion of our guest speakers, do they see conflicting requirements from clinicians in general and do they believe that the preliminary team assessment is contrary to the spirit of the Act, especially concerning the 90 minutes that is so short, and in my opinion, very insulting to have such a limited time for assessment?  I am aware that Ms Kirkpatrick and Ms Kenny spoke about meetings on short notice, etc.  Was the whole thing drafted without any concrete consultation with their association?<\/p> <p>  The standard operating procedure proposes that only children who have \"complex and significant needs\" access an assessment of need.  In my opinion, complexity is very subjective.  This will lead to problems and I would like to have the association's views on this point.  Does the association believe this will lead to misdiagnosis and wrong diagnosis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#H00300","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539763200,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Murphy O'Mahony.  I will start with the easiest point as to the process.  The document was created without any consultation with us.  Members have reported that it has been a knee-jerk reaction towards trying to manage the large increase recently in those waiting for further assessment of need.<\/p> <p>  On the preliminary team assessment suggestion, having not been around the table when this came into being, the Act deals with the determination of disability, and the steps required to do that.  It is never straightforward.  Often best practice requires a multi-disciplinary approach to do that.  One of the solutions would be the implementation of disability network teams under Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People, if that was implemented.<\/p><p>The objective is for parents to have one point of access.  Over time there have been delays in accessing services.  Our members are seeing parents going an AON route to ensure they can access services rather than going with the provisions of the Disability Act 2005, <i>per se<\/i>.  It is very likely that without an audit people might wait in an AON queue when it was never designed for that purpose, particularly with regard to the level of complexity of the needs of the people in that queue.  It is one aspect of the wait list numbers.<br\/><br\/>The risk of misdiagnosis is widespread with the current form of standard operating procedure.  As I mentioned in my opening address, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and social workers are currently regulated.  Physiotherapists and psychologists will soon be regulated.  This is to protect the public and ensure we do not engage in any practices that might put people at risk.  It is our duty to highlight the risks that this presents.  Even if the time changes, autonomous practice is required to ensure clinicians have the scope to meet the emotional needs of families.  We heard that very much from the DCA Warriors.  It is correct that speech and language therapy is not just about communication or feeding, eating, drinking and swallowing.  A therapeutic relationship is formed with people because of the nature of communication.  Working with younger people this takes longer to develop that trust in the family context.  We need to gather the information in a timely fashion.<br\/><br\/>I would be as bold as to suggest that the issue with the wait list in AONs is not how long it takes us on the other side to do an assessment but rather the volume.  Clinicians work as teams to ensure best practice and that work is the most important aspect of the process.  If we audit and quantify it, this would not be the piece delaying the numbers at the door.  Does that make sense?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Vickie Kirkpatrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":80,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#J00200","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539763200,"counter":81,"content":"<p>With regard to the preliminary team assessment, my understanding is that the idea came from services being reconfigured under the progressing disability services programme.

The initial assessment was fairly time-bound and it led straight to interventions.  The difference comes in that most parts of the country have not been reconfigured.  These people are waiting on the AON and are not accessing intervention straight away.  Between getting assessment of need and the time accessing intervention, there could be a gap of one, two or even three or four years in places.  In doing a short summary assessment at the start, one cannot give the family something to go away with for the next four years.  If there were reconfigured teams behind this, they could meet the families and set them on an intervention pathway very quickly.  It relates to the nature of operations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":84,"content":"<p>It seems to go against the idea of early intervention, which is so important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#J00600","speaker":"1262"},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I echo the point that has just been made, as it would not be early intervention if people must wait years for it.  It falls at the first hurdle under the definition.  I thank the witnesses for coming in.  When we discussed this previously, one of the matters raised concerned the inconsistencies throughout the country.  My question is simple and concerns models of best practice.  Do we have individual models of best practice?  Where we have models of best practice and where they are working, is that just associated with resources?  One often hears the process is working in a certain area and the work in that area should be modelled; this implies that everybody else is not working hard or smartly enough.  Generally, when we drill down, we find the areas where a new scheme, idea or policy works generally have an association with resources.  I am interested to know if that is the way the witnesses see it.  Does this explain the geographical inconsistencies?<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the recent budgetary announcement and the possibility of recruiting additional personnel.  I assume the same difficulties regarding recruitment and retention exist in speech and language therapy as in other areas.  Will the witnesses comment on that briefly, although I acknowledge it is not the specific issue before us?  In the context of a multi-annual programme, I share the optimism of the witnesses but it is all it is.  What was announced was just a one-off number and there was no hint there would be any multi-annual funding associated with it.  Will they comment on that?  The introduction of a new or rearranged SOP will not change anything unless there are resources and staff but I am interested in their comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#J00700","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539763200,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I will address the matter of numbers and models and Ms Kenny might speak to recruitment.  With respect to best practice models, from the numbers given to us by the disability operations office in June that were shared with the committee, it is not hard science.  Those with the lower numbers are in places that have reconfigured.  One of the barriers for clinicians on the front line, or even most important for families, is the one point of access.  We echo Dr. Morgan's point that it is not only about human resources for those posts; it is also about restructuring and models of best practice.  We had that model with its publication in 2005 through to 2009.  The greatest challenge is that a change of that magnitude requires front-end investment and project management, as well as lead-out.  It cannot be done in a vacuum.  It is a big restructuring process.  My suspicion is the places where there has been change are smaller and it has not been as cumbersome to restructure them.  This is all the more reason for proper project management and investment to manage the change required.<\/p> <p>  We heard figures in the previous session about investing now because of what the cost would be later.  It is again about ensuring that a workforce is in place.  The workforce in health and social care has increased exponentially over the past 15 years with Irish clinicians training at top universities.  The programmes are recognised.  The IASLT enjoys mutual recognition with the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia.  Our graduates are recognised and, therefore, we have the power to produce highly qualified professionals.  It is about the structures in place and not necessarily about a targeted number of posts.  It is important that there be a structure to facilitate one point of access for families.  The tiered model moves into a social model of care rather than an impairment model.  The other struggle is even in terms of legislation.  The Disability Act 2005 was a great advance for people with disability in Ireland but as legislation it needs to continue to grow and modernise.  It is an impairment-based model in terms of what people can and cannot do, which is difficult when a person is three years old.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Vickie Kirkpatrick"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539763200,"counter":87,"content":"<p>It was a good question about recruitment and retention.  The last time there was workforce planning, it followed the Bacon report of 2001.  There have been recommendations from the HSCP to look at workforce planning nationally.<\/p><p>We are working on old information.<\/p><p> The reason clinicians generally leave is because they might be looking for promotional opportunities or they want to move around the country.  Their initial placement might be somewhere they do not ultimately want to live.  There is anecdotal evidence that the urban centres might be suffering because it is so difficult for people to afford live in Dublin.<\/p><p> The second half is around replacing those who leave posts.  There might be a post that becomes available and there is interest in that post, but the length of time recruitment is taking is an issue.  There is a national recruitment service, the Health Business Services, HBS.  There are panels in place and when one person walks out the door, one must submit the paperwork locally.  It has to go through local pay bill.  That can take however long, depending on where budgets are at the local area, before it ever goes to national recruitment.  When a person walks out the door, one has a whole-time equivalent post but it may take six to eight months for somebody else to arrive in to that post.  Not only is nobody being seen in that length of time in that particular setting but when the new person comes in, he or she needs to be inducted.  It might take longer to upskill.  I refer to all that extra time on top of the length of time the post has been vacant.<\/p><p> The speech and language therapy is in primary care and social care.  Where a child at 12 months is not talking, the public health nurse may say that he or she will refer the child to a speech and language therapist in primary care.  When the child comes to that speech and language therapist, she may recognise that it is a much more complex disorder - potentially autism spectrum disorder - and then look to refer on to a disability team.  Depending on waiting lists, the child may have waited 12 months to see an SLT in primary care and then have to wait another 12 months or longer after he or she is assessed.<\/p><p> In terms of the work practice, as speech and language therapy, nationally, in primary care, we have looked at a review of how we can deliver services better.  There is a report sitting in the HSE that has yet to be published which looks at how we can improve the way we work in primary care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#J00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Kenny","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses from the Irish Association of Speech and Language Therapists.  I have a long association with the disability Bill - one withdrawn, there was a second one and then, finally, it passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas in June 2005.  That was a time of great hope and expectation, that has been badly dented in a number of ways.  Emotionally and otherwise, that is where I am coming from in this discussion.  The focus on starting with the children and moving along was a practical one in the Act and made sense.<\/p> <p>  I will respond to some of the points the witnesses made.  Ms Kirkpatrick referenced Dr. Cathal Morgan stating here in June last that disability services were under-resourced and hoped that the 100 new posts in the budget which we are all delighted with would be part of a multi-annual provision.  Ms Kirkpatrick is at least hinting that there is more needed to do this work.<\/p> <p>  Then there was talk about replacement and churning of staff, with experienced staff moving on and less experienced staff coming in.  Ms Kenny mentioned it takes six to eight months from when somebody goes out the door to get his or her replacement.  My question is twofold.  The first is a difficult one to be scientific about the answer.  In terms of the need for professionals and therapists to deal with this issue, is the bottle half full or half empty?  I accept there are many other issues as well.  It is important to get some sense of what step change the witnesses feel needs to be made.  Second, is allowance made for the effect on teams, including various allied health professionals and clinicians, of somebody stating, \"I am out of here.  I am moving on.  I am going somewhere else.\" or has everyone their fingers crossed every day hoping that their staff will stay there forever?<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the risk of misdiagnosis being prevalent.  I do not know what is meant by \"misdiagnosis\".  What I mean by that is often it is about getting from symptoms to a cause.  Somebody presents with a symptom or symptoms.  Ms Kenny talked about someone being referred to her by the public health nurse and Ms Kenny stating there are possibly other things going on here and she cannot deal with it.  It is easy to talk about the person having a condition.  In many cases, the person might have symptoms on foot of which he or she needs interventions but that is very different from knowing what are the root cause or causes.  What is the impact?  How is that dealt with?  When we talk about early intervention, there is this idea that it is a matter of whether one can get in to see the speech and language therapist, then it takes time to go and be seen again, and the children have gone through two or three pairs of shoes in the meantime.  How does the operation of the Act deal with the greater complexity in getting from symptom or symptoms to a diagnosis?  I suppose what I am getting at is often one needs to intervene before one has the final diagnosis.  Is that an impediment or how do they work around that?<\/p> <p>  The final little cluster of questions I have relates to what the witnesses stated on a number of occasions about restructuring.  I want to use the words \"culture\", \"approach\" or \"attitude\" in the same discussion.  Are there different areas in the HSE where maybe the same resource gets worked better?  Clearly, I started off with issues about resourcing but I suppose I am suggesting that is not everything.  It is about how one harvests and uses the resources.  Are there places that are better able to get product from those resources, by which I mean better support the children and their families?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#K00200","speaker":"1419"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539763200,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I will start with the resources and how that links in to where things are working.

We are relying on anecdotal evidence because we do not have an audit of what is working well around the country.  It would be useful to conduct such an audit.<\/p> <p>  In terms of whether one is going into work crossing one's figures hoping nobody will leave today, our managers conduct workforce planning as much as they can within their services.

There are staff one might be looking at who one knows will be going when the right opportunity arises.  No matter how much one might be supporting them and they might enjoy working in an area, they are obviously looking for that next step.

Depending on how services are set up, that child may get some intervention at primary care level while he or she is on another waiting list.  However, if one has cancer, one wants to be seen in a specialist cancer centre.  It is not desirable to have a GP manage those symptoms.  We can manage those symptoms to a certain level and give the child's family some ideas and strategies.  However the long-term management of the needs of that child and family needs to be done in a specialist centre where a team works together, as opposed to one clinician offering the family some supports.

It is a dynamic process, working with people around their communication and language development, especially around their social and communication skills.  For example, a lot of discussion during the earlier session concerned ASD.  A cohort of experts analogous to a cancer expert, as Ms Kenny put it, does exist, but the wait times for their services are long.<\/p> <p>  The Disability Act 2005 created a mechanism to capture the need that was not there previously, the legal right to an AON.  However, my understanding is that it was designed for complex disability, with the non-complex cases to be managed within primary care.  Our models for intervention have evolved, developing a social strength-based aspect.  We are always working towards people's strengths and their ability to achieve, not their impairments or their disability.

I have a couple of questions.  The witnesses made reference to collating data but collecting data is equally important.  To what extent have they been in a position to collect as much data as possible, as quickly as possible?  The collation comes after that, but the collection is obviously the first part of it.<\/p> <p>  Has the IASLT had competition from overseas for the skills set within the sector?  Most other sectors have had challenges from overseas and difficulty in retaining staff.  I would like the witnesses to comment on that. <\/p> <p>  Waiting times seem to be a problem everywhere.  Is this entirely due to a shortage of staff?  Are there other issues?  Is it a shortage of staff plus appropriate skills, or a combination of all of those?  <\/p> <p>  I had occasion in the past to visit other countries where different treatments are available.  In the old days, oddly enough, Hungary developed a particular set of skills and treatments that seemed to be better or had more effect than what was available in this country.  In some cases they had a dramatic effect.  I would like a comment on that.<\/p> <p>  I have recently been dealing with the case of a child with ASD who has been receiving home tuition, having previously been in a special class.  When moved to home tuition, the child improved dramatically.  The child's condition worsened in the special class, apparently because of having to compete with the surroundings.  There had not been the same level of individual attention one would expect from home tuition.  I would like the witnesses to comment on that.<\/p> <p>  Reference has been made to a report that is on the shelves of the HSE.  How long has it been there?  When is it likely to be published?  There is not much sense in issuing reports.  The world is great at issuing reports.  All Departments are good at reports, but after that nothing happens.  The first thing that has to happen is that a report must be published.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#L01400","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539763200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I will start with the first two queries and return to structure and workforce planning.  In regard to collating data and drilling down into it, IASLT is not privy to its own specific data.  The recommendation is to form a clear understanding of where the health and social care professionals are currently situated in the HSE and in the sections 38 and 39 organisations.  It is desirable to map that to ensure disability teams are set up on the basis of best model practices.  As we mentioned, the national model of care for paediatric healthcare services in Ireland recommends a ratio of 1.5 speech therapists per 100 children with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  As I said in reply to Deputy O'Reilly earlier, the need for project management to implement that change must be examined.  It is important to set up systems that can measure our effectiveness and link with Irish universities to deliver training and programmes that are evidence-based and play to people's strengths.  That is what we need to allow people to live life to the full based on their ability in the spirit of the UNCRPD.<\/p><p> In terms of challenges for overseas, during the crash a number of Irish clinicians emigrated, particularly to the UK, Australia and New Zealand.  We were privy to that as they wrote to us seeking letters proving their membership of their professional body.  While I do not have figures with me, I believe the numbers emigrating have decreased considerably in the past two or three years and Irish graduates are finding employment within Ireland.  <\/p><p> In terms of the personal example the Deputy gave of a little boy with autism moving from a special class in a school to home tuition, there could be many reasons for that.  Again, without assessment or making choices or a long-term plan for what that child needs both at home and in school, it is difficult to say why the family felt that was particularly successful.  Certainly, in my clinical experience, I have found that setting up structures is extremely important.  This means setting up a team, drawing up an education plan and a home plan to ensure the steps are in place to support the child at home, at school, in the community, at the swimming pool and at the airport.  Again, I am giving an answer in the broader sense and I apologise for being unable to answer the question specifically.<\/p><p> On ways of working and the shortage of staff, I ask Ms Kenny to address our current numbers in workforce planning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#L01500","nonspeaker":"Ms Vickie Kirkpatrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539763200,"counter":108,"content":"<p>On the question of staff shortages versus skills shortages, it is probably a little bit of both.  In addition to the time needed to recruit, we also have a number of staff on maternity leave, parental leave and sick leave.  In many cases, these staff are not covered or may only be covered for a short period.  When covered is provided, it is done by agency staff who would not be familiar with the area, the team or the children.  While this cover is of some benefit, these staff need significant upskilling.  When the team gets new permanent staff we upskill them as quickly as possible.  Most areas have induction and supervision processes in place to provide this for new staff.  In some areas the ratio of senior staff to staff grade employees across the health and social care professional, HSCP, structure is such the number of senior staff available to support these processes is limited.  Senior staff generally have more experience and clinical skills whereas someone at staff grade could be a new graduate therapist.  We have a supervision structure between senior staff and staff grade therapists across most of the HSCP structure.<\/p> <p>  The report I was referencing is a primary care speech and language therapy review.  I understand it was completed in June 2017.  Again, the IASLT was not involved in it.  The HSE requested speech and language therapists in its organisation to examine this so we do not know what is in the report either.  We know that the people who were involved in writing the report also want it to be published in order that we can look at it as a profession and see how we can make changes.  That is at the level of primary care, which will obviously influence children who are accessing disability services.

In some areas a child will be seen for assessment within four months.  In the majority of areas, the aim is to see children within 52 weeks.  It takes longer than that in a small percentage of areas.  In one area, people will wait three or four months, while in another area people will wait for a year.  After that assessment, if a child requires therapy it again depends on geography.  In one area, the intervention may take place within six weeks of the assessment, while the waiting time may differ in another area.  The health statistics show that more than 90% of children are seen for their first therapy session within 52 weeks but approximately 10% of referrals are waiting longer than that, including some who are waiting for up to two years.  Again, that intervention depends on where one lives.<\/p> <p>  The way speech and language therapists often work with families on these types of difficulties means that it is not a matter of a one-off intervention.  It is not the case that a child comes once, we give the answer, and we never have to see the child again.  Some of these children are coming for long periods of time.  The way the system and the waiting list operate means that, in those areas where resources are stretched, a child might wait 12 months for assessment, a further 12 months for therapy and then he or she might only get six or eight sessions.  The child then goes back on the waiting list for another year.  It is very much based on geography.  In some areas, a child will be seen very quickly, whereas a child living elsewhere may wait much longer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#M00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Geographically, which areas are doing well and which are doing poorly?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#M01000","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539763200,"counter":114,"content":"<p>From the most recent statistics, I understand community healthcare organisation, CHO, area 6 is doing well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#M01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":115,"content":"<p>Could Ms Kenny say that again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2018101700002#M01200","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539763200,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I do not have the figures with me but I know that CHO area 6 is one that is doing well.

It is not that it is difficult to hire staff.  Posts can be filled when they become vacant but part of the problem is the length of time that takes.  Another issue is staff taking different types of leave and that leave not being covered.  In areas where there are very established staff who are not going anywhere, one tends to have more maternity leave, parental leave and sick leave.

The easier it is to access services, the more people will start recognising that they are having difficulties.  There is a proposed model in this report to change the way we work to meet the needs of more children.  A recent schools project initiative created some extra posts for speech and language therapists and occupational therapists to determine if working in schools is more effective.  In some of the very disadvantaged areas of Dublin, for example, greater numbers of children are presenting with communication difficulties compared with their peers in other areas because they have not had the same opportunities.  The project is looking at whether therapists working in schools and training up teachers and parents will improve outcomes and is also looking at how that will fit with primary care services.  We recognise that we could do more at a universal and targeted level and this project is looking at whether changing the way we work will be beneficial.

In terms of disability services waiting lists, there are 1,700 people waiting for assessments of need in Cork and Kerry but there was a reluctance to hire people because the proposed restructuring of the health service meant that the HSE did not know where they would be located.

From a practical point of view, without real planning we will just create a bubble elsewhere in the system.  Telling people they have a disability without the dynamic assessment we spoke about earlier and without planning for intervention means they will just sit somewhere else, so to speak, and then we will run the risk of privatisation of interventions.

I apologise for missing some of the meeting.  I was in the Seanad dealing with the availability of therapeutic services for children with autism in a school.  The Minister for Health had come to the House to deal with the queries I had on the matter.  One of the responses he gave me was that a review is being carried out that is supposed to be delivered in the second quarter of 2019.  Is the IASLT involved in looking at each area?  They witnesses may have dealt with this question, and if so, that is fine.  I will go back over the transcript.  I imagine that in each HSE area the ratio of speech and language therapists per head of population is the same.  Has the southern region been looked at in this regard?  Are the numbers far lower in real terms compared with other areas?  The Minister has announced that more than 100 speech and language therapists are to be employed.  We need to prioritise where they should go.  Has the IASLT been involved in any discussions on this issue?<\/p> <p>  A major concern I have with the HSE is that it has taken on an additional 12,000 people since December 2014, which is greater than the entire workforce of the Irish Army.  I wonder about value for money.  For argument's sake, we may have an area with a higher ratio of speech and language therapists than other areas but a longer waiting list.  Has any examination of this been done with regard to whether there is a particular way the service is being organised that leads to the delays being caused?  I came across an issue in dermatology where one particular area had many more specialists than other areas but the number of cases they were dealing with was less than 50% of what was being dealt with in another area that had fewer specialists.<\/p><p>That is one issue that needs to be examined.  If we employ additional speech and language therapists, what level of backup facility and ancillary staff supports would need to be put in place?  It is like appointing a medical consultant to a hospital but not providing additional beds, nurses or accommodation to carry out a clinic to ensure he or she can do his or her job.  Has this been examined when dealing with the HSE or the Department?  One can have a therapist appointed but there might not be facilities to carry out the work and or the support staff to arrange simple things like appointments.

The provision also keeps options open for the type of structure that may be required for a body to carry out philanthropy for Children's Health Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Under amendment No. 4, the provision allowing the new body to borrow for current as well as capital purposes is considered useful but as members can see from the Bill it is strictly controlled.  The ability of service providers to respond to strategic investment opportunities in the public interest within legal control limits must be seen to be a progressive step in managing hospital facilities into the future.  I understand there may be a concern that the retention of this provision will allow this and other Governments to under-fund the hospital and exploit the provision by instructing the new body to borrow money for the purposes of providing health care services.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The new body will be funded by the State as a section 38 agency as the three children's hospitals currently are through a service level agreement reached with the HSE.  The primary driver for a service provider to borrow is to drive better value in services provided to patient in a cost effective and timely manner.  This provision allows the board to respond to strategic opportunities or needs as they arise.  Borrowing for current purposes could be considered in scenarios where the hospital cannot generate sufficient internal funding resources in the short term to develop a service but is able to demonstrate longer-term viability and an ability to repay.  The ability to borrow within controls creates this opportunity.  Circumstances in which the new children's hospital would make a case to borrow money or engage in activities that have an element of borrowing could also arise in regard to leasing or licensing of commercial areas or leasing of equipment.  This could also encompass investment in a strategic service initiative or expanding operational capacity in a service that has hospital income generating potential such as attracting international patients to avail of cutting edge high technology services or the specialist paediatric expertise and experience that will available in the new hospital.  There is also the need to consider possible scenarios whereby the new body could require the potential to borrow to invest in extending existing services further in order to generate hospital income by providing cross-jurisdictional services for example for children from Northern Ireland as part of an accountability framework.  Such scenarios would be subject to approval of a business case, demonstrating return on investment with the potential to repay borrowings and generate hospital income.  The Bill allows for proper and fully accountable governance and management within the framework of national policy.  It is acknowledged that since the new body will be largely funded by the State, its borrowing would form part of the overall public debt of the State, as assessed by the EU and other bodies and the State must exercise control before such liabilities are undertaken.  The Bill therefore includes a provision for borrowing subject to the approval of the HSE, Minister and approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Finance.  It is therefore considered appropriate to provide for the potential to borrow in the Bill.  Accordingly I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 3 and 4. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018101700003#B01700","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1539774000,"counter":181,"content":"<p>The Minister refers to the current children's hospitals and the fact that they operate as section 38 agencies.

It relates to the appointment process of board members to the board of Children's Health Ireland.  As provided for in the Bill, all members will be appointed by the Minister.<\/p><p>Section 13 refers to membership of the board on establishment day - the first board.  The Bill has been drafted so that the existing Children's Hospital Group board, a non-statutory administrative board first established in 2013, will become the first board of Children's Health Ireland.  This board comprises persons who were either appointed or reappointed in summer 2017.  This is a competency-based board and includes some members of the boards of the three children's hospitals, a member from Northern Ireland and a member with international expertise.  The board is currently overseeing the complex integration of the three hospitals and transition of existing services into one single body.  Retaining that membership will allow the board to maintain continuity, and ensures that the first board will have the required competencies to undertake the leadership role required over the next few years.  <\/p><p>It is possible that the proposed amendment is intended to ensure that all boards, and not solely the first board, are appointed under the mechanism outlined therein. <\/p><p>The Bill provides that all board members be appointed by the Minister for Health and, in the interests of securing the necessary skills and experience on the board, board members will be appointed on the basis of competencies, experience or expertise deemed relevant to the body's functions.  While all are to be appointed by the Minister, the Bill provides that the board of the new entity will nominate eight out of the 12 board members.  In drafting this legislation, we have been conscious of the need to achieve the integration of the three hospitals in a way that respects the values and cultures of each.  One such example is the arrangements for appointing board members.  Accordingly, the Bill provides for a role for the board in the appointment of board members, as is currently the case in the children's hospitals.  <\/p><p>The integration of the three children's hospitals into one new entity is a major change programme, with significant cultural and operational factors.  The three children's hospitals coming together have been at the forefront of paediatric healthcare.  Each has demonstrated enormous commitment to, and has established a strong track record and a proud tradition in the provision of, healthcare services to children and young people in Ireland.  The three hospitals are key stakeholders in this project, and their agreement and support are fundamental to a successful transition. <\/p><p>Looking at the meaning behind the amendments, I am at one with the Deputy that it is important that the board would be cognisant in its work of the needs of its staff and its patients.  The Bill provides for the body to be given broadly-worded functions in such a way that provides clarity, authority and certainty in its key roles.  One such role is the nurturing and development of staff.  Section 6(2)(<i>d<\/i>) requires the new body to &quot;facilitate, foster and promote, through education and other programmes, the personal and professional development of its employees...&quot;.  <\/p><p>The new children's hospital is the largest and most complex healthcare project undertaken in Ireland to date.  It is recognised that staff may be unsettled by changes to operating and service models and the location of their work and staff well-being is a key consideration during the transition phase and beyond.  In parallel with the capital project, the Children's Hospital Group has a comprehensive integration programme under way supporting staff in the transition and integration of the three existing hospitals.  Work includes to develop and deliver the employee engagement strategy and plan, define a list of representative bodies that will need to be engaged with or consulted and define and document the strategy and plan for this process and develop and deliver the change and people management strategy <\/p><p>Section 6 relates to object and functions of the new body.  Its functions include that it will provide for patient safety and quality of patient care and &quot;promote excellence in the practice and provision of paediatric services&quot;.  The new body is also required to &quot;advocate on behalf of children and young people about healthcare issues&quot;.  It is clear from this that the focus of the new body is on the care of its patients, ensuring that the clinical operation of the hospital is driven by the objective of improving, promoting and protecting the well-being of children.  This will be a function of the entire board and not the remit of one particular board member. <\/p><p>Regarding the appointment of a Dublin city councillor, as Children's Health Ireland is the single national tertiary hospital for the country and a specialist service provider for children from all over Ireland, it would not be appropriate for local councillors to be represented on the board. <\/p> <p> There are other ways to ensure that local representatives can contribute.  As Deputies may be aware, in 2016, the new children's hospital project monitoring committee was formed as a communications channel between the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and local residents and representatives on the construction of the new children's hospital.  Members of the committee include representatives from Dublin City Council, the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, councillors and nominated local residents.  The objective of the committee is to develop a process for communication and dialogue to address residents' concerns and issues during the construction phase.

I look forward to an ongoing positive and constructive engagement between the committee and the LDA.  I will briefly outline the LDA's strategic objectives and how we plan to make a lasting positive change to how we use land in Ireland, both State-owned and privately held land, and improve and stabilise housing supply over the long term.  I will then update the committee on some of the initial progress made by the LDA since its inception one month ago.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the LDA's objectives, its mandate is to expedite the delivery, with a focus on housing, of land that could and should be developed or redeveloped, be it State-owned or privately owned.  We will do this in two ways: by optimising how we use lands in the control of the State sector, with a focus on housing supply; and by opening up large-scale strategic landbanks, including privately held land, to ensure faster and better co-ordinated delivery of land and homes in the future.  These two objectives are interrelated.  The State may have land interests that are large-scale and strategic in their own right or that may form a part of a larger strategic area.  However, it is important to state that we are not limiting our focus to where the State has land interests.  We are also examining the potential to unlock delivery on wholly privately held areas that could be developed or redeveloped but where nothing is happening currently.<br\/><br\/>Both objectives will not be delivered unless the LDA focuses clearly on implementation.  Although the LDA was only launched last month, we have already commenced significant work programmes to put in place the platform to achieve our goals.  To make progress towards our first objective, that of optimising the use of State lands, the LDA, supported by the Departments of the Taoiseach and Housing, Planning and Local Government, has begun to identify development opportunities following meetings with a number of State and semi-State bodies.  From the initial trawl, the LDA has secured access to a portfolio of eight State-owned sites, which will yield approximately 3,000 homes.  Preparatory and feasibility work on these eight sites will start imminently.  These engagements are ongoing though and we are seeking to supplement the initial portfolio with additional sites and are in active discussions with various State bodies to achieve this.<br\/><br\/>While State bodies must consider their own legitimate operations in identifying what land they have that can be used for housing, I have been encouraged by their constructive approach and acceptance of the need for the public sector as a whole to help address Ireland's housing challenges.  It is important to note that, where another State body or agency is already advancing delivery on sites, the LDA will not seek to add complexity by becoming involved unless we can demonstrate that we can add value.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the second objective of opening up large-scale strategic landbanks, the agency is focused on identifying privately held lands that could be developed or repurposed for more suitable uses, including housing.  It will consider areas of near-term potential, but also growth areas for the future, especially where transport infrastructure is planned or already in place.  Some areas, even where earmarked or zoned for development, take too long for housing to be delivered on them.  To remedy this situation, a structured framework to drive delivery, backed by legislative authority, is needed.  I will expand on this in a moment.<br\/><br\/>Combining these two strategic objectives, we can fundamentally change for the better how we approach land use in Ireland.  Previously, intervention by the State was largely in the form of granting zoning and planning permission.  With the creation of the LDA, we are taking a step further by playing a key role in driving the delivery of these permissions.<br\/><br\/>I will turn to the initial progress that the LDA has made one month out from its establishment and the concrete work we are doing in the short term to maximise the impact that we can make over the long term.  Among the key work programmes we have started are creating a comprehensive database of State lands; identifying eight first-phase sites for 3,000 homes; identifying ways to improve housing affordability; making the LDA fit for purpose right from the start with a best-in-class governance, corporate structure and delivery platform; and facilitating the necessary legislation to underpin the LDA's work.<br\/><br\/>Concerning the State lands database, for us collectively to understand what the delivery potential is from State lands, the agency needs to scope fully what land is in the State's ownership, where it is located and what is its development potential.  In this respect, we have commenced work on assembling data for a complete, accurate and functional State lands database.  All Departments and State bodies are scheduled to provide information on lands within their control or ownership by the end of the month.  The agency will then collect this information, collate it and make it publicly available.  Alongside other data sources from within the State sector, the database will help us assess the delivery potential of the State's landbank.  It will also highlight relocation opportunities for non-housing uses.  For the first time, we will be able to take a single view of State lands and make plans in an holistic manner rather than on a body-specific basis.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the eight sites that I mentioned, these are at various stages of readiness and complexity but share the common feature of either not being currently used for the existing operations of the landowner or, where they are being used, advanced plans being in place to relocate those operations.  From a transactional perspective, the LDA has a number of options to access these sites, including acquiring the sites or acting on behalf of the landowning body to deliver them.  The agency has already prepared its procurement documents for professional services necessary on these initial sites, including surveying, architectural and feasibility work.  As a result, we can expect real work to commence on these sites in the short term.  That said, none of the sites currently has a usable planning permission in place.  That is why the LDA exists.  The lead times and work necessary to make a site construction-ready are well understood, but even allowing for this, we expect construction to start on the first site in 2019 and the first new homes to be delivered in 2020.<br\/><br\/>Moving to improving housing affordability, the LDA generally intends to drive this by increasing the supply of land that is available for development, providing visibility and transparency in the land market.  This will help counter Ireland's boom-bust cycle in land prices, which in turn determine housing affordability.  Land in some areas is priced very highly today, contributing towards the high rents we are experiencing, especially in the main urban areas.  The LDA will also contribute to housing affordability in a more direct way.  All of the sites in the initial portfolio, being State lands, will require the delivery of at least 40% social and affordable homes in line with the Government's policy in respect of State lands.  In some cases, the level of social and affordable homes delivered from this portfolio will be even higher than 40%.  Some of the landowners with a housing delivery mandate, such as the Housing Agency, may require higher levels of affordable housing provision on their sites that the LDA will assume control of.  Regarding non-State lands, the LDA may seek opportunities for providing affordable homes additional to the standard 10% social housing as a negotiated <i>quid pro quo<\/i>for facilitating development in certain areas.<br\/><br\/>What is clear is that the LDA will be delivering a significant number of affordable homes.  That is why we are working with various parties, including the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, to assist new housing tenures, such as cost-rental.  The LDA can play a major role in the establishment of this form of housing provision as a permanent structural bridge of the gap between social housing and the private housing market.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the LDA's governance and operations, work is under way on the recruitment of a board of directors.  This will enable the LDA to put in place a governance structure to ensure transparency and oversight.  The governance structure will also give effect to the LDA's initial preparatory work, which will enable it to enter into contracts, procure services and accept funding.  A draft business plan, in conjunction with other important administrative work, has been prepared for the board's consideration when it is in place.  This is an essential step in getting the LDA's operational capacity up to speed.  Once constituted, the board will agree the LDA's recruitment needs.  At this stage, we envisage building a team of 20 to 25 professionals over the next 12 months with the experience and skills required to achieve the agency's objectives.<br\/><br\/>It is important to state that the LDA's functions and powers will derive from legislation enacted by the Oireachtas.  One of the LDA's strategic objectives is to assemble and open up large-scale areas for delivery, both State-owned and in private hands.  A legislative framework to target these areas and help induce delivery on them in a structured manner will be critical for the LDA.  We have gone some of the way towards this in the past by designating strategic development zones, SDZs.  However, there is now a need to extend beyond planning and into the initiation of delivery in those areas.  While it is too early to say exactly what form this framework will take, given that it will require significant legislative support, there is real substance behind it.  Intensive work is under way between the LDA, the Attorney General's office and various Departments focused on designing the necessary measures to ensure that development happens in future in a timely and structured way.  This part of the LDA's strategy is about removing blockages from the delivery system.  In this respect and more generally, co-ordination and collaboration with our partners in the local authorities will be essential.  We are encouraged by the success of similar measures in other jurisdictions, such as Germany and the Netherlands.<br\/><br\/>I hope this statement provides the committee with an overview of the LDA's objectives and the steps it is already taking towards delivering them one month into its existence.<\/p><p>I assure the committee that my team and I are fully aware of the urgency attached to improving the supply of new housing and the importance of the LDA acting quickly, decisively and effectively in discharging any mandate given to it by the Oireachtas.  We have the shared aim of delivering more homes faster and ceasing our damaging propensity towards boom and bust cycles of housing delivery, which is why I look forward to working closely with the committee and supporting the vital role it will play in progressing the legislation needed to make the agency a success.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Coleman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Coleman.

As Mr. Coleman stated, given the high degree of importance placed by Government and the Department on the work of the Land Development Agency and the need to progress its legislative and operational underpinnings, there is much to be gained in shaping those underpinnings through effective and practical engagement with the committee as we develop that framework.<\/p> <p>  There are three main areas I would like to cover in my opening remarks.  The first is the policy grounding for the LDA, which goes to the heart of the national planning framework, NPF, Project Ireland 2040 and previous work by this committee in examining the framework at its formative stages.  The second is the details and timescale for the legislative programme being progressed by the Department to put the LDA on a full primary legislative footing.  Finally, I will also discuss some of the interim funding arrangements that have been put in place to enable the LDA to function in the context of budget 2018.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Coleman referred to the policy basis for the LDA, and I think everybody in this room would agree with the broad consensus that spatial planning policies which are aimed at ensuring that the right forms of development happen at the right time, in the right sequence and, most critically, at the right locations - all in a manner that is economical to those who require such development, whether for housing or other purposes - will not happen without a more proactive role by the State in land management terms.<\/p> <p>  From the Kenny report of 1973 to the National Economic and Social Council&rsquo;s report on land of last March, to international experience in other jurisdictions to which Mr. Cussen alluded, there is a consensus that proactive management of the supply of land for development, and redevelopment for that matter, is required if strategic public policy aims are to be met in areas like sustainable urban development and housing supply.  For these reasons and to progress objectives in sustainable urban development, particularly national brownfield development targets, the Government&rsquo;s national planning framework, which was published earlier this year with the national development plan under Project Ireland 2040, committed to the establishment of what was then titled a \"national regeneration and development agency&rdquo;.<\/p> <p>  Under the NPF, national policy objective 66 provides that a \"more effective strategic and centrally managed approach will be taken to realise the development potential of the overall portfolio of state owned and\/or influenced lands in the five main cities ... other major urban areas and in rural towns and villages as a priority, particularly through the establishment of a National Regeneration and Development Agency.\"  The Government&rsquo;s establishment of the LDA on 13 September 2018 is a key implementation step, therefore, for the NPF&rsquo;s policies in this regard.<\/p> <p>  The LDA will act as a key new Government instrument and, in line with its mandate, as a national centre of expertise, working with and supporting local authorities, public bodies and other interests to harness public lands as catalysts for regeneration and wider investment and, critically, to achieve compact, sustainable urban growth, with a particular emphasis on complex regeneration projects and the provision of social and affordable housing.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. Coleman outlined, the two primary objectives of the LDA are to ensure the optimal usage of State lands, co-ordinating their regeneration and development and opening up key sites not being optimally used, especially for the delivery of homes; and to drive strategic land assembly through mechanisms that will bring together both public and private sector interests in ensuring the timely preparation and release of strategic land for development in a counter-cyclical manner, stabilising the tendency towards volatility in development land values and securing more of the increase in such values as a result of the planning and infrastructure investment processes for the common good, thereby driving increased affordability through better and more cost-competitive land availability.<\/p> <p>  While the LDA has been initially established by way of an establishment order under the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act 1971, the Department recognises that the LDA requires a primary legislative footing.  To this end, primary legislation for the LDA is being drafted with a view to preparing a general scheme of the Bill to go to Government in November.  It is envisaged that pre-legislative scrutiny with this committee will be conducted in December, and we will be in contact with the committee shortly to work through some of the logistics of that.  I appreciate the views of the committee in that regard.  Taking account of such scrutiny, as well as the complex work required to draft the Bill, the intention is that, subject to the Government&rsquo;s approval, the Bill will be published in the first quarter of 2019, with a view to it being progressed through the Houses of the Oireachtas and enacted by the summer recess at the latest.<\/p> <p>  It is important that the LDA has funds to operate effectively in this interim and start-up phase.  In current expenditure, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has provided up to &euro;2 million in current funding from within the Department&rsquo;s existing 2018 budget provisions to support the agency&rsquo;s initial start-up administrative and operational costs, and a further provision of &euro;3.5 million is being provided in the budget from the Department&rsquo;s Vote.<\/p> <p>  On the capital expenditure side, an allocation of &euro;16.5 million will be made available to the LDA from the 2019 urban regeneration and development fund on an interim basis pending finalisation of future capitalisation that will be underpinned by primary legislation.  In that regard, the Government has approved future capitalisation of the LDA through a combination of transfers from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund in the form of subscription of share capital by the Minister for Finance and private finance of up to &euro;1.25 billion.  Capital funding will be used to fund feasibility appraisal, master-planning, infrastructure provision and, if required, development of sites, as well as strategic land acquisition as may be required in the circumstances.<\/p> <p>  In conclusion, the work under way in preparing a legislative footing for the LDA is a major priority item in the Department&rsquo;s work and legislative programme.  The Department strongly believes the LDA can and will make a major and strategic contribution to addressing structural gaps in Ireland&rsquo;s planning and development process, with a particular emphasis on proactive management of both the State&rsquo;s development landbank and the wider functioning of the land supply process as well.  The Department looks forward to further engagement with this committee in ensuring that the LDA is as effective as we all believe it needs to be in addressing the policy issues I have outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen"},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I must attend a conference later and I apologise if I have to leave soon.  I welcome Mr. Coleman and Mr. Cussen.  I favour and support the concept and actions they will take.  It is extremely important that there is a dynamically led organisation to gather all the State's lands and drive the developments that are needed where they are needed.<\/p> <p>  Communities need a mix of housing.  Notwithstanding that the Land Development Agency has been given a brief in the context of providing a certain proportion of social and affordable housing, we need to go much further than that.  This is probably a debate for the legislation rather than this meeting, but we must identify the acute needs that are there now, namely, homelessness and affordable and social housing.  I am unclear as to whether the agency has a brief on co-operative housing, which would also be extremely important.<\/p> <p>  The key to it all of this is proper planning.  In the city of Dublin, young people are being driven from the capital because they cannot afford the rents.  Even people with good jobs cannot live in the city.  What is the future for a young family with two or three children?  Where is the affordable housing for them?  How will our cities change?  Will Dublin be a city where only those who are extremely well paid live?  Will it be somewhere without a dynamic social mix, in other words communities of all ages, types and mixes living together?  The agency's planning is crucial.  It is not just about assembling the site.  Rather, it must also examine the location of sites, what the needs are, what the demographic pressures are and how many families with young children, older people and homeless persons live in the area in order that there can be an integrated, balanced, properly dynamic focus in this agency.  This is a great opportunity for us to get it right, but we can also get it very wrong.<\/p><p>I welcome the funding Mr. Cussen spoke about.  It is vital that the LDA will have sufficient money to go ahead with projects.  I am very concerned about that.  The interaction of the agency with the likes of Peter McVerry Trust, Threshold and so on is extremely important, as is networking by these bodies with the local authorities to get the outcome we all want.  Those are my concerns.<\/p><p> We must ensure our urban areas, in particular Dublin, develop into properly integrated, dynamic, modern cities in which the needs of residents are met.  That is my concern.  If we give 60% of these landbanks to developers to develop as they wish and keep the remaining 40%, developers should not decide what type of housing goes into a site.  Obviously, we need developers and we need to work with them.  I favour working with the private sector, but we must get this right.  These are State funds and money given by the taxpayer to the local authorities or State body initially.  We must ensure, therefore, that the outcomes are right for the people who need the housing.  I am very anxious about that.  I welcome the establishment of the agency, as I said, and I am not being in any way critical.<\/p><p> One of the key issues will be the transparency of the agency's decision-making, its interaction and the funding that will be provided for sites.  The last thing we want is a scandal about State lands worth millions being sold for thousands to fellas to make a quick buck.  This is the worry people have.  One of the issues with the agency is that I understand it has been set up as a commercial State agency, which means it is not accountable in the expenditure of its funds to the Oireachtas and will not be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is vital that we get that right as well.  I do not doubt the integrity of everyone concerned, but there must be accountability, transparency and value for money, and I will insist on this with my vote.  The problem is that deals done on a commercial basis are not subject to freedom of information requests.  I understand that applies right across the board with commercial issues.  There must be accountability.  How one defines that accountability is a matter for the legislation.  Would we be satisfied with an independent audit if the funding spent were to exceed, say, &euro;1 million?  How can accountability be worked into this process to give people confidence in everything the agency does?  I fully support the private sector and we need it, but we need to manage it.<\/p><p> I was involved in the creation of a wonderful body called Irish Water.  One of the first things Irish Water did was to disappear off the radar.  I must remind myself that I lived through this awful period and survived to sit in this Oireachtas as an elected representative.  I stood up for what I believed in and what was true.  Mr. Cussen will be aware of this because he works in the Department and knows what I think.  I want to ensure this agency does not fall into the same trap as Irish Water.  That trap is the use of consultants.  Once the agency is set up, it disappears, there is no accountability and it comes before the Oireachtas once a year.  Perhaps it is dragged in by Sinn F&eacute;in, the Workers' Party, People Before Profit or me.<\/p><p> Housing and homelessness is the biggest scandal facing society.  Now is the right time to settle up.  I feel very strongly about this.  I want to accountability and freedom of information to apply to this agency.  I would also like to see quarterly statutory reporting to the Oireachtas through the committee system.  We will keep an eye on what the agency is doing.  I believe it wants to do what we want it to do, namely, build the right type of housing in the correct mix.  Dublin is a huge pressure zone at present.  In 20 years' time we want to see families living in affordable housing in all areas.  There is no area in which there should not be social, affordable and co-operative housing.  We cannot allow the city to develop in such a way that those who have money own everything and those who want to work, live, and rear their families must live outside the city and have long commutes and a very poor quality of life.  I thank the Chairman for indulging me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#D00400","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":269,"content":"<p>We will hear from Mr. Coleman first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#E00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539763200,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his very interesting remarks, which resonate with us as we have been going through the process of setting up the Land Development Agency.  I will touch on a number of points the Deputy made about appropriate tenure mix and ensuring this is not done in a blanket manner and we put the right housing in the right locations for the people who require it.  In this respect we are very tightly aligned with planning policy driving the decision-making process.  We are also very close to the local authorities in working out the appropriate tenure mix for each site to ensure we are delivering the right kind of housing in these locations.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also pointed out that we need to ensure in our methodologies that we do not allow parts of State sites to be sold to developers and then lost because they have been flipped or something like that.  I will make a number of observations on this.  We share that concern, and one of the ways we will deal with it is through the transactional methods we will deploy when we deal with the sites under our remit.  Around the time of the launch of the LDA, there was a narrative that we would simply release sites to developers who could then do whatever they wanted with them.  This is not true.  Regarding our strategy in this respect, first, we are all about enabling developable sites, not just releasing any old sites onto the market irrespective of what stage it is at.  Second, it is a matter of ensuring that the sites will be developed.  Our intention is to do many of the activities that developers would traditionally have done.  This is where value is created in the process, through land assembly and achieving the right zoning, planning and tenure mix and then looking to see what our options are for delivery.  We will go a significant part of the way in determining what will be on these sites.  The second point I will make in this respect concerns the manner in which a site is released and how a partner is brought in if it is decided that the LDA will not take on the development itself, which is also possible.  We can cover off on ensuring that delivery happens on a site by being clever about how we transact.  This could include licensing or remaining involved in a joint venture, which would give the LDA some say in how and when the site is delivered in order that it is not just released to the developer to do whatever he or she wants with it.  We are very clear on this.<\/p> <p>  On the accountability and transparency side, we will be subject to the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  We regard the whole area of accountability as a critical part of the LDA's set-up.  For this reason, we will have a board, as well as oversight through committees, audit and risk and so on to ensure we are doing the right things.  I agree that regular interaction with Oireachtas committees is also very important.  We will be more than happy to engage constructively and enthusiastically with the various committees to ensure the correct oversight of the LDA.<\/p> <p>  I hope that touches on a few of the Deputy's points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Coleman"},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":271,"content":"<p>It does.

This is having a displacement effect to more outlying locations.  The national planning framework is very clear on its vision for our major urban areas into the future, which is to have people living, working and having all the various opportunities that should be available in our cities.  This is at the core of what the LDA is about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen"},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":275,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Dowd has 60 seconds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#E00800","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I appreciate that the Chairman has been very helpful to me in terms of time.<\/p> <p>  While I accept that is what Mr. Coleman might want to do in the context of the State bodies, it does not go far enough.<\/p><p>Currently I am fighting with a State body to get audit reports from them, which is an absolute sick joke.  It gave me pages of findings of internal audits with sections blacked out, which is entirely unacceptable.  The fact that I am seeking them as a Chairman of an Oireachtas committee, which I have to bring to the attention of my committee, is a disgrace as well.  We cannot have such a situation and I know that is not what Mr. Coleman wants.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding everything that Mr. Coleman has said, and using a friendly tone and not a hostile one, the freedom of information is hugely important in terms of accountability.  Mr. Coleman will have to find, in my view, a way of working the freedom of information, excluding the commercial sensitivities but with a completely independent audit so that we can get at the nub of the issue because that is where it is at.  I obviously do not doubt his intentions.  Mr. Coleman has put a lot of thought into his work but we need to put deeper thought into what he is doing.  Have international agencies taken on this role?  If so, then perhaps we can learn from them but I do not know the answer.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding all of the buzzwords of making sure that the council and everybody else is aligned, one needs a master plan in place before entering a site.  A master plan must be in black and white and based on the demographic needs or future demographic needs of the area.  One will have huge sites and huge resources.  One must identify employment needs, where people will work, how people will travel to and from locations, identify where schools, educational and recreational amenities will be located, and identify where older people will live.  These are the contexts for the huge decisions that Mr. Coleman must make.  I very much support what he is doing but he needs to put a lot more thought into it.<\/p><p> I have a question on the damned consultants.  The first thing Irish Water did was it disappeared out of my office.  I probably never saw them again for months but Irish Water sent people to my office to give me a load of whatever.  The facts were in the background, consultants were being hired and money was being spent but nobody was accountable or knew what was going on and we ended up in an awful absolute appalling mess.  I have no doubt that the witnesses do not want to do the same.  I know that people want to speak here but I ask the witnesses, in their replies, to outline how they will ensure the same thing does not happen.  Can they tell me today that they will be transparent about when consultants are used, and outline the accountability in terms of the consultants and their own accountability?<\/p><p> When Irish Water was established it was supposed to be an independent entity but the first thing it did was to link up all of its pay and pensions with another State organisation.  Straightaway, what was intended never happened, an agency became a place where people got paid, and I believe it was never intended that they should.  We need to know what the salary is going to be and all of those things.  All of that information must be placed in the public realm so that we will all support, agree, fight for and make sure that Mr. Coleman's agency succeeds.  That is the only way that this process will work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#E00900","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":278,"content":"<p>We will tease through a lot of those issues when we undertake pre-legislative scrutiny.

I apologise for being late but I did read the presentations before I came in.<\/p> <p>  I will make a general comment and will then ask a series of very specific questions to tease out the details.  As both of the witnesses will know, I am strongly in favour of a strategic land management agency.  I strongly favour the idea of having a central body that considers the totality of public land holdings, and that it has the power and funds to take them away from agencies where they are not strategically utilised to the best extent and transferred elsewhere.  That is the right thing to do.  I have no issue with that whatsoever.  If that was all that the witnesses were here to tell us about then I would be warmly welcoming it and indicating that we would assist them with the legislation.<\/p> <p>  My problem is twofold.  The first is that the agency would be involved in residential development.  The agency has yet to make the case as to why it is better placed to do that than local authorities if they were properly funded and if they had various restrictions lifted from then, which I shall come to in a second.  I also have to say that the tenure mix that the Mr. Coleman has proposed is not in line with either local requirements or housing need.  I have detailed direct involvement in one large joint venture and I have been keeping a very close eye on the other two.  My comments on the financing models and tenure mix is not borne out of some speculation.  I have spent two years tracking these ventures in my local authority area in Dublin city.  That is really where my strong concern is.<\/p> <p>  Can the witnesses tell us what additional powers they hope to get from the legislation?  Is it just the standard compulsory purchase order powers that local authorities already have or are they seeking something additional?  If so, can they detail that and explain how it differs from the powers that councils currently have?<\/p> <p>  Is it fair to say that the majority of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, will probably go into land acquisition and compensating CPO claims?  Do the witnesses have a sense of the breakdown in terms of site development and their own direct involved in the delivery of units as opposed to private sector financing for that and land acquisition?<\/p> <p>  In terms of units, can the witnesses confirm that where there are social units there will be additional money from the capital programme, for example, from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, to purchase those back as would be the case in the other joint ventures that are currently under way; and that the cost of the social unit would not be included in the costings and instead would be additional funding supplied by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government?<\/p> <p>  In terms of affordable units, can the witnesses clarify where there have been discussions about seeking access to, for example, the serviced sites fund?  Will the Rebuilding Ireland home loan facility be one of the primary mechanisms used to make the units affordable?  The witnesses in their presentations outlined the price range but did not tell us how people will access such units.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the sale of land, I have been very clear that there will be no land giveaway.  Land will be sold, if it is to be sold, to developers as part of joint ventures.  Will the land be sold at market rates?  Will there be a discount as a result of, for example, the site servicing costs and, therefore, could it be that the developer gets the land cheaper?  For the 60% of units in the overall target that would be sold at the open market price, is there not a discount even though the purchaser pays market value?  That market value might be less because the sites are serviced.  Can the witnesses confirm that all of the profit generated by the sale of open market priced units, if there are private developers in the context of a joint venture, will go to the private developer?<\/p> <p>  In terms of the social housing targets, for me this is the really incorrect bit of what the witnesses are doing.  Every time I see a reference to Part V in the literature I want to pull my hair out.  Part V applies to private land and private developments.  It does not apply and it is not a planning framework for public land.  I am in favour of mixed income and mixed tenure estates although I have a slightly different model to that of the Government.  I would like to hear the justification put forward by the witnesses for the 10% figure.  What it means is that on very large sites we will dramatically reduce the capacity of the State to deliver social housing.  I suspect the reason the social housing component has been reduced from its current rate of 30%, in the joint ventures in Dublin city and South Dublin County Council, down to 10%, has much more to do with the fact that the Department wants to use joint ventures to keep this off balance sheet to meet EU financing rules.  Therefore, the tenure mix is not about meeting needs but meeting a pre-prescribed set of financing commitments, which will limit the ability to meet the social housing need.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the social and affordable units, can the witnesses confirm that they are not in addition to the targets set out in the national development plan and Rebuilding Ireland?  Are they just within those targets?  If so, there is no additionality. <\/p> <p>  One of the things that concerns me is that people say local authorities cannot do this work and that is why we need a new agency.  One of the advantages that an agency has that local authorities do not have is that it will not have to comply, unless I am incorrect, with the very complex approval and tendering requirements laid down by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government or, for example, the very cumbersome value for money exercise that local authorities must currently comply with for projects worth over &euro;20 million, which we will hear about later.  I thought if local authorities were given those advantages and additional CPO powers then they could do everything that the agency can do.  I am interested in hearing the thoughts of Mr. Coleman on that matter.<\/p> <p>  I sat through and was very involved in the Kilcarbery joint venture.  One of the frustrations for elected members in the community was the competitive nature of bringing in the private consortium, resulting in elected members in the community having less involvement in the planning outline.  The managers are very involved in planning the scheme outline.  However, because it is a competitive process, it is secret and elected members of the community only know the outcome at the end.<\/p><p>That is a concern.  Are any of the existing sites local authority sites?  Is it intended to acquire local authority sites and, if so, why?  We hear a lot around the dogma of sustainable and mixed tenure communities.  Again, I am in favour of mixed income and mixed tenure communities, but can either of the witnesses point to a single piece of research that has been produced in an Irish context that supports sustainable and mixed tenure communities on the basis they have outlined, that of only a 10% social housing component?  I am asking that because there is a growing body of research that says if there is only 10% social housing it actually increases the sense of isolation of lower income families in communities.  What is the policy basis or evidence for the witnesses' commitment to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#F00300","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539763200,"counter":281,"content":"<p>There is a lot of questions there.  I will do my best to try to address them but we are at the very early stages of the drafting of the legislative programme so much of the function today is to listen, to take on board the points that have been made, and to take them back into the legislative process.  As the members can probably appreciate, some of the policy deliberations around the main legislative parameters for this legislation have not been finalised.  It is very important to have this sort of engagement in order to hear what issues the members of the committee feel are important for us to address.  I will try to answer and Mr. Coleman will come in on other points.<\/p> <p>  On the additional powers the agency would have over and above the situation as is in terms of local authorities, we are examining that currently.  The effectiveness of the compulsory purchase process is something we need to look at very carefully.  As the Deputy is probably aware, the Law Reform Commission has work ongoing around looking at compulsory purchase order legislation more generally.  It is very important that we harvest insights from that and see what we can deal with in the context of the Land Development Agency Bill.  It is also fair to say that, in terms of powers and so on, a very important function of the Land Development Agency, which is perhaps not getting enough priority or focus, is the job of building up a baseline understanding of who owns what in respect of the public sector.  There is no composite view of that currently, as the Deputy knows.  It is a very important baseline to have so that there can be a proper land management policy approach.<\/p> <p>  Something that flows from that is the ability of a land development agency to put the microscope over composite ownerships and to determine whether there is some sort of strategic approach that should be used to further development and to ask whether lands, even though they may have a perfectly valid operational function, are being used appropriately bearing in mind wider policy parameters, with which the Deputy would be well familiar.  We also need to consider how that interacts with the planning process while absolutely respecting that the members of the local authority are the ones who decide on development plans and policies and so on.  Activating that conversation on the configuration of the current development plan or how zonings and so on are working is the optimal approach, bearing in mind that there are significant strategic land assembly options available.<\/p> <p>  I will let Mr. Coleman come in on the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  Again, the commitment by the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and our own Minister in respect of the funding of the Land Development Agency is a visible commitment that we are not setting up a body that is not in funds and which does not have resources to deploy in the context of its work.  We are, however, at a very early stage in respect of the breakdown of how that would actually be deployed.  I suppose that goes back to the business plan.  Mr. Coleman will perhaps speak about that.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the units being delivered, the social and affordable units, and whether there will be additional money for the purchase of these, we have to go a step back and remember that through the work of the Land Development Agency, particularly in respect of getting access to lands that have hitherto been in the ownership of State bodies which have other priorities and so on, a new tranche of land is being opened up which is probably in the local authority development plan or has been zoned but on which nothing is happening.  The work of the land agency will relate to marrying up the making available of that land and the existing capital and current programmes for social and affordable housing delivery.  It is not a question of additional money being needed.  This is about ensuring that the money that has been reserved is deployed and can be spent and put to good use in respect of the Government and the interest of the taxpayer etc.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy made a very good point on the serviced site fund and the Rebuilding Ireland home loan.  He is absolutely correct.  These are mechanisms that can be deployed in the context of the work of the Land Development Agency.  I will let Mr. Coleman come in on the market rates, the land and the transactional aspects around that.  As we have stated very clearly, while there is obviously a minimum requirement for 10% social housing provision in the context of the provisions of Part V, that will not be a barrier to the Land Development Agency implementing the mandate given to it in terms of broader Government policy, but also in respect of the requirements of particular public landowners of sites that would be going to the Land Development Agency to be advanced for development.  A good example of that would be Housing Agency lands.  The vast bulk, if not all, of those lands would be developed for social and affordable purposes.  It is wrong to say that it is some sort of policy limit in terms of the level of social housing that will be provided on all the Land Development Agency sites.  It very much varies depending on the circumstances or provenance of those sites in terms of what they were purchased for in the first place and so on.<\/p> <p>  Related to the question about whether additional funds will be required to pay for the social units and so on which are coming forward, obviously the work of the Land Development Agency is being targeted at making additional progress in respect of the delivery of the housing targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland - the 30,000 to 35,000 units or more that we require.  We know that we are short in respect of the delivery of that right across the full continuum of housing solutions that we require.  Obviously the Land Development Agency will be an important delivery mechanism in achieving those targets, including the provision of additional social housing solutions and so on on lands that are currently off limits in the context of the work of the local authorities and the co-operative housing bodies that Deputy O'Dowd mentioned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cussen"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539763200,"counter":282,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the questions.  I will do my best to touch on some of the points on which Mr. Cussen prompted me.  I hope we are dealing comprehensively with the Deputy's queries.  In respect of the use of funds and what we are going to be using the money for, that is a very important question.  It is very important that the Land Development Agency will be capitalised.  Ultimately we are trying to make an impact on the land market and to make land available for supply.  From time to time that will involve certain actions which are capital intensive which could include, as the Deputy pointed out, compulsory purchase orders, which we may need to use as a last resort.  Overall we are looking to prioritise deployment of capital in our business plan.  We want maximum bang for buck in making land open and available for delivery.  That does not just involve buying land or anything like that, but improving it, servicing it and getting the right planning policy in place on that land.  That is ultimately where we are trying to get to.<\/p> <p>  We may need to spend money on compulsory purchase orders as I mentioned.  We may, in a countercyclical way, buy some land in order to build up some land that could be made open and available.  My view is that in many locations land is very highly valued currently.  It would not be a particularly good use of State funds to get into the land market in a big way right now.  We do not want to throw fuel on the fire of an already hot land market.  My view is that high land prices are really at the core of our problem currently.  If the Deputy looks at it and if we are agreed that restrictions or delays in bringing forward land cause a lack of it to be available, that causes high land values which feed into high housing costs and rents.  Our role is to take the pressure out of that system.  That is where we are looking to get maximum bang for our buck in terms of the funding that is being given.<\/p> <p>  How do we do that?  How do we bring forward land?  It could be by acquisition, as I mentioned, or by compulsory purchase order.  It could be by providing infrastructure, the lack of which can cause blockages for years, as the Deputy will know, in respect of some sites and even in respect of special development zones.  That must be done in a way in which the investment can be recouped and in which value is achieved for the State in terms of the money it spends in that respect.<\/p><p>If land that is currently unzoned is available at reasonable prices, in time it may be zoned in a very strategic way for the purposes of future infrastructure provision.  I refer to projects like MetroLink.  We will look at things like that.  We are looking for maximum impact.  We are going to be very judicious in the deployment of this option.<\/p><p> Our approach to the extraction of value from our dealings with private sector developers and contracting firms has always been to go up the development curve.  Developers do not just build houses on land.  During the development process, the creation of value and profit starts with a site that has no planning and no zoning.  That site is assembled and brought through the zoning, planning and servicing processes.  That is where the money is made in development.  That is what the LDA is going to try to do, for two reasons.  First, the agency will try to extract value for the State from the money that is spent on land.  Second, it will make sure each development is brought forward and delivered in a structured way so that it is not stymied by things like infrastructure and servicing.<\/p><p> We will deal with developers in a commercial way.  We will look to bring in covenants to make sure the land is delivered.  We might have time-bound delivery commitments and licensing requirements that will allow us to intervene if a site is not being delivered for a particular reason.  It is important that the State, through the LDA, can always control the tempo of delivery on each site.  We do not want to lose control of what is delivered on a site.  We will try to extract the best deal possible.  One of the ways to do that might be to stay in for some of the upside along the way.  It is hoped not only that this will be financially beneficial for the State, but also that it will help to ensure delivery.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked whether local authorities could be given the powers or abilities that are being given to the LDA.  If one examines what we intend to deal with, one will see that we will be looking at it with other State bodies in addition to local authorities.  Our initial portfolio mostly involves non-local authority land.  We see big opportunities across the State sector and into the private sector as well.  I think we will go further than local authority-owned land.  We may involve private land as well.  Given that land availability is at the core of the problem we have currently, it is important that there is an agency with a sole focus on making land available.  All we do is make sure there is a supply of land.  It is important that this is our dedicated focus.<\/p><p> It is important to note that in our interactions with local authorities, we are not seeking to add complexity or get in the way of what they are doing.  A great deal of good work is being done by local authorities.  We are not seeking to upset that.  We are looking to get involved where we can provide additionality.  The Dyke Road site in Galway is a good example of that.  We have asked the local authority in Galway whether there is anything we can do to assist and whether we can bring any additionality.  In that case, the council had a shortage of resources on the executive basis to bring a site like that through the planning process to delivery.  We have been asked to step in on a service provision basis in that case.  All we are doing is providing additionality.  We are not seeking to get in the way.  I hope I have touched on some of the Deputy's points.  I am happy to develop them further if he wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Coleman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I have a supplementary question.  Some of my questions were not answered, but I will come back to them in parliamentary questions.  The LDA's 10% social housing and 30% affordable housing targets are in the launch document and were mentioned in both of the presentations today.  It is all very well to say that those targets might be exceeded on certain sites, such as Housing Agency sites, but the model that has been proposed by the LDA is based on the controversial joint venture model and represents a poorer deal in terms of meeting social and affordable housing need.  Are the 10% and 30% targets based on what the LDA considers to be a commercially viable financing model that is aimed at attracting the private sector and keeping this off the balance sheet rather than meeting housing need?  I do not dispute what Mr. Coleman has said about strategic land management, but I will explain my problem with his response to my question about the residential end of the LDA's activities.  We have two choices.  We can pursue the model used in the case of Shanganagh Castle, which is a brilliant idea that essentially involves 100% public housing - a mix of social housing, affordable rental housing and affordable purchase - on a public site and will meet the needs of the local area.  The alternative is to pursue the LDA model, which is an even worse version of what we have just been through in the case of Kilcarbery in south Dublin.  In that case, a percentage of the land was made available for meeting social or affordable housing need and the rest was made available to meet private sector, open market price need.  That is not a strategic use of public land.  In my view, the LDA should add value by acquiring State lands from other public bodies and entering into joint ventures with local authorities to deliver the kinds of developments, like Shanganagh Castle, for which many of us have been arguing in our own local authorities.  I am talking about fully public, mixed-income, mixed-tenure estates.  Private developers are not needed in such cases.  I accept that local authorities use private builders.  All of this can be done in a way that maximises the output of social and affordable housing.  I have yet to hear Mr. Coleman or Mr. Cussen explain why the joint venture model makes any sense in the context of the 10% social housing and 30% affordable housing targets.  It adds complications and reduces the ability of the State to meet its social and affordable housing targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#H00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539763200,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I am glad to try to answer all the questions that have been asked.

There is no attempt to keep this off the balance sheet.  The LDA has a deliberate intention to stand on its own feet commercially outside the general Government sector.

The State absolutely has an obligation in respect of social and affordable housing.  It also has an obligation to ensure there is effective housing supply in all sectors of society.

There are people who are looking to buy or rent homes and have the economic conditions to do so.  That is good for them.  We have to provide housing for all sectors of society.  That is a fundamental tenet of Government policy.  It is important, in the context of ensuring there is a braided solution to meeting complex housing requirements across society, to appreciate that we cannot lock up public lands for one segment of society only.  As I have said, the 10% and 30% framework is not coming from some sort of economic or balance sheet perspective.  It is coming from the perspective of securing balanced mixed-tenure communities and so on.  I suppose it is very much a baseline objective.  The Deputy mentioned a particular initiative in a certain local authority area.  I think he will see many such projects advancing throughout the work of the LDA, particularly using Housing Agency lands but not necessarily restricted to them.

We do not want to lock up public lands only for one segment of society which, I suggest, is what is happening currently.  Let us look at the 60:30:10 mix of tenure.  The average market price in a private development in Dublin today is &euro;378,000.  The proposal before us is for 60% of public land to be used to facilitate private development with prices in that ballpark, varying from city to city.  Some 30% would be affordable.  There is ambiguity around the affordability scheme indicated by the Minister in the budget speech and we are hoping for more detail on that soon.  However, if one does the maths around what the Minister indicated in the Budget Statement, one is looking at an average of &euro;50,000 less than market price for \"affordable\".  That is &euro;378,000 minus &euro;50,000 in Dublin which means there are houses that could be in the scheme which cost over &euro;300,000.  The segment of society which cannot afford that, which does not only include young people coming out of college but also workers on the average wage, are effectively being locked out of the housing market.  The locked out generation is a term that I am hearing increasingly often.  According to the Central Statistics Office, the last census showed there are 500,000 young people living at home with their parents.  Sure, some of them want to be there but I suspect large numbers would far prefer to be buying, renting or living independently.  We do not want to lock up public lands for only one segment of society but that is precisely what is happening now: it is for people who have big money or are affluent, and the majority are locked out.  This is a tremendous opportunity to turn that on its head and reverse it.<\/p> <p>  Look at the amount of public lands in the State, even the land already zoned residential.  The housing analyst Mr. Mel Reynolds has indicated that between the public authorities and NAMA there is enough to build 114,000 public houses.  That would put one hell of a dent in the housing crisis if we said that public housing went on public lands, by which I refer to a mix of council housing and genuinely affordable housing that is not done through developers but through the State hiring builders and selling the houses at cost price or thereabouts.  A tremendous opportunity is there.  The concern is that the Land Development Agency's remit points in an opposite direction and what we are looking at is not something like the ESB or Aer Lingus, as the Taoiseach said, which are State companies that did the State some service, but a new agency which oversees privatisation of land on a large scale for houses mainly built at market rates and are therefore unaffordable, or houses built according to the Government's affordable housing scheme which are also unaffordable for many.  This is maintaining and copperfastening a position where large numbers of people are locked out of the housing market. <\/p> <p>  The Land Development Agency will assemble lands which are currently in State ownership, such as the health service, the ESB, Bord G&aacute;is Energy, but also acquire some lands from the private sector.  What is the mix likely to be?  Is it overwhelmingly lands that are currently in State ownership, which is what seems to be the case?  The intention is to release these lands for housing development, but what kind?  Is it the case, as it seems, that the majority will deal with developers for 60:30:10, mainly private market housing developments, or will there be a significant level of arrangements with local authorities, and if so how much, where they have a say in the use of those lands and can use it for genuinely social and affordable housing?  Unless that is the overwhelming thrust of this scheme, we are looking at privatisation on a large scale and a continuation of the majority being locked out of the housing market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#J00200","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":298,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Coleman like to respond first?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#J00300","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539763200,"counter":299,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the questions and appreciate his points.  When we look at how the Land Development Agency, LDA, can improve affordability, we must look at the bigger picture and the overarching reason for its establishment.  While it will deliver in the short term in specific sites, that is not why it has been set up.  I will refer to the tenure of the sites to which Deputy Barry referred.  The bigger picture is to look at why there is a lack of affordability, what is the core, base reason, and what is underlying it all.  The symptoms are a lack of affordability but we think one of the major core reasons is the lack of major deliverable development land being made available to the market, not only by the State but also private lands.  Back in 2008, land was effectively frozen for six to eight years after the crash, where it was tied- up in creditor processes and for other reasons.  Nothing was done with that land for long periods.  There was no planning work and no advancing of the land in infrastructure and so on because the money was not available or was tied up somehow.  It is not a coincidence that we have an affordability problem in Ireland now after land from all sectors was effectively locked up for six or seven years.  If one believes that and that it is a core factor in the problem we have today, then it follows that restrictions or delays in bringing forward land for delivery causes high land values.  It is undeniable that high land values then cause an increase in the cost of delivering a home or rent that is charged in housing that is built for rental.  The LDA's core objective is to tackle that central factor and make much more land available for delivery so that we do not have these boom-bust, very high or nil values for land that we have experienced in the past ten years which is central to our issue.  We will have a big structural involvement in the market.  It is not only what we deliver today or tomorrow in the tenure mix but it goes to the core of why we are suffering from this issue.  Ultimately, high land costs fall at the feet of the person who is buying or renting and that is what we seek to address.  That is the big picture for the LDA, which I cannot stress enough.<\/p> <p>  On privatisation, some private homes will be built but that has the effect of normal people buying houses on the open market as a result of them being developed.  They are going to be home owners.  The land effectively transfers through the development process to homeowners.  The privatisation is not to a faceless corporation or something, it is often people who want to own and buy their own house and it is a legitimate form of supply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Coleman"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539763200,"counter":300,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.

Once the State interacts with the private market we will be back to the problem we have with NAMA, in that it will have to negotiate with people whose interest in the process will be to make money.  The State will have to negotiate with them an arrangement, whereby they will make money from land that it is giving to them.  Mr. Coleman has mentioned that this land will be serviced.

If it actually delivers them, it will effectively account for all projected housing development.  The ESRI maintains that there is a need for approximately 35,000 units per year.  Thus, in the coming four years, to deliver on Rebuilding Ireland, everything will have to be social housing.  In reality, it will not because 100,000 units of the total to be delivered under Rebuilding Ireland will be accounted for under the housing assistance payment scheme.  In other words, we expect the private sector to deliver them.  We will then rent back from the private sector.  That is the plan.  Am I right in saying that is essentially what agency will be doing?  Will it be trying to deliver on these targets instead of the State directly trying to ensure these targets will be met by it in building public and affordable housing?  We will deliver a small portion directly and the agency will work with private developers for the most part to build on public land.  The State will then end up renting the properties back from the developers to which it will have sold the land.  That is the balance and they are the targets.  There will be 37,000 units delivered directly by the State.  Of the total of 137,000 units, 100,000 will be covered by the HAP scheme, the rental accommodation scheme and leasing arrangements.  These figures are all for social housing.  I do not see how anything else will happen other than that.  Is there not something a little mad about it?  The agency will help to deliver directly a small proportion of the units to be delivered under Rebuilding Ireland in conjunction with the local authorities and approved housing bodies.  It will flog off the majority to developers.  If we are to meet the targets set, the developers will have to lease back the properties to the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#L00600","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539763200,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I can only speak for the Land Development Agency and what it is going to do.

Not all of the properties will necessarily be rented back on the open market.  Normal people will be taking out mortgages, buying and living in the homes as owner-occupiers.  It is not the case that they will all be placed back in the private rental market.<\/p> <p>  To try to assist with affordability measures, we are targeting a figure of 30%.  A minimum of 30% of the housing delivered on State lands must be designated as affordable.  One of the tenures we are trying to develop in that respect and which is still new in this country is cost rental.  A cost rental arrangement pares the level of rent down to the minimum needed to cover the cost of producing the unit.

I know that it has taken a long time to come to fruition and very much welcome the overarching principle of what it is trying to do, but, to date, the approach has been piecemeal.  We are trying to work collaboratively and share responsibility with the local authorities.  Aside from the physical resources the agency will provide, where required, what other additional supports can it give to local authorities?  I have in mind sites on which it is taking a long time to get to a certain point in providing 100 or 150 units.<\/p> <p>  I take great offence when anyone uses terms such as \"flogging off State land,\" as if we are simply going to throw it away and get nothing back in return.<\/p><p>That is a little misleading.  I concur fully with Mr. Coleman that the initial part of bringing a site to the point where it can be developed is extremely costly.  If it is more beneficial to flip it and get something back in return, for example, 30% affordable, public private partnership or joint ventures, we have to examine those proposals in detail and determine what is in the best interests of the State in value for money terms.<\/p><p> The 10% baseline that keeps coming up is exactly that, a baseline.  People are misconstruing it.  It is a minimum requirement.  Nowhere does it say that cannot be exceeded or increased.  It is the same with the 30% affordability on the particular sites mentioned earlier.  Some sites outside Dublin will have a natural affordability but that is never mentioned.  What is never mentioned either is something I point to in relation to a site we have in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Fitzgerald Park, where we have 50 social houses which will be delivered this year.  It took years to get to this point.  They are magnificent homes built to a really high standard which we are providing to families to give them a safe environment in which to raise their children.  No one ever asked for 10% affordable on those.  No one ever asked for mixed tenure on those sites.  There can sometimes be an imbalance on that side too.  Bearing in mind that we have to look after the most vulnerable in society first, affordability is as much of a problem as social housing.  For that reason, I welcome very much the initiative establishing the Land Development Agency and principally what it is set to do.<\/p><p> When it comes to the board that will be put in place, I presume those appointed will be highly qualified and vastly experienced to deal with what is ahead of us.  While people can talk about salaries and misconstrue them in any way they want, if one wants to get qualified people with experience from the private sector, one has to pay them accordingly.  If one wants them to leave very valuable jobs, they have to be paid accordingly.  In return for that, we have transparency and can question the board where it is accountable to the Oireachtas and everyone else.  To get qualified, vastly experienced people, however, they must be paid accordingly.<\/p><p> Local authority social housing targets are similar to the 10% baseline in that they are targets.  They are not a minimum requirement but are expected to be exceeded.  In that regard, how will the agency, through collective and shared responsibility, help those local authorities where possible?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#L01400","speaker":"1246","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539763200,"counter":343,"content":"<p>A good example of the resourcing support we can lend is one of the initial sites in our portfolio, namely, the Dyke Road site in Galway.  The Chairman asks if there is anything else we can do in this respect.  One of the things we want to do is take blockages out of the system.  We want to understand where those blockages are and what we can do to smooth them over.  People talk often about procurement as a blockage.  That might be in relation to the procurement of professional services or a builder or developer partner.  We are seeking to design our procurement frameworks from the ground up for both those segments, namely, the professional and the development side, as slickly and as tightly as possible to take as much time as possible out of it.  We are also looking to make those panels available for use by anyone in the public sector, including local authorities.  We are hoping to make a meaningful and material improvement to help with mastering those blockages that sometimes exist on the procurement side.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman said it was unfair to refer to the involvement of developer partners as the flogging off of State land.  On the private side, where a private development takes place on sites, we will do everything in our power to ensure delivery happens within the bounds of time commitments.  It is not that a site is gone and it is for the developer to do with it as he or she pleases.  It is that we will put time-bound delivery restrictions in place for the commercial transactions we undertake with those developers where we engage those practices.  I note also the Chairman's point about natural affordability, especially outside Dublin.  With some of the sites we have, especially some of the larger ones, including in Dublin, any private sales that happen tend to be at the more affordable end of the scale.  The Chairman pointed out that affordability is as big a problem as social housing, which is true.  The more supply we have coming into that space, the better, as far as I am concerned, especially where that supply is at the affordable end of the scale.<\/p> <p>  When one looks at what we are trying to do, competition ultimately takes place in three different areas in the development process.  The first is in the buying of the land.  The second is within the development piece and the methodologies used to develop sites.  The third piece is in the sale of the houses when they are built.  Currently, all of the competition is in buying the land because not enough of it is coming out.  That is where we will help to put more land in there.  That will put the competition into the space of developing the house and selling it.  That is where we want competition and we will help with that by supplying land into those segments.  That is all I have to say on the Chairman's comments, but I am happy to elaborate if she wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Coleman"},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":344,"content":"<p>We have gone half an hour over time.

The following challenges are critical to the considerations of South Dublin County Council regarding the appropriate use of public land for housing delivery: ensuring sufficient supply of homes across south Dublin; determining the appropriate mix of private, social and affordable homes to be delivered on available sites and across the county; and utilising the full range of options envisaged by national policy for delivery of homes while taking location, infrastructural requirements and social context into consideration.  I have provided the committee with an overview of the status of the housing supply programme in south Dublin for current projects, future plans and proposals under consideration, together with the status and indicative number of homes for each area, a total of over 800 homes.  This shows our commitment to the delivery of social homes on available land within the county.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the larger sites available to the council for delivery of homes, the recently approved Kilcarbery project has been through a two-year process of master-planning, legal and financial modelling, competitive dialogue and procurement.  The elected members of the council approved the disposal of the 72-acre site at Kilcarbery for the development of 975 housing units, 294 of which will be for social housing.  The development is in tandem with and adjacent to 109 houses approved as part of the initial public private partnership bundle, giving an overall mix of 40% social and 60% private on this fully planned, integrated community which will also benefit from a cr&egrave;che, community centre, school and retail centre.<\/p> <p>  The project commenced in the absence of an affordable housing scheme but with the council fully cognisant of its role as a housing and planning authority and the need for the provision of homes in line with Pillar 3 of Rebuilding Ireland.  The enabling infrastructure works are being funded through the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF.  Some 50 homes will be sold at a discount to market prices to offset the drawdown value of the LIHAF funding.  The project also includes a social employment clause which stipulates that 10% of person hours are for those on the local register of long-term unemployed.<\/p> <p>  The next stage involves the preparation of an environmental impact statement and application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la as a strategic housing development by the successful tenderer to secure phased delivery of homes on site commencing in 2020 and to be completed by 2023.  In addition to providing for the delivery of much-needed homes, the economic yield to the council from the sale will enable the strategic acquisition of additional land for future housing development.<\/p> <p>  We have shared the detail of the Kilcarbery model with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and other local authorities and our team members will continue to make themselves available for consultation and to offer guidance on the process to others developing similar plans.<\/p> <p>  With the benefit of this experience, it is intended to develop housing on four other large strategic sites owned by the council, namely, Killinarden, Rathcoole, Clonburris strategic development zone and St. Maelruans.  These are currently being allocated to consultants for high-level master-planning in conjunction with our internal team to assess their potential unit capacity, infrastructural requirements and social environment context.  The budget announcement relating to affordable housing is very welcome and allows this tenure to be factored into plans for these sites.  We have advised the Department of our intention to apply for funding from the serviced sites fund in 2019 in respect of each site.<\/p> <p>  The sites have a range of contrasting characteristics, including greenfield, brownfield, urban, rural, town centre and strategic development zone.  Some are adjacent to large areas of social housing and others are on the outskirts of a rural village.  These characteristics will inform the master-planning context and the potential distribution of social, affordable and private housing on each site.<\/p><p>This mix will be developed in conjunction with the local elected members and will be informed by best practice and national policy on housing integration and sustainable communities.  It is estimated that all five sites, including Kilcarbery, will yield circa 4,300 homes.  As a housing authority, it is our view that the sites will have different solutions, which will all include provision for social, affordable and private housing.<\/p><p> There are 7,055 applicants are on the council's housing list.  We will continue to examine opportunities for in-fill housing, turnkey acquisitions, including through Part V, and partnerships with approved housing bodies to supplement the major housing supply projects on our available land.  In addition, housing solutions provided through the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, housing assistance payment, HAP, and leasing options are all being actively pursued and utilised in south Dublin.<\/p><p> The current actions and future plans I have outlined demonstrate the strategic approach being undertaken by South Dublin County Council to ensure the effective use of available land throughout the county to deliver an optimum integrated housing mix to meet the housing need for the people of south Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Ward","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Ward.

I thank the committee for the invitation to address it on the appropriate use of public lands.  This statement addresses both land supply and its importance for housing, the most crucial issue that now needs to be addressed for Cork to continue to its growth as envisaged in Project Ireland 2040.  This statement is structured to identify the major areas of publicly owned land in Cork city and the strategic priorities that will guide the continuing development of that land under the framework of Project Ireland 2040.  The strategic priorities for the future development of Cork city are set out in the Cork city development plan 2015, the Cork local economic and community plan 2016 and Cork 2050, which is a joint strategic pathway developed by Cork City Council and Cork County Council as part of their contribution to the national planning framework.<\/p> <p>  Cork city is due to expand substantially in the next local elections.  The area of the city will increase from 37.3 km2 to 187 km2, which is a fivefold increase.  The population of the expanded city is due to grow significantly, as projected in Project Ireland 2040.  Project Ireland anticipates that 50% of this increase in population must be accommodated within the existing built-up area.  In tandem, the population of wider metropolitan Cork is due to expand significantly.<\/p> <p>  Lots of encouraging things are taking place with regard to economic development.  These underline the urgency of addressing the housing supply shortage, the existence of which presents a whole set of challenges.  Not only is the supply issue a social challenge but it is also an economic challenge.  Unless it is tackled, it will clearly present an obstacle to future employment and economic growth in Cork city.  Early resolution of this issue will reap long-term rewards in local and regional tourism, enterprise development and foreign direct investment, aside from the obvious quality of life and liveability benefits of a vibrant and compact waterfront city, one that is a harbour of opportunities.<\/p> <p>  To achieve these development targets, the city needs land to develop.  The primary need at present is for housing and its associated infrastructure.  My submission contains a table setting out an estimated total yield on zoned land based on the existing city boundary, the estimate yield without infrastructure and the potential yield from that in terms of where there is an infrastructure requirement and where there is no such requirement.  Development activity in Cork city is showing strong signs of increasing after the period of recession.  However, actual construction of housing and apartment developments, with the marked exception of Cork City Council's social housing construction programme, remains slow.  The most active private sector is student accommodation with a number of beds under construction while planning permission is pending for others.  <\/p> <p>  A presentation by Cork City Council to the Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness in July 2017 concluded that a number of issues were affecting housing supply.  As the Chairman suggested, I will not go through all of them but the obvious ones are the scarcity of development land within the city boundary, a growing population, changing demographics, a tendency towards urban living, the need to build sustainable communities, a lack of investment in existing older housing stock, our autonomy in terms of decision-making and viability issues.  Unfortunately, these issues remain the primary challenges with regard to housing supply in Cork city.    <\/p> <p>  Focusing on public land, we have outlined for the committee in our presentation the public lands we have identified in public ownership in the current city.  There are 155.15 ha of publicly-owned land.  I have set out the different stakeholders in the presentation.  Cork City Council owns 41.25 ha of land and we are actively pursuing development of 34.9 ha.  There are two significant developments in this land.  Cork City Council is the freehold owner of the landbank at Old Whitechurch Road on the north side of the city, which was assembled some years ago for residential purposes.  It comprises some 22 ha on a southerly sloping green field site zoned residential in the Cork city development plan.  The council has been working to unlock the potential of that land because it has some very significant infrastructure challenges such as power lines and road infrastructure.  To this end, the council has committed to the local infrastructure housing activation fund to do the infrastructural work that is required to bring this land to market and development. <\/p> <p> The landbank is a highly accessible site as it is proximal to the Blackpool retail and business park and close to the city in terms of neighbourhoods.  The council's vision is for this landbank to be fully developed to provide a sustainable housing development.  The landbank has an estimated capacity for 600 units or more subject to planning permission.  The council envisages it being a mixed development covering all housing needs and would have an associated neighbourhood centre to balance the prevalence of social housing in the north of the city.  The council also has a site at Boherboy Road, which is in the north east of Cork city.  It has planning approval from the neighbouring local authority for 147 housing units.  We have made an application to the serviced sites fund operated by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and it is intended to develop the scheme as a mix of both social and affordable housing.  We are awaiting approval but we are very optimistic that this will be forthcoming.  <\/p> <p>  The other stakeholders are listed and range from the HSE, the ESB, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, the Port of Cork and Bord na M&oacute;na to the Department of Defence, Bord G&aacute;is Energy and IDA Ireland.  Having engaged with all of these stakeholders, the council has a fairly good understanding of what their position is with regard to this land.  These lands are a major resource in our city and it is Cork City Council's position that they should be brought forward for development as soon as practicable.  We have already notified the Department with regard to that.  We have had one meeting with the Land Development Agency and another meeting is due to be scheduled to progress our collective thinking on this.  These lands are also zoned for development and have the potential to make a massive contribution to the sustainable development of Cork city.  We caution, however, that proper urban design principles must be adhered to and we must future-proof to avoid the temptation to address short-term needs.  <\/p> <p>  There are many underutilised private lands in Cork, mainly adjacent to the city because we have probably brought forward most lands within the city through our public housing scheme.  These private lands also need to be addressed.  While there have been encouraging developments recently with regard to the supply of housing in Cork owing to our enhanced delivery of social housing, there is still a significant impediment to achieving other housing solutions in the city.  I hope our paper is of help.  We are very available to answer any questions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Ann Doherty"},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Doherty and invite Ms Farrelly to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#O00400","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539763200,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I am director of planning and strategic infrastructure at Fingal County Council.  I am joined by my colleague, Ms Mary Egan, from the council's housing department.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear before it to discuss appropriate use of public land.  The focus of this statement is the council's approach to the development and use of public lands for the provision of housing and sustainable communities.  Fingal County Council is the second largest of the four Dublin local authorities and has the third biggest local authority catchment area in the country.  The results from Census 2016 show that Fingal is Ireland's fastest growing county with the youngest population and also that Balbriggan is the youngest town in the country.<\/p> <p>  Fingal County Council supports the ongoing development of the county in accordance with the national, regional and local planning frameworks to which it has actively contributed.  Fingal County Council is committed to ensure the area develops in a sustainable way and supports the key principles of healthy place-making, climate action and economic opportunity.  In view of the current housing crisis, it is Fingal County Council's priority to form effective and innovative approaches to mobilise development on public and private land to create housing and quality urban neighbourhoods.  Consequently, any development, including that of public land, is positioned against national, regional and local policies and objectives.<\/p><p>To this end, Rebuilding Ireland, the national planning framework, the Fingal development plan, LIHAF and other such policies and programmes set the context for future development.  These enabling policies are in place and will facilitate Fingal County Council in developing sustainable communities.  <\/p><p> Facilitating the provision of the right quantity of appropriate housing in the right locations that is accessible and affordable for all residents is crucial for Fingal County Council.  To this end, there are 72 active private development sites which will deliver more than 12,000 homes in the county.  There are also existing planning permissions for a further 55 sites, with the capacity to deliver more than 5,000 homes.  The provision of housing in Fingal, as with all planning authorities, requires facilitating policies and principles within the county development plan and the core strategy.  These policies enable the delivery of quality dwellings and help to create and maintain sustainable communities and neighbourhoods.<\/p><p> In Fingal we have employed a number of policy responses to facilitate housing development, namely, the adoption of a core strategy which allows for the development of 49,000 housing units on more than 1,700 ha of zoned land.  To ensure the development of sustainable communities that are economically, environmentally and socially healthy and resilient, significant master planning has been carried out and is ongoing.  Furthermore, there are local area plans in place across the county and others under draft.  Hansfield strategic development zone, in Dublin 15, continues to work as a successful policy tool, with a high rate of completions in the second quarter of 2018.  We are on target to deliver in excess of 2,000 homes in 2018.  That will compare to a figure of 2,700 in 2008 and the trend is favourably upwards.  In 2014 there were 300 completions.  There has, therefore, been a significant change in recent years.<\/p><p> Fingal recognises the benefits of the parallel delivery of supporting infrastructure.  A review of the critical infrastructure required to unlock the significant residential zoned and serviced land banks available in Fingal was undertaken as part of the Fingal development plan in 2015.  On the back of the work carried out as part of this infrastructure audit, the Fingal County Council sought funding from the central government LIHAF initiative launched in August 2016.  The council was successful in securing total LIHAF funding of &euro;26.58 million for essential infrastructure required on three multi-unit housing development sites, the second highest allocation of the 13 local authorities that were successful in October 2017.  In the short to medium term LIHAF funding will unlock 2,200 residential units on lands in Donabate, Swords and Baldoyle.  Approximately 7,000 residential units will be delivered in the longer term.<\/p><p> Fingal County Council is actively planning the development of five key publicly owned sites for housing.  Three of the sites are council owned and located at: Ballymastone, Donabate; Cappagh, Dublin 11; and Churchfields, Mulhuddart.  Two of the sites are Housing Agency owned at Castlelands, Balbriggan and Hacketstown, Skerries.  Fingal County Council has engaged with the Land Development Agency about these sites in recent weeks.  The council&rsquo;s vision for these lands is to deliver successful and sustainable communities through the provision of high quality and attractive residential developments, with a focus on best practice urban design and layout and the provision of accessible community, open spaces and recreational facilities.  These developments will provide an appropriate mix of house sizes, types and tenure to meet household needs and to promote balanced communities.  The lands are key locations for population and employment growth, aligned with committed infrastructural investments.  Project Talamh, an internal project office in Fingal, has been set up to co-ordinate and manage the development of these lands.  The programme office analyses proposals to select the best approach to the projects and co-ordinates resources to procure, manage and deliver each project.  It is essential that the lands be developed in the most advantageous and efficient way for the council.  To this end, the development approach is tailored to the individual requirements of each site and adjoining area.  The council is working collaboratively with relevant stakeholders to ensure the development of housing across these sites is facilitated.  Our strategy supports the creation of sustainable communities.  We cater for all members of society and seek to deliver a range of house types and sizes which will provide more opportunities for people to stay and live locally at every stage of their lives.  In simple terms, we want Fingal to grow in an organic, sustainable way and ensure seamless integration between established and new communities.  The development plan sets the parameters for the development of the sites and it is envisaged that up to 3,730 homes could be provided on them.<\/p><p> I have included a lot information on the individual sites in the statement and will go through each of the sites presently, but we are open to working with all housing providers on a mix of tenure perspectives such as private house builders and approved housing bodies that may work together in developing each of the sites.  In total, the sites provide 100 ha of development land.  They are all zoned for housing and have the potential to deliver in excess of 3,700 units.  Fingal County Council acknowledges the role these strategically located sites can play in the wider Fingal region in terms of their potential to support a high quality of life, with the offer of culture and heritage, access to the coast, waterways, the city and the airport.  As such, the council is focused on delivering successful and sustainable communities through the provision of high quality housing and physical and social infrastructure and improving connections between new and existing communities.  It recognises that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to the use of public lands and the delivery of housing.  Realising a mix of solutions which work for individual sites is the current priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Ms AnnMarie Farrelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Farrelly.

I am the director of housing and joined by my colleague, Ms Mary Henchy, director of planning.  I will focus on the main points, rather than read through my prepared script.  The submission was compiled to have regard to the broader topic of appropriate use of public land, with specific emphasis on the Woodbrook\/Shanganagh lands, as circulated with the invitation to attend the meeting.  The regional planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area for the period 2010 to 2022 forecast a population of approximately 240,000 in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown by 2022.  This equates to the provision of <i>circa<\/i>1,500 homes per annum over a period of six years.  <br\/><br\/>The quarter 2, 2018 D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown housing task force returns for sites with greater than ten homes show that there are 41 active sites that account for <i>circa<\/i>1,300 homes under construction and that in the first eight months of the year planning permission was granted for 3,790 homes, more than treble the figure for 2017.  The primary challenge for D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is providing the infrastructure required to open up the new growth areas of Kilternan, Glenamuck, Woodbrook, Shanganagh, Cherrywood, Stepaside and Sandyford.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has already maximised the use of the bulk of its viable serviced lands, in particular, for smaller in-field developments of two to 50 homes, in conjunction with the downsizing campaign.  Since 2015 a total of 120 social homes have been completed, with a further four sites, comprising 129 homes.  The council is at tender stage with a further 19 homes and feasibility stage with 729 homes, including the site at Shanganagh Castle.  It is also working in partnership with three approved housing bodies to develop a further 208 homes.<br\/><br\/>D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown saw the fastest surge in prices in the capital in July, with prices up by 9.8%.  By contrast, south Dublin saw an increase of just 5.2%.  The median price for Dublin as a whole was &euro;360,000 in July, while in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, it was &euro;527,000, compared with &euro;320,000 in both Fingal and south Dublin.  The affordability problem is, therefore, unique to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  It is extremely important that D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council seek to maximise affordability on its own lands.  The council is commencing development of its larger sites, including at Shanganagh Castle.  The sites are mainly located in the southern part of the county.  Larger sites will naturally take longer to build on.  When we move into larger sites, there are economic, financial, planning and environmental considerations which add to the complexity of delivery.<br\/><br\/>In line with the EIA directive, certain developments, including on the Shanganagh Castle site, must be assessed for likely environmental effects before planning permission can be granted.  Planning applications under Part 10 go directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  This applies to the Shanganagh Castle site as it is proposed to build more than 500 dwellings.  Tenders for the master plan to prepare the scheme for compliance with the EIA directive, in preparation for Part 10 planning permission, were sought in quarter 1 of 2018.  The integrated design team has commenced its work and preparations for this stage are expected to take at least nine months.<\/p><p>The public spending code was introduced in 2013 and provides for best value for money for public funds.  It introduced a set of rules and procedures for projects with a value of more than &euro;20 million.  Under this code, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is obliged to carry out a cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness analysis.  It must consider the option of a PPP and is obliged to engage with the National Development Finance Agency to examine finance and apportionment of the risk and balance sheet considerations.  Projects are reviewed by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and also peer reviewed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p> Assuming an average build of &euro;250,000, the public spending code applies on sites of over 80 homes.  The public spending code applies to Shanganagh, which has an estimated cost of &euro;132 million.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is working with the National Development Finance Agency to develop funding options for Shanganagh.  At the same time, in order to expedite matters, we have appointed a design team to progress the master plan in preparation for Part 10 planning.<\/p><p> In conclusion, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is actively managing its landbank and is now moving into larger sites which have more complexities in terms of delivery.  As outlined in the submission, the public spending code provides important procedures for ensuring best value for money.  However, it may be helpful if the threshold were increased to allow for quicker build on sites of more than 80 homes.  Downsizing incentives would also assist in making better use of our housing stock for larger families on the waiting list.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Keenan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for taking the time to come in.  I appreciate they are operating within Government policy so while, in the privacy of their own offices, they might have their own views on some of the issues we are about to discuss, I accept they are constrained by that Government policy.<\/p> <p>  To put in context the concerns of some of us, one of the reasons many members of this committee are getting so exercised about land is because, the more we look at it, the more we see there is a mismatch between the targets for the delivery of social housing in particular, and also affordable housing, and what is being promised through Rebuilding Ireland and the other mechanisms.  By way of example, we know from the most recent housing needs assessment there are some 73,000 households on the council waiting lists, 40,000 households on HAP and another 19,000 households on RAS, and in Dublin in particular, RAS is experiencing some real difficulties.  This means there is a real social housing need for about 132,000 units yet Rebuilding Ireland will only meet 23% of that need through units owned by local authorities and approved housing bodies.  Mr. Ward will know that, in the local authority we share, the figures are just a little better, and some 27% of need will be met on the basis of the Government's targets.  However, when we look at land, particularly the larger tracts of land, many of us are wondering how we can make the case for a larger delivery of social housing on that land to meet the growing need.<\/p> <p>  The issue of affordability is the same.  We still do not have a measure for how many people or households need affordable rent or affordable sale.  One very important piece of research was published in June and it has not got enough attention, although we will look at it in committee in the new year, and I flag it with everyone I talk to in this regard.  Eoin Corrigan, Daniel Foley and a number of other ESRI economists have done a very detailed study looking at affordability since 2003.  What they found is that, of the people renting and paying mortgages but not getting social housing supports, 32% are paying more than 30% of their income on accommodation.  More worryingly, in the bottom 25% of income earners, the percentage of people spending more than 30% of their income is 70%, so one can see already, just in those initial figures, there is a huge level of need.  One of the worrying aspects of the study is that this is not just a current problem because the authors note that their modelling back to 2003 shows it is a structural feature of our system.  I say this because not only will we meet only about 23% of real social housing need by 2021 on the basis of the Government's targets, but we have no notion of how far we will be from meeting affordable rental and affordable purchase need.<\/p> <p>  I would like the witnesses to say as much as they can within the limits they are operating under.  My concern is that the conversation we have just had with the Department and the Land Development Agency is essentially about taking very large tracts of public lands and constraining the extent to which they can meet social and affordable housing need because of the use of the joint venture structure.  For example, if the various local authorities represented had all of the advantages the Land Development Agency has and did not have to do the value for money exercises for the larger projects, if they did not have to go through the cumbersome approval process and had more flexibility in terms of tendering and employment of staff, and if they had the very large multi-annual funding the Land Development Agency will have, I presume they would be able to deliver larger-scale, mixed income, mixed tenure projects like Shanganagh without needing help from anybody, apart from a little oversight from the Department.  If the witnesses are willing to put it on record, and I understand if they are not, surely that would be a better way of meeting that need.<\/p> <p>  I will outline one of the dilemmas we have.  We all support the Shanganagh Castle project, which is a brilliant project and, from everything I know from talking to the chair and councillors locally, it is designed to meet the needs there.  One of the difficulties we have with Kilcarbery, and I do not want to mention the war, is that while it is a really great project in its design, is well integrated, has land for schools, has a community centre and has retail, the great tragedy is that 70% of the units in the joint venture will not be affordable, or certainly the vast majority will not be.  Although Mr. Ward has only come in at the end of it, we are trying to find if there are not better ways of using the public land to meet social and affordable housing need.  That is not to say one could not use some of that land for market price houses, but surely it would be better if the local authority was selling those houses and recycling the profits back into the housing system to meet other needs.<\/p> <p>  My questions are twofold.  First, if the local authorities had all of the powers and advantages the Land Development Agency is going to get, could they significantly increase their output above the current targets under Rebuilding Ireland?  What are the current constraints in place preventing them from moving forward at a faster pace, for example, with the kind of proposal under way in Shanganagh?  Second, with regard to Cork, some issues were mentioned in the presentation around the possibility of needing to review some of the potential constitutional restrictions on accessing private land.  I would be interested to know if the witnesses had a view on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#Q00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I will ask Deputy Barry to come in, as the questions are directed to everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#Q00300","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I will direct my questions entirely to the delegation from Cork City Council, if the Chair is happy for me to do it that way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#Q00400","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":364,"content":"<p>Yes, we will all contribute first and I will ask the witnesses to answer at the end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#Q00500","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I will start on the point Deputy &Oacute; Broin finished with.  Ms Doherty's submission includes the following very significant comment: \"Cork City Council also urges Government to address in appropriate circumstances underutilised private lands, even if this requires a re-examination of the protections currently afforded to private property in the Constitution.\"  That is a significant statement from the chief executive officer of one of the largest local authorities in the country.  I would certainly draw attention to it and I support that statement.<\/p> <p>  I will not do the big block of talk as I am looking for a bit of back and forth.  I will start with social and affordable housing need and use Cork city as an example.  I will pose my questions to Ms Doherty and Mr. Geaney.  The first is about length of time on social housing waiting lists.  We hear a lot about the numbers on social housing waiting lists but we do not often discuss the length of time.  When I throw open the doors of my clinic on a Monday afternoon, I have people coming in to me who have been on the housing list for seven, eight, nine, ten, 11 and 12 years.  Are the witnesses in a position to give even an approximate profile of the position with the current social housing waiting list in Cork?  For example, how many people have been on the list for more than five years or more than eight years?  It seems to be backing up.<\/p> <p>  On the question of getting a picture of affordability, the Cork City Council CEO will know I have had dealings in recent times with the firefighters in the city.  We had a controversy there, and that is fine.  In the conversations I held with firefighters, one of the things that struck me was that very few of them live in the city and the journey time they have in the morning or afternoon to come in to work their shift.  Why is this?  It is because they cannot afford housing in the city as prices are too high.  Here we have a group of workers who, I imagine, are at least on the average industrial wage, if not a little more.<\/p><p>I hope I am not wrong about that but firefighters will soon let me know if I am.  I believe the same applies to nurses, teachers and so on.  Workers on average wages cannot afford to buy in the city.  Is that exceptional or part of the general picture?  If the former is the case, will the witnesses comment on it?

They are still relevant questions.  To meet that demand which, in total, depending on how the figure is calculated, will be approximately 5,000 households in real terms over the next few years, and to reduce those waiting lists, we would have to have a considerably higher level of delivery than we have currently.  I do not see how we can do that with our current plans for land use.  If we take the Shanganagh site, for example, we are only talking about 200 social houses.  Ms Keenan might clarify the number of Part V housing units she expects to see delivered.  She can extrapolate from the figures she gave on planning permissions, although getting planning permission is not the same as houses being built.  I refer to all the other sites also.  Work on the Shanganagh site will not start for some time.  Ms Keenan indicated it will take nine months just to get through the various bits and pieces that have to be done.  The houses must then be built and so on.  After that, I do not see where the rest will come from for years.  Is that a fair assessment of the dilemma we face?<\/p> <p>  How can we accelerate the process?  Does it not necessitate getting a much higher proportion of public housing on the lands we have, rather than entertaining public private partnerships, PPPs, and so on, which will lower the proportion of public housing we get on those sites, never mind the complications that might arise?  Ms Keenan seems to be saying the public spending code is limiting her because of the threshold.  She inferred that the threshold should rises.  Is it not a major problem for the council, in trying to work out what affordability is, that there is a requirement to have a proportion of affordable houses and also, as she stated, to consider PPPs?  The need to consider the finances of all of that is slowing everything.  The council cannot progress because it must consider a PPP, which is, I presume, related to the financing of the rest of the sites, and must also consider affordable housing, with which it is having difficulty for the reasons Ms Keenan outlined.  These include that the housing market in D&uacute;n Laoghaire is highly inflated and trying to work out what affordable is and how it can be financed is a complexity.  Would it not be easier to develop the entire Shanganagh site as public housing because the council would not have those problems?  It would also mean that we would get close to hitting our targets in terms of social housing need.<\/p> <p>  On another issue I raised previously with Ms Keenan, Mel Reynolds has made a suggestion which, given the scale of the demand, I believe we should consider.  On sites like Cherrywood and other private development sites, we are waiting for the social or Part V element to be delivered.  We do not know when the developers will deliver it and we do not get it until the developments have been completed.  Mel Reynolds has said we should take 10% of the land upfront to avoid being dependent on the developers.  If we did that in Cherrywood, we would have sufficient land on which to build 800 houses.  Four or five different developers own Cherrywood and we have no idea when that housing will be delivered.  We have to wait until the end of that process to get our portion and we will have to negotiate prices with the developers, which almost certainly will be very high.  Would it not be better for us to get the 10% of land upfront and build out ourselves, rather than waiting for the developers to build?  Would that not accelerate the delivery of the Part V housing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#R00600","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I have some general questions also, in particular on downsizing options.  The committee did a substantial report on housing options for older people.  We visited a number of sites where downsizing is taking place.  I am biased and perhaps not as <i>au fait<\/i>with the other three local authorities in Dublin, but D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has been at the forefront of delivering housing options for older people.  Not least among these will be the launch on Friday of the final phase of Rochestown Park.  Are we failing to maximise the sites we have in towns and villages to enable downsizing, or &quot;right-sizing&quot; as we prefer to call it, because of the infrastructrure that is required to achieve this?  Are we looking at State-owned land in these areas to build private housing for older people to right size if they choose to do so?  Have any policies been introduced in that area?<\/p><p>I am interested in finding out who is involved in the programme office team in Fingal County Council and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  Are further resources needed or are there barriers in that area?  While the representatives of Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown county councils referred to their teams in their opening statements, I would like to hear from all four local authorities what teams they have in place to deliver their housing programmes.<\/p><p>When in quarter 1 was the design team appointed in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council?  We need to know when nine months will have elapsed. <\/p><p>I share Deputy Boyd Barrett's frustration about the Shanganagh site, which has been mentioned countless times in this committee.  I differ with him on the proportions for social and affordable housing but that is for the local authority and councillors to decide.  It is not for members to get into such detail here.  However, I recognise the complexities around it, notwithstanding that it is frustrating.  What additional resources may be needed to progress the development more speedily?  Were there areas that could have been addressed by the Government side to deliver it faster, notwithstanding the two tranches of LIHAF funding that have been allocated?<\/p><p>I welcome that Cork County Council identified all the private or semi-State lands available in the city.  How proactive are the local authorities in dealing with approved housing bodies?  We have heard from AHBs that they have contacted various local authorities, not just in Dublin, and have been told that particular sites have already been identified for housing.  I have looked at some of those and I did not see any schemes for those sites.  What is causing confusion in that respect?<\/p><p>While I know cost rental is a fairly new initiative, have any of the local authorities represented here today identified sites for cost rental apart from Enniskerry, which has been in train for a long time and has now finally been signed?<\/p><p> I commend the local authorities on developing smaller sites, often more complex and more difficult sites to deal with, where they are trying to maximise with eight, ten, 20 or 50 units.  The local authorities have targeted those first because of the potentially quicker turnaround.  Some local authorities have not been able to do that.  What are the main barriers to doing that?<\/p><p> Do the witnesses feel we are getting the maximum from the sites we have?  Some sites around Dublin have apartment blocks all around them and yet the local authorities are only building two-storey housing or much smaller infill schemes.  Why are we not maximising the number of units on those sites?  Is it because of sensitivity in the area?  Is it because of the money to fund these projects?  Are the local authorities going for the smaller amounts to turn them around quicker?  Are there other reasons for that or is it just too complex to maximise them at the moment?<\/p><p> The witnesses all said that where they have come in with schemes, funding is not a barrier.

It was not a dedicated team.  We pulled in the outside expertise as we needed it.  We have a significant number of staff both in the housing department and architectural services working on all our projects.  We have resourcing through our workforce plan.<\/p> <p>  On the different sites and the different solutions, we will bring proposals for the building of approximately 2,000 homes at Clonburris which will in the main be affordable and social housing.  The fact it is in the wider context of a strategic development zone means it will provide for 6,000 private homes.  We are focusing on the social and affordable element of that.  In some of the other sites we have we will need to look to include private ownership, particularly in areas such as Killinarden which already has a lot of social housing.  Different sites will require different solutions.<\/p> <p>  On affordability, the new affordable housing scheme will be at the forefront of our minds.  We progressed the Kilcarbery project in the absence of that.  We were quite open all along that we had to work within the constraints of policy.  That will follow on in terms of a cost rental scheme.  We are waiting for the detail of a cost rental scheme.  There are all sorts of views on what that will entail, how we future-proof it, and the length of time involved.<\/p> <p>  We are actively working with developers and we are trying to front-load some of the Part V units.  If we get land, we have to go through the process of Part VIII and developing that ourselves.  I am speaking about South Dublin and I know the Deputy referred to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  Ideally in a development, we would work to get the units front-loaded.  There are certain examples of that, such as Shackleton Park, where we would be working to get units upfront.  That is to the fore of our concerns in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I have identified 7,055 on our housing list.  I do not have the average waiting time for a home.  There are additional numbers on the transfer list and on the housing assistance payment list.  If people are accommodated on social housing, it frees up other options for people who do not have those options.  We work with approved housing bodies, AHBs, consistently and we would aim to have about 400 units from AHBs in the next couple of years.  We would also envisage 500 units in the timeframe to 2021.  On top of the 800 units, we are delivering through our own smaller build programmes within local authority areas along with green space and open space that we have, supplemented by the large sites.

We are getting housing land ready for housing delivery.  We use the time when the sites are being serviced to get ready to have the housing delivered.  That is through the typical methodologies of joint ventures, direct delivery by the local authority and at times more active collaboration with the private sector.<\/p> <p>  We have done the site-by-site assessment of the potential of the individual sites and the constraints on the individual sites.  We know the sites well which allows us to plan how those sites might be developed.  Our project office takes very much a project management approach, drawing on the expertise available across the departments in the council - our housing, planning and architectural staff and then, when necessary, bringing in outside expertise to assist.  It is very similar to the approach of the Land Development Agency.  In Fingal we have found that the higher the number of active sites, the greater our ability to have short-term delivery.  The key thing is to have more sites active.  Large sites deliver at a similar pace to the smaller sites.  The Land Development Agency can assist us in having more sites active.  We have five key public housing sites, three of which are being progressed by us and the additional two will now come earlier to the market because of the involvement of the Land Development Agency.<\/p> <p>  The Cathaoirleach mentioned maximising the sites' potential.  There is a dynamic between delivering appropriate densities and being able to deliver affordable units.  The cost of the unit is key for affordability.  The higher-density schemes seem to cost more.  That is something we are working out.  Different parts of Fingal have different affordability issues.  The Castlelands site in Balbriggan will be developed by the Land Development Agency.  It has the potential to deliver affordable units without much need for discounts in terms of the land value being brought to the table.  That will be worked through over the coming year.<\/p> <p>  The first thing to get right is to master-plan the site, knowing what should be on the site and what can developed on the site in line with the potential constraints of that site.  That is why we focus very much on ensuring a framework is in place.

In Fingal we do not have a difficulty with the early delivery of Part V units.  From 2015 up to the end of this year, we will have delivered approximately 300 units through the Part V process.

This is all part of the negotiations.  In a scheme like Cherrywood with higher density housing, one can achieve more by working with the totality of the landholding than by splitting off elements.  There are circa ten landowners within Cherrywood.  To combine their holdings into one site would be a negotiation outside of what is facilitated by Part V, which is site specific and dependent on the planning application that is lodged.

While many of us are supportive of the Land Development Agency, LDA, as a strategic land management agency that moves around public land, the part of its function around residential housing development concerns us.  That is partly because some of us take the side of councils, in that they would be better placed to be given the power and money to deliver residential housing, but also because of the model being used.  I will ask a couple of technical questions to help me understand these matters, but I will first emphasise the concern that some of us have.  If the LDA develops along the lines of its initial proposal, I fear that local authorities will be reduced primarily to developing infill and small social housing developments, working with approved housing bodies, AHBs, and then managing the growing stock.  Given their direct experience of joint ventures, will Mr. Ward and his colleagues compare the timelines involved versus a comparably sized mixed income and mixed tenure project that is local authority-led?  The processes are different.  Is one faster, more complex or more cumbersome than the other?<\/p> <p>  We discussed with the LDA whether the exact breakdown of the tenure mix in a joint venture was determined by the financing requirements of the overall package rather than by an area's social and affordable housing needs.  Do the witnesses have a view on that matter?  Delivering affordable housing within the joint venture context is complex, given the many types of funding involved.  There could be a sites fund, a Rebuilding Ireland home loan and so on.  Does that not make it inherently more complex than local authorities building houses in the traditional way in their own developments and then renting and selling them at affordable rates to people on various income thresholds?<\/p> <p>  One of the changes to the serviced sites loan relates to the equity stake.  If I understand it correctly, there is a &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 subsidy, although 25% of that must be covered by the local authority.  I am not sure whether the money is there to do that.  Does adding the equity stake complicate the loan more than the &Oacute; Cualann model, of which I am sure the witnesses are aware?  Does the &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 meet the council's costs in terms of land and site servicing?<\/p> <p>  A matter discussed in the budget and relevant to this discussion is the changing of the financial threshold for the one-stage approval process to &euro;7 million.  My understanding is that the process adds a significant level of liability to local authorities, which is one of the reasons they are not keen on it.  Perhaps the witnesses will talk us through the matter.  Even without those liabilities, the &euro;7 million threshold would only allow for small projects.  Would it be of much use?<\/p> <p>  Regarding compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, I appreciate that the witnesses may feel it is not possible to answer my next question.  Local authorities have CPO powers.  The problem is that, unless the Department gives them the funding and political backing to use CPOs for a Dublin Bus garage or a part of the Cork docklands, for example, they cannot use them.  What would stop Cork City Council from going out tomorrow and using CPOs in respect of some of the large sites that were identified in its report?<\/p> <p>  A number of witnesses mentioned working with the LDA.  I understand the part where it acquires land and develops it with a council afterwards, but the witnesses might address a specific concern of mine.  If it is the council that has the land, how will that situation work when the LDA approaches it?  The council would be involved in the master plan, but would the land then be handed over to the LDA for a joint venture with a private developer?  We are still in the early stages, but do the witnesses have thoughts on this?<\/p> <p>  The Cork cost rental information was interesting.  What is its financing model?  Where is the council in terms of establishing rent setting, for example, a single rent or several bands of rent?  Dublin City Council is exploring these matters, so any information that Cork City Council has on it would be interesting.<\/p> <p>  I accept that re-lets form part of the work but, given the nature of the stock, they are a small number and the net churn will not be significant overall.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the Central Mental Hospital, 600 social and affordable units would be fantastic.  However, the site will hold 1,500 units.  Am I wrong about that?  Would it not be much better to have a number of great mixed income and mixed tenure units for sale and rental at affordable rates?  A total of 1,500 units rather than 600 would be a better outcome in terms of meeting social and affordable housing need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#U00500","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":392,"content":"<p>Ms Doherty pinpointed an important national issue, including for Cork city, when she referred to land hoarding of such a scale that it was causing an increase in land values.  The knock-on effect of this land not being utilised is a housing shortage, causing an increase in the price of housing and a significant increase in the cost of rent.  We must focus on this issue.  What is going on is, in my opinion, criminal.  It might not be breaking the law of the land but, in anyone's moral code, it is criminal that, in the midst of the greatest housing crisis in the history of the State, there are wealthy individuals further enriching themselves through this activity.  It needs to be tackled.  That is one of the reasons I welcomed the comment about examining the protections afforded by the Constitution to private property.  CPOs have been mentioned.  I am not necessarily in favour of limiting ourselves to CPOs that end up with us paying top dollar for land.  Some people have profiteered from hoarding land, so the State acquiring it at rates that are nowhere near to top dollar market rates is in the interests of society and those who are suffering during the housing crisis.<\/p> <p>  I noted carefully Mr. Geaney's comments about eight years on the housing waiting list not being exceptional in Cork.  If we could get a breakdown of those figures, it would be interesting.  I suspect that, when we examine them forensically, we will probably see that a period of ten or 12 years is not exceptional either.  I cited the example of firefighters, nurses and teachers being unable to afford to buy in Cork city.<\/p> <p>  Let us get down to the brass tacks.  We have land, albeit not a lot, in the council's ownership.  The last large council landbank is on the Old Whitechurch Road.<\/p><p>Given the points that have been made about affordability and people being locked out of the market, even people on average wages, and given the idea of a social housing waiting list with nearly 4,000 people on it, on which spending eight years is not at all exceptional, the use of 100% of those public lands for public housing - by which I mean council housing and units genuinely affordable for working people, which the State contracts a builder for and provides at cost price - is clearly needed.<\/p><p> I am completely opposed to the Land Development Agency ratio of 60:30:10.  I will ask a question about this in a moment.  If a ratio of 60:30:10 was applied to the Old Whitechurch Road, it would mean the following.  If there were 600 houses, 360 would be priced at the market rate, which is unaffordable for very many.  Some 180 would be what the Government defines as \"affordable\", the market rate minus maybe &euro;50,000, which is still unaffordable for young people who have come out of college and worked for a couple of years and for older workers on the average wage.  For 10% to be social housing would mean providing 60 units when there is a housing list of nearly 4,000, with many people waiting for ten years or more.  I have a direct question for Mr. Geaney.  What is the envisaged mix on the Old Whitechurch Road, as an example of public lands in Cork?  Why would we not assign 100% of that site and similar sites to public housing, that is, council housing and genuinely affordable houses?<\/p><p> A long list of sites was provided by the speakers from Cork City Council, belonging to the HSE, ESB, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, the Port of Cork, Bord na M&oacute;na and the Department of Defence.  One of the biggest concentrations of State-owned land outside of local authority control in the State is in the Cork area.  A lot of it is NAMA-owned, though not exclusively.  The Land Development Agency is being set up so that those public lands will be privatised, with at least 60% going to developers for resale at market rates.  I would love to see a situation where the likes of Cork City Council could play a central role in building on those lands and overseeing the development of 100% social and genuinely affordable public housing because clearly that is needed.  I wonder if the speakers from the city council would like to comment on that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#U00600","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I know there were a lot of questions, so I am not criticising witnesses for not giving an answer.  However it is worth getting an answer to dramatise the problem we are facing with waiting times in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, because they are shocking.  A wait of eight years is shocking.  That relates to the question about the plans for direct public housing provision by the local authority itself.  I accept that we need affordable housing.  Of course we do.  People who are not eligible for the list have to be housed, and even more so when the median price in D&uacute;n Laoghaire is &euro;527,000.  However, if we are trying to meet the demand to reduce those shockingly high lists, it seems to me that the planned council housing provision cannot impact in any significant way on them.  On a site where we could have got 500-odd units we will get 200.  After Shanganagh I do not see where the rest is coming from.  The witness said that 197 are coming down the line.  Re-lets will account for 150.  I was not quite clear on how many Part V units we hoped to get.  If we add it all up, we might get 1,500 over the next two or three years if we are lucky.  So much for council housing, against a list on which people have been waiting for 17 years.  I do not see how we are going to get anywhere close.  In the intervening years more people will join the list, which will further reduce the impact we have on it.  We have to have a plan to house anybody on that list.  We do not have one.  One way or another, we have to ramp up the planned provision of public housing.  I would like the witnesses to answer that.  I know part of this is to do with Government policy, but that seems to be a statement of the obvious fact that we are not going to be able to meet the need for public housing.<\/p> <p>  On affordable housing, do we not have a real dilemma?  The witnesses are alluding to it.  They have to be careful in what they say but if &euro;50,000 below the average price is considered affordable, and the average or median price in D&uacute;n Laoghaire is &euro;527,000, \"affordable\" means nothing in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  It is complete nonsense.  We cannot deliver affordable housing on that basis, at Shanganagh or anywhere else.  We have to have another scheme.  Clearly the Government scheme cannot deliver affordable housing on the basis of that price minus &euro;50,000.  To what extent does that conundrum slow up progress at Shanganagh, and is it likely to slow up other sites?  In other words, how can we get the affordable housing we want to get, when we cannot get it because it is totally unaffordable?<\/p> <p>  The D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown submission states that as part of the public spending code we have to consider public private partnerships, PPP.  Could the witnesses elaborate on that?  I want to know what that means.  Does that mean that when we are looking at Shanganagh we have to consider the possibility of selling part of it off in order to finance the unaffordable affordable housing and the public housing?  That is a mess.  In that context, would it not be easier to just build council houses?  Then we would just have to go to the Department and say we are building 500 council houses.  Maybe we would need to alter the eligibility scheme for it, maybe we could even decide on our own affordable scheme afterwards.  However, that mess seems to be delaying the whole process. <\/p> <p>  Lastly, I take Ms Henchy's point Mary on Cherrywood.  However, is it not fair to say that we have no control over when housing is going to be delivered there?  Hines has just flipped some of the land to Cairn Homes, and Cairn Homes has told its own shareholders that it is drip-feeding to keep the price up.  They have actually told the shareholders they will drip-feed and not build all of it out, in order to keep the value of the property up and to keep the dividends flowing to the shareholders.  Is it fair to say we have absolutely no control over that?  Is there anything we can do to take hold of that process?  Ms Henchy can remind me of the planning permission that did go through with Hines.  Was it 1,200 units?  I am told it will start at the end of the month.  When are we getting the Part V allocation from that?  Will that come upfront?  What price will we pay for it?  Has that been negotiated yet?  It has been bandied around that Hines will sell the houses back to the council for up to &euro;430,000, on land that was originally sold to them by NAMA.  Can the witnesses give us any further information on that? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#V00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":395,"content":"<p>It might be worth the while of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire people here, Deputy Boyd Barrett, Senator Boyhan and myself, to meet with the witnesses again about Cherrywood.

The fast-track planning process has facilitated this.  The amount of student accommodation coming onstream and that has been built is very much welcome.  It takes students out of the private rental sector, which eases that for us.  It is also recognised in the CSO figures because it is shared accommodation and does not come under the principal builds.  It is never really included although a huge volume is coming through.<\/p> <p>  When it comes to affordability this is where I disagree with Deputy Boyd Barrett.  Affordability is based on the cost of the land and the cost of the development.  It is not necessarily the average price in that area.  We can have different figures on different sites.  A substantial proposal was made by a number of councillors in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, including John Bailey and Michael Merrigan, which was supported by the 40 members of the local authority.  It looked at affordable purchase, affordable rent to buy, social housing and step-down housing for older people.  While the concept will have to be tweaked in some shape or form to make it happen, where is the scheme with regard to the Department because we are getting mixed responses on it?<\/p> <p>  When it comes to appropriate use of land, is there a scheme for the Mount Anville depot site in Goatstown?

That has taken two years but it has provided certainty.  We now have a preferred bidder who, all going well and working to the timeline we have discussed, will be on site in June.  It is a two and a three quarter year process to get on site.  If we were to manage design, approval and permission for something similar I could not quite quantify it.  I believe we will manage it in tracts and it would not be to compare like with like.  We do not envisage a scheme where we have the resources to manage the complexity of more than 1,000 units.  We will not be able to compare the two.<\/p> <p>  In terms of affordability we will have to go to the market at some stage to determine the price at which homes will be built.  The market will determine that and the affordability is a question of a percentage or fixed amount of it.  There is variability.  South Dublin County Council has a different consideration to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and we look to apply an appropriate percentage.  We are very much aware of this.  This brings in the service sites fund and offsetting costs.  We have signalled our intent to utilise the fund in 2019 on the four large sites I mentioned.  We have some concern about what will happen the land we put in and whether we will get full value back for it.  We must work that out fully with the Department.  It is a concern.<\/p> <p>  In the overall context of the impact, we have outlined 800 home build units.  We have approximately 200 re-lets per annum so that would be 800 if we are speaking about 2021 as a timeframe.  We have 500 Part V units and approximately 400 approved housing body units.  We have our large sites which will yield thousands.  People on the housing list will graduate to affordable housing when the schemes are onstream.

I do not see the end purchasers of the units necessarily being a complicating factor.  It is welcome that the Land Development Agency proposes to fund the development of some sites.  I see the issue as being who will pay the development costs.  If it is the private sector that will necessitate the procurement process of joint ventures and public-private partnerships and there is no avoiding it.  If it is public money we can go more directly to market and engage with it to build the units and ultimately decide how the units are used and whether they are sold on or used as social housing.

For example, the 30 unit scheme that I referred to earlier for downsizing had Part 8 approval from our members on 31 July last year and will be delivered before the end of the year.   There is a good timeline and good experience with that.

Like South Dublin and Fingal, Cork City Council has not availed of the &euro;2 million single stage process for the reasons outlined earlier.  On cost rental, we are lucky with the housing association in Blackpool.  Rents are being looked at and due to the volume of social housing on the site, some could be made available for cost rental, at probably 25% to 30% under market value.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#X00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Geaney"},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":409,"content":"<p>Is it a single rent or bands of rents?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018101700002#X00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1539763200,"counter":410,"content":"<p>Bands of rent are being looked at, depending on household income.<\/p> <p>  With regard to significant landholding on Old Whitechurch Road, Deputy Barry is aware that Part 8 development has now been advertised for to have the major infrastructural works on the site carried out.

As the Chairman said, our president, Joe Healy, has been held up, but we hope he will get here before we finish.  I understand he had a meeting with the T&aacute;naiste at Iveagh House this morning and that meeting was held up due to the T&aacute;naiste having an interview on \"Morning Ireland\".  He will try to get here as soon as he can.  As the Chairman said, I am joined by Barry Carey, the IFA crime prevention officer.<\/p> <p>  The committee is aware of the real anxiety among the farming community and rural communities generally over crime in the countryside.  Theft of valuables from rural homes and of livestock and machinery from farms is a major concern.  Many farmers and other rural dwellers are living in fear for their personal safely and the safety of their families.  That is why it is so important that this is addressed as a matter of urgency.<\/p> <p>  Farm crimes reported include instances of farm machinery being reported as stolen and vehicle theft; theft of livestock, including instances of cattle rustling; and burglaries and break-ins to farm houses.  We believe there is considerable under-reporting of rural crime, in particular for the theft of machinery, fuels and other items from farmyards and lesser break-ins to the family home.  The increase in the theft of agricultural equipment and livestock can be financially devastating for farmers, who, like all rural dwellers, are very vulnerable when it comes to criminality.<\/p><p>This vulnerability is compounded by geographic and service isolation.  It is the IFA's contention that rural dwellers and farmers are not guaranteed the same level of service and security that applies in urban areas.<br\/><br\/>There is also a requirement for the more accurate reporting of crimes committed in rural areas.  All vehicle crimes are recorded on the PULSE system as &quot;Unlawful Taking of a Vehicle&quot;.  The IFA has called for the separate classification of rural crimes to give a more accurate account of the problems that exist.<br\/><br\/>Earlier this year, we made a submission to the Policing Authority on the policing plan for 2019 in which we set down key priorities and made recommendations on organisational development and capacity improvement, confronting crime, roads policing, and community policing and public safety.  The IFA also presented the proposals to the Commission on the Future of Policing.<br\/><br\/>Over the past year, several serious incidents have occurred on farms.  The quality of crime investigations in such incidents needs to be addressed.  Some alarming issues were noted across various districts, such as slow responses; boundary issues where incidents have occurred within a short distance, perhaps 1 km, of a Garda station and are passed on to a station 22 km away, as a result of which culprits and persons of interest were not apprehended; a quite apparent lack of knowledge of industry, farming and rural practices by investigating members during follow-up investigations; and no report back or incident updates to affected persons.  To address these issues and to improve the quality of crime investigation, the IFA recommends that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na be given the necessary resources and training on the nature, structure and profile of farming, agriculture and rural life.  The IFA has offered to assist in supporting the development of a module and recommends that a separate rural, farming and agricultural unit be included in recruitment training at the national Garda College.<br\/><br\/>Throughout 2017, there continued to be an increase of thefts of livestock, machinery, tools and equipment.  Cross-Border crime continues to be a major part of this.  Items recovered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Ireland have come from the UK and Northern Ireland.  Items stolen in Ireland have been intercepted <i>en route<\/i>to Northern Ireland.  The IFA recommends additional support in the form of a more streamlined crime reporting system, immediate sharing of intelligence, and information exchange which would increase the level of visibility and awareness, particularly where agricultural crime has been reported in Border areas.  The IFA believes that greater interagency cross-Border co-operation between the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, customs on both sides of the Border, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service Northern Ireland, PSNI, would be instrumental in tackling this type of cross-Border crime.<br\/><br\/>As we approach Brexit D-Day, there is a requirement for a full review of all operational structures.  Should border controls for trade and immigration be reintroduced, additional resources will be required, such as an increase in manpower, vehicles, aircraft and technological equipment, such as CCTV systems for vehicles.  In addition, equipment will be required to ensure facial recognition to observe, monitor and manage all the Border crossings by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in conjunction with other agencies.<br\/><br\/>The level of sophistication of cybercrime, both here in Ireland and internationally, is of great concern to all communities.  The IFA believes it is important for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be fully resourced on all aspects of the risks associated with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's payment systems, specifically, the increasing volume of farm business now carried out online.<br\/><br\/>The IFA has been proactive in the area of crime prevention in joint initiatives with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, such as Crimestoppers, community text alerts and Theftstop.  The IFA recommends that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engage with rural communities more frequently to promote a greater awareness of crime prevention so that there would be a national and local communications plan using television, radio and print to demonstrate crime preventative measures, give updates on current crime trends and highlight successful preventions, convictions and prosecutions; and continued engagement with communities through meetings, events, rural shows.<br\/><br\/>There is a major requirement for the development of a national strategy around community visibility and supports available to local communities.  The recent success of Operation Thor is proof that intense patrolling of national primary routes is vital in the fight against crime.  The identification of road networks used by criminal elements and the ease with which they can travel from city to city in short periods must be curtailed.  The IFA recommends the greater use of community CCTV schemes supported by the Department of Justice and Equality which would give An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na greater coverage of specific areas.  Remote visual monitoring and in-station viewing would also be effective tools in combating crime.<br\/><br\/>The lack of Garda presence or patrols in certain communities is affecting public confidence.  The IFA's network of 946 branches have made it known that the lack of Garda visibility in rural Ireland is worrying.  There is a need for greater patrolling of rural Ireland.  Farmers need to see a greater presence of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the road.  The IFA proposes the deployment of additional resources in terms of manpower, vehicles and equipment.  This can be achieved by increasing the Garda Reserve to achieve greater community engagement and thereby supporting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with local involvement and assistance in the overall community policing plan.  In the UK, the various police constabularies have exactly the same rural crime issues as we have here in Ireland.  To address this, a small but effective rural crime task force has been established within the police forces to tackle specific issues.  The National Farmers Union has been actively engaged at community level in supporting this initiative by assisting the task force with intelligence and reporting of suspicious activities.  I am calling for the support of the committee to establish a similar type of Garda operation to tackle rural crime in Ireland which would provide for additional Garda presence and resources in rural communities; the targeting of criminal gangs operating in rural communities; a review of sentencing for rural crimes and repeat offenders; a review of bail conditions for repeat offenders; a review of Garda divisional boundaries; and a national Garda policy on criminal lurching and trespass.<br\/><br\/>The IFA will continue to campaign for support from elected representatives and Government to protect rural dwellers and businesses.  Today we are seeking further engagement from this committee on the IFA's activities on rural crime prevention, together with its support for the IFA's initiatives in this area.  We look forward to a constructive discussion with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101700002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Richard Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kennedy.

I refer to divisional differences and even differences within the branches within the PSNI.  They do not talk to each other to tackle problems as they appear.  Has the IFA explored that kind of work with its colleagues in the UFU?

That message rings out loud and clear from every area.  We were grappling with how the Garda should better use its resources in the new era with fewer resources, closed Garda stations and with a lot more happening on social media.  I do not deny what Mr. Kennedy is saying about many people in rural areas living in fear and that happens in Dublin as well but the point that the Garda was trying to make was to ask what the basis for that fear was - whether it was based on fear itself or on a rise in crime.  The Garda said that there has actually been a reduction in crime in rural areas so while it is the case that people in rural areas are in fear we should not be whipping that up or making it worse than it already is.  Could the reason for that fear be linked to other forms of isolation which would lead one to believe that if the problem is just fear and isolation then good neighbours, more interaction and more community spirit is a way of addressing that fear?  If it is more crime and violence then more garda&iacute; are the solution.

The capabilities are not in the system to classify a crime that occurred in a rural area as a rural crime.  For example, there has been a spate of Toyota Land Cruisers stolen in the north Dublin, Meath and Louth area over the last period of time.

I welcome Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Carey here and even though I was not physically here when they started talking I was listening to them on the monitor in my office and I agree with everything they have said.  There has been an increase in rural crime and where I come from we all agree that the closure of Garda stations, lack of squad cars and the lack of visibility of and availability of the local garda&iacute; has led to this.  That is fine where we have it and it is not fine where we do not have it but I will go back to my home place of Kilgarvan.  Even though there was only one garda in the local station for many years there was a lot of activity there and people knew that the Garda were around.  There is no problem with me mentioning that the name of the last garda who was there was Garda Tom McDonnell and he was in our parish for about 40 years.  People did not know when he would arrive because he was in his own car and he was around the place calling to people.  He interacted with people and he had his own sources of information.<\/p><p>He knew everything that was going on in the parish.  That is all lost to us now.<\/p><p> A place like Sneem, half an hour from Kenmare, is an hour and a quarter away from Killarney.  If the Garda car in Kenmare is out, people in Sneem will have to ring Killarney if something happens.  The phone is helping criminals.  The fellow in Kenmare knows which way the Garda car has gone and he can ring the fellow who is near to Sneem or wherever else.  Sneem is a sitting duck, as is Lauragh, which is 16 miles from the town of Kenmare where the Garda station was, and 32 miles from Castletownbere.  If the Garda car in Kenmare is in use on a task, the road back to Castletownbere is wide open.<\/p><p> What we need to get across is how an elderly person is affected when his or her home is broken into and ransacked.  In the case of two fine gentleman living very near to where Deputy O'Callaghan's father came from, their house was broken into on a Sunday while they were at mass.  They were always confident and still work hard but their confidence is totally shattered because none of those who broke into their house has been found.  The house of two other gentlemen living close by was also broken into lately.  They will not stay in their own home at night.  They have to go down the road to their niece's house, which is crowded, but their confidence is gone and they will not stay in their house any more.  We all hear about the increase in Garda numbers but we worry that these garda&iacute; will be directed to urban areas.  I met a man the other day who said he got home heating oil and he asked if he should lock the tank.  We decided that if people are going to take his oil, they will do so.  He is resigned to having his heating oil stolen and he will be lucky if it is not stolen before Christmas.<\/p><p> Sentences and penalties are wrong too.  Criminals are not being penalised and I know Mr. Kennedy will agree with me.  Many of the those who are apprehended have done it before.  They may be out on bail and it is no bother since they will get free legal aid.  These fellows should be just locked up and the key thrown away if they are serial offenders.  I have made that point in the Chamber.  They have such an effect on elderly people and the community around them.<\/p><p> I am thankful to the Irish Farmers Association for sending these two gentlemen here today.  I do not agree with Deputy Daly that we are whipping up fear or anything like that.  We do not have to do that.  People in rural areas are suffering because of the reduction in the number of garda&iacute; available in rural places.  We are looking for an extra car in Kenmare but that is not good enough.  In Kilgarvan, Sneem and Lauragh, there was a garda with his own car.  That is no longer the case and the criminals know too well where everyone is and they are ready to pounce when they know the garda&iacute; on duty have gone in another direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101700002#F01200","speaker":"1320","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I did not accuse anybody of whipping up fear.

Mr. Barry Carey got that message across very strongly.  They also shone a light on the interesting issue of boundaries and I thank them for that.  This is information the witnesses would glean from those they represent.  As it has not always filtered its way through in terms of our elected experience, it was helpful that the witnesses raised it.  On the cross-Border issue, the witnesses referred to the departments of agriculture, customs, and the two police services, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, respectively.  On the issue of text alert, which plays an important part in rural Ireland's response to a perceived threat or an incident, is there a cross-Border link-up?

We welcome the opportunity to engage with the committee on the topic of community policing and rural crime.  There is no doubt that many in rural communities are living in fear of violent assault and crime and that many more are frustrated by the level of property theft in isolated rural locations.  There is a sense that the Garda is under-resourced, which is leaving rural communities vulnerable, and, worse, that criminals are operating with impunity.  Criminals are rarely caught because the resources to investigate are too scarce.  When they are caught, the justice system seems to bend over backwards to be lenient.<\/p> <p>  Last year, the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, ICSA, in conjunction with Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, published a series of reports on crime relating to agriculture.  The reports were authored by Dr. Kathleen Moore-Walsh and Louise Walsh of WIT.  The reports were based on a survey of 861 farmers across Ireland in late 2016 and they make for stark reading.  The first report found that: 66% had experienced some form of crime which impacted them or their farms; 41% of respondents had been the victim of a crime more than once; and that while theft, vandalism and criminal damage were the most prevalent types of crime, 5% experienced criminal assault, which was 76 cases.<\/p> <p>  The second report quantified the average value of theft of property from farms at &euro;1,818 and that incidents of vandalism and criminal damage cost farmers &euro;360 on average.  This report also highlighted the fact that a significant level of crime relating to agriculture is not reported to insurance companies, with 94 incidents of theft and 348 incidents of vandalism, criminal damage or trespass going unreported.  This reflects that fact that the cost of claiming against one's insurance is perceived as not being worth it due to fears of higher insurance premiums in the future.<\/p> <p>  The third report showed that farmers were also reluctant to report crime to the Garda.  Some 45% of respondents did not report instances of crime to the Garda.  The reasons can be summed as a sense of hopelessness that anything will be done.  The level of recovery of stolen assets was 8% among the respondents.<\/p> <p>  The ICSA-WIT reports show that rural crime is very much underestimated in official figures from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They also very much indicate that criminal activity is widespread and that the impact is felt by many in rural Ireland.  Farmers are especially vulnerable.<\/p> <p>  While we are all aware of the terrifying ordeals of individuals attacked in their own homes or on their properties, there is a lot less awareness that farmers are regularly intimidated by trespassers on their land.  The ICSA regularly hears from members about uninvited individuals coming onto their land with lurchers or with the apparent intention of shooting birds or lamping foxes.  Many feel that this is just a front to size up a farm and its assets.<\/p> <p>  I do not want to over-dramatise matters but most country people will tell you they are living in fear of someone driving onto their property or of being attacked in their homes in the middle of the night.  There is no doubt that people feel that the Garda has inadequate resources.  The problem is not so much the closure of Garda stations but the time it takes to get a squad car out when something goes wrong.  The feeling among many is that it is better to call a neighbour than to call the Garda when one feels threatened.<\/p> <p>  Many farmers are spending money trying to make their premises more secure but solutions are not cheap for individual farm families.  A number of communities have come together to install CCTV cameras.  There is a scheme to grant aid this kind of initiative but so far uptake has been low.  That communities have to do a great deal of fundraising to provide matching funds and the an ongoing cost is a real problem.<\/p> <p>  The ICSA encourages farmers to mark their vehicles and farm machinery.  There are ways of doing this so that a stolen vehicle can be identified.  The markings are not obvious to thieves when they are stealing vehicles or machinery.  However, there is no substitute for having garda&iacute; on the ground.  We need local communities to be on first-name terms with garda&iacute;.  The ICSA is concerned that restrictions on Garda overtime are impacting on the force's ability to fight crime and be on the case rapidly.  We want a greater Garda presence in rural areas and we want officers to have the ability to respond to calls for help as fast as possible.<\/p> <p>  The ICSA is also concerned that criminals who continuously reoffend get treated too lightly by the criminal justice system.  All too often, we see crime committed by individuals who should be in jail.  We want to see stiffer sentencing for repeat offenders.  The purpose of the criminal justice system should also be about protecting innocent people in their homes.<\/p> <p>  The one message I want to get across loud and clear, it is that rural crime continues to be a major issue.  The ICSA reports show that we should not assume that Garda figures on crime tell the whole story.  People in rural Ireland are living in fear and it is time to prioritise the fight against crime, to deliver enough resources to the Garda and to crack down on reoffending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101700002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Sherlock"},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":542,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Sherlock.

From my experience, strong communities that engage will fight the challenges of crime more than anything the Garda can do.  One is never going to get the Garda numbers one would like.  Of course, there should be a greater Garda presence in the countryside.  However, as was stated in the earlier session, the amount of funding given to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is on foot of a political decision.  In the absence of sufficient State funding for policing, should greater effort be put into building stronger communities?  There would be less isolation in rural areas if there were more communication between people.  In northern Italy, there is far more community spirit.  Older people in that region spend a great deal of time together.  They come together to, for example, talk or have coffee and they know each other better.  In Ireland, there is more isolation.

There is no question about it and nobody doubts that the fear is totally real.  The question with which we must grapple is how to deal with it.  In some ways, what seems to be coming out of this discussion is that this is as much an indictment of how we treat older citizens and about the erosion of community in towns and, more especially, rural areas.  It is all about community policing and we probably need to join the dots on that.<\/p> <p>  The WIT study is really interesting.  It is very important to have facts to inform whatever actions we take.  In terms of the responses to the survey, for 66% of people the issue was burglary and that type of crime.  There was quite a big drop when it came to issues like assault and obviously, we do not want that gap to narrow.  In terms of the survey, to what degree was it the case that people who had been impacted upon by crime were more inclined to respond?  Is that why the percentages are so high?  The fact that the percentages were so high may have been because those who had been victims of crime were more enthused and more likely to complete the survey.

Do the witnesses have any views on restorative justice?  Have they analysed that?  In the context of their analysis of who is committing these so-called agricultural crimes, is it mostly gangs?  Is it groups of people working collectively and targeting with a particular market in mind?  Is that type of gang crime - with a small \"g\" - much more likely in rural than urban areas?  What analysis has been done on that to date?  In terms of restorative justice, is there a perception among people that if a tractor is stolen, the owner can get the money back through insurance or whatever and that those stealing it are not doing any real harm?  Is it the case that the people committing these crimes do not realise the devastating effect their actions can have, even in terms of the financial viability of a family farm?  It is a bit like fellas stealing from the boss and thinking that is not a real crime because losses can be recouped through insurance.

In some instances, a gang of criminals will drive onto a farm in a van, approach the farmer and tell him to get out of the way while they are taking whatever they want.  That sort of behaviour is unthinkable.  These are bully boys - shouting and roaring.  We are talking about vulnerable people.  The criminals always seem to know where to go, to farmers who are getting on a bit in age or living alone or living with, for example, elderly sisters.  They are vulnerable people who have no hope of defending themselves.  The gangs are coming in and raping the place.  People know that they can no longer leave the gate open but we are now at the stage in rural Ireland where farmers have to lock up everything if they have to go down to their fields to cut a bit of hay or check their cattle.  I know farmers who have come up out of their fields to find guys siphoning the diesel out of their tanks.  They say, \"Grandad, stay out of the way; we will be another five minutes\".  Those farmers will never sleep soundly again.  I cannot imagine the mental effect that must have on people who are getting on in age.  They are living in beautiful locations in rural Ireland but they are completely alone.  I can see the fear in their eyes.<\/p> <p>  To put is simply, we would hold a lot of meetings in rural Ireland and rural crime would not be on the agenda at all but it always comes up.  Someone will put up his or her hand and ask what can be done about the crime.  It always ends up on the agenda.  I have rarely attended a meeting in rural Ireland in the past 18 months at which rural crime has not been discussed.  It is being discussed because it is so widespread, although people might not want to acknowledge that.  To be honest, it is not all about stealing either.  Illegal dumping is also a huge problem and that is a crime as far as we are concerned.  Farmers will ring us and tell us that eight or ten black bags have been chucked over the hedge, that the cattle have opened them up and the rubbish is blowing all over the fields.  That can do damage to livestock and to machinery.  It also involves trespass.<\/p> <p>  In terms of trespass, there are also fellows coming in at night, lamping foxes or chasing hares with hounds.  They are leaving gates open and letting stock out onto the roads, which is a huge problem.  They are damaging property.  We have all heard of the high-profile case in north Dublin where a farmer went out and asked a group of people to leave and he was allegedly knocked out for his sins.  We know of a lot of guys who see the lamps going around their fields at night but they are afraid to go out because they are living alone and they do not know who they are facing.  As far as we are concerned, that is every bit as much a crime as breaking into a house.  Garda&iacute; might say, \"That's only trespass\" but it is a lot more to the farmer.  He could have ewes in lamb or cows in calf and anyone who knows farming knows that lights at night can terrify stock.  Cattle could run through barbed wire fences and get cut up.  God forbid, if gates are opened up, cattle could go out onto a main road and kill someone.  These are the issues facing already struggling and hardship stricken farmers in rural Ireland.  These are the calls I am getting on a weekly basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2018101700002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Sherlock"},{"type":"speech","time":1539763200,"counter":556,"content":"<p>It is really important that Mr. Sherlock raised these issues here.

There is not enough education in this area and that is something that we raised with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na last week.

The sense of security that a CCTV community alert group brings to an area cannot be overemphasised.  It also helps An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when it comes to investigating crime.  It will help with regard to what garda&iacute; might consider a minor issue but which is significant to a farmer, particularly in terms of trespass.  If there is one message that we want to impart, it is the importance of sorting out that scheme.  It is so difficult at the moment.  Two applications are required and it costs a community up to &euro;2,500 just to apply to the scheme.<\/p><p>It is so slow.  We have the county councils clashing with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as to who is responsible for it.  There is an awful lot of money that needs to go into this, but it is so important and so successful, and the more of these we have throughout the country, the better it will be for the residents of the country and for crime in general.

I live in the city myself but my cousins are farmers who live on an island, so they are a little more protected from rural crime than others.  Fear is a huge factor.  Deputy Wallace spoke about people looking in the window of his mother's home.  People coming onto land and looking in the kitchen window inspire fear.  If Deputy Wallace's mother told people in the town about her experience, then the fear would spread.  Even if nothing happens, there is huge anxiety.  All of a sudden people close their doors, which breaks down a community.  People are terrified.  They might connect with each other on phones or by text message but they are more isolated.<\/p> <p>  From listening to the two presentations, it appears that the situation is getting worse and there is not much support.  The IFA said earlier that more people are not reporting because nothing is done.  I refer to burglaries where farming equipment is taken.  The impact of such incidents is significant.

We get communities to come together.  Every rural dweller must be conscious of his or her security.  Unfortunately, we are now at a stage where gates have to be locked all the time, even if one is only going to the local shop - if there is a local shop anymore.  People are literally locking themselves in, especially farmers.  I often have to ring farmers to ask them to come out and open the gate for me.  They are locked in.  Every farmer now has to have a proper shed with a proper steel door to store all their valuables.<\/p> <p>  I have spoken to many farmers who on getting home realise that somebody was in the yard because something has been moved.  In some cases nothing has been stolen but it has a negative effect on people when they think somebody was walking around their yard.  People remember where they left a pitchfork, for example.  They tell me that someone has been in the yard.  If a man living alone had a cow calving, he might think twice about getting up at 3 a.m.  Many farmers say they would not and would take a chance on the cow being all right because they would not like to go out in case someone was outside.<\/p> <p>  Ms Starnes will speak in due course about CCTV, but for us as an organisation it is all about community and working with the local community police.  We have no choice at this time.  Many people feel they are on their own and they have to do the best they can.  It is a question of survival for many older people.  Many people say to me that they hope they can see their days out without being attacked.  That is very sad and it affects me very much when I drive home from meetings having heard vulnerable people say, for example, that they are 72 and they hope they see their lives out without being beaten up or attacked.  That is so sad for men and women who have worked so hard.  Some people lived abroad and came back to this country.  Many of them have family but the family have moved away.  The local post offices are gone, as is the Garda station.  In some rural areas it could be 15 or 20 miles to the nearest petrol station.  I do not say we can bring all that back at once but that is where we are leaving vulnerable people who find themselves left behind.

If, for example, something goes missing in Northern Ireland, it can easily be traced right across Europe as common scanners for the system are held by the police.  The system has recently been introduced here.  We have done a bit of work on it in that we have negotiated a deal with the company to apply discounts for our members so that it is more affordable for them to mark their vehicles.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has welcomed the introduction of CESAR, but it requires extra resources, for example, additional technology for the Garda so the members have a scanner to read it.  The system provides a deterrent and it has a tracker which it is hoped means people can recover items.

Even on the news we often see the Garda displaying a couple of hundred items, including smaller stuff like drills rather than farm machinery, and the owner cannot be found.  The problem is some farmers are not marking the equipment and others are not even admitting it was stolen.  Many farmers tell me a chainsaw might have been five or six years old and they would have a new one bought in the time they took to report it stolen.

This is a new committee shadowing a new Department and we hope to follow the roadmap set out in the 2016 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, report entitled Review of budget oversight by parliament: Ireland.  The committee will consider the mid-year position in terms of expenditure and performance outputs.  The committee is also interested in looking at the link between expenditure and performance following international best practice.  As well as considering this budget year, 2018, the committee will also consider 2017 and it will look to 2019 and the following years.<\/p> <p>  I propose that the Minister for Rural and Community Development will first make his opening statement.  This will be followed by a question and answer session structured as followed: outputs and expenditure will be examined programme by programme; and members will be called upon to ask questions on the subheads under the relevant programme and administrative subheads.  The committee will consider the Minister's statement and a brief supplied by the Department.  The committee must adjourn not later than 1 p.m. because another committee is due to commence shortly afterwards.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  <\/p> <p>  I welcome the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Michael Ring.  I also welcome Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney who is the Minister of State at the Department of Rural and Community Development and Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.

I also want to thank the former Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, on the great job that he did.  I wish him well in his new appointment as Government Whip and Minister of State at the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht with responsibility for the Gaeltacht.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for its invitation to attend to discuss the mid-year expenditure review for the Department.  It has circulated a short briefing note to members which includes a summary of the programme areas and sets out expenditure to the end of September.  <\/p><p> This has been a year of considerable activity and achievement in the Department.  Although Deputies will be aware that it is only a little over a year old, we have made significant progress in bringing it to full operation in that time, while delivering on the ground for communities and rural Ireland.  The mission of the Department is even more important as we look at the challenges facing the country and the actions we need to take to ensure a sustainable and high quality of life for all citizens wherever they choose to live and work. <\/p><p> With regard to the allocation for the Department, gross expenditure of &euro;231.532 million is budgeted for 2018.  This consists of &euro;144.024 million in current expenditure and &euro;87.508 million in capital expenditure.  In addition, provision has been made for a capital carryover of &euro;7.7 million which supplements the provision in the Estimate. <\/p><p> As requested, the committee has been provided with information on expenditure by my Department to the end of September, at which point the total gross spend was &euro;144.34 million.  This was made up of &euro;116.2 million in current expenditure and &euro;28 million in capital expenditure.  <\/p><p> With regard to actual expenditure compared to profile, at the end of September current expenditure was at 92% of profile and capital expenditure at 62%.  Given the fact that capital expenditure has been falling behind profile, I have prioritised this issue within the Department.  I am pleased to note that there has been a significant increase in capital expenditure since the end of September, which was to be expected.  The focus in the earlier part of the year was on assessing applications and making approvals under schemes and now the bills are coming in.  I will outline the most recent figures available to me at the close of this statement. <\/p><p> It is just as important to focus today on what the Department has delivered for communities since its establishment, as well as reflecting on some of the challenges we have faced and how we have addressed them.  I will try to keep these remarks short to allow time for discussion with members. <\/p><p> Throughout 2018 I have focused on the twin policy goals of improved rural development and community development.  On rural development, an important focus of work has been to develop and launch the new rural regeneration and development fund.  This &euro;1 billion fund was established under Project Ireland 2040 and will support ambitious projects that can drive the economic and social development of rural towns, villages and their surrounding areas.  The fund provides an exceptional opportunity to support the revitalisation of rural Ireland, make a significant and sustainable impact on rural communities and help make smaller towns, villages and rural areas good places in which to live and work.  Initial funding of &euro;315 million will be allocated to the fund in the period 2019 to 2022 on a phased basis.  The provisions for the Department in budget 2019 have allowed me to allocate &euro;55 million for the fund in 2019.  The closing date for applications under the first call for the fund was 27 September and there has been strong interest across the country.  There have been around 290 applications, of which around 125 are for category 1 projects - shovel ready projects - and around 165 are for category 2 projects - projects that need initial development funding to become potential category 1 applications in future calls for the fund.  Clear assessment criteria have been published and a project advisory board has been established which will oversee the assessment of applications for the fund.  The board is made up of representatives from key Departments, with a number of external experts.  On receipt of recommendations for funding from the board, I expect to be in a position to announce an initial number of successful applications in November, with further announcements to follow.  <\/p><p> While the rural regeneration and development fund is hugely important for the future development of rural Ireland, I remain just as focused on ensuring the continued success of existing schemes and programmes.  For example, this year I have approved 224 projects under the town and village renewal scheme to the value &euro;21 million.  I have also approved 389 projects up to a value of &euro;12 million across a series of measures under the CL&Aacute;R programme.  The town and village renewal scheme is an important part of the Government&rsquo;s work to rejuvenate rural Ireland and is having a significant impact on towns and villages across the country.  The benefit of previous funding under the town and village renewal scheme is being felt countrywide.  Since it was introduced in the second half of 2016, almost &euro;53 million has been approved for more than 670 projects across the country.<\/p><p> The LEADER programme is a very important part of the work of my Department.  Activity under the programme has increased significantly since the second half of 2017.  Over 1,300 projects have been approved by the local action groups, to a value of &euro;43.4 million.  There are another 300 or so projects, with a value of over &euro;20 million, going through the approval process.  The large volume of projects being approved shows that the changes I have made to the programme are working.  The changes have simplified the approval process to be followed by local action groups and LEADER programme applicants and greatly reduced the burden of administrative checks for applicants.  The programme is delivering for rural communities.  However, despite this ramping up of the LEADER programme, expenditure in 2018 has been less than originally planned.  Therefore, I have recently reallocated funds from the LEADER programme to other programmes, namely, an additional &euro;8.6 million for the community enhancement programme and an additional &euro;4 million for library investment.  The LEADER programme is demand-led and I remain committed to supporting it.  I am confident that the full &euro;250 million available over the lifetime of the programme will be fully utilised. <\/p><p> The other rural development programmes which include the local improvement scheme, the walks scheme and the outdoor recreational infrastructure scheme are also having a real impact in towns, villages and rural areas across Ireland.  <\/p><p> With regard to the community development aspect of my work, as the committee is aware, the Department administers a range of programmes that support both individuals and the community and voluntary sector as a whole.  The community services programme and the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, are the two most significant in terms of expenditure.  The community services programme provides financial support for community organisations to deliver local services through a social enterprise model.  The funding supports the costs of employing a manager or a specific number of full-time equivalents.  The programme has a allocation of &euro;46 million in 2018.  It is benefiting over 400 organisation nationwide, with 1,600 people being supported by the programme. <\/p><p> The social inclusion and community activation programme provides funding to help individuals and communities in society who are experiencing disadvantage.  The programme works with people from groups such as disadvantaged women, disadvantaged children and families, lone parents, people with disabilities, those who have difficulties in finding employment, Roma and Travellers.  It has an allocation of &euro;43 million in 2018 and supports over 2,200 organisations and 27,000 people.  A key development for SICAP in 2018 was the publication of a major review by the ESRI.  The review looked at the role of SICAP in the context of other related Government schemes, the continuing suitability of the goals identified by SICAP and the governance structures used in it.  The review highlighted a number of areas for improvement such as the need for a greater focus on more intensive individual supports and flexibility to respond to the needs of target groups at local level.  They were built into the new SICAP programme that I launched this year. <\/p><p> I will also mention the very successful senior alerts scheme, for which I had originally allocated &euro;2.3 million at the start of 2018.  However, the scheme has been far more successful than originally envisaged and I will be allocating further funds for the programme.  It will be made up of &euro;2 million from the community services programme and &euro;1.75 million from the Dormant Accounts Fund allocation.  The funding allocated towards the seniors alert scheme has allowed over 13,000 people to benefit from it so far this year.<\/p><p> I will talk briefly about the new community enhancement programme which I launched this year.  It replaces and builds on two existing schemes.  Combining them has allowed a more flexible and targeted approach to be adopted to providing funding for the communities most in need.<\/p><p>The community enhancement programme provides capital funding for communities across Ireland to enhance facilities in disadvantaged areas.  It is administered by the 33 local community development committees, LCDCs.  In May it initially provided &euro;4.5 million in grant funding for 2018 towards enhancing the facilities available to communities.  However, as the programme was greatly oversubscribed, I reallocated &euro;8.6 million for it for other projects around the country.<\/p><p> We are having this meeting to focus on the mid-term review of expenditure.  The full details to the end of September have been provided in the briefing document sent to the committee.  As members can see, capital expenditure at the end of September was some way behind profile.  Close monitoring of the spend position is a significant priority for me and my officials.  There has been significant direct engagement with the chief executives of local authorities and close and frequent contacts with local authorities and the LEADER local action groups to ensure we have an accurate picture of the level of activity on the ground.  In that regard, the spend at the end of September does not reflect fully the value of expenditure incurred to date across projects that are now at or close to completion.  As the committee will be aware, many of the funding schemes operated by the Department involve a large number of individual projects.  A key factor is ensuring that, when they are completed, the claims for payment are issued in a prompt manner.  That will remain a priority for the rest of the year.  I am satisfied, on the basis of projections for the spend to year end, that there will be a full spend under the Vote in 2018.  The position on Friday, 28 September was that the capital spend stood at &euro;28 million, compared with a profiled spend of &euro;45 million.  The latest position is that, at close of business yesterday, the Department's capital spend for the year to date had reached &euro;48.6 million.  This represents a spend of &euro;20.5 million in October to date, which highlights the ramp-up that was expected at this time of the year.  I expect progress to continue in the coming weeks.<\/p><p> I have kept my remarks brief so as to allow a full discussion on the programmes and funding of my Department this year.  I emphasise that we are making good progress in monitoring capital expenditure.  I will ensure our allocations are fully spent this year, in the process delivering for communities and rural Ireland.<\/p><p> I call on my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney, to say a few words.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018101700002#A00600","speaker":"1334","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":600,"content":"<p>I, too, will keep my remarks brief.

Last week the Minister of State was sitting on this side of the table.  I congratulate him on his appointment.  It is an excellent one, as he brings great understanding of the challenges facing rural Ireland.  I wish him well in his brief.<\/p> <p>  Although it has been mentioned that rural Ireland faces challenges, I have always been one who sees the glass as half full.  There are considerable opportunities for rural Ireland.  The Minister outlined in a general way the capital and current funding being made available to support rural communities across Ireland.  It excites me.  While we hear much criticism, the Minister mentioned a number of schemes, including the community enhancement programme, library investment and the walks and outdoor recreational infrastructure schemes.  We cannot underestimate the value of such schemes to communities in giving them the capacity to exploit the potential of their towns, villages and rural areas.  That is not even to mention the town and village renewal scheme or the CL&Aacute;R programme.<\/p> <p>  I welcome how the Minister started a pilot programme last week for vacant buildings in villages and towns.  He included in their number Cappoquin in west County Waterford which I will use as an example, as I know it well.  It was once a thriving village.  It was the base of Cappoquin Chickens and there was considerable industry in it, but over many decades it failed.  We have seen the decay on the streets.  A former councillor, Ms Nora Flynn, who is a great advocate for rural Ireland has always pointed out that, unless we breathe new life into towns and villages and get young families back on their streets, these areas will continue to decay.  For the first time, last week the Minister recognised this when he established the pilot scheme.  It will build on the likes of the town and village renewal scheme, the CL&Aacute;R programme and many other schemes.  We will begin to see real progress in collaborating with communities in delivering regeneration on the streets.<\/p> <p>  The Minister might elaborate on a number of issues.  He has provided substantial funding - &euro;315 million in the next three years - for the rural regeneration fund.  He referred to \"ambitious projects,\" but I have a concern.  While I do not doubt that he and his officials have ambition, as they have proved by providing and ring-fencing this capital funding for ambitious projects, communities might not have the capacity and local authorities, LEADER groups and so on might not have the same level of ambition that he has.  He mentioned that more than 270 or 280 applications had been received for the rural regeneration fund.  That is welcome, but I would like to gain an understanding of the quality of those applications.  We probably will not gain it until November when he announces the first round of allocations.  I hope the applications' quality meets the level of ambition he has set.  As policy makers, Deputies, Senators and local councillors can play a role in communicating his objective of lifting communities.  I hope the applications are strong and have not been rushed.<\/p> <p>  I hope also that there will be deep engagement with communities and that none of them will be left behind.  As the Minister and his officials will know, the ones that are most successful are the ones that understand the process well and have sufficient capacity, but the ones with the greatest need do not have the capacity to draft an application and engage with agencies.  What is being done to address such deficits?  It is often those who need a leg up that are left on the margins.  The Minister does not want that to happen and the committee wants to assist him in ensuring such communities will have the same access to funding as those that will be first up, best dressed and used to drawing down funding.  It is an ongoing concern of mine that we should maximise communities' integration into and access to schemes.  Various officials at every level face a major challenge.  I remind those in the Department that, if an application is weak because a community has not had the capacity to make it stronger, it should not just be thrown onto the scrapheap.  Officials should recognise that the community may need more help.  An analysis or evaluation of failed or \"lesser\" applications should be conducted so as to ensure those communities can be built up through deeper engagement.<\/p><p>I hope I am putting it across to the Minister in the right way that we need to help those communities more than the ones that are probably the best.  I am probably contradicting myself in a way.<\/p><p> What can be done to improve access for the communities?  How we can assist them?  How we can prevent the duplication of the work of many of the agencies on the ground?  Representatives of some of the agencies were before the committee last week.  The Minister of State, Deputy Canney, was in attendance.  The agencies, which are excellent and whose umbrella body is Pobal, are delivering on the ground.  I asked the agency representatives whether the agencies are competing with one another for clients and customers in the various communities throughout the country.  We need a targeted approach to prevent duplication.  This means spreading the resources and the funding.  The Minister referred to substantial current funding of &euro;135 million or &euro;140 million in 2018.  That is to be paid to all the officials and agencies that are meant to assist the communities.  I want to see the agencies spending the money efficiently and not duplicating the work of similar agencies.  The money should be targeting those who are most disadvantaged in rural areas.<\/p><p> The Minister has done a fabulous job in the previous budget in ring-fencing substantial funds and in having, for the first time, rolling annual funds for the period 2019 to 2022 and beyond.  This allows communities to plan.  Communities will not have to ask whether there will be a fund next year or whether they will be putting in the effort now on a voluntary basis only to find there is no funding in a year or two.  The message has now gone out quite clearly to rural areas that the funding is there to stay over a number of years.  It is a question of getting our act together, taking on the good projects and realising the ambition we all have regarding the good living of rural Ireland.  The Minister and his Department are to be commended on putting the funding in place.  The Minister has rural areas at heart and he deserves the support of politicians and communities in delivering.  The real benchmark will be how well we will deliver in an efficient way that can make the difference the Minister wants to see in the communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018101700002#C00400","speaker":"1422","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Coffey for his remarks.  He is quite correct that rural Ireland is alive and well.  Admittedly there are difficulties, and that is why my Department was set up.  It was set up to determine what schemes would support rural areas.  The Senator is quite correct about the town and village renewal scheme.  This year alone, &euro;21 million was made available to support 224 projects.  Since 2016, we have delivered 675 projects, worth &euro;53 million.  To be fair to the local authorities and communities, the former were asked by my Department to talk to communities and let those communities make the suggestions to them.  The authorities made the applications for them.  I travel a lot around the country and have noted that fear has been spread in every county.  The first year, the local authorities were allowed to submit 15 schemes and the second year we allowed them to submit 12.  Some of the schemes were of a very high quality.  It takes some time to deliver on them.  They are being delivered upon, however.  I can see this in every part of the country I go.  They are working very well.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the outdoor recreation scheme, we have approved &euro;1.8 million to date in 2018.  Since 2016, we have allocated &euro;23 million.  Senator Coffey will have seen what this has done in Kilmacthomas in his county.  I have seen it in Drumshanbo, where 78,000 people walked the boardwalk this year.  That is what the schemes are all about.<\/p> <p>  The CL&Aacute;R programme is very simple.  We have targeted very simple schemes to try to enhance the quality of life for people living and working in rural Ireland.  They have worked very well.<\/p> <p>  The local improvement scheme is a simple scheme for those who are entitled to get their b&oacute;ithr&iacute;n or road done.  They pay their water charges, household charges and taxes.  The local improvement scheme is working very well.  I would love to have more money for it.  Other programs, including SICAP, are to help rural areas.<\/p> <p>  The Senator raised two or three specific issues.  One concerned the new pilot scheme I set up.  I was delighted to set it up.  People might ask why there was no grant aid with it.  We gave &euro;100,000 to the six towns.  I hope the local authorities will work with the businesses, communities and various community groups in the six towns we picked.  The Senator raised this in his question.  He is quite correct that I could have picked 16 other towns.  Just before I am asked who picked them, let me say I got my officials to set up a group with the Departments responsible for housing and finance.  The officials picked the six towns and submitted the list to me.  They could have picked 16 more.  This is a pilot scheme.  I want it to be the case that we are not telling the rural areas what we want them to do.  I want them to come back to me.  The towns might have six different views on how they envisage moving forward.  It is not always about grant aid.  If it were, it would be noted that we had two schemes within the Department already.  Two of the schemes did not work, namely, the repair and leasing scheme and the buy and renew scheme.  They just did not work in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.<\/p> <p>  Under the pilot scheme, we have given the local authorities &euro;100,000 each to get consultants, sit down with the groups and come back early in the new year with their suggestions and recommendations.  They might have six different suggestions and six new recommendations but they will know what is best for their towns.  The Senator and I hear every day that we are out and about that there is much dereliction in many of the towns.  Compulsory purchase orders should be used more by the local authorities.  That might be one of the recommendations.  They might need a mix of grant aid, with the support from the local authority and Department.  I am open to considering schemes to try to revitalise some of the towns.  The whole point of the scheme is to get people living in rural villages and towns.  If they are going to do so, they have to have the necessary services and there has to be public relevance.  The towns or villages have to be nice places in which to live, and in which people want to live.  That is what the pilot scheme is about.<\/p> <p>  The Senator is correct about the rural regeneration scheme.  The funding amounts to &euro;1 billion over ten years.  People said the 2040 project the Government announced was not going to happen.  It is happening, however.  We opened the scheme, we closed it and we will be making decisions in November.  There are two categories in that scheme.  One concerns shovel-ready projects.  There were 126 in that category.  There were 166 in category 2, which concerns projects that need development funding.  Naturally enough, the shovel-ready projects mean they are shovel ready.  When we allocate the money, the various authorities will be able to start drawing down the funding in 2019 and start the projects.<\/p> <p>  To be fair to the local authorities, they had a few very difficult years because of the recession.  They did not have the staff in place.  My officials and I sat down with officials from the County and City Management Association and we outlined to them the schemes that would happen over the next few years.  The authorities had to have capacity.  They now know they will have the schemes funded on a rolling basis.  I see the improvements in the town and village scheme and the outdoor recreation scheme because of the sufficient capacity that now exists.  The authorities know the schemes will be funded annually.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the rural regeneration scheme, I am delighted with the 126 applications this year.  It means there is an interest.  I appreciate the Senator is concerned about whether the authorities went out to communities.  To be fair, they believed it would not happen.  They did go out.  My Department's representatives went around the country and had a number of meetings with the stakeholders.  The shovel-ready schemes will happen but I hope that, now that we know what is happening, they will go out to communities in the second category.  We will reopen the scheme again in March.  I hope the officials will work out with communities how their needs can best be met and how they might have an input.  The whole point of the rural regeneration scheme is that it is for bigger projects.<\/p> <p>  I am delighted with the rural regeneration scheme but want to keep the existing schemes, namely the CL&Aacute;R programme, outdoor recreation scheme, town and village scheme and local improvement scheme.  These are all important.  The good news is that the funding is in place for next year.  The good news is that we had approximately 300 applications.  People were aware of the scheme.  They did not believe it would happen so fast.  It has happened and it is now closed.  We will make the announcements and I hope that in March, when we open the scheme, communities will be ready for it.  It is worth &euro;1 billion over ten years.  The funding for next year is in place.  There is &euro;55 million extra in the budget for next year.  We are committed to this scheme but also to the others.  I want to send out loud and clear today the message that the rural regeneration scheme will not take over any other scheme.  The scheme is specifically for bigger projects and to create the jobs, infrastructure or whatever applications are submitted.  I want to see the shovel-ready projects starting early next year.<\/p><p>Some local authorities complained that they did not have the capacity or money to put some schemes and applications together.  Under category 2 of this scheme, local authorities will get the necessary capacity and funding, and they will be able to put together strong applications.  It is a good scheme that is going to work and will supplement the other schemes we have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018101700002#D00200","speaker":"1334","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":606,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Michael Collins, to be followed by Deputy Martin Kenny.

I congratulate Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney on his appointment as Minister of State at the Department.  I have known him since I was elected to the D&aacute;il and he has a great interest in and understanding of rural communities.  I echo the sentiments expressed by Senator Coffey regarding it being an excellent appointment.  I look forward to working with the Minister of State.<\/p> <p>  The rural regeneration programme is of interest to any active rural Deputy.  It is a difficult time in rural Ireland.  Similar to Senator Coffey, I like to consider the glass half full, but sometimes it is difficult to do so.  Eight businesses in west Cork closed in the past three weeks.  The communities there contact me about such difficulties.  I have recently been contacted regarding the credit union in Drimoleague, a local school in Goleen, a shop in Kilbrittain, a post office in Ballineen and another in Enniskeane, AXA insurance in Bantry, and Long&rsquo;s shop in Timoleague.  That is only the tip of the iceberg.  Rural Ireland is haemorrhaging badly.  I acknowledge that the Minister, Deputy Ring, always has his finger on the pulse in terms of where moneys should go, but people are being squeezed out of business which causes great difficulty in rural Ireland.  I have sought to emphasise the importance of the rural regeneration programme and spent many hours asserting its priority in the programme for Government.<\/p> <p>   Many years ago, County Clare was a role model in how it delivered for its community.  There is a housing problem in the bigger cities but the unfortunate situation we are left with is a shortage of people in rural towns and villages.  There is plenty of available housing in villages and towns, such as in over the shop accommodation, and that should be utilised.  The Minister referred to six towns chosen to participate in a pilot scheme.  How can a local community apply to that scheme?  Many communities wish to turn things around and bring more life to their community.  How can we get deserted buildings in towns back into use and get people living in them?<\/p> <p>  There have been several funding applications to the rural regeneration and development fund, the deadline for which was 29 September.  When will the Department announce when funding will be made available for those projects?  As the Minister stated, some may be shovel ready and awaiting a final tick of the box by the Department to make funding available.<\/p> <p>  The walks scheme has been very successful in west Cork as in other parts of the country.  At a time when farming and building in rural communities, which were the pillars that kept people in their communities, are in difficulty, many people have turned their attention to tourism.  Although I acknowledge that money has been allocated to set up new walks, including funding for stiles and signage, farmers have not been compensated under the scheme for people walking on their land.  I ask that this issue be concentrated upon.  Of course, the foundation must be put in first.  In many cases, however the foundation has been laid but farmers have not been compensated and are allowing access on goodwill.  Although such goodwill is important initially, there needs to be a little more than that going forward because farmers need to consider the long-term viability of their farms, as many are doing.  Some farmers have told me that they look on the walks scheme as a way to supplement their farm income.  Some are willing to allow access out of goodwill for the first year or two of the scheme to get it off the ground.  However, those in certain areas who have not been brought in under the scheme will consider it somewhat unfair if farmers in a neighbouring county or townland are being compensated.  I ask the Minister to elaborate on that issue.<\/p> <p>  There is no questioning the success of the local improvements scheme.  Of course, the problem is that only two or three of every 20 or 30 applications are allocated funding.  The scheme as announced may seem well-resourced but many schemes are not getting funding.  I ask the Minister to consider further funding for the local improvements scheme because it is very popular.<\/p> <p>  As I stated, tourism is a major issue.  The rise in VAT from 9% to 13.5% will have serious implications for rural communities.  Even up to this morning I have been getting phone calls on this from businesses that are struggling and will probably go out of business because of the change.  However, that is another day's work.<\/p> <p>  The community services programme is of great benefit to the community and voluntary groups that access it.  There is one issue-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018101700002#E00300","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":608,"content":"<p>That comes under the next programme.

I would like as many post offices as possible to stay open.  Some 950 post offices will remain open.  As the Deputy is aware, I have provided &euro;80,000 to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to establish a pilot scheme of ten digital assist post offices.  I had no input into which post offices were chosen to participate in the scheme.  The aim of the scheme is to see what we can do to help provide more services in the chosen post offices.  The issue of post offices has been discussed and I do not wish to get into detail on it again today, but there has been a public outcry to keep them open.  I have always been honest about post offices, as have some Deputies opposite.  On this occasion, post offices were not compulsorily closed but, rather, were given a package.<\/p> <p>  When I was Minister of State at the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, I, along with postmasters and An Post, was responsible for considering what we could do to keep post offices open.  I completed a report for Government which I handed to the former Minister, Deputy Naughten, who was responsible for post offices.  On that occasion, we considered how to offer further services in post offices.  I have allocated &euro;80,000 for a pilot scheme of ten digital assist post offices to see what we can do to allow post offices to offer more services.<\/p> <p>  I attended a public meeting on a post office closure.  I obtained the figures for the particular post office from An Post.  Amazingly, although there were more than 300 to 500 people at the public meeting, the post office had sold 50 TV licences in that full year.  Some 350 families were living in the area.  Either people in the area did not have TV licences or they sourced them somewhere other than their post office.  If people want to retain their local post offices, they will have to use them.  We have made that point loud and clear and I have been honest on it.  At that meeting, the local postmistress stated that she had to subsidise the post office to keep it open in recent years.<\/p> <p>  I hope An Post reviews the issue and considers where post offices can be saved and put into businesses or elsewhere.  I encourage it to leave as many post offices open as possible.  The public must use and support those which are left open, however, of which there will be at least 950.  Deputy Fitzmaurice might have heard a segment on MidWest Radio featuring a postmistress who called a public meeting a number of years ago.  Many of the local community attended and promised to support her.<\/p><p>She did not get the support she wanted and she made the decision to close the post office.<\/p><p> The second issue was in regard to the walks scheme.  The Deputy is correct, in particular in regard to farmers.  It is a very good scheme and we have 1,900 landowners getting funding from it.  We had &euro;2 million in the budget and I am glad to say I have got a further &euro;2 million this year.  I will be looking at ways and means of increasing that scheme for next year, but I have an extra &euro;2 million.  In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, therefore, we will be doubling that scheme next year.  I know there are a lot of walks in the Deputy's area and there are many new people trying to get into the walks scheme.  I have to formalise this and look at ways to progress it.  While we will not be able to get everybody in, we will certainly try to double the number from the current 1,900.  At least I have doubled the money from &euro;2 million to &euro;4 million.<\/p><p> The Deputy talked about the rural regeneration scheme.  His own county has been very active.  Cork has made 19 applications in category 1 and 47 applications overall for the rural regeneration scheme, so it has certainly been on the ball.  As I said earlier, many local authorities, the public and some public representatives did not think this scheme was going to happen.  I am delighted it has opened.  Applications have now closed and we will be making allocations in November for the shovel-ready projects.  We will make further allocations for other schemes later.  My priority is the shovel-ready schemes, to get the successful projects announced and to have them operating for 2019.  They will be announced in November so people know they have their money, and it is up to them to start progressing the schemes.  Cork has done very well and it has certainly put in the projects.  While many other counties have not done as well, it is a new scheme and people will learn from this.  As I said to Senator Coffey, one of the big issues is capacity, and the local authorities now have the capacity.  I want them to talk to the local communities and to have an input.  We will be opening the scheme again in March but the priority is to get the first round open.  We are assessing the applications and I want to get the allocations made in November.<\/p><p> The Deputy raised the issue of LEADER funding.  We originally had &euro;35 million allocated for LEADER in 2018 and this was supplemented by a further &euro;5 million that was carried over from last year.  Activity has ramped up and there are now 1,300 projects approved to the value of &euro;43.4 million.  Given the profile of the expenditure, however, I had to reallocate some of that money because I know it is not going to be spent this year.  The drawdown to date stands at &euro;15.6 million and I am confident that, by the end of the year, we will have that up to about &euro;26 million.  I am monitoring it and I will keep doing so.  There is no doubt this is ramping up and that many more projects are being approved.  Like every LEADER programme, it takes a number of years to make applications, get approval, do the work and then have the drawdown, and the drawdown is the final thing that is done.  There is &euro;25 million in total for the programme up to 2020 and there will be three years after that to complete the programme.  I am confident we will have that spent and I can see it ramping up.  There may be one year where we have a problem but we are hoping for a drawdown of &euro;26 million this year and, if there is a shortfall next year or the year after, we will have to find that money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018101700002#E00600","speaker":"1334","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":612,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his opening remarks.  I know he was in north Leitrim last week and I must apologise as I was not able to attend.  I am sure he had a good day in Rossinver.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, and wish him all the very best in his new role.  I know he will be a fighter for rural Ireland.  He certainly was on this side and I expect him to be the same on the other side.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the measures outlined, I will not go into every issue as other members have done so.  With respect to the local improvement schemes, in my own county, Sligo, and in neighbouring counties, no money was spent on these types of roads for seven years and there are huge lists of people who want to have these roads done.  While I welcome the money that has been spent, it was &euro;17 million last year but only &euro;10 million this year.  I would have hoped that, by now, we would be in a situation where the Minister was announcing an additional package of money for these schemes.  There is a substantial backlog and many people need these roads done.<\/p> <p>  As I said, the Minister was in Leitrim last week.  There are two walkways in Leitrim which are awaiting funding and on which people are anxious to get going, one being the greenway from Manorhamilton to Enniskillen and the other through Ballinamore on the old railway line.  They are in an area which, in terms of the number of overseas visitors, has seen a very negative impact because of Brexit, although it has not even happened yet.  The area needs to see investment in critical infrastructure like this.  The Minister mentioned the walk at Drumshanbo, which has been a tremendous success.  We need to see more investment to be able to generate the kind of visitor numbers we need in regions like this.<\/p> <p>  On town and village renewal, I want to raise an issue I have raised with the Minister before.  It is my view that the Government needs to prime the pump in this regard.  We need to come in with more than schemes that just tinker around the edges.  A decent grant aid scheme needs to be put in place for people to renovate these kinds of properties.  If a 60% grant to a maximum of &euro;50,000 is the type of grant that is put in place, it would be cost neutral because, within a year of offering that kind of grant, when the work starts to happen, the State gets excise duty, income tax from the people doing the work and VAT on the products being put in place.  It gets all of that back and, within a year of offering that kind of grant, it gets the 60% spend back in taxes.  All of that is without talking about the multiplier effect.  Normally, when work like that happens, other people in the area also get work done or the person that is doing the work does additional work that is not covered by the grant.  That has been the experience not just in Ireland but is also widely recognised internationally.  It is a cost-neutral benefit to put that type of scheme in place.<\/p> <p>  If such a scheme were put in place across large areas of rural Ireland, it would have a magnificent impact on employment creation and regeneration and in getting people to believe again that there is a sense of future in rural Ireland.  That is what we need to do.  The Minister said rural Ireland is alive and well, doing well and all of that.  The experience of many people, however, is that life is getting more and more difficult.  One of the main reasons for this is that people cannot get access to credit.  I have spoken to a number of people who have the kinds of properties the Minister is talking about in towns and villages throughout the country.  They would like to be able to renovate them because there is a market for rental properties.  We still have a situation in most parts of rural Ireland in which it is impossible to find a house to rent, even in a rural parish like my own, which does not even have a town or village and only has a church, a post office that is now closed and a pub.  People who have houses to rent and who want to renovate them cannot get a loan from a bank to do it.  They need that bit of assistance from Government to give them belief again.  I urge the Minister to put that kind of money in place as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>  With regard to LEADER, while I know there is movement at last in regard to the amount of money being spent, we need to see that delivered as quickly as possible in many rural areas.  The issue of post offices was mentioned and I want to come back to it.  The Minister is right that some post offices are small and will be unable to survive.  One of the big problems at present, however, is the review mechanism that An Post has in place.  If a postmaster or postmistress takes the redundancy package, the position is reviewed, and the review mechanism states that An Post will provide a post office where there is a population of 500 people in a settlement.<\/p><p>Its interpretation of a settlement is taken from the 2016 census.  It is a minimum of 50 occupied houses, each no more than 100 m apart.  If this criterion is used, it means An Post can close almost every post office in Ireland outside the major cities and big towns because there are few places where that criterion would be met.  For example, it would not be met in an area with 50 houses, of which three or four are unoccupied houses.  An Post has used an interpretation that will allow it to close almost every post office.  That issue needs to be addressed.  I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, who I understand will have a role in this.  An Post needs to be held to account on that because using that criterion is a means by which it can close post offices throughout rural Ireland.  That needs to be reviewed.  In fairness to Mr. Tom Hobson and Mr. Paddy McGuinness who have been asked to review this matter, they both have great empathy with rural areas and building them up and providing for them.  The terms of reference of the review are totally flawed and anti-rural.  I appeal to the Minister and Minister of State to do something about that because there is no point in letting An Post away with it.  It needs to be changed quickly.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018101700002#F00200","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":614,"content":"<p>For the information of members, representatives of An Post will appear in the coming weeks.

Rossinver, a small community in a very rural area, has put in place facilities that are a credit to the people living there.  One can feel the community spirit in the area.  As the Deputy knows, the community works together.  Rossinver faced many challenges but kept going, put a project together and secured funding from various streams.  I compliment everyone involved.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy raised the local improvement scheme.  He is right that we did not have a scheme for seven years.  While there is a major backlog, the allocations the Department provided in the past two years have been a big help, especially in smaller counties.  The Deputy asked about further allocations.  I am looking at this issue.  It is a scheme I want to support and which has worked well.  I would like to see some matching funding from another Department.  Members may wish to ask other Departments, perhaps the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, whether it will provide matching funding.<\/p> <p>  The local authorities charge us extremely high fees for administering the scheme.  Perhaps they should consider its social value and instead of taking 13%, 14% or 15% off the top, they should invest the money I give them in roads.  Maybe that money should all be used to tackle the problem we have.  The Deputy has to give me credit for recommencing the scheme after seven years when it no one funded it.  I am glad I did that and I will continue to do so.  The Deputy is right that I allocated &euro;10.8 million this year and I am considering what I can do in respect of having further funding.  I will make that decision over the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about the walks scheme.  He has certainly seen what the scheme has done for his area.  On the outdoor recreation scheme, the Deputy is correct that I have a further round of funding to allocate for the in-between schemes and bigger schemes.  County Leitrim has been given a great lift.  Off the top of my head, I remember we provided funding for a walk in Drumshanbo.  We also provided &euro;1 million for a scheme from Drumshanbo to Leitrim village and from Leitrim village to Carrick-on-Shannon.  The tourism sector tells me that this has given the area a tremendous lift.  In Drumshanbo alone, eight new companies were created from that particular investment.  The Department allocated &euro;700,000 and subsequently &euro;1 million.  Funding for walks along the Beara-Breifne way, which will extend into counties Roscommon and Leitrim, will also be of help.  I will discuss with the Deputy the separate question he raised regarding the town and village scheme.  The outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme is one of the better schemes we have but it takes a little time to put these schemes together.  <\/p> <p>  On supporting farmers in respect of the walks scheme, some of these schemes would not proceed without the support of farmers and communities.  I was in County Leitrim last week, as Deputy Kenny said, where I met a group that is looking for further funding to extend the walks schemes.  The group has the farmers on board.  It is committed and sees what such a small investment does for the community and the value for money it provides.  The area will not attract multinational companies.  The best way it can build a community is through enterprises in Drumshanbo such as the food hub and the local drinks company, which are creating lots of jobs.  People sometimes overlook the effect some of the legislation they want to bring in will have on jobs in rural Ireland.  I know alcohol has knock-on effects but, at the same time, if it is not being made in Drumshanbo, it would be made in Vienna or some other place.  The drinks company in Drumshanbo creates many valuable jobs.  The abuse of alcohol is another day's work.  I support anybody seeking to address that because of the effects alcohol has on families and communities and the costs incurred by hospitals as a result.<\/p> <p>  The outdoor recreation scheme is a great scheme and it is working well.  The Deputy raised the town and village scheme and the pilot scheme.  He is correct that the schemes run by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government were the repair and lease and buy and renew schemes.  The Department thought these schemes would resolve the problem but the Deputy is right that they did not work.  The proof of any scheme is the level of drawdown and there was very little drawdown.  The schemes just did not work.  For this reason, I reverted to the community in respect of the pilot scheme I have introduced.  I have asked the community to investigate.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy put forward a number of ideas.  Boyle is one of the towns that has been selected.  We need communities to tell us what they think will resolve their problems.  It could be a combination of a number of schemes.  People are always talking about grant aid, which is necessary.  However, what I need to know first is what are the priorities of communities and what the State can do to support them.  My Department and every other Department needs to listen to what communities say.  They may say they need the local authorities to use compulsory purchase orders to take over some of these properties.  Once that has been done, the communities or local councils should get funding from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government or from other scheme that could be set up to support them.<\/p> <p>  The town and village scheme has worked very well.  It has been a great scheme in cases where it has been used properly.  I have seen examples in counties Wicklow, Roscommon, Mayo, Galway and everywhere else.  Under that scheme, small amounts of money are used for simple work that lifts the community and the public realm.  It makes places look nice so that people want to live in and be proud of them.  I will seek further funding from the Department of Finance for further funding for the town and village scheme in the future.  The Deputy is correct that the more money put into the scheme, the better.  The scheme has been open on a wide basis.  It can be used for digital hubs, food hubs, public realms or other areas for which communities want to use the funding.  It is a scheme of which I am very fond.  I like it because I see the value of it instantly.  The walks scheme is the other such scheme.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy talked about the pilot scheme.  I am not putting any pressure on the six towns that have been selected but local people in the communities in question may come back with suggestions the Department has not seen.  Local communities know what it happening and how to resolve their problems.  If one looks at towns, villages and communities that have done well, for example, Rossinver, which I visited last weekend, one will see that it is all about communities working together and focusing on what they believe they need.  What they want is support from the local authorities, this Department and other Departments.<\/p> <p>  We have to start looking differently at rural Ireland and our towns and villages.  As I have said on many occasions, there is no point pretending.  In some areas, many small shops were taken over by the multinationals, which are now being overtaken by online shopping.  Life is changing and we have to equip for that and seek ways and means of doing things differently in rural Ireland.  I would love to see a bit of life restored to some of these towns and villages.<\/p><p>There is a demand and need for housing and rented accommodation.<\/p><p> As for why these other two schemes did not work, I need to see what the local community will say to me.  It might come back with ideas for six different solutions.  If it does, I will look at piloting a few of the suggestions.  If we need to extend the pilot to other towns, I will look at that at a later stage as well.<\/p><p> Deputy Kenny also raised post offices and the LEADER programme.  The Deputy is correct that the LEADER is ramping up at last.  It is beginning to happen.  The projects are now beginning to be approved and it will take some time for the funding to be drawn down.<\/p><p> On the post offices, the Deputy will have an opportunity to raise issues when representatives of An Post appear in a week or two.  As many post offices as possible should be kept open.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018101700002#G00300","speaker":"1334","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":617,"content":"<p>What is needed is pressure on An Post from the Minister, as well as the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018101700002#H00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":618,"content":"<p>An Post needs to consider new approaches.

An Post had to reinvent itself and I hope it does that with its post offices as well.<\/p> <p>  There are communities and businesses that are prepared to take on the post offices.  An Post does not have to give them the full services but it can give them some of the services to keep the post offices alive in some of the areas where they can be kept alive.  Approximately 950 post offices will be retained and I believe that number could be increased to 1,000 or more.  An Post should look at certain post offices that are quite capable of providing the business and being profitable and I hope it will do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018101700002#H00300","speaker":"1334"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":619,"content":"<p>We are having an interesting debate about policy but this is more a review of progress to date this year.

I am now working on a base of &euro;23 million.  Some &euro;15 million has been spent, which means &euro;8 million is available to spend by the end of the year.  The allocation for the town and village scheme is &euro;15 million, of which &euro;8.3 million has been spent.  On the local improvement scheme, the Minister had to shake the bushes there.  I grant that it can be frustrating trying to get local authorities to send in the shagging bills.  They whinge about money but when they do work, it is a matter of trying to get money out of them.  There is a &euro;10 million allocation, of which &euro;4.8 million has been spent.<\/p><p>The challenge I see is that despite the reallocation of the money into community, which I welcome and which we will discuss under the community heading, expenditure has fallen far short of the allocation under each of the headings.

The best time of the year, summer when one could work until 11 p.m., is gone.  We are into dark, wet evenings unsuitable for working on roads, yet only half the money has been spent.  Is the Minister still confident he can spend all the money?  Will he reallocate unspent funds to areas where they might be spent?

The councils are so flush with money they are not in a hurry looking for it.  I cannot understand that and I read the local newspapers every week and see councillors complaining that they cannot get enough money and that there is not enough money going in.

The Deputy has been asking about the underspend.  He must worry at night about the underspend and not sleep.  I can understand that because he had a lot of it in the period 2008 to 2010 - his Department had &euro;38 million in 2008, &euro;3 million in 2009 and &euro;34 million in 2010.  That was when the country was booming, when everything was going well and when people were working.  This Department has done a tremendous job and I have no doubt that I will spend this money.

He was one of our colleagues up to a few days ago.  Now he is a Minister of State on the other side of the House.  We look forward to working with him.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Ring, for the great work he has been doing in the past 12 months in what is a very important Department.<\/p> <p>  A previous speaker indicated that there has been an underspend in respect of LIS.  Kerry County Council has spent the money the Minister gave it earlier this year, at the end of last year and early last year.  I want the Minister to recognise that because the council has done the work and its second application has been with the Department for over a month.  That application includes a request for funding for emergency hardship schemes.  Such funding comes out of moneys for LIS.  The council was not able to fund that in the first round of LIS.  The emergency services cannot get up and down the roads to the homes of people with disabilities.  This is one aspect of the application made to the Department.  I ask the Minister to the council an opportunity to do the work while the weather is reasonably good.  There are over 800 applications for LIS with Kerry County Council.  I assure the Minister we will spend the money if he sends it to the council because we have so many roads in a deplorable condition.  When I was agitating for the reintroduction of the scheme, I said these people are every bit as entitled to a good road to their doors as the people in Dublin 4.<\/p><p>The Minister understands that.  I appeal to him because it is important and they deserve recognition.<\/p><p> The repair-and-lease scheme was a disaster and I had that matter out with the Minister of State, Deputy English, on different occasions.  The local authorities could only offer the scheme where there was pressure for social housing.  The Minister of State tried to deny that and rebuff me but that was the fact of it.  If people applied for the scheme in places such as Kilgarvan, Gneeveguilla or Rathmore, there was no hope in the world for them because there was no pressure in these areas.  However, many houses there were falling asunder and into dereliction and yet we did not benefit from the scheme at all.  I do not know if there was enough funding or whatever.<\/p><p> We are discussing the rural regeneration scheme and we are all listening very attentively.  We have proud towns in my county such as, for example, Cahersiveen, where businesses closed down in the past two weeks.  We can spend money to do up the houses in the town or to provide housing but jobs are what will sustain people in their homes.  There are schools in the Cahersiveen area this year that have only two youngsters going into the junior infants class.  That highlights the seriousness of the situation.  In Currow, the post office, a shop and one of the pubs have closed.  There is just a shop and a pub left and we do not know if they will remain open.  There are so many different places.  In Rathmore, Cadbury Ireland gives employment but there are many houses vacant and shops closed along the street.  That is the road leading into our county from the manor side to the first town in Kerry.<\/p><p> There are so many places that need jobs to sustain them.  I know funding can be provided for houses - and the Minister is doing his best to do that and to regenerate these places - but we need to consider how we are going to create employment.  I appeal to the Minister to do that because if we are going to regenerate rural Ireland and keep it afloat, what we need are jobs.  I refer to Cahersiveen in particular, which is so far from anywhere else.  We need to get jobs down there.<\/p><p> Reference was made to walkways and to farmers.  The people of the Iveragh Peninsula are waiting for the greenway from Glenbeigh to Cahersiveen to be put in place.  I am of the view that the local authority went down the wrong road.  I do not know from where it got its advice.  Three and a half years ago it went down the route of making compulsory purchase orders, CPOs.  However, the greenway has still not materialised.  A number of farmers needed to be dealt with, but not that many.  Now that the CPO process is in train, however, more people have their dander up because of the idea that the greenway will be the created by means of using CPOs.  I ask the Minister if he could intervene and ensure that this greenway gets going via communication and agreement rather than through the use of CPOs.  It is not too late to pull back from the CPO approach and to talk to the landowners involved.  After all, they had to pay for the land going back generations and they had to fight hard to hold it.  They have a right to be spoken to and that would be the fastest way to achieve this important greenway between Glenbeigh and Cahersiveen.  The people of Cahersiveen really need it and the boost it will provide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018101700002#J00600","speaker":"1320","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":650,"content":"<p>Like my colleagues, I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, on his appointment.  As others have stated, he sat on this side of the table and he lives in a rural area so he has a good grasp of the challenges which face us.  I wish him the best of luck in his new role.<\/p> <p>  I have a few points to make.  The people of Roscommon are delighted that &euro;780,000 was awarded through the town and village renewal scheme this year.  That impacted on seven towns and villages across the county.  Within that scheme, it is a decent amount of money to make an impact.  As we see the economy improving, it is good to see increases in the allocations regarding that impact.  It is also good that the Minister anticipates that the scheme will be rolled out further.  Does he expect further changes to be made?  I refer, in particular, to the economic impact.  Last April, the Minister spoke in the Abbey Hotel in Roscommon at the launch of the Beara-Breifne Way.  Specifically on the walk scheme - and the Minister is known as a man of his word - he indicated that he hoped to extend it.  The allocation of an additional &euro;2 million in budget 2019 in this regard is a positive development.  I am involved with a number of community groups regarding the Beara-Breifne Way and it is important that landowners are properly supported.  We anticipate that the &euro;2 million to which I refer will have a positive impact within our area.  Almost &euro;1 million was allocated to the Beara-Breifne Way.  The Minister will be happy to know that work on that is under way in Roscommon.<\/p> <p>  I also want to mention Boyle.  The Minister already referred to the town in the context of the pilot scheme.  It is a really good initiative in trying to encourage town centre living.  Many of the challenges Boyle faces relate to accommodation.  That is particularly the case because of the fabulous tourist amenities such as Lough Key and the King House Historical and Cultural Centre.  In the context of trying to create footfall within the town, preliminary work has taken place on scattered accommodation to support tourists or people who want to come into the area to stay overnight in the town centre.  I hope that with this money the community will come up with innovative ideas to support that and encourage town centre living.<\/p> <p>  On the rural regeneration scheme, I understand that decisions will be made in November.  There is a major emphasis on economic benefit.  How will the applications be prioritised or adjudicated upon?  It is positive to see tangible funding being given to local communities.  Positive discrimination towards rural towns and villages is what we need in order to encourage balanced regional development, as Senator Grace O'Sullivan indicated.  The Minister is working exceptionally hard on our behalf to ensure that there is adequate funding.  However, there is always room for more.  These schemes are important and will be beneficial.  We have seen the benefits already from the town and village renewal scheme, the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme and the reintroduction of LIS.   Many of the schemes have been beneficial but we need further positive discrimination towards rural and towns and villages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018101700002#K00200","speaker":"1415"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":651,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for their presentations.  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Canney - the man to whom I showed the ropes a few years ago - on his appointment and wish him the best of luck.<\/p> <p>  Many of the schemes introduced by the Minister have been successful.  I am not here to criticise him.  I hope the Minister of State gets the same disease as the Minister in order that he might make money available.  I know that, at times, it is difficult to do this.  I have a few suggestions of which I would like the Department to take note.  If councils are not fit to spend money on LIS, there are communities in every part of this country with community groups that are able to access money.  There are only four or five roads in each municipal district.  If the groups to which I refer are unable to carry out work on the two, three, four or five local roads by a certain date, they should be able to hire private contractors, price projects at the proper specs and make applications in order to draw down money, particularly if councils are not considered fit to do the work in question.  This would be a way of alleviating problems in respect of accessing funding.<\/p> <p>  The Department distributes money for the Tidy Towns competition.  Great work is being done throughout the country but there is a problem in respect of which the Department might liaise with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Many towns are struggling because someone might be on the scheme for a year but then has to leave and another person will not take up the position.  There are towns and villages that do not have the relevant people and the local Tidy Towns groups are now paying individuals keep them in good nick.  The groups in question do not have the resources to do that but they are battling on trying to do so to make sure they are awarded good points.  There is a need to ensure that if there is no one to replace a person in a village on the scheme, an extension will be provided under the community employment scheme or T&uacute;s.  I know that more people are working, which is good, but some Tidy Towns groups are really struggling.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the money provided in respect of the Suck Valley Way, the Beara-Breifne Way and other walkways.<\/p> <p>  The Minister referred to post offices.  His argument that people must use post offices is 100% correct but in most of these areas, people were not allowed to hand them on.  People are entitled to retire at 70 or 80.  In this instance, the families of postmasters or postmistresses have not been allowed to take on the business.  This is the reason why people are being forced into a corner.  This point is directed to the Minister of State.  The Minister has responsibility for rural affairs, while the Minister for State deals with climate change, etc.  Is it possible for him to try to resolve a situation whereby letters are being sent back different communities, including that of the Chairman in County Clare.  Nobody is saying that there is a need for a five-day or a seven-day service in small villages.  Will the Minister sit down with the head of An Post and discuss this matter.  We are seeking to ensure that designated local shops would be allowed to give out pensions, social welfare payments or child benefit once a week, perhaps on a Friday.  We are not saying that these shops should do every single thing under the sun.  What we are saying is that if the 50, 60 or 100 people in a particular village have to go to another town, then that village will struggle.  That is all I am seeking.  Nobody is saying that we will offer everything in these areas.  If, like someone 60 years ago, I went out today with a horse and a mowing machine, I would not get any work because times have moved on.  In business, including An Post, we have to move on and draw people in the door rather than allowing matters to stagnate.<\/p> <p>  I accept that the position regarding LEADER has been relaxed to an extent bit but would it be possible to work on ensuring that schemes are simplified?  Every one of us finds that for some people, it is nearly like looking at the clock every night.  They are waiting to see when this or that scheme is coming.  Could the Department produce a calendar so that people will know that a certain scheme will commence in May, July or January?  These people are volunteers, as the Minister is aware, and are trying to complete forms as best they can.  I know the sports capital grant only comes out at a certain time.  There is a system in respect of many of the schemes set up by the Minister so that they come out in February or March.  Would it be possible to create a link with the schemes run by councils in order that we might provide communities with opportunities?  It should not be a case of someone telling me that he or she did not know of a scheme's existence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018101700002#L00100","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":652,"content":"<p>Perhaps the Minister will answer those questions from Senator Grace O'Sullivan, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, Senator Hopkins and Deputy Fitzmaurice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018101700002#L00200","speaker":"1273"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":653,"content":"<p>Senator Grace O'Sullivan asked a very good question.  I will go through a few things.  The whole point of setting up the Department related to regional development.  That is why the Taoiseach, in particular, and the Government made the decision, which involved trying to rebalance what was happening in Dublin and rural Ireland.  Dublin has a problem with capacity, housing and overpopulation, while rural areas face all sorts of difficulties.  Rural development was one of the matters to which the Senator referred.  This is why we drew up the Action Plan for Rural Development.  I chair the group responsible for the latter.  We bring in all the different entities, including State agencies and Departments.  I also have a second role in the Cabinet regarding regional development.  My officials and I must monitor every scheme that comes through.  The Senator asked a good question about our working with other Departments and Ministers.  My job, particularly in Cabinet, is to ensure that any scheme, development or change is rural-proofed.  This is where I must fight rural Ireland's corner, particularly when it comes to balance.  This is why we set up the outdoor recreation scheme to which the Senator referred.  She spoke about how well the greenway in Waterford has worked.  It has been a tremendous success and has lifted the town and the surrounding area.  I have seen similar things happen in Leitrim, Mayo and Sligo.  The scheme has worked very well in any place where these walks were grant-aided.  The Senator asked whether we monitor the schemes we grant aid.  We try to support the schemes, particularly social enterprise schemes.  Social enterprises receive direct grants in some cases.  They are expected to be self sufficient after a number of years.  Some of them have worked very well.<\/p> <p>  The Senator also referred to Dr. Senan Cooke.  I had the pleasure of launching Dr. Cooke's book.  Senator Coffey asked me to do that.  Dr. Cooke has been very passionate about rural Ireland all his life so there was no better man to write the book because he did it from the ground up.  Along with Senator Coffey, I was in his place a number of years ago.  He is committed the social enterprise aspect of community, as am I.  Some of the schemes support social enterprises where we have another problem. They are supposed to be social enterprises.  I am carrying out a review of that scheme.  We hope that the social enterprises will be able to create jobs, become self-sufficient and not need any support from Government.  I have the other problem whereby we have enterprises that do not really take in any revenue but that do a social justice job for us which local communities, the Government or the councils will not do.  In respect of funding these community groups and where there is a problem with the minimum wage, there is a hardship fund that I have asked Pobal to examine.<\/p><p>It will write to them directly.  I will continue the scheme for the year, but I need to carry out a review of schemes.<\/p><p> We spoke about the rural regeneration scheme.  I have a note on was applied for in County Waterford.  Waterford County Council has done well during the years in the funding it has received.  It has made one application for a shovel ready project under the rural regeneration scheme and four applications in category two for seed funding.  That is why the rural regeneration and the town and village schemes were established.  We copied the Action Plan for Jobs in providing an action plan for rural Ireland.  If there was one thing that worked it was the Action Plan for Jobs.  What I like about the action plan for rural development is that I can bring in any State agency.  Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice raised issues to do with social welfare and housing.  All of the various Departments have representatives who must come in.  I chair the group and look at the issues that affect rural Ireland.<\/p><p> The Department's aim with the rural regeneration and the town and village schemes is to have balanced regional development.  That is why I met Enterprise Ireland recently and will meet IDA Ireland next week.  We must start looking at ways and means.  Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta must be able to put in place initiatives to create ways for companies and individuals to invest in rural Ireland.  The best way to get them to invest is through the town and village scheme to make nice places in which to live and have community spirit, through the sports capital programme to provide facilities and through the provision of schools and infrastructure because if they are not provided, companies will not come and people will not come to live in rural Ireland.<\/p><p> One thing we have in rural Ireland is a great quality of life.  People like living there.  They want to live in rural Ireland.  They are not looking for the sun, the moon and the stars.  What they are looking for is fair play from central government, which is why the Department was established.  The schemes are working well and I am happy with them.  Of course, I would like to have more money and this year I fought hard with the Minister for Finance for further funding, but, as Senator Maura Hopkins said, as the economy begins to lift, more funding will become available.  The rural regeneration scheme will deal with bigger projects, while the town and village scheme, the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme, the CL&Aacute;R programme and other schemes, including the social enterprise scheme, will all help social enterprise in rural Ireland.<\/p><p> Deputy Danny Healy Rae spoke about the local improvement scheme in County Kerry.  It was one of his big issues and has always been an issue for him.  To be fair, he has always acknowledged that the funding has been well spent.  To be fair to it, Kerry County Council is a very good local authority.  It is one of those at the top in the LEADER programme.  To date, allocations of &euro;7.65 million and &euro;1.659 million have been processed for LEADER projects.  The total amount approved for projects is &euro;23.02 million.  The total claimed for projects in 2018 amounts to &euro;525,000.  Kerry is one of the better counties when it comes to spending.  It has applications in the shovel ready category, as well as the second category.  It is doing well in that regard.  The Deputy spoke about the lease and repair scheme about which I spoke.  It did not work.  He also spoke about the post office network.  I will answer that question later.  He also spoke about the works scheme.  Funding is in place to provide for a &euro;2 million increase in the allocation for the scheme this year.<\/p><p> Senator Maura Hopkins spoke about the town and village scheme.  I agree with her that it is the best scheme for rural Ireland.  I met the local authorities because it is called the town and village scheme and I wanted towns and villages, particularly villages, to be given an opportunity.  The one good thing about it is that last year every local authority was given an opportunity to make 12 applications.  I insisted on projects being spread throughout the country.  The funding we put in place is spread throughout the country.<\/p><p> The Senator also spoke about the Beara-Breifne Way, into which we put &euro;1 million, as many people had spoken about it for a long time.  We are developing it in on a phased basis and it is going very well.  The Senator knows that the scheme has created and will create many jobs and generated tourism in the area, as has happened in County Waterford because of the numbers of people using the greenway and resulting from it has done for small businesses and local communities.<\/p><p> The Senator spoke about Boyle being one of the six towns chosen for a pilot scheme.  Off the top of my head, last week it received funding under the town and village scheme.  We also gave it &euro;100,000.  There is a very active young group in it and people really want to see the town being revitalised.  It now has such an opportunity and will come back to the Department.  I hope it will give us some ideas about what it would like to see happening in their town.  This is also the case in Ballinrobe and other towns, including Callan, County Kilkenny and the town in County Waterford that we picked.  They will give us ideas and tell us what they want to do to try to regenerate towns and villages.<\/p><p> More and more people are coming to live in rural Ireland where accommodation is beginning to become a problem.  It makes financial and political sense for local authorities, State agencies and the Government to work together to try to put in place a scheme to encourage people to live in rural Ireland.  It is an opportunity to deal with the housing crisis.  It is not all about grants, but I am sure what will come back in the recommendations from the six towns is that they will require investment from the Government and that we may need pilot schemes.  I am prepared to look at and do anything to deal with the problem.<\/p><p> An issue of which I am aware - I know that the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is looking at it - is that we need to do something about compulsory purchase orders where a local authority wishes to take over a derelict property.  Some of the properties have been left to people who are deceased or who are in the United States or Australia and do not even know that they own them.  When I was a member of the town council, the scheme worked well.  A property is valued on the day it is taken over and anyone coming back to inherit it has his or her rights.  It is terrible to see the dereliction caused where people do not even live in the country and probably who do not even know that they own the property.  We need to do something about this issue.  That is what the pilot scheme is all about.<\/p><p> In County Roscommon there are applications for two shovel ready projects and two for the other scheme.  <\/p><p> Senator Maura Hopkins asked about the assessment criteria.  We have set up an advisory board in the Department that will also involve the Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Housing, Planing and Local Government and Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  Three independent outside experts will look at the schemes.  I will not get involved.  They will make recommendations to me.  One of the criteria is that I want to see a spread throughout the country.  Some counties may submit very good schemes, but I want to see a good spread.  The advisory board will conduct the assessment and come back to me with recommendations.  I will make the final decision, but the advisory board will have to decide on the projects.  It would not be right for me or the Department to do so.  The best way to do it is through the advisory board as it is more independent.  The one thing I want to see is a spread throughout the country.<\/p><p> Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice asked about spend.  He is correct.<\/p><p>This year, under the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme, I let LEADER companies apply for funding for smaller schemes to see if they would be able to handle the spend better.  I will adjudicate between now and the end of the year to see how they get on.  If there were other formats and ways that I could use to give the money to communities, I would use them, but I also have to have the public auditor to make sure everything is above board.  The Accounting Officer is sitting to my left and also has to be satisfied that whatever taxpayers' money we spend is spent correctly.  It has to be monitored; there have to be checks and balances, as we saw in previous schemes when things went wrong.  There were problems with the LEADER programme when many difficulties were encountered in the first round.<\/p><p> The Deputy also talked about the Tidy Towns competition.  I am glad that he mentioned it.  He was one of the few to mention it.  I allocated a capital grant of &euro;1.4 million and simplified the scheme.  I made it very simple.  It is a \"Thank you\" for the work Tidy Towns committees do all over the country.<\/p><p> I have raised the issue that was raised by the Deputy related to social protection.  I will ask the Secretary General to obtain the information.  If I do not have it at the next meeting on the action plan for rural development, I will bring in representatives of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection at the meeting after that.  The meeting is to be held tomorrow.  I will not have the information tomorrow, but I will have it at the next monthly meeting.  I will make sure the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection will give us an update.  I thought there were going to be changes.  The Deputy is correct, as I see in my county, that people are satisfied with the schemes, including the rural social scheme and others.  They are great schemes which work well and are good for the community and the country.  I am not being disrespectful when I say this, but people are at an age where they probably will not find employment and are happy with the jobs and work they have to do.  I will talk to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection about the matter.<\/p><p> We do not thank or appreciate Tidy Towns committees enough for the work they do for local communities.  Sometimes people complain about the work they do.  I try to encourage and support them because they deserve credit for what they do for towns and villages.  They do not really get the recognition they deserve.  I see people involved in my town out at 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., cleaning up after others.  People come into towns, dump their rubbish and expect others to clean it up.  I compliment Tidy Towns committees for their work in that regard.<\/p><p> The LEADER programme is beginning to be ramped up.  I want to see the funding spent.  I am confident that this year &euro;26 million will be spent on the programme.  I would like to see more being spent on it.  As it is ramped up, we will put funding in place to ensure people receive the money for which they will apply.<\/p><p> The Deputy talked about post offices.  He knows my views on the subject and I know his.  I agree with him.  When representatives of An Post are here, they cannot take a rigid line.  Where there is demand and a need, while it does not have to provide the full range of services, it can provide some.  That will keep people happy.  An Post has a public obligation to provide a service for the community.  Somebody else raised the way it worked out the criteria, of which I would not be overly fond.  There would be 950 post offices left.  If we could save 1,000 of them instead, we would be doing well.  I hope that in the future people will realise that if they want to have a post office, they will have to use it.  We looked at post offices handling the car tax renewals.  Over 80% of people now do so online and will not change their habits.  When people need a passport when going on holidays or a loved one dies, they used to come to us.  They also used to do it through the post, but now they can do it online.  That service is broken.  We have to start looking at new ways and means, as does An Post.  It cannot expect the Government to do everything for it.  It is a semi-State company and has to start looking at new schemes, ways and means to generate new business.  That is what every other businessman in the country does.  They look at where they are and where they are going.  If every other businessman and business in the country was to stand still, they would close down too.  An Post has to start looking at new ways to do business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018101700002#L00300","speaker":"1334","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":656,"content":"<p>We will move to programmes B, C and D.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018101700002#N00200","speaker":"1273"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":657,"content":"<p>I am not usually at the committee, but I have come for the community development aspect of the matter.  It is clear from the contributions made so far that a huge amount of much-needed work is being done in rural Ireland.  I apologise in advance for being a buzzkill when I bring the discussion back to community development in some of the poorest urban areas.  The issue has fallen off the cliff both for the committee and the Department.  Even the press release that was issued from the committee included the words \"discuss rural spending\".  I think something has been lost in translation with regard to the brief of the Department of Rural and Community Development.  When it was first set up, I was quite excited, having come from the community sector.  I was a community development worker for a long time.  After years and years, dating back to Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's time in 2002, I felt the systematic destruction of the community sector and the abolition of community development projects, CDPs, had left it in disarray.  It has moved from being a sector focused on social inclusion, addressing poverty and inequality and which played a crucial role during the years in critiquing State policy to being told to desist from campaigning and the closure of 19 of 180 CDPs in 2008, with those remaining being dissolved later.  Local workers were taken over by managers who were not local and did not understand the target or approach needed in communities which had been destroyed by poverty and various social issues.<\/p> <p>  Coming from the community sector, the Department's community development brief covers one of the most important aspects of life in the community sector.  It includes everything from addiction to the high rates of suicide and children being taken into care since the family resource structure was affected.  In working class communities we have seen a rise in the number of children going into care since the CDPs and family resource centres were practically dismantled.  The level of expenditure under the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, is &euro;40 million.  SICAP needs to be completely reformed and restructured.  There is no longer local autonomy whereby local communities are empowered to be involved in decision-making.  It needs to be reinstated.  By 2009, it was estimated that up to 41% of funding had been taken out of the community sector, compared to a figure of 7% across all other sectors.  Effectively local community development programmes had replaced grassroots community development, which has lost its meaning.  The words \"community development\" are still being used, but the process has become market-driven and about employment activation more than enhancing and empowering communities and building capacity within them to be able to address poverty at grassroots level.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps it is lost within the wider Department.  The rural and regional development brief is understandably large and I understand the attention it needs, but the role of community development has become lost in the championing, not only by the Minister's Department.  Politically, in general, there do not seem to be champions for the local community development structure.  I have certainly looked in on this committee since it was set up.  There was a position for either Senator Grace O'Sullivan or I, but I said I would step back and that she could take it.  I have watched it, but I have not seen the community development aspect being considered to address poverty and social exclusion.  We need to look at restoring funding to that sector and adopting some targeted approaches.<\/p><p>There will be a launch of a report in a few weeks, which unfortunately I cannot give to the committee now, that deals with the systematic destruction of community development and the impact of that.  My request to the witnesses at this point is to let me support them and the Department in refocusing some of those efforts towards community development.  Maybe we need to carry out some sort of review or analysis of what has happened in the past ten years within the community sector and the effect that the cuts and the restructuring have had.  We can look also at reinstating a significant portion of that funding and be willing to look at the failings of both the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, and of the kind of managerialism that has set in in the community sector where people from outside the community sector have come in with a very business-like model which is being imposed at a local level and is simply not working.<\/p><p> I have come here today to put some of these issues back on the agenda.  The communities I work with, like north Clondalkin, for example, would remind a person of the 1960s, such is the lack of investment.  The community is completely destroyed.  It is a similar situation in Inchicore, Athy, and west Tallaght when one looks at the family resource structure.  I have been meeting people in those communities and some of them did not even know that community development was within this Department.  I had to tell many of the communities that there was a Minister in place in control of this.  There a lack of acknowledgement or distance between them and the community development sector where people view this sector as involving rural development only.  Perhaps we should do something to change that perception and put the urban question, as it were, in terms of the poorest communities in urban centres.  I will bring those community sectors together and the Minister and his Department could meet us and be brought up to speed with the situation.<\/p><p> I am aware that this destruction started long ago before the Minister came to this Department, so I am not pointing any finger in his direction.  That said, decision-making was brought back to the centre of the Department and the State and the amazing work that was happening on the ground was completely disempowered and disenfranchised.<\/p><p> I would look forward to having the opportunity to engage with and support the Minister and his Department in bringing some of these issues to the fore, to helping those communities that are struggling, and to looking at the current structure of SICAP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018101700002#N00300","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":659,"content":"<p>I will bring in Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and then Senator Grace O'Sullivan.

It is not up to me personally, unfortunately.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has abolished the revitalising areas by planning, investment and development, RAPID, programme.  Other than Dublin north inner city, what programmes are there specifically to deal with the issues of intense social deprivation in what were the RAPID areas, which were the most deprived areas in the country and which were all urban communities?  In reality, despite the talk of booming cities and the challenges in rural Ireland, the most deprived communities in this State, socially, economically, and under quality of life and all other indicators, are exclusively urban communities.<\/p> <p>  My further question, which the Minister has touched on himself, is on the community services programme.  In recent years, before he took over the programme, an increasing divergence has taken place between the grant that was paid for wages and the minimum wage.  That has meant that the companies have had to top-up out of their own resources funding to pay the wage bill.  That was not the position up to 2014.  This is a phenomenon of 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018.  In 2018, every worker has to be subsidised by &euro;2,000.  For such programmes as meals on wheels, that is an impossible burden.  I accept that some of the companies have good income streams, and the Minister and I know of a number of these.  Will the Minister revert back to the payment of the 100% wage grant in the case of those companies that provide vital social services that the State would otherwise have to provide, that have a very marginal income and perhaps charge &euro;5 for a dinner?<\/p> <p>  I am very pleased to hear that more money is being put into what was the RAPID programme and into community facilities of &euro;8.6 million.

On new ideas to spend money, I was talking specifically about the local improvement scheme, LIS, for example, where there is a list of the roads, and a value on them, a council cannot do it by a certain date, and a community is willing to take it on and do it - within reason; not at the 11th hour and 59th minute - providing that it is within the prices and guidelines set out by the council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018101700002#O01300","speaker":"1341"},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":671,"content":"<p>I compliment the committee members as I feel as passionately about community as they do.  As to allocations, this year alone our Department is spending &euro;133 million on community, which is very important.  The Department and I take the SICAP and all of the community programmes very seriously.  There is no such thing as rural or urban poverty.  It is everywhere.  I have a role which I do not view as rural.  My job in the community sector is to look at both urban and rural.  The SICAP programme, in particular, is one of the programmes announced last year and is a five-year programme.<\/p><p>Some &euro;190 million has been allocated to that programme.  A review of the programme was carried out, not by myself or by the Department but by outside experts.  The review made 15 recommendations and we accepted them all.  We made it more flexible and gave groups more power to deal with problems.  One of the recommendations concerned one-to-one services.  There was a lot of group work involved in these programmes, but there is a need for one-to-one services where people are applying for jobs or learning to read and write.<\/p><p> I went to Limerick recently and saw the SICAP programme working at its best.  It gives a lift to communities and self-respect to people who get a second, or indeed a third, opportunity.  They deserve these opportunities because they are in disadvantaged areas.  I was in the middle of Dublin city last year with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and I will be there again tomorrow to provide further funding for disadvantaged communities.  It is important that we continue with these programmes.  The 2018 target is to assess 27,452 individuals and 2,219 community groups.  It is important that we support these groups.  They are working at the coalface, dealing with communities and with all sorts of problems.  I try to support those groups in any way I can.  The Deputy is correct.  Over the years these programmes were scaled back because of the challenges the country and the economy faced.<\/p><p> I am committed to SICAP.  It is one of the flagship programmes of my Department.  It is evaluated regularly, and I will be working with communities and with people such as the Deputy.  I want to support them in any way I can.  I have always said that social enterprises are one thing, but community work involves the targeting of the most disadvantaged sectors in society.  The people working on this know what is happening on the ground and what supports are needed.  I have made SICAP more flexible to give the people working on these programmes the opportunity to deal with the problems.  One of the problems with programmes such as this is that sometimes the rules and regulations that have to be followed are too rigid, and I am offering a bit of leeway on that in response to recommendations made in the report.<\/p><p> The community enhancement programme, including the community facilities programme and the RAPID programme, did not receive big funding, but I was able to deploy some money towards it from savings I had.  The community enhancement programme replaces the community facilities and the RAPID programme.  I provided the funding to the local community development committees, LCDCs, which comprise elected representatives, community groups, business groups and local councils.  Providing the funding at that level will make sure that money is targeted at areas where it is needed.  I will ask my Department to monitor this.  We are using the Pobal HP deprivation index guidelines to help decide on the allocation of moneys.  A value for money review of the RAPID programme was carried out, and I absorbed the findings of that report.  I hope that by providing the funding directly to the LCDCs, we can target the areas where funding is most needed.  This year the funding is &euro;4.5 million, consisting of &euro;2.5 million from RAPID and &euro;2 million from the community scheme.  I also added a further &euro;8 million into it, meaning that total funding this year is more than &euro;12 million.  Local authorities approached me and told me that they were having difficulties with the funding I provided.  I want the programme to support their needs.  It is not all about rural schemes.  These community schemes are very important to me.<\/p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has raised the issue of the community services programme, CSP, and the minimum wage.  The CSP review will look at the level of support provided to organisations as well as the need and feasibility of aligning the CSP supports with the minimum wage.  Pobal has a hardship fund, and I have asked it to look at every single group throughout the country.  Where it finds a need I have asked that funding be provided to these groups.  It is an issue I have to face going down the line.  If I link these groups to the minimum wage, it will cost another &euro;4 million.  We are making a contribution here.  It costs &euro;21,000 for a manager, and we pay the staff as well.  It was never intended that the Department would provide an employment grant but rather a contribution.  The Deputy has made his point and I have made mine.  Some of these groups are social enterprises that can easily match the top-up we are providing.  I am asking Pobal to look at this issue.  Where the groups are able to pay the minimum wage and do not require the top-up, I must provide that funding to other groups that do not have the means to raise funding.  I am carrying out a review of that, and hope to have it completed by 2019.  It has to be done.<\/p><p> Due to the current regulations, some of these community groups have difficulty surviving.  I do not want to see that difficulty happening.  I want community groups that are dealing with problems the Government, the councils and the health service are not dealing with.  If we did not have these groups doing the work they do, we would have a problem.  My review is considering whether two different categories can be created.  If any member of this committee has any advice or any submissions in this regard, I would appreciate his or her contribution.  I want services maintained and retained in communities where they are needed and where the State is not providing them.  I have continued to support funding, and I hope we can, in the next few weeks, top up some of the groups that need more funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018101700002#O01400","speaker":"1334","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":673,"content":"<p>To answer Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's question on the roles and responsibilities I will have, I have to sit down with the Minister, Deputy Ring, but I will have the same responsibilities that the former Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, had in the Department, which are the areas of rural development and responsibility for the oversight of the work of the Western Development Commission and of the Atlantic economic corridor task force.

The Atlantic economic corridor was mentioned.  A person can take a train from Limerick and do very well until he or she reaches Athenry, when the train will stop even though there is a railway line in place.  If one is driving from Limerick one will find that the motorway stops at Tuam.  I look forward to working with both the Minister and the Minister of State on developing the Atlantic economic corridor.  I am sure that my colleague will join me in kicking up the tables to ensure that the corridor does not stop at Tuam or Athenry.  Progress has been made, but we must push it further.  We have to connect Mayo into the national network of decent road and rail services.<\/p><p>With the two Deputies present in the Department, I am very hopeful that we will see progress.<\/p><p> I am going to put my head on the block now and may get it taken off.  I will be straight and honest about post offices versus rural broadband.  People are migrating online for shopping and social welfare.  We all know it.  I do an awful lot of business online.  I have probably stood in a bank three times in the past 30 years.  It is just the way of the world.  We do know one thing.  If we had ubiquitous, high-quality fibre broadband into every business premises and house in this country, the guts of a million people who live in rural Ireland would be online and using that broadband virtually every day.  That is the population of Dublin, give or take.  When I see people here in the great city throwing their eyes to heaven because it might cost &euro;250 million or &euro;500 million, I ask if they can show me a train or Luas line in Dublin that will carry a million people a day and that can be built for &euro;500 million.<\/p><p> I am not one of those guys who go around saying rural Ireland is done.  The area I live in is much better than it was when I went to live there in the 1970s.  We were dependent on manual phones then.  If I was asked the one thing we need to make rural Ireland grow, the answer would be high-speed mobile and fixed broadband into every premises, covering every area and road in rural Ireland.  Do that, and the people will do the rest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RCJ2018101700002#P00500","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1539768600,"counter":678,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, Deputy Ring, and the Minister of State, Deputy Canney.
