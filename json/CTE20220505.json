No apologies have been received.  To limit the spread of Covid-19, I ask all in attendance to wear face coverings when not addressing the committee.  The Service requests that those present continue to wear such coverings when moving about the campus and when in close proximity to others, to respect other people's physical space and the public health advice.  Members of the committee attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is the permanent witness to the committee and he is accompanied by Mr. Leonard McKeown, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p> <p>  This morning we will engage with the Department of Finance to examine the following matters: the 2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts and Vote 7 - Finance and the 2020 Report on the Accounts of the Public Services of the Comptroller and Auditor General, Chapter 1 - Exchequer financial outturn for 2020, and Chapter 16 - Ireland Apple escrow fund; and the audited financial statements of the Exchequer 2020.  The Department has been advised that the committee may  wish to examine the liquidation of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, and matters related to vehicle registration tax during the course of the engagement.<\/p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from that Department: Mr. John Hogan, Secretary General; Ms Emma Cunningham, assistant secretary; Mr. John McCarthy, chief economist; and Mr. Des Carville, head of shareholding and financial advisory division.  The personnel from the finance Vote section of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform were unavailable for today's meeting.  I remind all of those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are switched off or are on silent.<\/p> <p>  Before we start I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practices of the House as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As such witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything that they may say at the meeting.  However, they are not expected to abuse that privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with such directions.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits or objective of such policies.    Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022050500002#A00500","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651739400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas, a Chathaoirligh.<\/p> <p>  Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann requires all revenues of the State to be paid into the Central Fund of the Exchequer, unless required otherwise by legislation.  Funds are issued from the Central Fund on the authority of the Oireachtas to pay for public services, either through annual voted provisions in the Estimates process, or under standing statutory provisions to pay for what are called \"Central Fund services\".  It is estimated that around 75% of total annual Government receipts and spending passes through the Central Fund.<\/p> <p>  The finance accounts are prepared each year by the Department of Finance, to present an account of the Central Fund transactions.  The format of the accounts has evolved over time, and is unlike that of any other set of annual financial statements that come before the committee.  The accounts are prepared on a cash basis, and so represent the actual movements of cash in the year.<\/p> <p>  The annual Exchequer account presents the cash receipts into and cash issues from the Central Fund.  The account is presented together with a set of schedules that analyse the transactions, with a significant amount of explanation and detail set out in footnotes.  The financial statements of the national debt of Ireland, which are prepared by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, are also appended as part of the finance accounts.<\/p> <p>  Chapter 1 of my report on the accounts of the public services is a recurring chapter, which is designed to summarise the transactions on the Central Fund in a more accessible format, and to highlight key trends over time.  While budget 2020 had forecast a small Exchequer surplus for the year, the outturn was an Exchequer deficit of just over &euro;12.3 billion, primarily due to increases in voted issues to fund Covid-19 support measures.<\/p> <p>  As the finance accounts do not include a balance sheet, or a statement of the Exchequer&rsquo;s financial position at the year end, the chapter on the Exchequer outturn aims to provide a summary position of key assets and liabilities at the year end.  I will briefly outline just three of the liabilities that will impact the Central Fund into the future.<\/p> <p>  As the national debt account shows, Ireland&rsquo;s national debt at the end of 2020 stood at &euro;219.5 billion, up &euro;12.8 billion from the end of 2019.  However, the cost to the Exchequer of servicing the debt continued to fall, and fell by more than 10% in 2020, due to the refinancing of older, higher cost debt.<\/p> <p>  Liabilities under public private partnerships, or PPPs, are regarded as \"off balance sheet\" from a general Government perspective.  PPP-related commitments outstanding at the end of 2020 totalled an estimated &euro;6.7 billion.<\/p> <p>  The third point I will draw attention to is that the State is the sole contributor to the Eircom No. 2 pension fund.  Towards the end of 2020, the fund&rsquo;s remaining assets were almost fully exhausted.  It is estimated that Exchequer funding of approximately &euro;84 million for 2021 and &euro;86 million a year thereafter will be required to meet the liabilities of the fund to Eircom pensioners.<\/p> <p>  Pursuant to section 28 of the NTMA (Amendment) Act 2000, the Minister for Finance delegated to the NTMA a range of functions in respect of the Ireland Apple escrow fund, including the production of annual financial statements which are subject to audit by me.  These are published separately from the other NTMA accounts.  The net assets of the escrow fund were &euro;13.984 billion at year end 2020.  This represents a decrease of &euro;36 million from the 2019 net assets balance of &euro;14.02 billion.<\/p> <p>  The 2020 appropriation account for the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Finance records gross expenditure of just under &euro;36 million.<\/p><p>This is divided between two expenditure programmes.  These relate to the costs incurred in respect of economic and fiscal policy, on which the Department spent &euro;23.6 million, and banking and financial services policy, on which the Department spent &euro;12.4 million.<\/p><p> Members may wish to note that the NTMA has provided a number of staff on loan to the Department to work in its banking unit.  The related staff costs, and certain consultancy costs, are paid directly by the NTMA and are not recouped from the Department.  In 2020, the costs incurred by the NTMA in that regard amounted to &euro;1.8 million.  This was in addition to the expenditure on banking and financial services policy recorded in the appropriation accounts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022050500002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651739400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Hogan.

I think that the Chairman identified some of the officers and officials who accompany me.  We have Mr. John McCarthy, chief economist, Ms Emma Cunningham, head of tax, and Mr. Des Carville, head of the shareholding and financial advisory division.  We also have Ms Scline Scott, head of corporate division, and Ms Laura Cunningham, our finance officer.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on the specific items on today&rsquo;s agenda and keep my comments brief.  The agenda covers the Appropriation Accounts 2020, Chapters 1 and 16 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s Annual Report 2020, and the Finance Accounts.  As the Chairman mentioned, the committee has a number of items to discuss with us, including the special liquidation of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation.<\/p> <p>  Turning to Vote 7, the Estimate for the Department for 2020 was set at &euro;39.9 million or &euro;38.6 million net of appropriations-in-aid available.  The gross outturn spend for the year was just under &euro;36 million, &euro;3.9 million or 9.7% under the available allocation.  As a result, the Department surrendered just under &euro;3.4 million to the Exchequer.<\/p> <p>  The end-year surplus arose for a number of reasons.  There was an underspend of over &euro;600,000 on consultancy and other services costs; around &euro;800,000 of the capital budget was left unspent as a result of the public health restrictions in the construction sector; for similar reasons there was an underspend on travel and subsistence, which was very much linked to Covid-19; and finally, there was an underspend on the disabled drivers fuel grant scheme of &euro;530,000.  As members know, this scheme is demand-led and is difficult to predict with great certainty.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the Exchequer Financial Outturn for 2020, I draw the committee's attention to the following key points.  Despite the pandemic, tax revenues held up well, falling by just &euro;2.1 billion or 3.6% on 2019.  The two key drivers of the better-than-expected performance were income tax and corporation tax.  Income tax is the largest tax head, accounting for 40% of the overall tax revenues in 2020.  Taxes in the year were &euro;22.7 billion, only &euro;200 million lower than 2019 despite the high number of people in need of support via the pandemic unemployment payment.<\/p> <p>  The strong performance of income taxes was the result of the progressivity of the income tax system, interposed with the sectoral nature of the employment shock.  Unfortunately, those worst affected by the pandemic were predominately in lower paid employment areas.  However, as lower paid workers are largely kept outside the income tax net, the impact on income tax receipts was less than could be expected given the overall level of joblessness.<\/p> <p>  Corporation tax also over-performed, mainly due to high levels of profitability in a number of key sectors.  The volatility and unpredictability of corporation tax receipts pose a challenge to the continued stability in the public finances.<\/p> <p>  The Department currently estimates that the impact of international tax reform discussions under way will be in the region of &euro;2 billion per annum relative to baseline.  As the discussions at OECD and EU levels continue, the impact will be kept under close review and updated accordingly.<\/p> <p>  The more domestically focussed tax heads, namely VAT and excise, were heavily impacted by the pandemic, as consumer spending collapsed as a result of public health restrictions.  VAT returns fell &euro;2.7 billion on 2019 to &euro;12.4 billion, while excise receipts for the year were just under &euro;5.5 billion, &euro;500 million lower than 2019.<\/p> <p>  On the expenditure side, total net voted expenditure was &euro;67.8 billion, an increase of some &euro;13.7 billion or 25% on 2019.  The significant growth in expenditure reflected Government policy to use the public sector balance sheet to offset the pandemic-induced contraction in private demand.  For example, the three main income and business support schemes, which were the pandemic unemployment payment, the employment wage subsidy scheme and its predecessor the temporary wage subsidy scheme, as well as the Covid restrictions support scheme cost the Exchequer nearly &euro;9.5 billion in 2020.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the Apple escrow fund, the committee is aware that as part of the European Commission's decision of August 2016, Ireland was ordered to recover from Apple the alleged State aid plus interest related to a ten-year period from 2003 up to 2014.  Notwithstanding Ireland's appeal against the Commission's decision, the Irish Government complied with its obligation to recover the sum of &euro;13.1 billion plus interest of &euro;1.2 billion.<\/p> <p>  The Minister for Finance agreed with Apple that the amounts collected would be held in an escrow fund until the legal process is completed.  The Ireland Apple escrow fund was established under the terms of a formal agreement between the Minister for Finance and Apple, pending the final outcome of legal challenges to the findings of a State-aid investigation undertaken by the European Commission.<\/p> <p>  The investment and management of the fund is jointly overseen by the Minister and Apple, with the Minister's functions delegated to the NTMA.  The financial statements for 2020, published on 22 June, set out that the net assets at the end of 2020 totalled &euro;13.98 million.  The &euro;36 million decline for the year primarily reflects the negative interest rate environment and negative yields on highly rated euro-sovereign and quasi-sovereign bonds that existed in 2020.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the Department, I will briefly describe the role that the Department plays in the effective implementation of Government policy.  The Department's mission is to lead in the achievement of the Government's economic, fiscal and financial policy goals having regard to the programme for Government.  In late 2020, the Department published a new Strategy Statement 2021-2023, which sets out how the Department will continue to work towards achieving strategic goals pertaining to public finances, the economy, the financial sector and the environment.<\/p> <p>  Despite the enormous challenges posed by Covid-19 in 2020 the Department continued to make progress on achieving these goals.  More recently, as the pandemic has receded, the fall-out from the war in Ukraine has posed new and significant challenges for the domestic and international economy through terms of trade shocks not seen since the 1980s coupled with an enormous humanitarian crisis.  Officials from the Department of Finance, while engaging with colleagues from across the civil and public service in a whole-of-Government response, have been working hard across a number of key areas.  Specifically, the Department has been at the forefront of the implementation of financial market sanctions, as well as working with Government on designing and implementing measures to respond to the cost of living pressures now being felt across society as a result of the issues.<\/p> <p>  The economic and financial consequences of the Ukraine invasion, both globally and in Ireland, will be considerable.  The most direct economic channel through which the war has and will impact Ireland is inflation.  The Stability Programme Update, published last month, sets out a scenario in which inflation would average 6.25% this year, falling to 3% next year.  Conversely, the forecast for growth has been lowered to 4.25% of modified domestic demand this year, from 6.5% estimated in budget 2022.<\/p> <p>  The fiscal impact will be large too.  At this stage it is difficult to provide an accurate estimate as to the cost of supporting refugees arriving from Ukraine.  Work to better understand the potential expenditure requirement is ongoing in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>  In closing, I first thank the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We are always grateful to his office for the engagement and assistance we receive in ensuring that the Department produces accounts that meet the highest standards in public accounting.  Finally, I thank the staff within the Department for their work during the period under review.  They demonstrated considerable adaptability and flexibility in adopting to new working arrangements through 2020 to ensure that the core business of the Department continued, as well as put in an enormous effort to deliver and implement new temporary support arrangements at a time when the Irish economy and society most needed them.  In addition, I am mindful of the successful collaboration with Oireachtas staff and members of both Houses to ensure the necessary Government and Oireachtas business and scrutiny was conducted as normal in abnormal times.<\/p> <p>  To conclude, I thank the Chairman and members for their invitation to meet the committee today as well as for their attention.  I welcome any follow-on questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022050500002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Hogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1651739400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hogan.

However, we have since had, essentially, the resignation of the medical board of appeal and it appears that the underlying issues have not been addressed.

I am conscious that several people who applied for primary medical certificates but were not successful in that application have sought a mechanism of appeal.  The board of appeal resigned.  That is a statement of fact.  We need to find a mechanism through which those appeals can be dealt with and that is the process that we have under way in the first instance.<\/p> <p>  The second item is the future of the scheme and how it is structured.  I mentioned earlier that the scheme has probably been in existence since the 1960s.  The definition of \"disability\" is very much framed in that era, if I may describe it in that way.  It is framed against a definition of \"disability\" that is very much in the physical area.  Some of the areas that were raised in the Supreme Court decision bring the wider aspects of disability into play.  As part of the issue and how we bring this forward, there is an ongoing engagement with our colleagues in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, where the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is chairing a review group into transport mobility schemes.  The progress from that in respect of policy outcomes should be very much framed in how we look at where the disabled drivers scheme should and could go in future.  That stream of work is very much under way.  We have been feeding into that but also looking at an information-gathering exercise which included the outgoing members of the disabled drivers board of appeal to see what best practice is internationally, how these issues are dealt with in other jurisdictions and whether tax is the appropriate mechanism for dealing with them.  That work has progressed to a significant extent and we are now feeding it into the mechanism that is chaired by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.<\/p> <p>  There is a two-pronged approach to what we are trying to do here.  One aspect is to recognise that there may be legitimate reasons individuals believed they were unsuccessful in their application for a primary medical certificate and we need to find a mechanism for dealing with that in the short term, but in the longer term it is to look at the wider issue in respect of the whole scheme and how it fits into the best mechanism for supporting transport mobility for disabled people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022050500002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Hogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1651739400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Mr. Hogan mentioned that one of the reasons for the board to be reconstituted is that there are appeals outstanding or people who wish to make an appeal.

Certainly, if the Deputy looks at the cost of servicing the debt, even as far back as 2013, I believe the cost was anticipated to be in the order of about &euro;7.5 billion.  That has fallen substantially over the past number of years.  The NTMA has taken advantage of the low interest rate environment to reprofile, as the Comptroller and Auditor General rightly noted in his presentation, the more expensive debt that was taken on board by the Irish State at that time.  There has been a success in that regard, particularly in taking advantage of what was available on the international markets to reprofile and reorientate our debt at considerable saving to the Exchequer.<\/p> <p>  If I look at the wider debt picture at the moment, the thing to note is that we are seeing an increase in bond yields.  It is very clear that the cost of borrowing internationally will increase over the next while.  It is something that the Department has been signalling through our different publications over the past while, probably covered in the stability programme update, SPU, over the past number of days and certainly the annual debt report that was compiled by the Department earlier in the year.

The State was exposed to a &euro;2 million fine as a consequence of the two-year delay in its transposition.  It was supposed to be done in 2017.  The reason I raise it is twofold.  First, it seemed to me that there needed to be interaction with the Department of Finance in the development of legislation to transpose the directive.  What was the situation there?

There is a new directive itself, a sixth one, a revised funds transfer regulation and a regulation establishing a new central supervisor for anti-money laundering matters at EU level.<\/p> <p>  Anti-money laundering touches quite a number of areas.  The Deputy rightly identified the Department of Justice as being part of it.  There is very strong co-ordination through the anti-money laundering committee which our Department chairs and which has representatives from the different areas across the State where anti-money laundering and terrorist financing issues arise.  Sometimes transposition can be difficult and can touch on different Departments.  We do co-ordinate across the different bodies.  I think that anything the Department needs to do is up to date but I will double-check and if there is anything to the contrary we will come back on it.  We are very conscious that when we are transposing regulations, we do so correctly.

I suppose the concern from the committee's perspective was that there was such a large fine, that it was an unusual thing and there was, as Mr. Hogan says, a series of anti-money laundering directives.  In our dialogue with the Department of Justice, it indicated that it can be difficult to keep up and that there was directive after directive in relation to it.  It generated concern here because \"difficult to keep up\" is not where we want to be.

I thank Mr. Hogan.<\/p> <p>  There are some general questions and there is general ill-ease.  I received a very good response back from the Department of Finance, which is worth putting on the record.  It relates to securitisation and the exposure of the financial market generally to Russian assets.  Mr. Hogan may correct me if I am wrong but the Department told me that at the end of 2021, Russian assets represented only 0.1% of the on- and off-balance sheet financial assets and liabilities held by Irish authorised banks, that is, &euro;1.7 billion, 0.3% of total assets of authorised investment funds, or &euro;11.5 billion, and 0.1% of the total insurance sector assets of &euro;97 million.  I think the Department also gave me numbers in relation to the special purpose entities, SPEs, that just under 2% of the 3,000 special purpose entities, which of course are totally legitimate entities, had been identified as having links to Russia and that it was currently estimated that one in three of those, that is, 17 SPEs being 0.5% of the total SPE population was directly linked to individuals in the scope of the sanctions regime.  <\/p> <p>  It seems to be a contained exposure; I do not want to say that it is small.

Credit is due in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Let me refer to the primary issue I would like to raise.  The gross national debt in 2020 stood at approximately &euro;220 billion.  What we are starting to see, and as alluded to in reports today by Bloomberg, is a rise in interest rates in the UK and, potentially, the eurozone.  In terms of the debt in Ireland and inflation at a scale that has not been seen in many decades, what is the exposure when it comes to the change in interest rates?  The Secretary General or perhaps the chief economist, Mr. McCarthy, might like to answer that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022050500002#L00200","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651739400,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I will start and then hand over to Mr. McCarthy.  Early in the session I referred to our annual debt report, which is a very useful document, which is almost a handbook. on the national debt, exposure and what it means in terms of our own public finances and so on.  Over the past number of years, there has been significant reprofiling and elongating of our debt.  Associated with that, by virtue of benefiting from the lower-interest-rate environment, there has been the material impact on the cost of servicing the debt.  As we look into the near and middle term, we are generally well placed to deal with the issues that are now arising, but, as we have stated in our own public documents over the past number of years, the very benign environment that has been operating internationally on bond yields, very much driven by central bank action, is beginning to come to an end.  We have seen a movement on interest rates in the US, of which I am sure the Deputy will be very much aware.<\/p><p>In the European context, the ECB has already indicated some of the policy actions it intends to take over the coming while.  They are very much linked to the winding down of asset programmes that have been instrumental in terms of the moderation of the international lending environment.  However, what might have been described as an era of free or more-than-free money is very much coming to an end.  We have been mindful of it.  We have been indicating it in our documentation over recent years and have been planning accordingly.

As the Deputy might remember then, we were very much the story then, but we are in a much better position on the international debt markets and seen very much as part of the semi-core group of nations.  Our bond yields trade very closely to Belgium and France at present.  We would have envisaged and experienced quite a different scenario ten years ago.

We are in a situation where we know that, in 2020, the NTMA and the Department of Finance were involved in the procurement of approximately &euro;26 billion in borrowing.  We are now facing into very uncertain economic times with the war in Ukraine which has the potential to do significantly more damage to the economy than Covid, which is pretty hard to believe, when it comes to the increase in the cost of oil and other seriously important commodities that are vital to the running of an island economy such as Ireland that does not have access to many raw materials as such.  What does the Oireachtas need to do to enable the Department to get over the next 18 months, which look to be incredibly unpredictable?  It is quite worrying.<\/p> <p>  One area on which there could be a very serious knock-on impact is our corporation tax if profits were to drop as a consequence of ever-increasing costs of supplying companies.  That is something I hear on the ground from business people and SMEs throughout the country.  I am sure the same could be said further up the ladder.  We will see that later in the year in terms of when companies' profits are returned.  I assume corporation tax is one of the areas that will be very badly impacted by the war and by supply issues in terms of companies facing increasing challenges as they try to get goods and services moved.  They show that the Irish economy is extraordinarily exposed to some ongoing international issues, especially around the war in Ukraine.  What work is the Department undertaking when it comes to trying to make the economy bulletproof to some degree?  I know it is not entirely possible to do that.

We are projecting modified domestic demand, which is our preferred measure of economic activity, of approximately 4.25% for this year.  At the time of the budget we were talking about 6.5%.  Over the medium term we see the economy has the capacity to grow by approximately 3% to 3.5%.<\/p> <p>  What is the Government doing in terms of trying to build resilience etc?  My view is we are probably living in a more shock-prone world at this stage.  Already since the start of this decade we have had a global pandemic, war on European soil and we have a much slower moving but nonetheless significant shock, namely, Brexit.  Government is trying to build buffers to be able to address those shocks over time.<\/p> <p>  The key innovations were set out in the summer economic statement last year.  Government is setting budgetary policy within a medium-term framework and setting spending within the trend growth rate of revenue but also, within that, ramping up its public capital programme.  It is spending &euro;12 billion to &euro;13 billion per annum.  Only a decade ago, if I was sitting here, we would be talking about spending &euro;4 billion per annum on capital.  It is boosting the supply side, addressing bottlenecks and ensuring Ireland remains attractive using all that public capital programme.<\/p> <p>  Of course, it is not all in physical infrastructure.  It is in human capital as well because that will increasingly be a part of Ireland's attractiveness in years to come.

I raise the issue of the credit unions.  The savings in credit unions went up by 2.8% in 2021.<\/p><p>At the end of last year there was a surplus of &euro;17 billion in the credit unions.  I am raising this in the context of the housing crisis.  The credit union movement has indicated at different times that it would like to try to help with the housing problem because it has a co-operative ethos.  We are unusual in European terms in that many other countries have community-owned banks and publicly owned banks, such as Germany, for example.  Here, we have the credit union movement sitting beside the big players like AIB, Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB, etc.  Last year, 69% of new mortgages came from three banks, namely, AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB.  The credit union is in a bind.  It can only lend up to 3% of total mortgages and 10% of total SME borrowing.  It is caught at 3% while the three pillar banks were at 69% last year.  The banks' SME lending was 90% of all SME lending whereas the credit union was restricted to below 10%.  What is happening there?<\/p><p> For nearly as long I have been around there has been talk of reforming the credit union to allow them to play more of a role in this area.  It appears to me, and to some others who keep an eye on these things, that there is heavy lobbying from the banks in this regard.  There may be some bias - perhaps \"bias\" is too strong a word - in that we look favourably on the banks and let them do all of it.  After the past 12 or 14 years we have learned a thing or two about the banks and the things we took for granted.  There was a saying when I was a bit younger that something was as good as money in the bank, but we know now that money in the bank is not always good.  Why are we restricting the credit union movement?  It wants to get involved here.  Money is needed for affordable housing, there are people who cannot get mortgages and schemes that cannot be funded and there is &euro;17 billion sitting there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022050500002#O03500","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651739400,"counter":470,"content":"<p>I will start and then let Mr. Carville add to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022050500002#P00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Hogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1651739400,"counter":471,"content":"<p>If you could keep it brief-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022050500002#P00300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651739400,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I will keep it very brief.

The way to make a return is by lending and making a margin on the lending versus the deposit base or funding cost.  That equation is wrong.  Either credit unions have to lend more or interest rates need to increase, which brings me to the Chairman's second point.<\/p> <p>  There is a viability question if this trend continues in the longer term.  We must not forget that there are 220 individual credit unions and they all have different risk appetites and membership profiles and so on.  It is not a homogenous group.  Within that, there are definitely some credit unions that have the risk appetite and the wherewithal to do more SME lending and mortgage lending.  There are limits set by the Central Bank, which is independent of us, but when credit unions start coming towards their limits, they can apply for an extension to those limits.  Many credit unions that are hitting their limits have done that.  Not every credit union wants to do SME lending or mortgage lending.<\/p> <p>  On engagement and lobbying, my team spends an awful lot of time with the sector and meeting individual credit unions.  There were two people with the Minister of State at the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, conference recently.  We talk extensively to the sector to try to find out what is happening behind the scenes and on the ground.  We are very receptive to the representative bodies talking to us at any stage.  They are well represented in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022050500002#P01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Des Carville"},{"type":"speech","time":1651739400,"counter":486,"content":"<p>Mr. Carville has confirmed that banks have 100% of their assets loaned out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022050500002#P01800","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651739400,"counter":487,"content":"<p>It is less than 100%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022050500002#P01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Des Carville"},{"type":"speech","time":1651739400,"counter":488,"content":"<p>It is just under 100%.  For credit unions, it is 26%.  The figure I had for last year was 27% but we will settle on 26%, which is about a quarter.  We are talking about viability.  There is a pot of money there of &euro;17 billion.  I am not advocating crazy lending like the banks did in the 2000s.  Around 50% would seem like a safe bet because the assets would be there even if everybody defaulted and everything went belly-up.  The credit unions have had their hands tied behind their backs and a blindfold or a bag pulled over their heads.  They are suffocated and prevented from getting into the mortgage market.  A credit union with &euro;70 million to lend can only do 14 mortgages at &euro;250,000 each.  That is all it can do.  In other countries like Canada, Australia or the USA, there is more of a level playing field.  Those are not exactly communist states or anything like that.  We are talking about America, for God's sake.  They seem to be able to allow the credit unions to play a bigger role.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses advise the Government on these policy decisions.  There is a need to move this issue on because it has been going on for years.  When we were caught in the middle of the recession and just starting to emerge from it, everybody was scratching their heads and asking what to do about housing.  The credit unions said they wanted to intervene and help.  I have a letter here from a local credit union saying that due to the regulatory caps being imposed and the regulations on the ability to provide mortgages, the cap is 7.5% of assets in business and home loans, so it is effectively stopped before it starts.  This credit union has assets of &euro;67 million and 7.5% of that is &euro;4.9 million.  Its existing business and home loan book amounts to just over &euro;2 million.  It has potential for a lot more.  With the value of an average mortgage being &euro;250,000, this credit union has the potential to give out only nine mortgages in total.  It seems the credit union movement is being held back.  The witnesses may not be able to give me a detailed answer to this question but do the banks lobby the Department of Finance very heavily on these matters?  The witnesses may have only been in their roles a short time, but do they know what the situation has been over the years?  Is there a lot of lobbying from the pillar banks - the banks we bailed out?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022050500002#P02000","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651739400,"counter":489,"content":"<p>The limits the Chairman is referring to are not set by the Department of Finance; they are set by the independent regulator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022050500002#P02100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Des Carville"},{"type":"speech","time":1651739400,"counter":490,"content":"<p>I know.

However, penalties arrive very quickly if, say, somebody does not get to pay the toll.  How do we compare with other jurisdictions?  Could TII give us some information about third-country vehicles?  How does it collect the tolls, or does it collect them?  The other thing I discovered from replies I received is that people overpay.

Among the projects for which an update is given is the N2 Clontibret to the Border scheme.  As we discussed in the hearing with TII, it has been removed from the funding allocation this year.  The price range is now given at &euro;280 million to &euro;340 million, which is fairly broad.  I have raised previously that these ranges are very broad.  My big question relates to the project status, which indicates the next steps for this scheme are under consideration.  Under \"comments\" it states very bluntly that the scheme is on hold.  With regard to the official parlance it would be useful if we were to get clarification as to what, if any, distinction there is between the two comments.  A document I received through freedom of information indicated this element of the road was suspended because of funding constraints and a focus on bypass and compact growth schemes.  It would be useful to ask TII to provide us with details of the cost-benefit analysis carried out on various projects.  Even within the funding constraints we could have issues pertaining to the level of funding allocated.  Even within these there are too many questions as to why some projects are favoured above others.  I have seen no rationale as to why this project would be demoted and put on hold as against others, other than political considerations, which TII told us when it came before us form a big part of the decisions it makes.

We will note and publish the correspondence and follow-up.<\/p> <p>  No. 1209 B is from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Health and is dated 25 April 2022.  It provides information requested by the committee on the national children's hospital.  Our first question concerned controls for delays and sanctions.  While the contractual provisions are set out in the response it is not clear whether any damages have been paid by the contractor for failure to complete sections of the project by the agreed completion dates.  We might request clarity from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.   Our second question was on a potential conflict of interest but again the question is not directly answered.  I propose that we request clarification from the board as to whether this potential conflict was identified or considered and, if so, whether it was addressed.  In relation to the board&rsquo;s analysis of the projected costs and timelines for the project, we wrote to the Department again and reiterated our request for sight of it and asked that the Department clarify whether it could be provided to the committee on a confidential basis.  It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence and to request the information mentioned.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I propose that we seek clarification from the board as to whether damages have been paid to the contractor with regard to the agreed completion dates.  We also asked for clarification from the board as to whether potential conflicts of interest were identified or considered and, if so, whether they were addressed.<\/p> <p>  There is also the issue of the reply the Secretary General gave at a meeting.  We raised and brought to his attention that the commitments given to the committee on 16 December did not align with the response.  In the second last and last paragraph of his letter of 25 April he states he does not believe the responses are not aligned and that rather his response reflects the fact he is the Accounting Officer for the Department of Health, and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is a statutory body under the aegis of the Department.  He reiterates his response to confirm this was not a single decision point as to whether the analysis could or should be furnished to the committee but rather the collective corporate fiduciary responsibility of the Department of Health and the development board, cognisant of the confidential and commercially sensitive nature of the contents regarding a live strategically and financially important contract under project 2021.  He also states that ultimate responsibility would lie with the Department.  I am open to correction on this but my recollection of the previous occasion Mr. Watt came before the committee-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022050500002#DD00800","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1651739400,"counter":642,"content":"<p>What correspondence is this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022050500002#DD00900","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1651739400,"counter":643,"content":"<p>It is No. 1209 B.<\/p><p>It is the final two paragraphs of his letter.

My recollection - I am open to correction on this - is that when he was pressed on the matter he said that he took the decision when the last questioner raised it with him.  That is my recollection of the matter, and this would appear to be at odds with it.  He is saying that it is a corporate decision, but I thought I heard him say that day that, as Accounting Officer, it is his decision and that he made the decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022050500002#DD01000","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651739400,"counter":645,"content":"<p>On that point, he also states that ultimate responsibility for this would lie with him.  We are told that in February and March of this year, the value of claims increased by a further &euro;31 million.  That means a total of &euro;585 million.  From what I am aware of, any dispute that has been resolved has been resolved in favour of the contractor.  It would be useful to get clarification on whether the contractor has lost any claims he has made.  I am told that a number of them are on hold, for want of a better term.<\/p> <p>  We have accepted, and it is broadly accepted now, that the cost of this project is going to exceed &euro;2 billion, although that was not acceded to by the Department or the Secretary General.  Considering that we are not being provided with this information it is a fair question to ask whether there is recourse for us to force a Department to provide us with documentation that we have sought and that we think is important to our deliberations.  I do not know if that can be provided to us here or whether we need to go into private session for the clerk to tell us, but I do not believe we can accept a situation whereby, whether it is a corporate entity or an individual, the public service and a Department are essentially telling the Committee of Public Accounts of the D&aacute;il that they are refusing to provide us with information relating to the expenditure of hundreds of millions of euro of public money and that they will not provide us with that information until, essentially, the money has been spent.  That is unacceptable.<\/p> <p>  On a further point, there have been reports of a number of arson attacks at the site in question.  It would be useful if we could get clarification as to whether that will impact on the public outlay relating to the costs.  For many contracts, if a contractor is undertaking works it is responsible for the security on that site while the works are ongoing.  It would be helpful to get clarification that this is the case on this site or on whether insurance cover is in place to ensure there is no public outlay on that.<\/p> <p>  On a separate matter but relating to the same Secretary General, we agreed last week to write to seek clarification in respect of the timeframe for which he had waived a portion of his salary.

Is the cost of it being picked up by the contractor?  Ultimately, the contractor would be responsible for both security and staff on the site.  It is a very unusual situation, to put it mildly.<\/p> <p>  There is &euro;585 million in claims made by the contractor at this point.  Only &euro;22 million has been settled so far.

The contractor was slow to get the thing up and running, and we are now into an inflationary period.  What I feel we are getting is an attitude of \"Trust us\" that all sanctions are being applied.  This committee is required to satisfy itself regarding the matter rather than being told \"Trust us\".  They are saying that some of the things are commercially sensitive.  If something has been settled, it is gone and over.  The decision has been made and it is no longer commercially sensitive.  Some of the claims will fall into that category.<\/p> <p>  None of us is trying to add to the cost of this building.  It is expensive enough and it is going on for longer  In fact, part of the reason that we were told the two-stage process could not be walked away from was that it would delay the delivery of the hospital, but if they had gone somewhere else it probably would have been no later than this is going to be delivered anyway.  We are at the point where we are in a circle of correspondence that is completely ineffective.  We have to get the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board before the committee so we can ask some of those questions to our satisfaction.  It could be doing an amazing job in settling claims and rejecting things, but I want to see that for myself in the context of things that have already been done.  I am not saying we should be interrogating things that are going to the courts or that have not yet been settled.  I want to see the process and how robust it is.

It is good the committee will be hearing from me and then directly afterwards from the USI, IUA and THEA because my experience of working on these issues around gender equality has very much been one of partnership right across the sector.  I hope we can begin to knit together a full picture and range of views on these important issues.  Before I begin I take the opportunity to commend formally the work of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Gender Equality that culminated in the publication of a report containing 45 recommendations across eight themes.  It was a significant moment in a long history of advocacy and public discourse around how we treat and value women and girls in this country and how we make real progress when it comes to the issue of gender equality.<\/p> <p>  I was especially heartened to see the inclusive parameters the assembly adopted for its work, for example by recognising violence against women as a gender justice issue.  As members know, I have direct experience from my time as Minister for Health of the impact a citizens' assembly report can have and what follows when a report leaves the assembly and comes to the Oireachtas, which I think is exactly what the Chair is alluding to.  It is a process that has served us very well in trying to make cross-party societal, social change on important issues.  Particularly around the issue of reproductive rights and healthcare, it showed we can be very respectful in how we work to make progress.  I am therefore excited another citizens' assembly has reported on an area of work of major importance and an all-party Oireachtas committee is now examining how to turn those recommendations into tangible action.  Usually when one comes before a committee as a Minister, one is accounting for everything one is doing and that is right and proper.  I very much see this engagement as a two-way flow where I and my Department outline to the committee what we are doing but we very much look forward to hearing members' views, seeing its report and seeing what more we can do.  I look forward to working with the committee on that.<\/p> <p>  I wish to be clear at the outset that gender inequality is pervasive across society and we cannot silo or reduce our aims to achieve gender justice to one category or a range of narrow perspectives.  We need a holistic, whole-of-government, whole-population approach if we are serious about making progress.  While the assembly&rsquo;s recommendations cut across many policy areas and very much highlight the need for a collective Government response, I am here to share with members the role my Department must play in advancing gender equality.  I understand the committee has requested that this session primarily focus on recommendations 26 to 31, inclusive, regarding norms, stereotypes and education and I welcome that.  However, as they are interrelated I will also address recommendations 28 to 30, inclusive, as my Department is also progressing work in these areas.<\/p> <p>  While my Department has policy responsibility for third level, we need to have an honest conversation here about how gender stereotypes and issues of equality roll through the entire education system.  We need to link in across the three systems, namely, the primary, secondary and third levels.  I feel very strongly about this.  It would be dishonest of me to not be clear about how strongly I feel about the issue.  There is really good work being done in the third-level sector around consent but it is just too late.  It needs to happen much earlier.  I know the committee will be engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Education.  There is little point in talking about consent at third level, for example, if we do not have a comprehensive sexual education curriculum at primary and secondary level in an age-appropriate manner.  It is with regret I say this is one of the key recommendations of the Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution that has not been substantially progressed yet.  If we wait until our young people are aged 18 years and entering third level to educate them on consent, in many ways the damage can be done; certainly it can be more difficult to undo perceived norms at that stage.  In any event, I understand a separate invitation has issued to my colleague, the Minister for Education.  I very much look forward to working with her and her Department on any shared recommendations that arise from this committee's report.<\/p><p>A long-held aim of the education policy has been to ensure that everybody is afforded the opportunity to develop to their full potential in this country.  Traditional gender norms and stereotypes can lead to adverse outcomes in terms of gender inequality, which can inhibit people from reaching their full potential and lead to less than desired outcomes.\u00a0 In the education sector this can manifest itself in subject choices in the school system which, in turn, can influence course choices at third level which can, in turn, determine future career paths.<br\/><br\/>The higher and further education sector can be an engine for economic growth, and an instrument to promote diversity and enhance social cohesion.  I want to ensure that we create opportunities and support people to engage in education and training at every stage of their lives to learn, upskill, reskill and grow.<br\/><br\/>I propose to go through each of the relevant recommendations and update the committee on my Department's initiatives and work.<br\/><br\/>Recommendation 28 states: <\/p><blockquote>\tAll levels of the education system from pre-school to third level, led by the relevant Government Department, should:\u00a0  \t(a) Ensure that initial education and continuing professional development for staff includes modules promoting gender awareness and gender-sensitive teaching methods.<br \/><br \/>(b) Monitor policies and practices - including school inspection and whole school evaluation through the lens of gender equality and report regularly on trends and outcomes by gender.  <\/blockquote><p>I would like to share with the committee some of our activities concerns gender awareness, and the monitoring of practices and policies in third level education.<br\/><br\/>On 15 March, I announced the second national review of gender equality.  The review is being carried out by an expert group, on behalf of the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  The review will assess the progress since the first review of its kind in 2016 and make recommendations to ensure that gender equality is amplified in higher education institutions.  The expert group is expected to make five to ten high-level recommendations on how higher education institutions might enhance their equality policies, and their implementation of those policies, to support gender equality.  I expect to be in a position to publish this report towards the end of this year.<br\/><br\/>Progress is continuing on the range of indicators included in the gender action plan for higher education and I will outline some examples.  All higher education institutions have institutional gender action plans and now submit annual progress updates to the HEA.  The HEA continues to publish the higher education institutional staff profiles by gender on an annual basis.  New and additional gender-specific posts under the senior academic leadership initiative, SALI, was launched in 2019, and I am sure that colleagues will not mind me acknowledging the work on SALI done by the former Minister of State with responsibility for higher education, Mary Mitchell O'Connor.  The initiative is very sensible but it was also a brave initiative at the time and I think that it was the right thing to do.  I am delighted to say that to date 20 posts at senior academic level have been awarded to Irish HEIs under the first cycle of the initiative.  During my time as Minister I am delighted to have been in a position to award a further ten posts so far under the second cycle of the initiative.<br\/><br\/>Higher education institutions that currently hold Athena SWAN Ireland awards are guided in their applications to provide information on training that is related to equality and diversity, management, leadership, and-or other opportunities linked to career progression.  I am pleased to say that 15 additional awards were announced on March 31, which means: there has been a total number of 98 awards; 20 HEIs have achieved a bronze award; and 78 departmental awards have been made to date.<br\/><br\/>The attainment of Athena SWAN awards is now linked to eligibility for research funding.  This is an important moment and we are leading in this area.  When I tell European colleagues and the European Commission about the progressive initiative that we have taken as a country.  I refer to the fact that we have linked the eligibility to apply for research funding from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Health Research Board, the Irish Research Council, and Science Foundation Ireland to attaining an Athena SWAN award.  That means we have directly linked gender equality to the ability to draw down research funding.  I think that is a good move and I hope it is one other countries will follow.  Our senior research academic posts have increased by 50% in the course of a year from 2019 to 2020.  In addition, in the research sector the female research applicant success rate has grown from 26% in 2019 to 31% in 2020.<br\/><br\/>To be clear about accountability, in addition to the submission of progress updates the governing authority of each higher education institution must submit a statement to the HEA confirming that the institution has an action plan in place, and that it is being implemented as part of its annual governance statements.  All HEIs are required to submit an annual governance statement and a statement of internal control to the HEA, which covers a comprehensive list of governance requirements.  That is how we ensure accountability in terms of progress.<br\/><br\/>The HEA has awarded funding of over &euro;0.5 million under the gender equality enhancement fund in 2020-21 to advance gender equality initiatives in Irish higher education.  Awards were made across three areas - research on or advancing gender quality initiatives in Ireland; training programmes that specifically address gender equality; and Athena SWAN capacity building activities.  Projects were funded across several areas.  They include the promotion of female role models in the physical sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics; the development and implementation of gender identity, expression and diversity training for staff in Irish HEIs; the establishment of networks to support female participation in computer science; resources to support the academic advancement of mid-career female staff; the provision of gender equality-based leadership training to future leaders and so on.<br\/><br\/>Recommendations 29 and 16 refer to how we reform financial supports.  Recommendation 29 states: &quot;In view of the gendered impact on women, reform the Third Level Grants Scheme to ensure that those accessing part-time courses are eligible to apply for a grant.&quot;  Recommendation 16 states: &quot;Address the specific needs of lone parents to incentivise and support them in accessing work or education, including provision of child and after-school care.&quot;  When I took up this role one of the first things that I did was commission a review of the student grant scheme.  It is timely that I am here because I was delighted to bring the final report to Government this week and we launched it yesterday morning.\u00a0<br\/><br\/>Already, as a result of the review, we have made some early progress in addressing some of the review's recommendations around the cost of living.  However, we cannot hide away from the fact that the cost of living for students has increased as it has for us all.As women comprise the majority of lone parents we must ensure that there is access to the supports they need if they wish to enter or re-enter education.\u00a0<br\/><br\/>For the first time in a decade there will be significant changes to the rates and eligibility when it comes to student grants.  As colleagues will be aware, the rate of the grant will increase.  There will be an increase in the  income threshold that goes into a house while still qualifying.  Plus the number of students who can qualify for a larger grant will increase due to changes in the adjacency rules from September.All that in of itself is not enough.  We need to make bigger changes to the structure of the SUSI grant.  The review that I published yesterday is very clear about this matter.To be blunt, that means considering ways to provide student supports and grants to people who undertake part-time education.  There is the idea that every student is 18, just out of school and looking forward to going to college for four years.  That is great for them but that is not all of our students.  There will be an increasing number of students, and it is hard to put ages on these things, who will be in their 40s, there will be women with dependants with a mortgage and a full-time job trying to, and needing to, access the education system.  I admit, as the Minister, that there is an inconsistency in the policy approach.  We tell people to take up part-time education and study in flexible ways but do not provide a SUSI grant.  Yesterday's review was very clear that there is a need to make changes in that regard and I support the need for those changes.  I have been working my way through that in the budgetary processes and would welcome cross-party political support for this.<br\/><br\/>As part of the overall funding package that we announced yesterday, there is an implementation group that will be chaired by Professor Anne Looney and Professor Tom Collins, which may be of interest to the committee in terms of its work to make sure that there is a focus on gender equality and gender proofing the work of the implementation group.<br\/><br\/>Very shortly I will bring to Government the new national plan for equity of access to higher education.  I am genuinely very excited about the plan.  It is going to make an impact where we need it the most.  Not only will students be supported to enter third level, we will start to measure things a bit better and not just measure getting somebody in the door, which is important.  We will measure when people get in the door of a college and what happens when they leave college.<br\/><br\/>Objectively, through successive Ministers and Governments of different hues, we have made a lot of progress when it comes to access.  However, we do not measure everything when it comes to access.  We can say that we are doing great, and in some areas we have, but the bigger story is the things in the access plan that we do not measure.  Perhaps this committee has some ideas on how we can look at some groups that are currently under-represented in higher education.  Of course that can involve people from socioeconomic groups that have low participation.  For example, Irish Travellers, students with disabilities, first-time mature student entrants, part-time and-or flexible learners; and further education award holders.<br\/><br\/>Lone parents and ethnic minorities are included in this grouping as a subgroup.  Following a review of the supports and barriers for lone parents in accessing higher education in 2017, a number of additional supports were put in place to support lone parents.  In the interests of time I will take the detail of that as read as I am conscious that my statement is a bit long.<br\/><br\/>Recommendation 30 refers to the STEM programmes and analysing how to encourage more women into what have been male-dominated careers, which includes STEM programmes and apprenticeships, and, equally, how do we develop initiatives that encourage men into female-dominated careers because, traditionally, the caring professions have been dominated overwhelmingly by women rather than men.  One of the most impressive groups that I have ever encountered since I took up this role is the group called Women Technology and Stem, WITS.  They have informed me about the various barriers that face young women entering STEM careers, and the steps that we need to take to fix what they call the leaky pipeline of women working in STEM industries.<\/p><p>We are very good at diagnosing what the leaky pipeline is and diagnosing the problems and challenges but it is harder to diagnose what we need to do next.  I have met some of the most impressive people I have ever come across in this area and even in discussions with them, I am not sure we are clear on the five or ten tangible actions we must take.  That feeds into the work of the committee.  The problem has been clearly identified.  It is a fact that there are many women in Ireland with qualifications in STEM not working in STEM.  There are also women in Ireland with qualifications in STEM not in the workforce.  That is the leaky pipeline.  The question is how we fix it.  I have had some very good discussions with those people on that.<\/p><p> We are funding a number of initiatives to ensure more women enter male-dominated careers.  Existing programmes to encourage women into male-dominated careers include Springboard+ and the human capital initiative pillar 1.  Springboard+ complements the core State-funded education and training system and provides free and subsidised upskilling and reskilling higher education opportunities in areas of identified skills need.  Since early 2017, Springboard courses have been made available for free to returners, that is, people looking to get back into the workforce.  Employed people participating in courses at levels 7 and above contribute 10% of the course cost, with the remainder being funded by the Government.  Almost 64% of course places are in STEM-related areas, including new and emerging technologies around cybersecurity and virtual reality.<\/p><p> When it comes to apprenticeships, there needs to be a relentless focus on female participation.  We have an action plan for apprenticeships.  We want to get 10,000 new apprenticeships registered every year by 2025.  I believe we are going to hit that target.  It is possible we could even exceed it.  We are already at over 8,000 as of last year.  Some good news, albeit coming from a very low base, is that the number of female apprentices is growing.  It was 665 at the end of 2019 and was 1,482 in March 2022.  There is an increase there, which we very much welcome.  One of the five unambiguous objectives in this plan is Apprenticeship for All, meaning that the profile of the apprenticeship population will more closely reflect the profile of the general population.  We are matching the rhetoric with actions.  We have also put in place a new bursary scheme.  I recently announced a gender equity bursary, which provides a bursary for employers of apprentices from a minority gender in apprenticeships where there is over 80% representation of a single gender.  This applies overwhelmingly to apprenticeships where employers need to take on women to bring about gender equality, but there is one apprenticeship in hairdressing where they need to take on more men.  Under the action plan, we are also establishing an equity of access committee and will develop additional targeted actions to support the diversification of the apprentice population so that it more strongly reflects the general population.  Options such as increased flexibility in the delivery of apprenticeships to facilitate part-time employment or periods of leave will be considered in the delivery of this new inclusive apprenticeship delivery structure.  These actions align with the national strategy for women and girls which includes an action to increase female participation in apprenticeships.<\/p><p> Regarding recommendation 38, which is about eliminating tolerance in our society of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, the framework for consent in higher education institutions was launched in April 2019.  It aims to ensure the creation of an institutional campus culture that is safe, respectful and supportive for students and staff.  The framework outlines a number of aims for higher education institutions, HEIs, students and staff.  The HEA and my Department will ensure relevant supporting structures and processes are in place to address the issues of sexual harassment and violence on campuses.  There are 15 framework outcomes, which are grouped thematically under headings and look at areas such as institutional culture, institutional processes for the recording of incidents, lines of responsibility and targeted initiatives.<\/p><p> The first letter I wrote to university presidents on taking up this role was not about funding or any of those important issues; it was specifically about adopting a zero-tolerance approach to sexual harassment, sexual and gender-based violence.  As a result of that, every higher education institution in Ireland has now published its own individual action plan.  National frameworks are great but institutions cannot hide behind them.  They cannot stay too high-level.  The presidents have to tell us what they are going to do on their campuses to make sure the culture is safe, and how they are going to report on that.  I thank them all for their work on that.<\/p><p> As part of the monitoring requirements, HEIs are required to report annually to the HEA on progress in implementing the framework for consent.  We are also providing funding for this.  Over &euro;400,000 has been allocated to a number of initiatives.  In addition, the HEA has allocated funding of over &euro;500,000 towards consent workshops, the development of an anonymous report and support tool, and UCC&rsquo;s bystander intervention programme.  I thank Professor Louise Crowley for her leadership on that.  My Department is also partnering with the Department of Justice and the NUIG Active* Consent programme on the roll-out of an integrated, publicly available, online learning and resource hub on sexual consent awareness and learning.  I thank Dr. P&aacute;draig MacNeela for his leadership there.  I launched the online consent hub on sexual consent in January.  This is the first time we have a national online resource relating to consent.  It is a publicly available, free educational resource on sexual consent for young people, their families, and the educators who work with them.  This hub will play an important role and will be a very important resource for both students and wider society.<\/p><p> I could not come here today without commenting on the launch of the report on the student and staff surveys on sexual violence and harassment in higher education.  It was a genuinely harrowing read.  I take this opportunity to thank students and staff across the country who took the time to engage with this survey and share their experiences.  Some people were too focused on identifying how many people filled out the survey and so on rather than listening to what the survey was telling us.  A total of 11,417 responses were analysed from 7,901 students and 3,516 staff.  The survey points to some positive developments.  There has been a significant increase in awareness around the training programmes and a significant increase in the willingness of both staff and students to access training programmes.  More students want consent classes and more staff want to be trained in this area.  More people say they would intervene in a scenario they did not believe to be appropriate.<\/p><p> Those are the encouraging signs but there are also some deeply troubling findings, such as the levels of sexual harassment experienced by staff and students.  This is not necessarily on campus harassment because we asked students and staff for all their experiences.  It is an insight into a broader societal challenge.  An expert advisory group on ending sexual violence and harassment, chaired by the HEA, has reviewed the survey reports and has proposed a number of actions, for example, around consent classes and the availability of investigators.  I have fed the recommendations of my Department and that expert group into the Department of Justice for inclusion in the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  I will continue to speak up and speak out about the importance of institutional change, championing the changes required to achieve a cultural norm where bullying and sexual harassment are not tolerated.<\/p><p> I want to mention an important piece of data-gathering within the higher education sector.  On 8 March 2021, I launched the national gender equality dashboard for higher education institutions.  This is based on the higher education institution staff profiles by gender.  This dashboard was developed by Maynooth University and provides, for the first time, an interactive and comparative visualisation of key staff data and gender profiles from Irish higher education institutions.  It will be updated annually and offers a valuable baseline from which progress on gender equality can be visualised and measured across all grades of staff in universities, colleges, and institutes of technology.  It is important that we continue to improve data collection so we can have the evidence to inform policies and measure progress or highlight challenges.  The centre of excellence in the HEA monitors HEI performance through the strategic dialogue process.  The centre is responsible for analysing and publishing annual higher education institution staff profiles by gender and setting ambitious targets in this regard.<\/p><p> This was my attempt at a brief synopsis of what my Department and sector are advancing to achieve the goal of gender equality.  There is a massive body of work to be done in third level.  In many ways, the third level sector holds a mirror up to the broader issues in society.  We, the sector, students and staff are determined to lead the way in bringing about cultural change.  If we cannot bring about a safe culture in academia, a place that is meant to be full of enlightened progressives, where can we?  Education has the ability to change culture.  We should let our young people and staff in colleges experience zero tolerance for sexual harassment and gender-based violence.  Let them have the tools and resources they need to live in a gender-equal society and let them take that knowledge out into broader society, back to their homes, communities and workplaces. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#D00300","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":679,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

An area I have been fascinated by for the last number of years is that of women in STEM.  There has been a lot of excellent research done in this country on how to encourage greater female participation in STEM subjects and, ultimately, in STEM careers.  CoderDojo has done some wonderful research and Accenture did an excellent piece of research about five years ago in collaboration with DCU.<\/p><p>There are many exciting things happening regarding how we encourage women to make the initial decision to participate in STEM subjects at third level; however, much more collaboration and co-operation are needed right across the education system, from junior infants right through the various other levels.  Much of the research has concluded that while a focus on role models for women and girls in STEM subjects is incredibly important, it is even more important to have role models in one&rsquo;s immediate peer group.  A nine-year-old girl in a primary school in Roscommon with a fascination with all things technical will be most inspired by another nine-year-old girl sitting beside her sharing that fascination.  Therefore, we need to consider what research is available internationally.  We need to consider the global exemplars regarding how this is done well.  Ultimately, more in-depth collaboration between primary, post-primary and third levels is required.  I encourage the Minister, Deputy Harris, the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, and others to consider this area to ensure that we can completely normalise the decision-making process for young girls who want to immerse themselves in STEM subjects very early in life and get involved in STEM careers.  That is ultimately what we are trying to do.  If we can seek to normalise the choice of a STEM career and make it seem just like any other career choice, we will have done a great body of work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#F00300","speaker":"1483","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":682,"content":"<p>I fully agree with Deputy Cannon.  I realise he knows about this matter from his time in what was the Department of Education and Skills, his work on CoderDojo and his interest in this whole area.  I could list out all we are doing at third level, as I did in my opening statement, but the Deputy is entirely correct that these decisions are made by young girls long before they get to third level.  I must highlight the question of access and availability to subjects in all schools.  It is a fact that in some all-girls schools, there has not been sufficient subject diversity.  People are working to improve this.<\/p> <p>  We are aware that because we have narrowed the conversation so much, students, whether men or women, were not hearing much at all about apprenticeships.  This feeds into some of the work we are doing on CAO reform.  I have met some female apprentices and will be meeting more after this committee meeting.  I ask them whether they entered apprenticeships directly from school.  Sometimes they laugh at me and say they did not know anything about apprenticeships at school.  It is as if they got there accidentally.  Maybe they took the traditional college route, found it was not for them and heard about an apprenticeship later.  They say they wish they had known about apprenticeships earlier.  Therefore, I hope some of the work we are doing on apprenticeships, further education options and the trades through the CAO discussion and reform and the changes to the website helps, but it is very much about getting role models into schools as well as having the relevant conversation.  We are now trying to build a panel of female apprentices to visit schools in order that students will believe they can be one when they see one.<\/p> <p>  Subject choice is an important aspect.  Professor Anne Looney in DCU has spoken to me about how subjects are taught.  I do not have the research in front of me and I am going on memory but if one asks a class whether anybody is interested in science, one is likely to see more male hands than female hands going up in many primary schools.  I am led to believe, however, that if the pupils are asked whether they are interested in whether we can come up with a cure for a health condition, more female hands begin to go up.  There is research, rather than just anecdote, behind the understanding of what the concept of science is and how it applies to the different genders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#G00200","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":683,"content":"<p>That is very helpful.

It is a matter of how we frame, not advertise, what the careers are going to look like for our younger students.<\/p> <p>  I have some questions but I want to start on a point that is very close to my heart but that also gives me a bit of a nervous twitch.  I am not going to lie to the Minister in that regard.  We have come phenomenal distances since I was a teenage lone parent who re-entered education.  The barriers at the time were such that without really good support, you were simply not going to get there.  I am talking about the late 1990s.  We have made real progress in that regard, which has to be acknowledged, but there are still barriers.  Unless we can get to grips with them, we will continue to see women failing to meet their own career objectives.  Also, we will not benefit from them being in the workplace.  That is what is really key here.<\/p> <p>  One of the issues that repeatedly comes across my desk is the back-to-education scheme.  The Minister spoke about emerging technologies and he was correct to do so because technology is emerging and changing constantly.  He needs to consider the idea of someone accessing back-to-education supports more than once.  If we are serious about asking people to work in particular areas, we need to start removing the barriers that exist.<\/p> <p>  On STEM subjects, I am proud that my child who was born in the late 1990s is now a woman in STEM herself and absolutely loving it.  Again, however, she is one of those who made her career choice not by way of any direct path but by a meandering road.  That is acceptable and there is nothing wrong with that; a meandering path sometimes gives us the opportunity to learn life skills along the way.<\/p> <p>  What gives me the nervous twitch is the non-adjacent rate.  I say this as somebody whose constituency is quite rural.  I recognise that we need to have a limit and a reduction, which I welcome.  In my home town, Mullingar, there are people who access public transport to get to T&uacute;s in Athlone.  Some might live 29 km away while others might live 31 km away, which is over the threshold of 30 km, but those in each category receive a different rate of support.  They all get on the same bus in the morning.  That is one of the small barriers.  It is not major but small, yet it has an impact.<\/p> <p>  My colleague is correct in speaking about these issues.  A saying that came to the fore in recent years is one that I truly believe in: you cannot be what you cannot see.  We all remember it.  It popped out around when Chris Hadfield had a better Internet connection on the International Space Station that some of us did at home, but it is true.  This falls very nicely back under recommendation No. 31, on how we promote gender equality and avoid gender discrimination.  Women who do jobs that may not have been traditionally associated with their gender - the same applies to men - are the ones we need to see on our screens and hear on our radios.  These are the ones who can have a genuine impact on younger children such that the latter will say there is something in what is being said and that they might join CoderDojo, the Midlands Science club or another such group as a consequence.  That is critical.<\/p> <p>  One of the keys to encouraging more women into apprenticeships is providing wider options.  Plenty of careers already have a hybrid model involving learning and earning, otherwise known as an apprenticeship, although the title is not attached.  This is something we should be considering also.<\/p> <p>  The Minister spoke about the linkages between primary, secondary and third levels and further education.  He was correct to do that.  It is a matter of having cross-sector engagement when it comes to the changes we need to make.  A whole-of-government approach is required.<\/p> <p>  Before this committee reports, can the Minister outline his experience with cross-departmental engagement on the issue of gender equality?  He spoke of silos.  We do not want people working in silos; we very much want a team push towards where we need to go.  We would like to know what the Minister&rsquo;s experience has been.<\/p> <p>  Consider the consent framework across third level, which is doing a reasonably good job.  We have a zero-tolerance approach, action plans, resources, workshops, committee frameworks and the whole shebang but it appears to me that there is no real mechanism by which progress can be measured.  I raised this with the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister for Justice, last week.  It is very important.  If we simply measure the reduction in reported assaults or measure progress as the return of a form to be sent in, we are not using an appropriate parameter.  There is better work that we could do on that.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the professional development of academic staff, is diversity and gender training part of the professional development programme?  If not, why not?  This is one of the areas that the citizens really focused on in their recommendation.  We speak of very young children we want to bring forward.  While we know about the progress made regarding students and staff, is diversity and gender training included in professional development courses?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#G00400","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":685,"content":"<p>I am conscious that there was a lot in that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#G00500","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":686,"content":"<p>We could be here all day.

I will get her Twitch in a minute.  I find myself in agreement with much of what she has said.  On the issue of lone parents, while I do not need to mansplain this in any way to the Deputy, she is right that we have made progress.  That is a statement of fact.  In truth, there are now more people from diverse and different backgrounds entering higher education.  The Deputy is also right that a lot more needs to be done.<\/p> <p>  I will briefly identify three things.  Reform of the student grant is a big piece.  Second, based on an experience I had in Wexford the other day, I know that the opening of the technological universities, bringing education into the regions, is a game changer.  I was talking to lone parents in Wexford who are involved in lifelong learning and they told me that, if they did not have the Wexford campus and had to go to Waterford, that would not have been possible.  That is what they basically said.  Ensuring that not all roads lead to the big city and bringing higher education into the regions is important.  It will provide opportunities for people from a whole variety of backgrounds, including lone parents, who may not be there otherwise and it is already doing so.  That is the feedback I got this week.  <\/p> <p>  The third thing I will identify is online learning.  We saw this during the Covid pandemic.  During that time, we saw a lot of things we would never want to see again but we also saw an education system that was less rigid and more flexible and responsive.  Obviously, outside of the pandemic, that will have to be done in a more organised and planned way.  I met with Longford Women's Link, which is an incredible organisation.  All those I met were women learners who were, at a later stage in life, accessing degree programmes at Maynooth University and South East Technological University Carlow from rural Longford.  They told me that the availability of online education, which was, to be honest, a Covid measure, enabled them to do a degree.  They were not able to pack their bags and head to Maynooth and Carlow.<\/p> <p>  If I was to pick three things, and there are way more, they would be: the reform of financial supports, particularly the student grant; bringing education into the regions; and bringing education online.  Those three things are potential building blocks.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right to highlight the poverty traps and the disconnect that sometimes arises between the initiatives of one Department and another Department's schemes.  We are trying to work our way through those.  The Department of Social Protection was involved in the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, review.  The Deputy is right; we need to improve how the back-to-education allowance interacts with other areas.  <\/p> <p>  On the adjacent and non-adjacent rates of grant, I was determined to make progress on this issue in the budget.  The Deputy has acknowledged that we did although she also believes we need to do a lot more.  It was the case that you had to live 45 km away for the non-adjacent rate.  That has been reduced to 30 km.  This means that many students will see their grant go up by 25%, 30% or 35% this September.  That is great but the Deputy is right in that, if you live 29 km away, you are out.  That is always the issue when you set thresholds.  However, if the Deputy were to ask me whether I am finished my journey with regard to reducing those rates, I would say that I am not.  I hope to make more progress on that.  The SUSI review, which was published yesterday, feeds into that.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Clarke makes an interesting point on apprenticeships.  Again, I believe she is correct.  It drives me crazy when people ask me, whether their sons and daughters should do third level or an apprenticeship because an apprenticeship is third level education.  It is just a different way of doing it.  It is the same piece of paper.  You can do a science degree in this country as an apprentice.  More and more, I am asking the universities and colleges - they are autonomous but it would be interesting to get their views when they are here later - how they can provide more of their degree programmes through the apprenticeship route.  In Ireland, you can do a master's degree as an apprentice, although there is only one such programme available.  You can even do a PhD as an apprentice in one area.  Can that become the norm to a greater degree?  The gender impact of that could be quite significant.<\/p> <p>  With regard to my experience of how Government, by which I mean the State rather than Government in the political sense, operates on gender equality, there is good and bad.  A good example is the work we are doing on the third strategy, which is being led by my colleague, the Minister, Deputy McEntee.  It is a very collaborative, joined-up process and it is going well.  All of our Departments are feeding in their actions.  In my opening statement, I outlined what my Department is doing.  The Minister will bring that strategy to Cabinet.  Her Department is clearly the lead Department in that area.  Everyone gets how that works, which is good.<\/p> <p>  I do not think back on my leaky pipeline as a good example.  Again, I am not talking about Departments or Ministers but about the State, but I do not think we are as co-ordinated on the enterprise side.  If Women in Technology and Science Ireland, WITS, was here today, it could outline ten or 12 reasons women with science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, qualifications are not working in that field.  Those ten or 12 reasons would span four, five, six or seven Departments.  We are not joined up in that regard.  If I was to ask who is responsible for fixing that leaky pipeline, the answer would be a very long list of people.  Usually, when a long list of people are responsible for something, nobody is.  There is a good example and a bad example of co-ordination.<\/p> <p>  I will reflect on the question of how to measure progress.  It is a fair one.  How do we measure progress in terms of tackling sexual harassment, sexual violence and gender-based violence in third level education every year?  My initial answer would be that we do it in two ways.  We have an annual survey, which gives us a baseline.  Dr. Aoibhinn N&iacute; Sh&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in convinced me that you need annual surveys so that you can get and measure the data.  That is one way.  The second way is that we now have annual reporting of institutions' action plans.  The Deputy asked a very interesting question as regards what progress looks like and what we are measuring.  I will reflect on that.<\/p> <p>  On professional development, to be truthful, I do not know the answer.  It is a question for the institutions.  We will find out or the witnesses in the afternoon session may be able to provide that information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#H00100","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":689,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister very much for what was another very comprehensive response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#H00200","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":690,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and our other guests to the committee meeting.  I have a lot of notes so I hope the Minister will excuse me if I am not looking up at him.  I will first touch on relationships and sexuality education, RSE, and how the challenges become more acute at third level.  I may also touch on the precarious nature of employment contracts at third level.<\/p> <p>  In terms of RSE, the Minister, Deputy Foley, has said that the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is in the process of developing a revised RSE syllabus.  We know from responses from the NCCA that the development of that syllabus has not yet begun.  Responses to the review, and responses from students in particular, are unanimous with regard to the importance of relationships and sexuality education.  They reference the fact that they are conscious that, while friends and the Internet are sources of information, piecing information together from these sources has shortcomings.  I am particularly thinking about LGBT kids piecing together information they find online or get from friends, which may be a necessity where RSE is not inclusive.  This is probably a good moment to cite the programme for Government, which states the Government will \"Develop inclusive and age-appropriate RSE and SPHE curricula across primary and post-primary levels, including an inclusive programme on LGBTI+ relationships and making appropriate legislative changes, if necessary.\"  I will come back to the Minister's view as to whether such changes will be necessary.  <\/p> <p>  The Minister touched on this himself so I do not need to say to him, although I will because we do not always get opportunities to discuss RSE so this is the time to do it, but if commitments on change are not delivered, the problems will become much more acute at third level.  He has mentioned the Higher Education Authority study on sexual harassment.  Some 8,000 students and 3,500 staff responded and a third of female respondents said they had experienced non-consensual sex.  I think back to October 2020.  I remember speaking in the Seanad about an article written by Una Mullally, who had spoken to a student union officer in a Dublin university who had received 350 disclosures of harassment and assault in one calendar year.  Consent, positive and healthy relationships, safe Internet use and healthy attitudes towards sexual minorities are important.  Does the Minister think it will be necessary to make appropriate legislative changes as mentioned in the programme for Government or can we deliver on this without such changes?  As the Minister said, this was also the subject of a commitment in the report on the eighth amendment.  Sex education has been in place since 1995.  There is not much of an age gap between the Minister and I and we remember that this education was completely insufficient.  The Minister's views on that would be most welcome.  Perhaps I will allow him to respond at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#H00300","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":691,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Warfield.  I am in clear agreement on the need to have fact and evidence-based impartial information delivered in an age-appropriate manner in primary and secondary schools in Ireland.  What you learn or do not learn about these issues cannot be the luck of the draw or down to the ethos of the school or where you live.  That causes great societal difficulties.  I remember launching the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre's annual report a couple of years ago when I was in the Department of Health.  There are clear correlations between where young people get their information in respect of sex and their attitudes to sex as they grow up.  The Senator referenced social media.  I am an avid user of social media, as are many of us in this room.<\/p><p>I think it is great.  I imagine it is also a frightening time to be parent of a teenage or even pre-teenage child.  I worry that in the absence of proper and factual information being provided in a school setting, young people would end up developing their attitudes to and expectations of sex from social media.  We must call this out and get real on it.  We must get on with it.  There is a clear programme for Government commitment and my colleague, the Minister for Education, will be before the committee next week, or this month anyway.  That Minister is tasked with driving forward this programme for Government commitment and I know she will do that.  It is vital we do so.<\/p><p> In truth, I do not know if we require legislative change.  I will await the Minister's view in this regard.  I would not necessarily have thought that to be the case.  I would defend to the death the right of a parents to decide what ethos of school they want and I believe fundamentally that parents are the primary educators of their kids.  It is a separate and distinct issue, however, in having every child in Ireland being able to access age-appropriate, fact-based, impartial information about sex and consent.<\/p><p> There is a little good news in this respect.  My Department, through the Irish Research Council, has provided funding to the Bystander programme in University College Cork, and Professor Louise Crowley is an incredible individual and leader in the area.  That funding is to bring the programme into schools.  I will provide a note to the committee on this but there is an overwhelming demand for it.  It may be a strawman argument that there is much resistance to introducing such a programme to schools and it is not necessarily my experience but there is a need for a decision to get on with it.  I hope we can get there shortly.  This cannot be optional and it must be available to everybody in schools, regardless of what school a student attends.  I feel very strongly about that.<\/p><p> All of us in this room knocked on doors and asked people to repeal the eighth amendment to the Constitution.  It was a very important moment.  We told those people we would do other things.  We told them we would provide free contraception and proper sex education and education on consent in schools.  We need to fulfil all the promises we made to the people of Ireland.  I also feel very strongly about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#H00400","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":693,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

I am also conscious of the Higher Education Authority Bill.  I must raise the increasingly precarious nature of employment contracts across higher and further education, which disproportionately affects women.

Of all permanent full-time academic positions, 41% are held by women.  There is, I suppose, systemic precariousness of employment for women across higher and further education system.  I wanted to put that on record and I would welcome the Minister responding to the point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#J00500","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":697,"content":"<p>I will be brief in the interests of time.  Precarious employment is a real challenge in the third level sector.  To address it we must fund the sector properly and look at the employment control framework.  We have student-staff ratios in this country of approximately 20:1 and the European norm is 14:1 or 15:1.  We announced &euro;307 million in funding yesterday to plug the gap in core funding, and that has been welcomed by the sector.  They want to see the delivery but the figure has been welcomed and it will get us to the levels we need of 15:1.  That is how we will address precarious employment.  Representatives of the sector will be here later and they will make the point that the employment control framework is a piece of this issue and we will work our way through that with them.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned female presidents.  We have five technological universities in Ireland as of this week and three of them - a majority - have female presidents.  I was just looking at the traditional universities.  When I started in this role, there were no female presidents of universities, so it just shows the pace of change in the sector.  There is now a female president at both the University of Limerick and Maynooth and there is a female provost at Trinity.  She is the first and it only took more than 400 years but she is doing a super job.  I hope when Ministers come before this committee in future they will not have to remark how great it is to see that progress and it will just be the norm.

I agree with his comments about females in senior positions in universities and I compliment former Deputy, Mary Mitchell O'Connor, on the pioneering work she did in that regard.  She came up against much criticism for that but it was the right action.  Fair play to her for doing it.<\/p> <p>  I will follow up on the relationship and sex education issue.  I am glad my colleague raised this and I know he has done that a number of times in the Seanad.  I have raised the matter consistently in the D&aacute;il.  I do not want to criticise somebody who is not here and I have said this in the D&aacute;il as well.  My concern is that the junior cycle programme is being advanced and we will see content rolled out next year.  The senior cycle and primary content is not being developed, as far as I am aware, and I have been told that after the junior cycle work is done, that work will begin.  I do not understand why it needs to be done consecutively and not at the same time, as it is a similar body of work, albeit adapted for age-appropriate content.  I am taking this additional opportunity to speak to the Minister as a member of Cabinet and try to understand this better.  I know he cannot answer this directly but I want to know why such a body of work, which has such a similar read across age groups, cannot be done contemporaneously.  As he said, this needs to start at the age of five in primary school.  I also agree with his position on the overall parental choice, perhaps except on this matter, where every child is entitled to the same fact-based education as every other child, which is a societal imperative.<\/p> <p>  His Department also has a role in this with regard to higher education and teacher training, including teacher training colleges and curriculums within them.  In anticipation of this being delivered to children from the age of five, it will have to form part of the education programme for new teachers.  What engagement, if any, has begun in anticipation of that work, which will be completed at some time by the Department of Education?<\/p> <p>  We spoke before about mandatory consent classes following the sexual harassment survey that was published.  I reiterate the extraordinary responses from that, with 34.2% of female students reporting experiencing non-consensual vaginal penetration.  It is an extraordinary statistic but I can think of all the experiences of women in college, and then I wonder if it is that surprising.  It is certainly not surprising to me or my female friends or colleagues.  What has been the engagement since with universities on mandatory consent classes, if there are any?  I will allow the Minister to respond, although it would be great if I had time for another question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#J00800","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":700,"content":"<p>I do not want to use the Deputy's time but I acknowledge her own consistent advocacy of fact-based and evidence-based sex education in schools.  I agree entirely on that point.  I will take back the view to the wider government on how this work might be done contemporaneously rather than sequentially.  There is a logic in what she says.  The Minister for Education will be able to articulate more accurately her Department's position on this.  The programme for Government commitment is clear, and that is what we are all charged with delivering.<\/p> <p>  I will get the Deputy and the committee a note on the teacher training piece, which resides with the Department of Education.  The mandatory consent classes work is going very well.  Again, I will get a note for the committee but from what I can see, all our colleges are now providing consent classes as a core component of the general induction.  I use the phrase \"mandatory consent\" but what I mean by that is that it is not something that happens somewhere on a Wednesday night but it becomes part of a student's induction in college.  The uptake levels have been extraordinarily high.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's comments about the survey are right.  Politicians come out saying the findings are shocking or horrific but I am not sure that is the right reaction; the findings are stark and harrowing but give an insight into what people were experiencing.  The positive from the survey was that staff and students demonstrate a willingness and desire to access training.  Dr. P&aacute;draig MacNeela of the Active* Consent programme in NUI Galway speaks very well about this, indicating the very different approach to training by somebody who has been through sexual harassment.  It takes in what it is, what is consent and the attitudes, and it is quite transformational as well.<\/p><p>It might be useful for me to give the committee a breakdown, college by college, of the uptake levels and the progress.

Lone parents are of particular concern to the Citizens' Assembly.  We want to be able to provide routes back to education, particularly for female lone parents.<\/p> <p>  Another group I want to highlight is Beyond Exploitation, led by Ruhama Women's Project and the Immigrant Council of Ireland.  The group is trying to support people who have been in prostitution to get out of prostitution.  Those people are extremely marginalised and vulnerable.  In situations where people try to leave a situation of domestic violence, it is reported that it takes six, seven or eight tries to successfully leave because of how difficult it is.  People trying to leave prostitution, coercion and exploitation are having similar experiences.  One of the challenges Beyond Exploitation is facing is similar to that which the Housing First model of the Peter McVerry Trust tries to address.  In that case, the intention is to provide the most immediate need and wraparound services around it.  That situation is not a million miles away from that faced by women in prostitution when one considers the wraparound services that are needed.  Those services include housing, access to work and education.  The lack of those things might draw somebody back into a coercive arrangement.  Many of those challenges are similar to those that Housing First tries to address.  Access to work, education, support and training are particularly important.  I put that Beyond Exploitation campaign on the Minister's agenda and register.

I know that reform of SUSI will have a part to play in that regard.  I am not asking the Minister to tell us everything that will be in the national plan when it is published in June but what other measures will be included?  I am thinking in particular of access programmes.  Many access programmes focus on the important idea of the bridge from school to third level, who crosses that bridge and so forth.  I am also thinking of people who may be moving away from social protection payments and other supports.  I know there has been a lot of concern around, for example, those who may have parenting responsibilities and are only available part time.  Such people are often forced into short-term courses rather than encouraged or supported.  It can be a matter of timing.  A person might be told in March to undertake a six-month course rather than facilitated to enter college in September.  Some gaps are arising in that regard.  I would like a sense of how the Minister is engaging with the Minister for Social Protection, with whom we will also be meeting, on the topic of those gaps and route accesses.  I do not only ask with regard to the SUSI grant but also with respect to situations where people are being pressed into courses that might not be suitable.  I worked with young unemployed people for a period of time.  At that time, young unemployed people and parents whose children had reached a certain age and who were being encouraged into employment were being routed into a certain kind of education and employment.<\/p> <p>  I will also take up the issue of precarious employment, which is a specific issue.  I appreciate what the Minister said about the ratios but there are a few other issues.  I recently launched the new respect strategy in the National University of Ireland, Galway.  The university is developing a respect charter, which is a welcome initiative.  I spoke to many academics on that occasion, and I have spoken to other academics around the country, about the Athena SWAN initiative, which is very good.  The Government has given it teeth by linking access to research funding to attainment of certain levels of Athena SWAN.  It is notable that certain strands within universities, let us say well-resourced departments, are progressing further.  The sciences and business schools are able to progress further.  Part of Athena SWAN sensibly relates not simply to codes of conduct and everything else but to actual, secure employment.  That is one of the key issues in terms of women's progress.  We need a change in institutions to allow for secure contracts and genuine progression pathways.  That is happening less in the arts, partly because the arts are less resourced.  That is one factor.  There is a cultural issue but there is also a resourcing issue.  How might that be addressed?  Secure employment, which is a key plank of Athena SWAN, is recognised as a gender equality issue.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has talked about the research money that has gone into gender equality and research.  I have written to the Minister's Department about public-public research on a number of occasions.  Research that may not have a high financial aspect attached to it but has a high public good quotient is not always ranked highly for progression.<\/p> <p>  I know the Minister has engaged positively with the proposals of my colleague, Senator Ruane, for non-disclosure agreements and their.  There has been a signal that they should not be used further.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that because it is a core issue whereby patterns of gender inequality within higher education institutions are not being identified.<\/p> <p>  Another issue which has come up again and again is the importance of separate pathways for reporting.  That would mean that one is not necessarily reporting to the same person whose job is to recruit the superstar academic and who has financial imperatives but that there would instead be multiple ways to report.  Some people could be designated to focus solely on addressing the issues of abuse within institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#K00700","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":708,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator and fully agree with what she has said about lone parents.  The SUSI grant is a part of the equation but I would hate anyone to think it is the totality of how we improve access because it is not.  I base my comments on what lone parents and students have told me about their experiences.  There are related issues that are well outside the remit of my Department.  I am thinking of childcare and the likes.  That is definitely an issue for a lone parent who is trying to get back into education.  If someone has young kids, the cost of childcare is an obvious and real issue.<\/p> <p>  The Senator dwelt on the issue of the flexibility of how education is provided.  That is very important.  I am thinking of a woman I met the other day.  She told me that she is going on to do a master's degree.  When she started, she was planning on doing a short course to dip her toe back in the waters but managed, bite by bite, to get there.  She was fortunate to come across people who would help her on that journey.  All too often when people look at a prospectus and think they have to sign up for a four-year programme or something else, it can create an immediate barrier for their next step.<\/p><p>How we provide programmes, whether that is moving it online or whether it is actually allowing people do things over a longer period of time, is a key plank.  The group chaired by myself and professors Looney and Collins has five themes it intends to deliver as part of the &euro;307 million of core funding that we announced yesterday to plug the gap.  One of the themes is on how one creates a much more flexible education system.  That is not just because we believe it would be nice to have a more flexible education system.  We believe that without it one can never have a situation where all people can reach their full potential.  That obviously has a direct impact on the gender pay gap if all of a sudden one has to do the short course rather than being able to do the degree programme.<\/p><p> I really want to make progress on precarious employment.  The reason I am using the ratios is that if we fund the colleges to all of sudden be able to start taking people on, on proper permanent contracts, that will take people out of precarious employment.  Colleges will tell the committee at great length if they are asked that it involves work around the employment control framework.  My Department is engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on that.  Let me have a look into the point that the Chair is making around Athena SWAN.  There is a validity in that.  Let me see if I can support it.<\/p><p> Non-disclosure agreements have no place whatsoever when it comes to sexual harassment, violence, bullying or intimidation.  The only time a non-disclosure agreement should be used is perhaps in a commercial issue where one is trying to protect some commercial information.  The idea that a non-disclosure agreement would be used for anything to do with sexual harassment is utterly repulsive.  There is no other phrase for it.  It is utterly repulsive.<\/p><p> I wrote to Senator Ruane who has done superb work on this.  I wrote to all the institutions.  I got the letters back to assure me it was not the case.  I believe Senator Ruane and the women to whom she has spoken.  We have more work to do to tease through and to make sure none of the letters are in any way Jesuitical.  I am happy to engage further with the Chair and with Senator Ruane on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#K00800","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":710,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his extensive engagement with us.

I thank him for referring to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution which followed from the Citizens' Assembly because that is the committee we are taking as our model.  We are not re-opening the substantive policy issues but rather looking at implementation of the 45 recommendations that make up that blueprint for gender equality.<\/p> <p>  I want to pick up on recommendation 30 in particular.  We have spoken about this in our engagement today in terms of strengthening existing programmes to encourage women into STEM and apprenticeships.  Colleagues have raised a number of issues on that.  I am conscious, as the Minister has said, that some progress has been made but there are still far too few women in apprenticeships.

The Minister might want to give us a note on that.<\/p><p>I also want to refer to some practical ways to address this.  There is a wonderful new book out by Mr. Owen O'Doherty, who was inspired to write about role models for women in STEM, called <i>Bright Sparks<\/i>.  It is for children and is about women in Ireland in science.  That is the sort of great initiative that can help address the low levels of girls choosing to do subjects that would lead into STEM careers.  Does the Minister's Department have much engagement with careers advisors in schools at secondary level?  As he said, that is really where the issues arise.  Is there anything we can do, such as the milk round at third level, where the big solicitors' firms and corporates come in to attract graduates and students into their offices?  Could we see some way to doing that sort of milk round?  Maybe it is already being done with Science Foundation Ireland or others.  It is just a practical point.<\/p><p>Recommendation 30(b) of the Citizens' Assembly also called for the development of, &quot;initiatives to encourage men into female-dominated careers&quot;.  I know the Minister said there is one particular apprenticeship where that is an issue.  I think it is a hairdressing apprenticeship.  Is there any other measure the Minister can take to specifically target young men and boys?  The corollary is whether boys are choosing subjects that might lead into careers in the caring professions which tend to be more dominated by women.<\/p><p>I acknowledge Ms Mary Mitchell O'Connor's work in advancing Senior Academic Leadership Initiative, SALI, at university level.

I look forward to the committee's recommendations on how we can make progress.  The Chair is right that the total number of female apprentices is rising but the total population of apprentices is rising too.  I do not have the percentage.  I will get it for the Chair but I do not think we are making significant inroads at present.  That is why we have announced the female bursary.  That is why we have tried to change the CAO website to change the conversation.  It is why we are identifying role models and looking at specific initiatives.  We will set up an advisory group on this as part of our apprenticeship action plan in order that we can learn from best practice.<\/p> <p>  I think there are five craft apprenticeship programmes in Ireland without a female apprentice and 11 programmes with five or fewer.  That is from my memory but it gives the Chair an indication.  We do not have time to get into it today but I want to flag the issue of league tables in schools because this is a real challenge.  If we decide as a society that we will measure the success or otherwise of a school based on how it features in a league table that only looks at universities, how will we make progress on apprenticeships culturally?  How will we make progress on further education pathways?  <\/p> <p>  It is an issue that comes up with guidance counsellors all the time.  I talk to guidance counsellors regularly.  Work needs to be done in terms of a joined-up national guidance counselling policy that transcends a number of Departments.  I am advocating for and working on that at present.  It is not that the league tables are published by the State but that is what is published in newspapers.  It is not a criticism of newspapers.  They will say they cannot get data for other things.  It is a legitimate issue to look at. <\/p> <p>  We have a new national apprenticeship office.  We are very much looking at getting into schools.  I am going in but it is much more important to get female role models into schools.  We did not talk enough today about the reverse that the Chair rightly brought up in terms of the professions where we are looking to get more men in, especially the caring professions.  Trying to bring role models in through the national apprenticeship office will be a new departure.

We are very grateful for your engagement with this committee.  As our guests will know, we are a special Oireachtas committee with a time-limited remit to review and make progress on the implementation of the 45 recommendations of the Citizen's Assembly on Gender Equality.  Those recommendations, essentially, form a blueprint for the achievement of a more equal society.  We have been conducting public hearings since March and we will be concluding in early December.  We have already looked at public hearings on the recommendations of the assembly relating to constitutional change and gender-based violence.  In this module, we are looking at the recommendations specifically on norms, stereotypes and education, which are recommendations 26 to 31.  We are very grateful to you for your engagement.<\/p> <p>  Before we begin, I will read an important notice on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee but if directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to particular matter, and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of the evidence.  They are directed that only evidence that is connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make them identifiable.<\/p> <p>  Participants at the committee from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating within parliamentary precincts do not extend and nor can clear guidance be given on whether or the extent to which the participation is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  Having given that warning, I invite each witness to make an opening statement and then we will open the discussion to members and colleagues, some of whom are participating from within the parliamentary precincts via MS Teams.  We have asked witnesses to limit their opening statements to five minutes and we will also apply a time limit of eight minutes to each individual engagement with the committee members but we can have a second round of questions if time permits before we draw the meeting to a close at 12.30 p.m.  I thank you all for being with us today.<\/p> <p>  I will first call Ms Adebowale to make her opening statement on behalf of the USI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#N00100","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651705200,"counter":717,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairperson and members of the joint committee for the opportunity to participate in this discussion.  I am the vice president for equality and citizenship at USI.  As many of the members will know, a key element of the USI&rsquo;s core mission is to ensure equal opportunities for all in the pursuit of a third level education.  To an extent, we welcome the recommendations of the citizens&rsquo; assembly regarding norms, stereotypes and education.<br\/><br\/>The 2014 Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, OHCHR, report on Gender Stereotypes and Stereotyping and Women&rsquo;s Rights states that stereotyping of a woman&rsquo;s role as being within the family leads to a division of labour within households that often results in poverty and lower levels of education for many women.  Recommendation 26 of the citizens&rsquo; assembly to promote gender equality highlights the need for subject choice in schools to counteract these stereotypes.  The emphasis must not be that a woman is the caretaker of the home but that it is every person&rsquo;s responsibility to maintain a home and family and care for those within it.  Career information and education must always be gender-neutral and never maintain its focus on what men and women should or should not do. <br\/><br\/>Recommendation 27 encourages school curricula review with a focus on gender power dynamics and gender-based violence.  This recommendation is important to the USI and is backed up by the 2020 USI &amp;amp; Active* Consent Sexual Experiences Survey carried out in higher education institutes, HEIs, in Ireland.  The survey results noted that 29% of females, 10% of males and 28% of non-binary students reported non-consensual penetration by incapacitation, force or threat of force.  These findings are, sadly, very much reflective of the wider society we live in today.<br\/><br\/>We welcome recommendation 28, which advises the need for staff professional development in gender awareness.  All gender awareness training must address the fact that there are many people who do not identify with gender binaries.  Research from LGBTI Ireland Report 2016 found that transgender, non-binary and intersex people face additional significant challenges in their day-to-day lives, including being referred to as the gender and use of the incorrect pronouns, which can have an immensely negative impact on a person&rsquo;s mental health.  It can be further assumed that these challenges are shared by those who do not identify with the gender identities of the aforementioned research. <br\/><br\/>The recommendation also focuses on the encouragement of women taking up roles that are male dominated and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  However, a question we should ask ourselves is why a profession or role is regarded as dominated by a particular gender in the first place.  In the past there was an emphasis on women occupying roles that were deemed typically unimportant.  Those roles that typically fell into the category were caring roles.  While roles that were deemed important and highly regarded were things like Government and political positions, which are usually occupied by men.  According to the UN Sustainable Development Goals Report, approximately 25% of those in parliamentary positions are women.  That means in the average parliament 75% are not women but are making decisions on behalf of women.  This is extremely stark.  We must begin to uproot patriarchal norms in the places we constantly ask women and non-binary people to occupy.  We must also make sure these spaces are safe environments for women and gender non-conforming people to thrive in. <br\/><br\/>Recommendation 31 is well received but we must make sure there is an intersectional approach to portraying all types of people within the media such as disabled people and people of colour.  There should never be a focus on the visibility of men to perform caring roles but an emphasis that caring roles are valued and important in society. <br\/><br\/>In all, the USI supports the vital work being done to address gender inequality.  These recommendations are a starting point for actions that can be taken to improve the lives of many.  Gender norms and stereotypes damage the way in which our society operates.  This is directly because of the value we have continually placed on specific genders roles and the lack of value on others. <br\/><br\/>I thank the committee for this opportunity to contribute.  I am happy to elaborate on any of the points I have made and I look forward to answering any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Bukky Adebowale"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":718,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Adebowale for that opening statement.

Our universities are deeply committed to equality, diversity and inclusion for all staff and students, and we see a part of our role as taking a leadership role in civil society.  The universities have contributed significantly to the establishment and workings of both the citizens&rsquo; assemblies, and the predecessor constitutional convention, as an important model for democratic deliberation on key societal challenges.  On that basis we are very pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this very important discussion with the committee.<\/p> <p>  By way of context, it should be noted the universities have statutory responsibilities both &ldquo;to promote gender balance and equality of opportunity among students and employees of the university&rdquo;, as per the Universities Act 1997, and &ldquo;to eliminate discrimination and promote equality of opportunity and treatment of its staff and persons to whom it provides services&rdquo; under the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014. <\/p> <p>  We share the view of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality that gender equality must be mainstreamed in all societal interactions, and addressing the many inequalities that exist by reference to gender requires ambitious, not just incremental, change.<\/p><p>Across our sector, addressing gender equality has been at the forefront of our agenda in recent years.  Major focal points have included the introduction of the Athena SWAN Charter, which is a gender equality self-assessment accreditation scheme introduced in 2015 and the HEA National Review of Gender Equality in Irish Higher Education Institutions of 2016, resulting in a concerted collective effort across the entire sector to accelerate the necessary change.  Engagement with Athena SWAN has been significant, with all universities holding institutional and multiple departmental awards.  In addition, a large number of people across the universities have become involved in gender equality work through Athena SWAN.  Bronze Athena SWAN accreditation signifies that an institution, department or school has carried out a rigorous and evidence-based self-assessment, has a good understanding of its challenges and has a credible gender equality action plan.<\/p><p> Gender equality action plans are in place across all universities as a standard management practice, thus supporting conversion of policy into practice, and are subject to internal monitoring and reporting.  Vice-presidents for equality, diversity and inclusion, EDI, roles, or their equivalent, have been established across the sector to lead this important work.  The Athena SWAN programme is increasingly addressing related challenges as well, such as gender identity and the intersectionality of gender with other protected groups, notably with respect to race.<\/p><p> Addressing gender inequality is complex and challenging.  The report of the citizens' assembly reflects some of these complexities, including bias and stereotyping, provision of care and the need for committed leadership.  The universities have an important role to play across many of the detailed recommendations and, through our programmes of work on gender equality at both institutional and school level, are well placed to contribute, for example: by working with primary and post-primary sectors to advance EDI on the curriculum and in teaching methods, through initial teacher education and curriculum reform; through emphasising role models in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, and engaging with primary and post-primary students about STEM learning and career opportunities to promote female participation in STEM; and through the development and implementation of consent education and bystander intervention training, modelled and evaluated in ways so that it can be adapted to needs of schools.<\/p><p> Some of the recommendations targeted at Government are ones that the universities have long supported, for example, extending the higher educational grants system more fully to part-time students but in the context of a properly resourced higher education system overall.<\/p><p> With respect to role models, measures in the universities to increase the number of women in senior academic and leadership roles have seen the proportion of women in the most senior professor grade increase from 19%, a rolling average figure from 2013 to 2015, to 27% by December 2020.  This is an increase of 42% or of eight percentage points.  However, further progress is needed to bring us to the minimum target of 40% women professors.  Government and the Higher Education Authority, HEA, have initiated the senior academic leadership initiative, which represents a significant investment.  This has been implemented through all stages successfully and has attracted very high-quality candidates and recruitment for posts approved under the second cycle of this scheme is currently under way.<\/p><p> It should be noted that before 2020 there had never been a female university president in Ireland.  We now have female presidents in three of eight IUA member universities.  The gender composition of the governing bodies, academic councils and executive management teams are increasingly aligned to the norm that there should be a minimum representation of 40% male and female members.  Some seven of the eight chairs of the governing authorities of our member universities are now held by women and all top management teams in our universities are gender-balanced.<\/p><p> To conclude, I once again thank the committee for the invitation to join the discussion today and confirm that in broad terms we are very supportive of the recommendations of the citizens' assembly.  While the higher education sector has made significant progress on gender equality, through self-assessment and the development and implementation of action plans and new leadership structures, there is much still to do to achieve and embed sustained cultural change.  Based on our experience of implementing gender equality plans and striving to achieve the systemic and cultural change needed to sustain progress in gender equality, we would emphasise that decisions and strategies will need to be evidence-based, tailored to key areas of need and appropriately resourced in order to achieve the required change.

This was catalysed by the opening of the UK-based Athena SWAN Charter and award process to Irish higher education, supported by funding from the Higher Education Authority.  From 2015, Irish HEIs began to apply for Athena SWAN awards.  At the time of writing, the majority of our members hold a bronze institutional award.  <\/p> <p>  Since 2016, our members have been implementing the recommendations of two major national reports on gender equality in higher education.  After the 2016 report, HEIs were required to implement gender action plans and report on these regularly to the HEA.  <\/p> <p>  The HEA also began to publish annual reports of gender-disaggregated staff data from Irish higher education institutions.  Following the 2018 report, all HEIs have adopted changes aimed at ensuring that &ldquo;the proportion of men and women to be recruited or promoted to a certain level is based on the proportion of each at the career level directly below&rdquo;.  The 2018 report also established a centre of excellence for gender equality within the HEA which is now the centre of excellence for equality, diversity and inclusion, and a women-only professorship scheme, the senior academic leadership initiative.  A further national equality review in higher education is currently taking place and we look forward to seeing the recommendations arising from that review.<\/p> <p>  In recent years, the focus has shifted from solely gender equality to a broader equality, diversity and inclusion, EDI, agenda, based on the nine grounds of discrimination outlined in our equality legislation.  The commitment of THEA&rsquo;s members to the broad EDI agenda was enshrined in the THEA gender and diversity statement which we published in 2018.  Gender equality plans in HEIs have been broadened to include other aspects of equality, diversity and inclusion, taking into account these EDI areas both separately and as they intersect with gender equality.<\/p> <p>  A major development related to gender-based violence has been the implementation of the framework for consent in higher education institutions.  In March 2021, THEA published the report, THEA's: Promoting Consent and Preventing Sexual Violence project.  The report made a series of recommendations, including a number of resources which should be established within HEIs to support the implementation of the framework.  Work is ongoing to put these resources in place, including through seeking a budget line through the Estimates process for the Minister, Deputy Harris.<\/p> <p>  Overall, much progress has been made in supporting gender equality and the broader EDI agenda in higher education over a relatively short time since 2015 or so.  Between September 2015 and December 2020, the percentage of female senior lecturers, the highest academic grade in the technological universities, TU, and institutes of technology, IOT, sector increased from 31% to 36%, while the percentage of female professional, managerial and support staff at the highest grades increased from 14% to 25%.  It is worth noting that the institutes of technology have a track record of appointing female presidents and it is very positive to see that three of the five technological universities are led by women.<\/p> <p>  Participation in Athena SWAN has been a strong driver of recent progress, as have the recommendations within the two national gender reports.  However, much remains to be done to accelerate progress, embed improvements and spread the lessons learned across the wider public service.<\/p> <p>  Turning specifically to recommendations 26 to 31 of the citizen&rsquo;s assembly report, we would like to make the following points.  With recommendation 27, higher education will need to put significant efforts into co-creating with our students an inclusive learning environment, celebrating diversity and ensuring that the curriculum and the teaching strategies are inclusive.  THEA's members are working on a project to embed gender equality and intersectionality into the curriculum, supported by the HEA&rsquo;s gender equality enhancement fund.  All THEA members are rolling out dedicated training on sexual violence and harassment to students and staff, and while this is positive, it is clear that age-appropriate training on consent should be offered as early as possible in the education system.<\/p> <p>  On recommendation 28, we are rolling out an online equality, diversity and inclusion in higher education training programme developed by our colleagues from the Irish Universities Association.  We have also started to revise our policies and procedures through the lens of gender equality and EDI.  On recommendation 29, we strongly agree that the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant system should be reformed to provide support for part-time students.  In the 2020-2021 academic year, 25% of students enrolled in our member organisations were part-time and more than half of those part-time students were female.  On recommendation 30, we acknowledge that more work to encourage men into female-dominated careers is required and the work to encourage women into male-dominated careers should be complemented by reforming the curriculum from primary school level onwards to address underlying factors that discourage women from being interested in STEM.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for its time and look forward to the discussion today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jennifer Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":723,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Brennan.

It is really important we hear from people working in the field when we come to look at this.  I was very disobedient in terms of time with my previous round of questions so I will condense these questions slightly if I can.<\/p> <p>  I will focus first on something Dr. Brennan mentioned.  She said 52.5% of part-time students are female.  That is a considerable number.  I will just touch on an issue I have raised with the Minister here before.  Accessing third level is the first step, but retaining people in third level is the next step, and then there is progression to a career.  From the witnesses' perspective, how important are financial supports for part-time learners, particularly women?  Is that highlighted to the witnesses as a barrier to their staying in a learning environment?  Often we find there are very specific barriers to getting there.  Once people get there, however, there is a whole other range of barriers that pop up in front of them.<\/p> <p>  I will ask a general question.  The consent framework is grouped thematically.  Mr. McMahon touched on this and the need for the framework to be evidence-based.  I absolutely agree with him.  I could not agree with him more.  What barometers does he believe need to be implemented to deliver the change we need to see?  We heard from the Minister about action plans, hubs, resources and committees, which absolutely have a role to play, but if we are not gauging the data being provided, how do we map a pathway to where we want to go?  What barometers does Mr. McMahon see as being important in that regard?<\/p> <p>  For staff in higher education, is there diversity and gender training as part of professional development?  If not, why?  That was recommended by the citizens.  Their focus was clearly on it.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' perspective on that.<\/p> <p>  As for lecturers and other staff who teach and educate, have the witnesses seen any progress made in recent years that needs to be focused on more, particularly where there is a gender imbalance?  I am speaking not only about women working in heavily male-dominated areas but also about men working in female-dominated areas.  The reason I ask that is that I absolutely agree with what Ms Adebowale said earlier: career information and education must be gender-neutral.  What impact has the fact that it has not been gender-neutral to date had on those on whom we now rely to provide education at third level?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#P00200","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":726,"content":"<p>I will go first to Dr. Brennan, if that is okay, and then to the IUA for responses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#P00300","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651705200,"counter":727,"content":"<p>The Government yesterday published the review of the SUSI grant system, which I had a quick look at this morning on the train in.

We also see that a significant number of students work up to 20 hours a week, sometimes more, in addition to the grant they get and trying to do their college work, so there is definitely a financial barrier in that area.

First, rewinding to the work on sexual violence and harassment, as a HR director, if I looked at the number of complaints and there were very few, I could assume we do not have a problem, but we know from our surveys that there is a problem.  We need to look at where we will get information on the type of culture in our organisations that tells us where there is a problem and where there is not.  The Minister may have mentioned the matter this morning, but that is why investment has been put into a report and support tool called Speak Out.  In the past, the only gateway to raising concerns or complaints was through formal complaints processes, which we know are adversarial, and we know that incidences are under-reported.  We now have a report and support tool that will give us information on the types of issues arising in our organisations.  As for a barometer on that, because this is new, it is difficult to say what kind of number represents progress or otherwise, but at least we will get a benchmark.  That is being piloted.  It was introduced only in September or October across our institutions.  That will give us an insight into the types of issues arising.<\/p> <p>  The second type of metrics we might look at is in the area of training.  Dr. Brennan's submission mentions this.  We put in an application through the HEA for funding to support the work on consent.  The IUA's estimate was that to fully embed this work would involve an investment of between &euro;350,000 and &euro;400,000 per annum.  That is a lot in terms of people to work on training, counselling services, investigations across the whole remit from report, support and prevent to dealing with issues when they arise in terms of counselling and the actual investigative process to deal with issues.  There is a huge range of issues there.  Training is significant and will be one of the issues.<\/p> <p>  The third barometer will be the culture surveys and the types of data we have taken already through the national surveys, repeating those to see what the picture is and to see what sort of improvements we will make.  It is very firmly on our agenda.  We have a very specific framework.  Every institution has an implementation plan to deliver the framework.  That is where we are at today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#P00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony McMahon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651705200,"counter":733,"content":"<p>If I may come in on the third and fourth questions about professional development and training first, EDI training has been developed across the universities sector as part of professional development.  There are a number of different focal points: first, unconscious bias training as a key part of processes for recruitment for both academic and professional administrative staff; and, second, more generalised online EDI and race training have been developed across the IUA's sector and implemented over the past 12 months.  Is it mandatory for every member of staff?  Not yet, but it is available and there is very strong take-up of that training.<\/p> <p>  In response to the final question the Deputy asked about whether we see any progress with respect to the understanding within the sector of the progress of women into what were traditionally regarded as male areas and men into professions dominated by women, in the gender equality action plans developed by our schools and departments as part of Athena SWAN, we see a very strong commitment both to understanding the data and understanding where the challenges lie and to addressing them through a wide range of measures.  We have a lot of outreach measures and other measures to understand this and to bring more female students into engagement with STEM.  Science Foundation Ireland has funded a number of programmes of research, engagement and outreach across the universities over recent years, so most of the universities are strongly engaged with that work.  We have also seen targets set to increase the number of women in educational programmes where they have been under-represented.  For example, computer science and engineering would be central to that.  With respect to bringing men into professions dominated by women, again, the gender equality action plans show a very strong understanding of the data and the measures to be taken to role-model men in, for example, the caring professions and to bring larger numbers of men into those professions.  Both of those are important factors in reshaping the culture of our society towards greater gender equality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#P01000","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Scott"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":734,"content":"<p>That reshaping of the culture will not happen overnight.

We need to take this back to primary school level as well.  We touched on that in our more comprehensive written submission in March.  Certain things happen in primary school that discourage women in particular from looking at STEM areas.  For example, there is a well-known disparity that can occur in children around spatial ability and ability to see things in space, which can be corrected quite easily.  There are some nice educational programmes developed by researchers from within our own higher education sector on this.  We should probably see those kinds of things happening in primary school and correct them before they become a problem.<\/p> <p>  Professor Scott is quite correct that at secondary school level there is an issue with access to certain subjects that would put people on a particular career path.  I also think we could do a little bit more ourselves in the higher education system around outreach towards men in the kind of careers they do not tend to go for, such as in the caring professions.  We have a lot of support from people like those in the Discover Programme in Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, to get women into STEM but we do not necessarily see the same kind of support.  I do not know where that would come from to target and have activities that would be designed to encourage men to look at other or more female-dominated professions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#Q00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jennifer Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":742,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Brennan.

Something that is really important is having that gender neutrality and looking outside the scope of the current binaries we have when it comes to gender, especially when we are looking at trying to place emphasis on putting females into more male-dominated areas and males into more female-dominated areas.  We look at the piece on caring roles and how that is not necessarily occupied by a lot of men.  The issue is not necessarily that men do not occupy those spaces but that the value and importance of those types of roles are not stressed enough.  We touched on those points in terms of supporting, for example, part-time students in their education through funding with the SUSI grant and other supports.  The emphasis on those roles is not as strong as it needs to be.  Many part-time students are coming along who are in caring positions, who are at home taking care of others and having responsibility for others, which ultimately means that they need more flexibility and the part-time funding to support their studies should they wish to continue with education.  There needs to be more of an emphasis on roles like that being deemed important in society.

It is lovely to see everybody moving in the same direction and all having a commitment to the recommendations without objection.<\/p> <p>  I think I already know the answer to my questions.  The funding element is an enormous barrier, in particular for women whose children have gone to school, to allow them to access what we generically call lifelong learning.  That is before we even get to the stereotypical courses women attend compared with those attended by men.  We must address that or at least acknowledge that it is an enormous barrier.  We all acknowledge that the investment involved is significant.  As a former Minister for Social Protection, I know the contradictions between the SUSI grant and social welfare payments that exist.  However, we must acknowledge that at least if we had a roadmap for the next ten to 15 years to address it, we would all know that at least we accept it is real and that we are willing to change it.  I want to put that on record.<\/p> <p>  We focus a lot on the fact that subject choices are based on the gendered nature of schools.  While that is true, it is missing the obvious elephant in the room.  My kids have always gone to a mixed school where they have access to woodwork, mechanical drawing and metalwork.  I mean no disrespect to Deputy McAuliffe, but the problem is that the culture or environment that exists in those classes that are male-dominated is not one where young women want to be, enjoy or are comfortable in.  It is not the case that they do not have access to mechanical drawing, metalwork or woodwork, it is just not a nice environment for young ladies to be in, so therefore they do not stay in it.  My daughter does woodwork and her best friend is the best student in mechanical drawing.  Her friend is the only girl in her class, and she is leaving it after junior certificate because it is not a nice environment.  We need to stretch this argument to make sure that we recognise that culture is equally as important as making subjects available.  There is no point in ticking a box and saying a young one can do any subject she wants if the environment is not comfortable and nurturing for her to be in.<\/p> <p>  I want to touch on the Speak Out campaign and congratulate the colleges in that regard.  We have a real culture problem with reporting in this country, for all of the reasons that the journey from being assaulted to getting justice is not a safe place or welcoming environment.  It is a very victimising environment.  The non-evidence base of the Speak Out project is fundamental to empowering women to be able to say they cannot specifically prove that something happened - because we know how difficult the bar is - but this is the culture that exists and it allows organisations and us as a society to say that we are not surprised that 340 women reported rape in 2020 or 2021 but let us be really surprised that probably 3,400 women were raped that year and 90% of them did not report it.  Let us acknowledge through programmes like Speak Out that we are going to make a change in the culture, shake up society and wake people up to say this issue is far more prevalent and serious than we believe.<\/p> <p>  One of the witnesses spoke this morning about the prevalence of people reporting.  That is not the issue; that is the red herring.  What we need to do is create a culture where women and men feel empowered to be able to talk more freely, report and to make the environment safe and not victimising.  I congratulate those involved on starting the initiative.  I hope it filters out into the wider world of work, education and society.  I say well done to those involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#Q01000","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651705200,"counter":746,"content":"<p>I am very grateful to the Senator for those comments that are supportive of the work we have been doing in the sector.

It is right that there needs to be a move from a victimising culture for complainants to a supportive culture.  Having the data around incidents through reporting systems is part of that, but there is a huge architecture to be put in place in particular around trauma-informed support for disclosures, separated from complaints mechanisms.<\/p> <p>  In UCD, we have a new dignity and respect support service with three staff who are trained to receive disclosures on breach of dignity and respect rules around not only sexual harassment and sexual violence but also bullying and harassment.

That is something we have seen that has emerged with Covid-19 and has made third-level education much more accessible for people who have caring responsibilities.  That is to be welcomed.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the societal issues around why women are not coming into the more male-dominated professions, we have seen this time and time again.  This has come through our Athena SWAN evidence and action plans.  We asked female students in male-dominated areas why they are so few.  What they say is that they do not want to be the only girl in the class.  That is exactly linked to issues around culture and how they are treated sometimes by their colleagues in their class.  Again, that is tied into the consent framework.  It is tied into education around gender stereotypes, dignity and respect and how we treat people.<\/p> <p>  The Speak Out data will be hugely beneficial for our sector.  We are only into it since we launched it in October across the sector.  What we are going to see from that will allow us to tailor our approach to education to our students and to the development of policies in this area.  That will be hugely beneficial.  When we were launching Speak Out, I remember reading a piece of research that talked about the culture of reporting and when women would feel they could come forward and report or make a complaint.  There was evidence that linked the willingness of women to come forward to the numbers of women on senior management teams and the visibility of women within the university.  That is really important.  It brings us right back to the Higher Education Authority's, HEA, recommendations and to Athena SWAN and the importance of having gender balance.  It encourages and supports women across all levels of the university, and our students, to come forward when there are cultural issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Allison Kenneally"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":750,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Kenneally very much.

They made some really interesting contributions.  Some good strong conversations are happening in universities pressed from the higher level in terms of things like Athena SWAN and, of course, the really important crucial point of funding being linked to Athena SWAN, but also pushed from individuals within individual departments, including staff members but also students and student movements, who have really pressed for change in this area.  I want to acknowledge that.<\/p> <p>  I would appreciate a bit more follow-up on a few areas, one of which is that issue of situations of abuse.  Again, I was glad to hear, for example, that in University College Dublin, UCD, there are now designated staff in terms of dignity and support staff to whom people can go.  The witnesses will be aware that my colleague, Senator Ruane, brought forward legislation around non-disclosure agreements and their usage.  One thing I am looking to is that as well as learning, we need to have better reporting mechanisms in order that students and staff have people to whom they can report, as Senator Doherty said, not just with individual complaints but in terms of concerns around raising flags.<\/p> <p>  I would like to know a bit more about how universities feel they are doing better at identifying those patterns.  What are the mechanisms not simply for providing support, redress or justice for individuals but for identifying patterns?  Of course, things like non-disclosure agreements in the past were the exact opposite of that where different people would have experiences.  Each person would have to experience that individually and would not even know this had been an issue that may have arisen before.  How do we get better at identifying patterns?<\/p> <p>  Building on that, we had much discussion around recommendation 28(a) and the idea of promoting gender awareness and gender-sensitive teaching methods.  Part B is around school evaluation through the lens of gender equality.  This is what I am trying to get to.  Again, it is not just the issue of whether there are there are more women in each different area or whether there is more diversity in terms of who is entering areas.  It is about the system changes that are arising as part of that.  It is not simply that we are hitting 30% or 40% of people going in but about some of the issues highlighted by Senator Doherty such as retention and changes in work practices to reflect, encourage and maintain diversity or participation.  The fact is that when we have people involved, we have different needs that evolve and different changes are required.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses might comment on one of the points I was interested in from the Irish Universities Association's presentation around THEA in terms of curriculum reform.  In NUI Galway, for example, conversations are beginning to happen around the decolonisation of the culture.  Similarly, in terms of a real examination of curriculums and those ideas of norms and stereotypes, sometimes, norms and stereotypes have a racial layer or relate to people who are non-binary or intersex.  There can be layers to the gender stereotypes that come through.  I am wondering about curriculum reform, system reform, the retention of people who are entering areas, specifically, and that issue of key performance indicators, KPI, generally.<\/p> <p>  Lastly, and this comes back to recommendation 28(b), when we talk about it, policies and practices, including evaluations, are viewed through the lens of gender equality as well.  In the key performance indicators, to what extent are equality policies really being reflected?  Then, crucially, something really struck me with regard to the criteria and weighting around promotion.  I was speaking to a female academic who had gone for promotion and done extraordinary work but used the word \"We\".  She said things like, \"We did this\" and \"I worked with people together\".  She was informed or advised that she needed to use the word \"I\".  Again, that is an example of whether collaborative work gets valued or gets a weighting.<\/p> <p>  On this point again, Ms Adebowale mentioned what gets valued in terms of work.  She made a really good point whereby we know with Athena SWAN that certain well-resourced departments are progressing faster and further whereas even areas within academic institutions that seem to have fewer resources, which also often happen to have more women participating in areas such as the arts and humanities, are often hitting barriers in terms of progressing in Athena SWAN despite having a large number of women students and early-level staff members.  Is that around resources to achieve the Athena SWAN goals in terms of secure contracts?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#R00700","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":754,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Higgins.

I will then ask Dr. Kenneally to talk about the curriculum review that we mentioned in our opening statement.  We have clearly seen initial progress in Athena SWAN in the STEM areas.  However, that is mainly because when Athena SWAN was launched, it was entirely focused on STEM and on academic career structures.  It has only recently been expanded in Ireland into arts, humanities and social sciences, AHSS, areas and into looking into our professional, managerial and support staff.  There is a lag there, but we will see that catching up as the more expanded broader charter becomes more embedded in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  We mentioned in our opening statement that we were putting a gender lens on our policies and procedures.  I want to give the committee a sense of three actions that have been taken within one of our members as a result of that.  In one case, for example, in recruitment, all of the shortlisting now has to be done by at least one female and one male.  All interview panels must have a minimum of 40% female members.  They have also reviewed all of their marketing materials and prospectuses to ensure that they are inclusive.  They have removed a previous requirement that you had to have one year of service before you could avail of parental leave.  This had been identified by new employees through their Athena SWAN surveys as a barrier to work-life balance.  That is just a flavour.  <\/p> <p>  On the KPIs, we are required to have our gender equality action plans.  These are reported on every year to the HEA.  They keep a close eye on us to ensure that we are implementing and doing what we said we were going to do.  Within the system performance framework, which governs our institutions as well, there are targets around gender equality.

We have a sectoral project under way at the moment.  We have to look to other jurisdictions.  This is important because there is much good practice out there.  In other countries, notably in the UK, some universities have made excellent progress on this.  We are working with partners in the UK on this to try to develop a charter for the sector, in order that universities in our sector can sign up to that.  It is possible that there will be a cross-sectoral aspect down the line.  This will demonstrate our commitment to embedding gender equality through our teaching.  That will necessitate all academics reviewing their own curricula.  This will include looking at their teaching methods, at their reading lists, at who they fight during classes, at the types of examples they give and at the type of stereotyping that might be present in examination questions.  This work therefore includes many aspects.  There is amazing work out there.  We can learn much from other jurisdictions on that.  It is important that we scale up work in that area of the sector.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#S00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Allison Kenneally"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651705200,"counter":763,"content":"<p>If I may, I will comment on the first two questions.  The Senator asked how we identify patterns in respect of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct, for example, within institutions.  Part of that is the reporting support tools which we have mentioned already, such as ShoutOut, which is across the sector.  That provides significant data in identifying patterns and challenges.<\/p> <p>  The second dimension and innovation is the introduction of environmental investigations.  We have known for a significant period that there may be issues in a particular part of an institution that are not resulting in people being willing to come forward with complaints.  The trend is towards introducing a power to have an environmental investigation of a particular area of a university, with respect to, for example, sexual harassment and sexual misconduct.  This would enable a review to be undertaken and engagement with staff and students in a particular area to learn more about where the cultural challenge is, where the behavioural challenges may be, what their character is and what kind of solutions might be adopted to address those challenges.  It is an alternative; it is a supplement to a complaints-based approach.  The HEA&rsquo;s equality, diversity and inclusion, EDI, centre of excellence has recently funded some new work around setting up these environmental assessments.  That will supplement a complaints-based approach to understanding and addressing patterns of sexual harassment, sexual misconduct and sexual violence.  <\/p> <p>  On the questions about more diverse classrooms, the sector is very strongly committed to continuing to diversify who comes to learn in higher education.  That has strong implications for who is teaching and how they are teaching within the classroom.  As Dr. Kenneally has already mentioned, there is a strong commitment in all parts of the sector towards enhancing the support we provide through teaching and learning units and through access-widening participation units to both understand and address the challenges.  One approach is implementation of the universal design for learning as a key ethos for the way that we teach and support learning in higher education.  To link that to data, it is to have the data on retention and progression that enable us to identify and highlight the success that different types of students have in progressing to higher education and to pick up where there may be challenges that need to be addressed through further developments and support for the teaching and learning modes that are offered within the classrooms.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#S00900","nonspeaker":"Professor Colin Scott"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":764,"content":"<p>That is good to hear about the environmental assessment method, rather than the individual complaints-based approach to harassment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#S01000","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":765,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair and I welcome all of our guests.  I wanted to use the session primarily to get a better understanding from the witnesses, including the USI, about the consent framework.  As it has been ten years since I graduated from Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, there is probably a different picture now in terms of how consent is addressed.  From what I hear, it is doing a reasonably good job.  Is there a mechanism for the success of implementation and outcomes to be measured?  Barring a reduction in assaults, is there any way that we can measure the success of the consent framework?  I do not think that the reduction in the number of assaults is a helpful or an appropriate barometer.<\/p> <p>  Ms Adebowale will probably touch on the sexual experiences survey from the USI in 2020, which 6,000 students completed.  For student unions that are involved in designing the action plans, does the messaging include sexual minorities, trans folk and non-binary folk?  Is there recognition in the action plans about sexual harassment, assault and violence in the context of drugs and alcohol use?  My next question is geared towards our other guests in the room.  Is there a sharing of best practices across the universities and the higher education institutions?  Ms Adebowale might respond on whether the USI is satisfied with where the consent framework is at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#S01100","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651705200,"counter":766,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for that contribution.

At the moment I do not have statistics on the impact of the work that is being done on the measures to what happens after sexual violence or assault has occurred on campus.<\/p><p>A key element that has been important from the perspective of the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, is one of the recommendations on implementing prevention and support programming, which looks more at the preventative measures rather than what happens afterwards.  That is a key element to measure.  Many institutions and unions would be in partnership on the consent framework.  For example, the students union of the National University Ireland, Galway, NUIG, is a named students union that would often work closely with its institution in presenting the consent framework on its campus.  I cannot speak for every students union because I not on the ground while they are doing work.  That is something they have been doing but the work is slow and in progress.  It is definitely something we are proud of up to now and we will continue to work on it in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#S01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Bukky Adebowale","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":768,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Adebowale for that.

The actions in the implementation plans for our consent framework were grouped under various themes.  Many of those in terms of training and policy are probably lead indicators that will result in the implementing of actions that we believe will lead to better outcomes.  We monitor all that and report it to the Higher Education Authority.  We have worked closely with the USI.  Last year we had a very successful campaign called UnmuteConsent.  It was a play on the words &quot;you are on mute&quot;, a Covid type of language.  That was a really successful social media campaign primarily.  We would love to run that again this year.  That was an effective way of collaborating with students to get key messages out to the whole student body on appropriate standards of behaviour and how they engage.<br\/><br\/>&quot;Yes&quot; is the answer to the question around looking at issues.  We have a bit of work to do on the data on this in terms of the nature of the complaints <i>vis-&agrave;-vis <\/i>particular groups, not only with respect to all students, female students or male students but on the whole aspect of it. <br\/><br\/>That brings me to the question the Senator asked about sharing.  The Speak Out tool, which is currently being piloted, has been in place for just over six months.  A collective group of representatives from all the institutions have implemented Speak Out.  That group collectively will look at the data and try to understand the patterns.  We will examine first if the tool is doing what it was intended to do, which is to gather information and be a basis to allow people to report.  That work is happening collaboratively and it is ongoing.  The final point I would make on sharing is that it is not only a collaboration of student bodies but every university has also collaborated with NGOs in its area, for example, the local rape crisis network support centres.  Much of our expertise was drawn from those NGOs and also the way we monitor and progress our implementation work.  We work with those bodies as well to quality assure ourselves of the work we do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony McMahon"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":770,"content":"<p>That is also an important point.

As part of that we had a steering committee of people from all across higher education, we had a representative from the USI, Clare Austick, who is now its president, and a representative from the National Women's Council of Ireland.  Therefore, it was quite inclusive.<\/p> <p>  In terms of sharing, this is a very collaborative space.  We work very closely with our colleagues in the IUA  on this.  In addition to the Speak Out working group, there is a Higher Education Authority, HEA-led, led advisory group on ending sexual violence and harassment, on which we are all represented.  It is very much a collaborative effort.  We are all keen to share our best practice in working with each other to improve our understanding.  It is a new area for us.  We are trying to understand what works and does not work and making sure we share those lessons across the whole higher education sector.  Although there has been a very strong focus on this consent framework within higher education, it is clear this is a wider societal issue.  It is not just about what happens within higher education.  Education and consent must happen at the very earliest stage in a child&rsquo;s development and we should not wait until a young person reaches the age of 18, goes to college and suddenly learns about this thing called consent.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#T00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Jennifer Brennan"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":772,"content":"<p>We are hearing that from everyone involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#T00600","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":773,"content":"<p>We had a conversation earlier about commitments delivered at second level.

I am conscious we have been in session since 9 a.m. and we do not want to take up too much more of their time.  I thank them very much for their engagement.  They will have noted from the range of questions asked and the comments from colleagues on the committee how strongly focused we are on ensuring implementation of these recommendations from the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly.  They cover quite a wide range even on this section on gender, stereotypes and education.  They have assisted us greatly in providing us with such insights into what is happening across higher education.  As we spoke about outside earlier, I am conscious initiatives at third level to enhance greater equality for women have had a better impact than in the Oireachtas where we still see a serious gender imbalance.  Ms Adebowale mentioned that figure at the start and, as I said, only 23% of our TDs are women.  A report I did in 2009 for the justice committee identified five Cs, the barriers to women&rsquo;s progression in politics, namely, lack of cash, lack of confidence, an old boys' culture, lack of childcare and candidate selection procedures.  Those first four are common across different sectors and certainly in third level.  We have tried to tackle the candidate selection procedures through gender quota legislation, which has had some positive impact.  However, I am conscious at third level, where I also know the situation well, real progresses have been made on tackling those other four Cs.  Certainly, my own work with Athena SWAN in the law school in Trinity was a real eye-opener as to the sorts of ways in which an unconscious bias persists even where we  think we have a fairly progressive workplace.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask about a few issues that came up from my work with Athena SWAN and that arose also out of the Micheline Sheehy Skeffington case, which were highlighted with Mary Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s initiative on the women-only professorships, as they are known, the senior academic leadership initiative, SALI.  These issues around lack of supports for women in academia come to the fore at a crucial point in careers, the mid-way point in women's 30s when they are much more likely than men to take time to go on maternity leave or parental leave to carry out essential childbearing and child-rearing and then they see careers impacted as a result, particularly because of a lack of capacity to carry out the necessary research, which Senator Higgins touched on, vital in order to get promotions.  Some of what myself and Athena SWAN heard were issues around a lack of supports for returners, those returning to work after maternity or parental leave.  I would love to hear our guests' comments on that and on what initiatives specifically can be taken to support very much gendered initiatives to assist women returning from maternity or parental leave or a career break.  What supports can be offered in the universities and in the technological universities and how can we lead on this?  This arose as such a crucial issue, along with all the others around curriculum and culture that we spoke about.  I would love to hear a little more on that before we close.  I might hear first from Dr. Kenneally, Dr. Brennan and Professor Scott.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022050500002#T00800","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651705200,"counter":775,"content":"<p>It is a key point when we ask women and we note all the evidence we have seen from Athena SWAN in our sector.  When we ask people why they do not go forward for promotion they say that they think the workload would be incompatible with their caring responsibilities.  It is a big problem.  Also, what we value in terms of promotions is research, which was touched on earlier.  Research is not something within our sector that is contracted for; it is mainly focused on teaching.  The people who will be able to engage in research will be those without additional responsibilities outside the home.  It is a big problem.  We must consider what is valued.  Some  good initiatives are starting to come from the sector in terms of looking at different types of promotional avenues.   Certainly research is valued but it is important that teaching, engagement and other activities are valued equally.  Many in the sector are implementing return to work policies.  For people who have been on maternity leave, parental leave, carer&rsquo;s leave or sick leave, their return to work should be staggered and they should have additional support from their manager.  In the university sector there has been protected time.  We speak of this in order that people might be given time to engage in research.  We have slightly different limitations and boundary conditions in our sector that make that a little bit more difficult to put into policy but the willingness is there.  It is a two-pronged approach.<\/p><p>It is about getting people to apply for the posts in the first instance.  As we know, a lot of women do not apply.  We need to know why that is the case.

The question about supporting people who return not only from maternity but other forms of leave is very important.  Across the sector, key examples include providing a 50% reduction in teaching load in the first year of return, to be negotiated with what would fit with the needs of the person returning.  For example, it could leave a half year of no teaching on return in order that the person can build research back-up.  Another element of support is grant support to rebuild research activities.  One of the things we are concerned about in the sector is how to mirror the supports provided to academic staff to our professional and administrative staff as well.  We recognise that the challenge of return from leave of various types is not limited to academics.

Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts of Leinster House will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any member participating via MS Teams to confirm, prior to making his or her contribution, that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.

My interest in the area of assisted human reproduction dates back the 1990s.  It was not for at least another ten years before it began to form part of my work as a solicitor.  Over the years I have worked with individuals and couples dealing with fertility issues, including surrogacy.  I realised at a very early stage that not only is this area complex from a medical perspective, but that it is also extremely complex from a legal perspective.  It is constantly evolving and developing.<br\/><br\/>I have been asked to address the committee on the particular issues faced by same-sex couples, both male and female, entering international surrogacy arrangements and achieving parental recognition in Ireland.  As a preliminary, I believe it might be useful to address how parental recognition is currently obtained for parents who have had a child through surrogacy.<br\/><br\/>The first point to note is that irrespective of where the child is born, whether in Ireland or abroad, the child&rsquo;s position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>his or her parents is exactly the same under Irish law.  That said, there is an advantage to be had in going abroad, as in most countries where surrogacy is possible the intending parents are named on the birth certificate at birth or pursuant to a post-birth court order.  In Ireland, however, the surrogate mother is named on the birth certificate, and this cannot be changed.<br\/><br\/>The position of same sex male parents through surrogacy is not very dissimilar to that of opposite sex parents, apart from the fact that some countries will not provide surrogacy services to a same-sex male couple.  Under Irish law they are treated the same.  Only the genetic male parent can have <br\/><br\/>his relationship with the child recognised under Irish law.  The non-genetic male, or second parent, is in exactly the same position as the female in an opposite sex relationship: in all cases the birth mother is the parent of the child.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the court process, the first step is for an application to the court to have the genetic male parent declared to be a parent.  If this order is granted, then the court is asked to appoint that parent as a guardian of the child.  Additional or ancillary orders are also sought to include an application that a passport can issue for the child without the consent of the child&rsquo;s birth mother.<\/p><p>It is only after those orders are granted that an application for an Irish passport can be made.<\/p><p> The process to establish parentage is exactly the same for a single male parent through surrogacy.  While I understand that it would be more unusual for a female couple to require to undergo surrogacy, such possibility does require consideration.  Currently it is not possible for a same-sex female couple or a single female undergoing surrogacy to establish a legal relationship under Irish law with that child.  This is the position irrespective of whether or not she is genetically related to the child.  Happily, the assisted human reproduction Bill seeks to rectify this position for domestic surrogacy arrangements.<\/p><p> The assisted human reproduction Bill proposes to legislate only for domestic surrogacy where all parties are habitually resident in this jurisdiction.  The committee should bear in mind that there are many Irish citizens in same-sex relationships living abroad who have had or will have children through surrogacy or through donor conception where they live.  Even if the entire procedure is carried out in accordance with the law of that place it may not be possible for the non-genetic parents to have their parent-child relationship recognised under Irish law.  This can have the knock-on effect of denying Irish citizenship to these children.  Last week, a representative from the Department of Justice referenced to the committee a case that has been leapfrogged to the Supreme Court in which this very issue is before the court for determination.<\/p><p> It is most unfortunate that the Bill as drafted contains no provision for the retrospective establishment of parentage in the case of a child born through a pre-commencement surrogacy arrangement.  The committee has been addressed by many parents through surrogacy, both male and female, who have no recognised legal relationship with their child born through surrogacy.  The Children and Family Relationships Act contains a template for obtaining a retrospective declaration of parentage in the case of a donor-conceived child.  A not dissimilar process could be established for surrogacy cases.<\/p><p> It is worth giving some thought to the importance of a genetic link in a surrogacy arrangement.  Currently an opposite-sex married couple can go abroad for IVF treatment using donor gametes.  A child conceived through such procedure and born here is the child of that couple, even though there is no genetic link.  The Children and Family Relationships Act contains provision for the establishment of parentage in the case of a child born as a result of embryo donation.  The assisted human reproduction Bill contains provision for the donation of embryos.  In addition, adoption is a long-established and recognised method of obtaining parentage of a child where there is no genetic link.<\/p><p> Having been involved in this area for so long and watching various reports gather dust, I have wondered if I would ever see assisted human reproduction legislation in this country.  I have watched the committee and I admire the enthusiasm with which all members have engaged.  I wish them the best of luck in the preparation and finalisation of their report.  It is not an enviable task.  Medical science has enabled people who might never have been able to have children to become parents.  Assisted human reproduction and surrogacy are here.  The law must now catch up.  I would be delighted to address any questions committee members might have today.  In addition, I am happy to be at the disposal of the committee should it require any further input or assistance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651705200,"counter":793,"content":"<p>Good morning, Chairperson and committee members.  My name is Claire O&rsquo;Connell and I appear today on behalf of LGBT Ireland as a board member and as someone who has researched this area extensively for my PhD.  I am very grateful for the invitation to return to the committee to discuss specifically the issues faced by same-sex couples entering international surrogacy arrangements and achieving parental recognition.  In order to avoid repetition I refer to the opening statement I made to the committee a number of weeks ago and ask members to consider the recommendations contained therein as well as the recommendations set out in our briefing paper \"Pathway to Parenting\".<\/p> <p>  The starting point to this discussion is to set the scene of how Irish parentage law has progressed over many decades.  We have had a number of landmark pieces of legislation that deal with parentage, guardianship and associated rights and responsibilities in respect of children.  These include the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, the Status of Children Act 1987, the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 and, most recently, the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, which was bolstered by the Irish vote in favour of marriage equality.<\/p> <p>  Each of these pieces of legislation progressed the rights of children and their care-giving parents by being more inclusive than the preceding system.  With each Act, we offered more and more protections, not fewer.  We are a progressive country in terms of legislating for the rights and freedoms of children and individuals and we are now once more at the precipice of another major change in Irish family law.  We are giving ourselves the opportunity to be even more inclusive through creating a legislative framework for assisted human reproduction, specifically surrogacy.  It is imperative that we avail of the opportunity to ensure the 2022 Bill includes a framework for the granting of parental orders in both the international and retrospective contexts.<\/p> <p>  Since 1964, the mother in Irish law has been the primary rights holder outside of marriage.  The addition of marriage offered special protection, even to non-genetic fathers, as a result of the presumption of paternity.  However, it was primarily and ultimately the biological link that bestowed the status of parent on caregivers in respect of their children.  These principles operated until the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 which, for the first time in Irish law, bestowed parentage knowingly on a non-genetically linked parent.  This Act applied to all persons engaging in donor-assisted human reproduction.  However, it was especially useful to those who could not benefit from the presumption of paternity.  This meant primarily same-sex female partners.  Either retrospectively or prospectively such partners would have to comply with a specific list of criteria which is, arguably, quite restrictive in nature in order to access parentage.  However, while female couples grappled with a restrictive system, male couples remained without any pathway to parentage in assisted human reproduction.<\/p> <p>  The 2015 Act also did nothing to remedy the presumption of paternity, which continues to apply in the area of assisted human reproduction despite the gestational or genetic parent being in a loving and committed relationship with the other intending parent.  To be clear, where the presumptions of paternity continue to apply the exclusions under the 2015 Act, which were set out in detail in my previous statement, disproportionately impact on same sex couples.  This is because birth registration in Ireland, which in itself results in a presumption of paternity, is not based on DNA tests but rather on the consent of the mother and her marital connection to the presumed father.  Yet there is no mechanism for a mother to consent to have her female spouse and intending parent registered as the child's second parent under the 2015 Act.  Therefore, the work of the Oireachtas would usefully include amendments to the 2015 Act to allow the inclusion of non-clinical donor assisted human reproduction, retrospective declarations of parentage where a known donor was used, and donor assisted human reproduction where the child is conceived or born in another jurisdiction.  This would be to ensure that no child is treated differently based on the sexual orientation of their parents and the method of their conception.<\/p> <p>  When considering a framework for surrogacy domestically and internationally, it is important to consider the groups who will be excluded in its absence.  The committee has heard the stories of individuals who have experienced heart-breaking infertility, experienced multiple miscarriages, had to suffer through unthinkable illnesses, have been aged out of adoption or have been excluded from adoption due to their disability.  This is the first group to be excluded.  The second group is the LGBTQI+ community, particularly gay men in the context of surrogacy.  They are individuals who, like every other person in this country, benefit from a constitutionally-recognised right to procreate under Article 40.  They also benefit from Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to respect for private and family life, and Article 14, which protects individuals from discrimination.  These rights are not absolute.  However, their existence requires that any interference or restriction be justified by the State in serving a legitimate aim in a proportional manner.  Such aims have been suggested as the vindication of the child's right to identity and the prevention of exploitation of women.  I respectfully suggest that both of these concerns can be comprehensively dealt with in legislation.  I have made specific proposals, on a section-by-section basis, setting out exactly how this can be done.  I am grateful to LGBT Ireland for having endorsed these proposals.<\/p> <p>  These proposals set out a process for vindicating the child's right to identity both retrospectively and prospectively.  The 2015 Act and the current proposals in the 2022 Bill do not include any protection for the child&rsquo;s right to identity born through assisted human reproduction prior to the commencement of each.  These proposals also set out a court application process for retrospective parental orders with regard to retrospective domestic and international surrogacy agreements.  They also set out a preliminary pre-conception approval process by the assisted human reproduction regulatory authority and a subsequent court approval process for prospective international surrogacy agreements.<\/p><p>These proposals have a number of principles which should be applied in each set of proceedings and these focus on the rights of the child, the surrogate and the intending parents.  It presumes autonomy yet requires informed consent, as well as setting out safeguards to ensure it achieves a balance of rights on a case-by-case basis.<\/p><p> In conclusion, a lack of regulation will not stop couples from travelling to other jurisdictions and engaging in surrogacy agreements.  However, it will result in less guidance in terms of safe and best practice for intending parents, it will leave a surrogate with responsibilities she does not want and it will result in the child having no legal relationship to the person who assumes the parental role in their life for all intents and purposes.  There are a number of workarounds for intending parents but nothing as yet that comprehensively offers that child the legal certainty and lifelong security of family that they deserve.  Moreover, there is no insurmountable cause for why that should be the case.<\/p><p> I am obliged to the committee for the invitation and would be glad to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire O'Connell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":795,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I am joined by my colleague, Dr. &Aacute;ine Sperrin, to outline why assisted human reproduction and international surrogacy are relevant to the lives and dreams of disabled persons.  Before I hand over to my colleague, who will detail vital learning from the Re(al) Productive Justice project, I want to briefly reiterate a few of key facts outlined at a previous committee session.<\/p> <p>  My statement is based on my experience as a disabled person, mother and reproductive justice activist.  I am vice chair of Independent Living Movement Ireland, a member of the Assisted Human Reproduction, AHR, Coalition and a regional ambassador for the NUIG Centre for Disability Law and Policy&rsquo;s Re(al) Productive Justice project.  I am also a survivor - and I do not use that word lightly - of the assisted human reproduction system in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  ILMI is a member of the AHR Coalition because our members and the wider disabled persons movement have an important contribution to make to the development of this essential legislation.  We believe that joining with like-minded reproductive justice groups and working in an intersectional way will be the most effective way to achieve rights-based AHR legislation and services in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  We are here today in a very public setting to implore the committee to consider the most private of rights which go to the very core of human existence and which have been largely denied to disabled people thus far.  Historically, disabled persons have been considered passive dependent recipients of care, eternal children, vulnerable people to be fixed or hidden away in the family home or involuntarily incarcerated in various facilities and institutions.  We were considered asexual or our sexual desires were considered problems to be managed.  Disabled women in particular have been considered most vulnerable.  These varied and widespread misconceptions have had a detrimental impact on disabled persons&rsquo; access to reproductive justice and fulfilment.  It is important to acknowledge the historical treatment of disabled persons to understand why it is essential to hear the voice and experiences of disabled persons in change-making spaces such as this committee.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of ILMI&rsquo;s statement today is: to put on record the voice of disabled persons who have lived experience of infertility and the need for inclusive access to AHR and surrogacy, both important components of reproductive justice; to stress the importance of the committee&rsquo;s deliberations and recommendations being underpinned by an understanding of intersectionality; and to remind committee members of Ireland&rsquo;s responsibilities under Article 23 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which is concerned with respect for home and the family, including the right of disabled persons to found a family.  Intersectionality is a framework for understanding how social identities overlap with one another.  What makes disability unique is that anyone, regardless of age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity or socioeconomic status, can become a disabled person at any stage in their life.<\/p> <p>  My personal journey to motherhood took 15 years and involved two miscarriages, one pre-term daughter, Ashika Noor, who lived for one hour, one failed IVF treatment and finally, in 2007, the birth of our precious daughter, Saira Noor.  My journey also included exclusion from intercountry adoption due to my being considered incapable of being a mother due to being a disabled woman.  My experiences are not unique but they are very private.  However, I am sharing our story - mine and that of my non-disabled husband - with the committee members because I hope that, through their actions, other disabled persons and disabled intending parents will not experience as much heartache, exclusion and prejudice in the future.  Ableist attitudes exist across assisted human reproduction, maternity and parenting services, and the research findings that my colleague will outline this morning bear this fact out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Selina Bonnie"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651705200,"counter":797,"content":"<p>I am speaking as a member of the Re(al) Productive Justice project at NUI Galway, which has gathered qualitative data from disabled people and legal, medical and social work professionals about disabled people&rsquo;s experiences of fertility, contraception, pregnancy, birth, abortion and parenting.  We have also analysed the legal and policy framework governing reproductive justice in Ireland but as Ireland is only developing this area in regard to assisted human reproduction, we can only anticipate potential issues from the perspective of disabled intending parents.  Like Ms Bonnie, I want to highlight to that ableist discrimination is pervasive across all aspects of a journey to parenthood and that these issues should be addressed in regard to international surrogacy and the wider AHR Bill as we think they intersect.<\/p> <p>  What we consider very telling is that across 80 interviews in the last two years, we had no lived experience of surrogacy relayed to us and only minor references to it were made by professionals.  We do not accept that this absence of evidence means that surrogacy is not affecting disabled people, but rather that this is evidence of the absence of surrogacy as an option towards parenthood on an equal basis with non-disabled people.  Where assisted human reproduction services have been referred to in our research, a lack of accessible information, excessive cost and the need to travel abroad have created additional and insurmountable barriers for disabled people.<\/p> <p>  We know there are huge gaps in accessible information around reproductive services for disabled people who have long been presumed not to need it.  Under section 12 of the proposed Bill, it is imperative that the AHR information document is available in multiple formats to ensure everyone can access the information equally and as barrier-free as possible.  Any framework that is established to regulate international surrogacy must be clearly explained across these formats.<\/p> <p>  We are acutely aware that there is a cycle of reproductive services being inaccessible to disabled people, disabled people, therefore, not seeking those services and services then assuming there is no demand for accessible measures or reasonable accommodations to be put in place.  We have first-hand accounts of this occurring within assisted reproduction services.<\/p> <p>  We want to highlight that the risk both to the pregnant person and the resulting child should be interpreted fairly under the proposed section 15 and that disability is not automatically considered a risk.  We are very concerned that being a disabled parent has been designated as a risk to children within Tusla&rsquo;s child protection policies.  The proposed section 16 assessments seem to us to be preconception parental capacity assessments.  These assessments are inherently discriminatory, as told to us by parents who have endured them and professionals who have conducted them.  The assessments do not recognise the true parenting potential where appropriate supports are put in place.  We know that disabled parents are being held to a much higher standard than non-disabled parents and we are very concerned that this would be replicated when accessing surrogacy.<\/p> <p>  The project has heard descriptions of social workers sharing information about disabled people and unnecessarily prejudicing the reproductive services which they receive.  This ties in with the proposed section 37, where information can be exchanged between an AHR provider and a medical practitioner without the consent of the individual.  We have been told about disabled people being required to have another person present during consultations relating to sexual and reproductive health.  This violates the individual's right to privacy and is particularly worrying if the medical practitioners were to disclose private surrogacy-related information in front of inappropriate attendees, such as a family member or a disability support worker.<\/p><p>All of these issues, which disabled intending parents might uniquely face, will potentially impact on the real accessibility of surrogacy to disabled people.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to highlight these issues that the project has come across.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. &Aacute;ine Sperrin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651705200,"counter":799,"content":"<p>In conclusion, we appreciate that international surrogacy is, in turn, a part of broader reproductive justice for disabled and non-disabled people alike.

By way of introduction,  the committee gets a breakdown of each person's curriculum vitae courtesy of the secretariat who are fantastic in the support that they give to us.  I note Ms Duffy has a role in the Merrion Fertility Clinic and the ethics committee in the hospital, in addition to which she is a lawyer.<\/p> <p>  One of the features that arose last week was the possibility of clinics abroad getting, not an accreditation, but a pathway to have a list of almost approved clinics.  I am aware that the word \"approved\" is heavily laden.  When Professor Mary Wingfield was in she talked about the fact that when they engage with clinics abroad or send embryos to clinics abroad they can tell very quickly whether a clinic is good and has good standards because they know by the documentation and the questions that are asked for.  Has Ms Duffy anything to contribute in that regard as that would be helpful as a methodology?<\/p> <p>  Presumably, if Ms Duffy is a lawyer for the surrogacy process in Ireland then it is quite likely when there is relationship breakdown that people come back to her although they would have to arm wrestle to decide which of them would get her.  In relationship breakdown, because of the fact that only one parent is recognised in Irish law and the second parent is not recognised at this moment in time, there is an appalling power imbalance and I know of cases where this has occurred.  We need to bring this matter into the conversation.  Ms Duffy can think about my questions for a minute.<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Ms O'Connell.  We have protocols for genetic link.  I know, particularly over the last few months, clinics have biological embryological protocols yet when a baby is born via surrogacy the presumption of paternity goes with the husband of the surrogate even though well established protocols already exist.  On one hand, in that country the intended parents may be on the birth certificate so they have all the rights that flow from that when they are in that jurisdiction.  The moment they step out of that jurisdiction and they are home in Ireland those rights and presumptions are removed immediately and it is back to the surrogate and her husband and, in particular, her husband must be removed from the picture via affidavits and genetic testing.  It is important that we do something about this matter.  If we were to undermine the presumption of paternity it would have an impact on children who are born without assisted human reproduction.  Has LGBT Ireland given any thought to this matter?  I would appreciate if we could start this conversation as well.<\/p> <p>  My next question is for the ILMI.  We need to repeat the sentence that for people with disabilities there is almost a presumption, and it is in the Tusla guidelines, that they are a risk to children.  We must highlight how appalling that is.  It is ironic that we are in a committee that seeks to resolve discrimination and bring equality for children, and welcome the fact that we are all equals together.  I believe that we are equals in disadvantage and in dealing with discrimination and ableist privilege, which is small by comparison with the lived experience, particularly that described by Ms Bonnie.  The idea of a parental capacity assessment is equally abhorrent in my view.  We must take the opportunity to amplify how abhorrent that is.  This matter is not strictly in the terms of reference for this committee but we must ensure that all reproductive services are available to people with disabilities.  Also, the costs are so prohibitive so it is important that the committee recommends that funding is provided for IVF.  Some of these matters can go towards a second round. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#D00400","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651705200,"counter":802,"content":"<p>The Senator has asked two very interesting and challenging questions.

Interestingly, over the years when people came to me I would say to them that we needed to get things sorted out because everything is fine so long as everything is rosy in the garden but if there is a break-up in the marriage or relationship then that is where issues start to appear.<\/p><p>A psychiatrist involved in a case I was dealing with once described surrogacy as being the happy side of family law and that is true because it is making families.  It is wonderful to be a lawyer involved in that and it has brought such pleasure to what I do.  The other side of it is not the happy side.  I do not do that end of it but the Senator said she is aware of situations and I have been approached by people and I do not deal with it because it is sad.  Any marriage or relationship break-up is incredibly sad but the Senator is correct in what she said.  In the cases that have come to my attention there is a huge control issue, which I have only come across in heterosexual couples where the male is the father recognised in Irish law.  In some cases the female may have been biologically related to the child and in other cases she may not have been.  In some of those cases he has exercised control, asserted that the child is his, that the female is not the parent and stated that he can do what he wants.  The control end of it is quite frightening, particularly if there is no guardianship for the second parent.  It is a major concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#D01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":812,"content":"<p>The guardianship is reliant on the consent of that parent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#E00200","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651705200,"counter":813,"content":"<p>Yes.

I might start by explaining to everyone that the presumption of paternity is based on two things.  First is registration on the birth certificate and second is marriage.  It is dealt with at the moment by section 46 of the Status of Children Act 1987.  So interestingly, in the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 we have a section that excludes it from consideration.  There is a section in the 2022 bill that states that section 46 of the 1987 Act does not apply to parental orders in the context of domestic surrogacy.  The surrogate's husband domestically is not presumed, therefore, to be the father and we do not need to dispense with his consent.  When I first read that I thought it was great that a long-established principle can be changed just because we choose to do so and because we create a new framework.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked if I am concerned about the effect it might then have on contacts outside of surrogacy or assisted human reproduction, AHR.  There is a simple answer to that; when we make legislation like the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 and when we hopefully pass the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022, we are setting out completely new contexts.  We are not applying it to every person who comes through the parentage pathway.  We are applying it to the process of parentage where there is no genetic link or where there is no gestational link.  It is quite simple and has been done already in the proposals.  It is simple to disapply that from those contexts-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#E00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":819,"content":"<p>In a limited and discrete group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#E00900","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651705200,"counter":820,"content":"<p>Exactly.  It is a consideration for us.  The last thing I will say is that the presumption of paternity can be rebutted.  It is a rebuttable presumption on the basis of a genetic link.  I would like it to be clearly set out that it does not apply in the context of surrogacy.  I would also say that I am not of the opinion that a genetic link should be required in surrogacy for many reasons.  First, we already allow double donation in donor-assisted human reproduction.  We have already increased our protections of the social role and minimised the biological role in these specified contexts.  For that reason, if there was no genetic link in the process, the presumption could not be rebutted and there would have to be a specified provision saying that the presumption of paternity does not apply to these contexts.

I have to ascertain whether that male is an Irish citizen so that he can get the child back to Ireland.  Those are the first two considerations we have.  Generally, when people come to me they have done their homework and they have decided where it is they will go.  Their primary interest is to find out how they can establish a relationship with the child when they come back to Ireland.  One of the most difficult things when I am talking to a couple like that, whether it is a same-sex couple or not, is that I have to turn to the second intending parent and tell him or her that I am sorry because there is nothing I can do for him or her at the moment and I can only give advice to the intended biological male parent.  I go through the process for them when they come back to Ireland.  I am an Irish lawyer and I can only advise them on the process here.  My advice to people going abroad is always that they first need to take independent legal advice where they are going.  As we are dealing with same-sex couples in this sitting of the committee, I will concentrate on them.  Invariably, most men will go to America or Canada.

When I started dealing with this I might not have looked at them to the same extent that I currently do.  One of the things I noticed about the agreements is that when the baby was born, the agreement came to an end.  I have always said it is important that the surrogate would understand that her involvement does not purely end when the baby is born but that her involvement is also required for the legal process back in Ireland.  Before she even enters into the agreement that should all have been taken care of, she should realise she will be a party to the legal proceedings in Ireland with rights and she should know that her co-operation or objection will be a part of same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#E01800","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":829,"content":"<p>For me, surrogacy primarily focuses on the needs of the adults rather than the rights and needs of the child and Ms Duffy put it eloquently earlier in mentioning what happens when the relationship breaks down.<\/p><p>What is Ms Duffy's view on step-parent adoption as a process or a route to parentage in some international surrogacy cases?

If the Departments had that information in their pipeline, they would probably be able to better support people going through the process and also to plan better.  Is there is an opportunity for Ms O'Connell to help to deliver that message to organisations and couples she is working with that might benefit from that?<\/p> <p>  It is fantastic to have Ms Bonnie here.  She presented previously to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Disability Matters and I know her from my time on South Dublin County Council.  She does tremendous work.  It is so important to have heard her perspective today because that is what this is all about.  It is about making sure that we are including the people who are most impacted by this.  She very articulately outlined that for people with disabilities who are perhaps excluded from the adoption process, this may be their only lifeline.  I would love to hear more about why she feels this is such an important option for people in that community.  <\/p> <p>  I ask Ms Duffy to respond on when she and her clients engage with the State authorities and then I would like to hear the thoughts of Ms O'Connell and Ms Bonnie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#F01700","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651705200,"counter":847,"content":"<p>I will start by giving a little background.

If one looks at what is happening now in terms of the proposed legislation and this committee, there is more and more information available.  Anecdotally, one of the very first cases I ever dealt with involved a man who made an appointment with me, arrived at my office and told me he had a five-week old baby living in Ukraine with his wife.  He thought he could go to Ukraine, have the baby and just come straight back.  We are going back to the dark ages with that case but that is what happened.  I was sitting in my office, looking at this person and thinking \"Oh my goodness\".  Anyway, life has changed a lot since and people are much more knowledgeable now.  It would be less likely for people to find themselves abroad now, wondering how they are going to get their baby home.<\/p> <p>  When people come into me looking for advice I always tell them, as a preliminary, that they need to let the Department know of their plans.  Certainly, if they have a confirmed pregnancy, I tell them they should get in touch with the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The Department cannot and will not do anything at that stage but, as I say to clients, they need to be on the Department's radar so that it knows what is happening, at least.  If they communicate, the Department will tell them what the requirements are and so forth.  I tend to have very little communication with the Department unless issues arise.

It is important to recognise, right from the start, that people are more than just one thing.  The foundations are important and now is the opportunity to get it right from the start.<\/p> <p>  International surrogacy is an essential part of the path to parenthood.  When people are on a journey to becoming a mother or parent and they have fertility difficulties, there are many different steps they can take.  If they take the first step and it does not work, they go to the next step and it gets more and more intense as they go along.  Personally, I had one failed IVF attempt and even if we could have afforded, both emotionally and financially, to try again it would not have been possible for me from a medical and health point of view.  We had one shot and that was it.  If our final attempt had not resulted in our miracle girl, then because adoption had been excluded for us due to the prejudice of the system, surrogacy would have been our next step.<\/p><p>I am half Indian, so I would have loved to have gone in that direction and ended up with a part-Indian child.

Many of our oral histories in which we have spoken to disabled parents show that babies and kids who grow up with such parents adapt to them and things work for those families.  It is about giving people an opportunity and being extremely careful, if there are assessments, that disability is not considered as a risk, at it currently is for existing children.

The assessments do not recognise your abilities and there are assumptions about whether you should have become a parent.  As well as the costs related to surrogacy, disabled people have to deal with additional costs of day-to-day living and that can impact on raising a child, which is not cheap.<\/p> <p>  There are different attitudes.  There are simple things about when things are held.  There have been examples of people being physically unable to attend meetings because there is not a lift and the meeting takes place upstairs.

They are stuck with whatever the regime is where they go.  We could have control over domestic surrogacy but not in terms of what happens abroad.  In the US, most orders are pre-birth orders but it is possible to get a post-birth order.  To a large extent, because there is no regulation or strict law, you have to keep evolving and deciding on different methods of dealing with this.  Recently,  I have leant more towards asking clients to get a post-birth order.  In Florida, for example, there is a pre- and post-birth order system.  The pre-birth order involves the court looking at the agreement entered into and accepting its validity.  Then it sets out directions for what is to happen as soon as the child is born.  The court accepts jurisdiction for dealing with it but gives directions to doctors and institutions as to who they might take instructions from in respect of a child as soon as the child is born.  The post-birth order is done before the registration and is a final confirmatory order.  It is done shortly after birth.  The advantage of the pre-birth order is it gives more certainty to doctors, for example.  Mary Wingfield referenced this when she was before the committee.<\/p> <p>  I am dealing with the case of a child due in this jurisdiction through surrogacy.  There is a debate between the intending parents and the hospital as to who will give instructions when the baby is born.  There is a desperate difficulty for the intending parents because it is their child and the surrogate mother wants them to have the child, but the hospital is saying she is the mother under law and it will only take instructions from her.  One possibility is having a pre-birth order system here.  I know I am deviating into Irish law but there is provision in the AHR Bill for the appointment of intending parents as guardians.  However, it is not clear.  I would like to think it could be done before the baby is born so they would automatically be guardians when the child is born and could make those decisions.<\/p><p>That is probably being too optimistic.  It has to happen, however.  One cannot have that grey area as soon as the baby is born.<\/p><p> As regards the autonomy of the surrogate mother, in the agreements I have seen abroad, the surrogate mother has absolute autonomy in respect of everything to do with the pregnancy.

Ms Duffy referred to the benefits of the situation in some US states where they have the adoptive piece.

My understanding is that they are happy to go on the birth certificate if it will facilitate legal proceedings in the country of the intending parents.  The reality of the situation is that under American or Canadian law the birth mother is not the mother of the child even though she has given birth to the child.  From the point of view of the birth mother and getting finality in that relationship, it is important that even if she does go on the birth certificate temporarily, her name could be removed when everything else has been done.<\/p> <p>  Step-parent adoption may not be a possibility for a person living here because there is a residency requirement.  The reason for step-parent adoption being the preferred method for people who live in the United States is that one could have a situation where both men are named on the birth certificate and that is recognised under the law of the state in which they live, but they might travel to a neighbouring state that does not recognise same-sex parents as being parents.  Step-parent adoption gives much more security to the second parent because when he goes into the neighbouring state, his adoption order will be recognised even if the birth certificate is not.  That, therefore, removes any concerns in respect of his position as a parent.

The issue for a long time has been the exclusionary nature of a birth certificate.  The birth certificate only recognises people who are parents - the mother and father or mother and second parent or what have you.  I hope I am not speaking out of turn for the rest of the coalition but the idea is that although there would be no issue in respect of having the surrogate registered as the surrogate or surrogate mother or whatever it may be, the parents are the intending parents.  It is not to exclude her or minimise her contribution in any way; it is just to create a bit of separation.

It is important to query that and ask questions.

We did as much as we could to gather a wide variety of stories related to reproductive justice, but surrogacy was definitely one of the main blind spots we did not get to hear, although we think that is reflective of people not being aware of it or considering it a viable option.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. &Aacute;ine Sperrin"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":877,"content":"<p>I have just come from a meeting of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters and I was speaking on the floor of the D&aacute;il, so I apologise for having missed some of the meeting.

In the case of the CFRA, for example, a transitional provision was allowed, whereby everybody who used a gamete donor would be identifiable but there would be about three years after the commencement of certain sections of the legislation in which anonymous gametes could be still used.  Much of the reason behind that related to people who already had a child from the same gamete donor, who may have been anonymous, and they then faced the challenge of deciding whether there should be a sibling relationship between their two children or whether they should work within the framework and have to use an identifiable donor.<\/p><p>It is just to be conscious of things like that.  It is a choice whether you want to give the discretion to the parents to prefer identity and choose that or a transitional provision where you give parents a bit of a chance to maintain those relationships.<\/p><p> The second question was whether I was aware of people who did not follow the CFRA.  I am.  In one particular instance, a couple used a known donor even though they knew, with legal advice, that they would be left out of the CFRA provisions for a retrospective declaration of parentage.  The reason they did that and the reason they are excluded is that they used a known donor.   All the narratives around the CFRA and the disclosure of a child's identity were becoming more prevalent in the conversation and they recognised that.  They thought their child should know its genetic origins but purely for that reason they are excluded from getting a declaration of parentage.  That is a considerable problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#J01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire O'Connell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":880,"content":"<p>That is a problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#K00200","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651705200,"counter":881,"content":"<p>It is a real problem.  My opinion on mistakes that have been made in the CFRA would include exclusions about known donors, as I just said.  Not being able to avail of non-clinical donors in human assisted reproduction is a problem because it requires unnecessary medical interventions on something that can be a very private and lovely process at home.  One technical issue I have is around sections 21 and 22.  These are the sections that deal with retrospective declarations of parentage.  They have strict criteria and going forward there are strict criteria.  What there is not is a discretionary principle for the court.  I see this a lot with surrogacy in the UK and the court cases that arise there.  Sometimes people, through ignorance, mistake or something that may not even have been their fault, fall outside of a framework.  What needs to happen in each court application is that a level of discretion is provided to the court to allow it to say have regard to, say, the best interests of the child or even the autonomy of the surrogate.  Different principles can be applied in different contexts.  That discretion does not exist in the CFRA.  It currently does not exist in the 2022 Bill.  In fact, it is more restrictive than in the general scheme of the 2017 Bill in that the latter allowed discretion to dispense with a surrogate's consent in certain circumstances.  That has been removed.  Allowing for that discretion is something that is recommended by the UK law commissions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Claire O'Connell"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":882,"content":"<p>We are coming to the end of the session but I am aware that there were some questions for Ms Bonnie and Dr. Sperrin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#K00400","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":883,"content":"<p>In some respects, the questions may have been answered but Ms Bonnie and Dr. Sperrin may wish to respond.

As I said at the beginning, surrogacy is complex.  By way of clarification on the baby Gammy case in Thailand, I believe that was subsequently clarified in court in Australia.

I believe there may have been a debate around an abortion but the mother wanted to keep the child because the child was, in her view, a lucky child.  I know the family has been much maligned for having abandoned the child but my understanding is that in fact the mother chose to keep the child.  That is something that should be clarified.<\/p> <p>  The whole issue around surrogacy is that in most jurisdictions the agreement between the parties is not enforceable.  That is where the dilemma is.  If it was enforceable, the parents would have to take the child but there is this very fine line between having a woman carry a child and then forcing her to hand over the child.  I cannot really give the Senator a definitive response on it.  When you look at it, however, and without even dealing with surrogacy but with other situations in which people conceived children naturally in a relationship, parents do walk away.  Fathers walk away, as do mothers, for different reasons and because things happen.  It is not something that is exclusive to surrogacy.

I am the chief executive officer of Equality for Children, a not-for-profit volunteer-led organisation that represents hundreds of LGBTQ+ families across Ireland.<\/p><p>Equality for Children was formed in 2019 with the intention of fighting for equal treatment for children born to LGBTQ+ families in Ireland through donor-assisted conception and surrogacy.  More importantly, I am also a proud same-sex parent to two daughters with my wife Audrey.  Ava is five and Arya is three. <\/p><p> This committee has been established to look at the issue of international surrogacy.  Today&rsquo;s session has been convened to look at, among other things, the retrospective recognition of international surrogacy.  The committee has heard from our close friends at Irish Gay Dads about how surrogacy can be regulated in an ethical way and how the lack of regulation affects same-sex male couples who have children through international surrogacy.  However, international surrogacy is not an option for Irish same-sex female couples.  Currently and under the proposed legislation, parental rights through international surrogacy are only awarded through the biological male parent.  This means that there is no path to parenthood for two women who may need to access surrogacy.  As far as we are aware, there are no children born to same-sex female couples via international surrogacy who require retrospective recognition. <\/p><p> Today, we are asking the committee not only to ensure that same-sex male couples can access international surrogacy and that children already born and conceived through surrogacy to same-sex male couples are included in the legislation, but also to ensure that same-sex female couples can access international surrogacy and that all those LGBTQ+ families left out of current and proposed legislation do not continue to be left in legal limbo.  We are asking that the committee make recommendations to amend the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 and the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 to include all children born to LGBTQ+ parents through international surrogacy and donor-assisted conception. <\/p><p> I will now hand over to my colleague, Ms Maeve Delargy, a member of Equality for Children and a practising solicitor, who will outline the current position of countless LGBTQ+ families across Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Ranae von Meding","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651705200,"counter":906,"content":"<p>On behalf of Equality for Children, I thank the committee for the opportunity to present today.

I am here today while she is doing the work of looking after our children and our house.  That important job is not as valued as it should be by society or, most of the time, by me.  While I am a mother to two daughters, I am only a parent to one.  As Ms von Meding noted, Equality for Children strongly endorses the submission from Irish Gay Dads on how to ensure that same-sex male parents are not excluded from legislation on domestic and international surrogacy.  Additionally, we are here today to highlight to the fact that international surrogacy is and remains entirely unavailable to same-sex female couples in Ireland.  This can be addressed in one of two ways in the upcoming legislation on assisted human reproduction.  The first is by creating a pathway for parental rights to be assigned in an international surrogacy situation where there is double-donor conception and the second is by allowing an intended female parent who uses their own egg to create their child to establish parental rights through DNA evidence.<\/p> <p>  As today&rsquo;s session focuses on protecting the rights and regularising the position of existing children born through international surrogacy, it would be remiss of us not to point out that hundreds of existing children of same-sex female couples across Ireland continue to be excluded from any legislation.  The children who continue to live in legal limbo are: the children of same-sex male or female couples born outside of Ireland through surrogacy or donor-assisted human reproduction, children conceived by same-sex couples in a non-clinical setting, children conceived by same-sex couples using a known donor prior to May 2020 and the children of same-sex female couples conceived outside of Ireland after May 2020.  We urge the committee to recommend in its report that these gaps are also addressed in the upcoming Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill, should it consider it appropriate to do so.

I am a long-time member and volunteer of the organisation, having been with for over ten years.  It supports people on every step of their journey to have a family.  We welcome the opportunity to come before the committee, which is undertaking a very important piece of work in the context of the legislation on assisted human reproduction.<\/p> <p>  For those who are not familiar with NISIG, the organisation was established in 1996 by three amazing ladies in Cork: Helen Browne, Martina Horgan and Geraldine Fitzpatrick.  It is the only charity in Ireland focusing on infertility.  Our mission is to provide practical supports to, and to advocate for, those who experience reproductive challenges and their families.  <\/p> <p>  We strongly welcome the publication of the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022.  Many of the proposals in this Bill have long been called for.  We are concerned that international surrogacy is not included in the current AHR legislation but welcome that this committee is tasked with agreeing a means by which this can be remedied.  We appreciate that the issue members, as national legislators, have been asked to deal with is not straightforward but it is incredibly important.  <\/p> <p>  Over the years, NISIG has been the first point of contact for thousands of people reaching out for support and connection, particularly in the early years when there was not much awareness of fertility issues and there were very few people for those people to connect with.  Many of those contacting us are really just starting to contemplate the option of surrogacy.  We also provide workshops on various issues related to fertility challenges including workshops on surrogacy.  After our most recent workshop on surrogacy, we found that a relatively brief psychosocial intervention can significantly increase parents&rsquo; feelings of confidence and emotional resilience and provide practical tools for engaging in the profoundly important conversations with their child and their community about their child's story.  <\/p> <p>  To give the committee an example of the lived experience of one of our members, I will briefly detail Sarah's experience.  Sarah and her husband spent eight years trying to conceive before her boy and girl twins were born in January 2020.  They had exhausted every treatment available in Ireland and in the Czech Republic, including Clomid, intrauterine insemination, IUI, and eight rounds of IVF.  It took a massive toll on them not just financially, but also physically and mentally.  They also sadly had a miscarriage during this time.  It was a very difficult and stressful decision for Sarah and her husband to make but they eventually arrived at a point where surrogacy was their only option.  They feel that, based on current legislation, as soon as their twins were born, the Irish State was only concerned with Sarah&rsquo;s husband, as the father.  Sarah feels that she is essentially invisible and has practically no rights to her own children.  She can apply for guardianship but feels that just does not befit her role as a parent.  Once her children reach 18 years of age, she will lose all her rights again.  Sarah is their mother.  When they need a parent in the middle of the night, when they have a cut on their knee or when they are scared, and for all of the other natural milestones that children go through during their lives, she is the first person they look for.  Not a day goes by when Sarah does not think about how unfair this is, first of all, to the children but also to herself and her husband.  Her children are not protected because, according to current Irish law, they do not have a mother.  How can we accept that in Ireland in 2022?  Given the long and arduous journey these parents have had to endure to finally become a mammy and daddy, including not just the emotional investment, but also the financial struggle, it is unconscionable that the State would then, as a willing bystander, make them endure any more hardship and stress.  <\/p> <p>  We urge this committee to listen to the lived experience of those who have been through the international surrogacy process, whose stories clearly show the need for legislation in this area to support them and their families, and to take on board the medical and academic testimony that witnesses have provided to it.  This testimony cannot leave anyone with any doubt that legislation is desperately needed and overdue for those who have been through this process and those who will undertake it in the future.  At the centre of this, the best interests of the child must at all times be at the forefront of any legal provisions.  We ask that the committee bear this in mind when working through this process and drafting recommendations.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak.  I look forward to answering any questions members may have on behalf of NISIG.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Gillian Keegan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651705200,"counter":908,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairperson and the committee for inviting us back here today.  I am the chairperson of Irish Families Through Surrogacy, a nurse by profession and a mammy to three-year-old Clara and Matthew, who were born through international surrogacy.  I am here to speak to the committee on behalf of hundreds of families created through surrogacy across Ireland.  I will start today by reading a message I received from Siobhan, one of our members.  Siobhan is a radiographer from Donegal.  With a diagnosis of severe adenomyosis, Asherman's syndrome and years of infertility, Siobhan and her husband, Paul, turned to surrogacy as their last hope to create a family.<\/p><p>Siobhan is now mammy to a four-and-a-half year-old girl - the half is very important - and to a baby boy born through surrogacy last November in the USA.  She states:<\/p><blockquote>\tCiara, our houses should be empty, devoid of noise and mess and chaos and pieces of artwork strewn across the floor like our house is today.  I shouldn&rsquo;t be a parent and yet here I am with two of the most precious children.  We are blessed and not a day goes by that I don't pinch myself that I am here in this situation.  It is just amazing what surrogacy is, and what it has done for me, my husband and my whole family.  It has been absolutely life changing and life saving for me, if I am to be perfectly honest.  I am sure you and others understand this.  I have been to some very, very dark places on my path but thanks to two amazing ladies, surrogates Triona and Lakyn, we have been able to succeed and thrive as a family.  My husband and I completed every piece of research before taking that leap down this path.  It is so important to us to be able to tell our children that we have been their mammy and their daddy every step of the way, including seeing off our embryos as they were being shipped from the Merrion Clinic to the USA. <\/blockquote><p>The wish to raise a family is not an expectation.  It is a shared hope for healthy, happy and rewarding lives.  We wish for equal pregnancy partners, surrogates and donors who can share our hope and the experience of creating a new life: a baby, a child who needs the secure, loving and nurturing environment of a family to flourish.  We believe our laws and regulations should be designed as an invisible protector and enabler of children&rsquo;s well-being and their right to family and citizenship.<br\/><br\/>It is absolutely alarming that the proposed legislation does not include retrospective recognition as a means to create a legal parent-child relationship with their mother for those existing children born prior to the commencement of the Bill.  Hundreds of children from every county across Ireland remain vulnerable in this regard.  Many of these children will soon turn 18 years of age, or already have, and will lose the opportunity for a lifelong legal relationship with their mothers: the mothers who are their caregivers, who love them, raise them and want to fully protect them.  This situation is clearly contrary to the best interests and welfare of Irish children and leaves them in a legal limbo.  The importance for our children of creating that legal-parent child relationship on their social, emotional and psychological well-being is completely immeasurable.  Irish Families Through Surrogacy is recommending an expedited route to parenthood for the protection of these children.<br\/><br\/>Irish Families Through Surrogacy's first piece of advice to any couple going down the road of surrogacy is to seek legal advice from a solicitor who has experience in this field.  The solicitor in that first consultation will explain to the couple what is involved from start to finish.  This can often be a very difficult meeting for the intended parents as it may be the first time they hear that the intended mother will not be recognised in Ireland, even if it is the intended mother&rsquo;s own eggs that are used.<br\/><br\/>Our members are currently experiencing huge variation in the legal process, time taken and cost here in Ireland.  As the committee has heard previously, some of our members have had a five-year wait to get the father's parentage through, leaving their children without a legal parent in this State for five years.  This variation is dependent on the legal representation employed by the couple and also on their address for access to courts.  Essentially, one could say it is a postcode lottery.  There is also a variation in the process and in the courts used.  Some solicitors and barristers are using the family courts and the Circuit Court and others are using the High Court.  We are aware that the Courts Service is changing.  We welcome this change.  We would expect that this change would ensure a more streamlined specialist approach.<br\/><br\/>Intended parents availing of international surrogacy will also employ a legal practitioner in the country they choose.  The legal practitioner engaged is independent to the surrogate mother&rsquo;s legal practitioner.  It is the role of this legal practitioner to ensure all contracts and affidavits are credible, and that the law, regulations, and best practices of the jurisdiction are fully respected.  The international legal practitioner will prepare all documents and ensure they are translated, apostilled and retranslated, including birth certificates and documents required to exit the country and return to Ireland.  The legal practitioner would also work closely with the Irish embassy staff.<br\/><br\/>The surrogate mothers is assigned an independent legal practitioner.  Their role is to ensure that the surrogate mother is fully informed, gives informed consent to the process and fully understands the consequences of the law in their own country and the intended parents' country of origin.  Irish Families Through Surrogacy recommends that all surrogacy contracts should be individualised, directly between parents and the surrogate, to ensure the relationship between the two parties starts early and is not intermediated.  Having a direct contract with a surrogate who has independent legal advice would mitigate the chances of exploitation and ensure the best possible scenario for ensuring surrogate welfare.  The legal support employed for the intended parents and the surrogate must be members of and governed by a regulatory authority in their own country.<br\/><br\/>It is our experience that there are robust processes and arrangements in place internationally for the verification of documents issued in the country of birth to ensure all parties are protected.  This would include oversight from the legal practitioners, the court system in some jurisdictions, Irish embassy processes, and international passport control on exit.<br\/><br\/>With the introduction of legislation, Irish Families Through Surrogacy would see a role to provide advice and guidance on the entire process, and we would work in partnership with the assisted human reproduction regulatory authority and the Department of Foreign Affairs to support intended parents, and children born through the process, safely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Ciara Merrigan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651705200,"counter":910,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak here today.  I am the spokesperson for Irish Families Through Surrogacy.  I am also a mother to three children.  My first-born, baby Helen, died at birth.  When I lost Helen, I also lost my ability to carry another pregnancy.  Thankfully, through advances in assisted human reproduction, I was able to avail of surrogacy and welcome my now two-and-a-half-year old twins Ted and Elsie into the world.  Thankfully, they were alive.  The first thing I said when they were born was \"How is Ivana?\", our surrogate, and then \"They are alive\", because that was not my reality.  Today, the committee will hear some of my story, but, ultimately, I am here to represent the women up and down the country in every community and constituency.  Irish Families Through Surrogacy represent families who, through no fault of their own, had to avail of international surrogacy to have their children.<\/p> <p>  I was failed by State services throughout my entire adult life.  I was failed by a delayed diagnosis of endometriosis.  I was failed by the maternity services where there were admitted failures in my care and the care of my beautiful, stillborn baby girl, Helen.  I was failed when, due to medical reasons, I was denied the chance to adopt.  I was failed when I brought my beautiful children home to Ireland.  When we landed in Dublin Airport as a family. I realised that this was the moment I lost my maternal rights.  I have been invisible as an Irish woman throughout all of these failures.  At the committee's previous sessions, we heard about invisible mothers.  The truth is that I am an invisible mother.  As a mother of a stillborn baby I had no child in my arms to signify my motherhood in society's eyes.  When my husband and I finally welcomed our twins Ted and Elsie through surrogacy, in the eyes of the law I am a legal stranger to them.  I do not exist.  If the current  Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill proceeds without the inclusion of international surrogacy and retrospective recognition of parentage, being a mother through surrogacy means that I will still be invisible.  Hundreds of mothers and I will not be recognised.  Today, I come here to appeal to members, on behalf of these mammies, to please let us finally be visible.<\/p> <p>  I say to the mighty women who carried our children, simply because our bodies could not, that Irish Families Through Surrogacy wants you to know that we see you and that you are not invisible in our lives or in our children's lives.  When we blow out the candles on our children's birthday cake we think of you and we celebrate you.  Without you there would be no birthday cake and our houses would be empty.  The beautiful pandemonium of family life simply would not exist.  This is why your well-being and protection will always be a priority for us.<\/p><p>We come here today to be witnesses to our legislators, the people who can make a difference to our families and to our children.  However, the truth is we bear witness every day to our children.  We have a responsibility to be able to look them in the eye and be confident that their story is one that ensures they were created with protection, love, respect and dignity for everybody involved with our pregnancy partnerships.  We ensure that we as their parents did everything we could to make their story one of which they could be proud of.<\/p><p> Our children have a right to know their origins and their identity.  When we see our reflection in our children&rsquo;s eyes, we want them to see a mother who did everything possible to protect them, love them and advocate for them.  Now is the time as a country we can stand up and be counted, be brave, be forward-thinking and be the ones who are not afraid to tackle the difficult advances in society.  This is not just for our families' sake but for all families and for generations to come.

We were married in 2011 and, unfortunately, we had a number of miscarriages.  Our story on our surrogacy journey started in a Dublin acute hospital, when I was diagnosed with endometrial cancer and my gynaecologist recommended that I have a total hysterectomy.  I was only 33 at the time, which was pretty young for that type of surgery.  At that time, as part of the cancer treatment, my consultant spoke to me about surrogacy.  She spoke about the experiences of other previous patients of hers, indicating it was a real option for me and my husband to create a family.<\/p> <p>  At that point she referred me to the Rotunda IVF clinic, which was known in those days as the HARI clinic.  She referred me to the clinic so we could have our embryos created and frozen.  We completed two cycles at the Rotunda IVF clinic.  It is important to note that one of those cycles was funded by the State as part of my cancer treatment.  That is the normal process for young people with gynaecological cancers, including cervical, endometrial, ovarian and those types of cancer.<\/p> <p>  We created the embryos and, ethically, I did not think we could just leave them there.  They were all a possibility of life.  When I got over surgery etc., we started researching the possibility of surrogacy.  We looked at both domestic and international options but there was no legislation about this in the country.  That did not sit right with me and we looked internationally then.  We looked for a country that had a robust framework in place.<\/p> <p>  Ukraine was the country we chose to pursue our surrogacy journey.  We started to research different options and clinics in Ukraine.  It is interesting because one of the clinics in Ukraine was owned by the same company that owns the IVF clinic we were dealing with here.  Essentially, they are all owned by the same company and therefore they all had the same standards, procedures and book of policies.  Even on a more practical note, they had the same way of thawing an embryo in the clinic in Ukraine as they did here in the Rotunda IVF clinic lab.  The book of standards was exactly the same.<\/p> <p>  At that point we looked at transferring or transporting our embryos from Ireland to Ukraine and it takes a while to get one's head around the thought that part of you and your husband is in a plane flying to Ukraine.  We met the people in our clinic.  It was explained to us at that point that we had to complete an external clinic assessment.  It is a six-page document and I have a copy of it with me today.  I pulled it out to have a look over it.  The case is assessed for legitimacy to ensure standards and licensing are in place, including a registration with the regulatory body in Ukraine.  There were even questions about success rates.  After that, the quality managers in the labs both in Dublin and Ukraine communicated and an inter-clinic agreement was set up.  That was a 23-page document between the two clinics.<\/p> <p>  The clinic in Dublin then had to apply to the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, for permission or a licence to export our embryos from Ireland to Ukraine.  There is much paperwork in that process and it took approximately three months.  It is quite a long process.  The clinic in Ukraine had to do something similar and apply to its regulatory authority, asking for a notification of import.  Essentially, there were two regulatory bodies involved to ensure the standards, processes and everything else were in place on both sides.<\/p> <p>  The clinic here was happy with the clinic we had chosen in Ukraine.  Again, it was owned by the same company and had the same standards, procedures etc.  The next step was to employ a courier or transporter that is licensed, with procedures, protocols and standards in place to carry these precious embryos from one country to the other.  Again, the clinic in Dublin had to ensure it was happy with the person we chose to do this.  The clinic in Ukraine also had to agree it was happy to take the embryos from the transporter and it was happy with the standards and procedures etc. that were in place.  At that stage, we decided - pardon the pun - not to put all our eggs in one basket so we completed the process twice.  The documents had to be completed on both occasions because they were separate transfers.<\/p> <p>  There are some lessons to be learned already within the system that we can bring to the table.  There are regulatory bodies already working together, so to speak.<\/p><p>Even for a couple here in Ireland, it was reassuring for us that the clinic in Ireland completed all these processes.  They had nearly confirmed that everything was right about the clinic in Ukraine as well.  There are learnings there from industry that we can acknowledge here at the committee.  Does that answer the Senator's question or does she need any more information?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Ciara Merrigan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":916,"content":"<p>There are protocols in place that we can build on for other aspects-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#P00200","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651705200,"counter":917,"content":"<p>Yes, from the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, point of view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Cathy Wheatley"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":918,"content":"<p>-----particularly the Chair's question of last week which I promised her Ms Wheatley would be able to answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#P00400","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651705200,"counter":919,"content":"<p>Does that answer it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Cathy Wheatley"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":920,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Wheatley.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#P00600","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651705200,"counter":921,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her question on step-parent adoption and the appropriateness of that process for surrogacy.  Before we get into whether it is possible or not, I would start by saying that it is not really appropriate in these cases.  These intending parents are already parents of their child and it would be essentially asking them to adopt their own child.  Particularly where there is a genetic link, it does not make sense to go through the adoption process.<\/p> <p>  Let us look at what is actually involved in getting an adoption order.  It is an invasive process, it is time consuming and it results in a declaration of eligibility and suitability, but such a declaration would not be given in cases where there is an underlying medical condition for one of the parents.  It is often the reason, as we have heard from the stories today, parents have to go down the route of surrogacy, in that there is an underlying condition and that declaration would not be given.<\/p> <p>  I would also point out that a step-parent adoption is not an option for people who have used assisted reproduction because the adoption authority is not making those orders at present in the absence of legislation.  I would also emphasise the fact that in the proposed legislation there is a surrogacy register and all the details of the surrogate will be on it, available to the parents and available to the child, and that hugely important role, as pointed out today, will be recognised, formalised and recorded so that information is available to all parties.<\/p> <p>  It was stated by another witness that adoption has been used, particularly in cases in the US where the couple is potentially moving between states.  Adoption can be a stronger formulisation of the parental rights in that situation where same-sex marriage is allowed in one state and not in another, and that might be the reason one would use it there, but in terms of Europe there is recent case law from the European Court of Justice in relation to mutual recognition of parenthood in same-sex families between the EU countries.  Therefore, it just would not be appropriate or required here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#P00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Maeve Delargy"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":922,"content":"<p>I thank all the speakers today.

Let me tell the committee members, as they will know, it is a full-time job, in itself, and they are only three-and-a-half and ten months old.

Ms Wheatley touched a lot of people but, because I know her and I know Ms Merrigan, I just thought, &quot;Oh my God&quot;.  It was just so emotional.

It is so important when one hears the stories, and particularly when it comes to medical issues and things like that.<\/p><p>I have been talking to a lot of women recently who have taken the <i>in vitro<\/i>fertilisation, IVF, route.

Do the witnesses believe transferring parental rights to the intended parents should happen before the birth of the child or after?  It is just something I was wondering about.

We need to lead here.  What core standards should be in place to ensure that we protect the rights of all the parties involved?  Is there something specific there?  Ms Merrigan, in particular, went through many legislative issues.  That definitely needs to be looked at.  In general, is there anything there that might make a difference to this?<\/p><p>Again, I thank the witnesses.  I am so touched and I am very supportive.  I am fully committed to doing anything I can do to help.  I do not know who wants to take the questions.

Like Ms Merrigan, our experience when we started our surrogacy journey was that it was very much a collaboration with the clinics in Ireland.  I went through my stimulation in Ireland and that was worked with the clinic over there.  It was a collaborative approach and that is definitely what we want going forward.  That is why we feel the role of the regulatory authority is so important.  It is because we have these systems in place.  We need something to cement it and give it an overview.<\/p> <p>  The legal representation for both parties involved is hugely important to us as an organisation.  The reason for that, of course, is that we have our representation in Ireland.  We also have legal representation in the country where we are availing of surrogacy but the surrogate mother herself has that independent legal representation.  That is absolutely huge for us.  In my case, when we went there, we met our surrogate, Ivana, who has no problem being named.  We met her without anybody involved first.  We had literally a human meeting where we wanted to see who she was and whether she was happy to do this, and her reasons for doing it, and then we went into the more official process whereby we met with our representation, her representation and together we produced a collaborative contract, so that her voice was heard at all times.  That is really what we are calling for in that regard.<\/p> <p>  As we said, counselling is a big deal.  Even before starting the process, we believe people should have access to that.  Every woman wants to carry her own child and as one is going through the process, there is so much information and so many regulatory bodies, and one must meet the requirements of clinics here, clinics over there, etc.  The reality is it is a big deal to hand over the most precious gift even from our point of view in terms of our embryos to begin with.  To hand that over to somebody else to take care of is huge and, therefore, the intended parents definitely need to have counselling to establish how they will feel and how they will deal with issues when they arise.<\/p><p>One of the most beautiful things that happened between me and my surrogate mother is that when we went there at the 20-week scan, she asked me if she could hold her tummy to my tummy so that I could feel her babies' kick.  In that moment, I was blown away by her love, generosity and kindness to be able to do that.  I also wanted to make sure that she was okay with that, emotionally.  She was offered counselling at all stages throughout pregnancy as well and, most importantly, post birth.  There was a definite push from the clinic to get her to avail of counselling.  Ivana would tell you she is a strong woman.  She knew what she was doing.  She knew what she was getting into, but she did avail of counselling, and she found that it really helped her.  One of the things that she said - I do not speak on her behalf as she is able to speak very clearly for herself - is that after our surrogacy journey was completed, the twins were born and we were back in Ireland, what she missed most was the contact between the two of us because in those nine months we were constantly in contact.  I was so busy.  I had newborn twins and I would ring her and show them to her and she would say it was okay that I was busy and it was grand.  One of the reasons she availed of counselling was to deal with the fact that the time I had initially was not available, not because I did not want that, but because I was caring for newborn babies.  That was a huge issue for her.<\/p><p> The main issue for us is always that our surrogate mothers get to retain autonomy over their own bodies.  That is important.  Nobody has the right to say what anybody does.  It was one of the things that was really important to us.  Ivana herself would say differently.  She would say \"Get it done and dusted quickly\".  She would be afraid of her life that she was going to have legal responsibility for the children.  That is something that is really important.  As an organisation, we outline the steps to couples in the absence of regulation and legislation.  That is a role we have very much taken on and what we recommend to couples is to make sure that people going into it have clear indications of what is best practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#P01400","nonspeaker":"Ms Cathy Wheatley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":930,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Wheatley very much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#Q00200","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":931,"content":"<p>I have been very touched by the testimonies here today.

In terms of our research and everything that we did, the reason Ukraine was hugely important is due to a couple of factors.  First, in order to avail of surrogacy in Ukraine you have to be a heterosexual, married couple and you must have a medical reason for undergoing surrogacy.  We met the criteria in that regard.  The lengths to which they go to ensure there is a medical reason are robust.  I had to get letters from my fertility doctor and send my child's stillborn certificate to them.  Lots of paperwork was involved before we even got to the point of being accepted to undergo surrogacy in Ukraine.<\/p> <p>  Of course we researched the situation.  The first thing we did, which we would advise anyone to do, is to get legal advice.  We were very lucky in that the legal representation that we got had experience and was able to steer us in the right direction.  At the end of the day, we have to be able to make sure that the women carrying our children are being looked after, not just for ourselves but for our children.  We bear witness to them.  As Ted and Elsie grow up, I have to be able to look them in the eye and tell them that I made sure at every step of the way that the woman who carried them was protected.  A couple of ways we did that personally was when we went to Ukraine first, we met her without any agency being involved and we had a chat.  We talked about her motives for doing it, why she wanted to do it and whether we thought it would work for all of us together.  Then we had a meeting with the agency, as I said.  One of the things that was really important to us was that we spent time alone with her at every step of the process, so that she was not being monitored in any way and she had free rein to highlight any problems she was having.  We also flew over there when she moved to the city where she was going to give birth.  We flew over to check out her accommodation to make sure that it was of a proper standard for her and her children who went with her.<\/p> <p>  We did due diligence to the best we could to make sure that she was absolutely protected.  After our twins were born, they were in the neonatal unit for ten days.  Ivana was in hospital for three days.  When she left the hospital, she came to stay with us.  Because her family lived further away, I felt that I had a responsibility to make sure that she was okay as well.  Every day we would go and visit the twins and I asked her if she wanted to come but she would say \"No, no, I am done.  I will rest and watch TV.\"  Of course she did come, which I felt was really important as well, when we went for the DNA test, so that the Irish officials could be there to make sure that she was okay and that she was there of her own free will.  We all travelled together.  We did not travel separately.  This was very much a relationship that had been built on.  She stayed with us after that until she simply had enough of us and she wanted to go home to her own family.  That was the point when she left and went home to her boys.  She was taken into hospital early and her mother had not yet arrived to look after her children so while she was in hospital having my children, I cared for her children.  The relationship that was there was very solid.  I trusted her with mine and so she trusted me with hers.  We went through everything that we possibly could in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Ted and Elsie are two and a half now and we speak to Ivana and her children regularly.  We send little drawings back and forward.  I can say 100% that she does not consider herself the mother of the children, because I am.<\/p><p>Ivana is living with us due to the crisis in Ukraine.  I felt like I needed to do something to protect her, just like she had protected my children.  She is living with us in a two-bedroom cottage in County Wicklow.  We have three adults and five children in our little cottage.  It does not matter if we have no room in the house, however, because there is plenty of room in our hearts.  We are able to prove to Ivana that when I stood in her kitchen and told her she was part of our family-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#Q00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Cathy Wheatley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":934,"content":"<p>You meant it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#R00200","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651705200,"counter":935,"content":"<p>-----I meant it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Cathy Wheatley"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":936,"content":"<p>My heart goes out to you.

I also just want to acknowledge Senator Seery-Kearney.  She has been invaluable to me in the context of information.  I appreciate her sharing her story, as well as everyone else who is here.<\/p> <p>  So much has been covered and said.  I have just a few points.  First, I welcome the fact that Equality for Children has solutions in its documents and submissions.  We all have a tendency to say it is complex, and it is.  However, I have found over the past number of weeks that there are actually loads of solutions out there.  It is just a matter of putting them all together in the best way we possibly can.  I just wanted to acknowledge that.<\/p> <p>  Ms Wheatley and Ms Merrigan have kind of already touched an awful lot their personal stories.  However, if there is anything else that they want to add, I wish to give them that opportunity.  I am conscious that, as they said, this is probably was not something they ever envisaged happening in their lives.  Even around the whole process and where they first started, some of which has already been covered, I just want to give the opportunity to add anything.<\/p> <p>  I want to ask Ms Keegan about secondary infertility.  Infertility is a very lonely space.  People do not have an understanding of it much of the time and people are very harsh as well in the questions that they ask.  Assuming someone gets into a relationship or gets married, people ask, &ldquo;When are the kids arriving?&rdquo;  Then, if you have a boy, people will ask when you are having a girl.  If you have one, people will ask when you are having two.  While people kind of mean well, sometimes those comments can be very hurtful.  On secondary infertility, sometimes there is a myth that if someone has one child, people will kind of wonder what are they complaining about.  Is there anything Ms Keegan wants to say on that?  I acknowledge the work she does and the support that she gives to people because, as I said, it is a very lonely space.<\/p> <p>  The final question is for everyone, if there is time for it.  I refer to other models, for example, the Canadian one.  We will have witnesses in from that jurisdiction and I look forward to that.  The Canadian model acknowledges the bodily autonomy, which I appreciate.  It has counselling and everything built in and there is no delay or question mark over when the rights of parentage are transferred over.  It is done at birth.  That is a good system.  I am interested to hear what the witnesses think about that.  Are there other models we should be looking at?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#R01100","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651705200,"counter":944,"content":"<p>I suppose our stories are very well covered at this point.  One thing that has not been covered, however, is the fact that when we started to undergo surrogacy, it was very taboo.  Nobody was talking about it.  It was hidden.  I remember going to a NISIG meeting and meeting people who were going through it.  My husband thought, &ldquo;Wow.  These are all normal people.  We can do this.&rdquo;  It was amazing.  One of the things that we are trying to do in Irish Families Through Surrogacy as well is to break down those myths around surrogacy and tell people the truth, our truth and the reality of it.  Lately, we have been trying so hard to raise the social awareness of surrogacy.  Thanks to the likes of the committee and its members because it has been invaluable to us to shine a spotlight on it, destigmatise it and take away the myths.  As a mother of children born to surrogacy, I do not want my children to be stigmatised because of the way that they were born.  Children are children, no matter how they were conceived.  My job, as their mother - all of our jobs - is to fight for them to make sure that in no way are they being made to feel different.<\/p> <p>  This week, I faced the reality of not being able to sign another legal document.  I faced it previously when Elsie was sick and I was sitting in the car park at the hospital crying my eyes out.  This week, they started playschool.  It was a very exciting day in our household.  Obviously, when children start playschool, the schools need forms.  I brought the forms home and my husband filled them in the night before.  When I was walking my children up to the door to playschool, I did not have the same nervous excitement for them or the same emotional feelings of them being let out into the real world.  In my stomach, I had the anxiety and upset of knowing that I had forgotten those forms that my husband had filled in.  I did not know if my children would be turned away that day because of that.<\/p><p>When I got to the door of the playschool, in front of all the people there, I had to tell them I did not have the forms and had forgotten them.  They said that was no problem and to just fill them in now.  In front of all my peers, and my children's peers, I had to say I could do that.  It made me think, as they are taking their first steps into the world, about how many other times this will be the case.  How can one tell a child who is excited to go on a school trip that mammy cannot sign the permission slip?  How can we stand there and know that because of the choices we made and the legislation that is not in place they will be discriminated against, if it is not changed?  I cannot let that happen.  I do not think any of us can.  Ted and Elsie are my world.  I would do absolutely anything for them, as everyone would for their children.  The realisation at that moment at the playschool door was then compounded by the fact that the teacher said to Elsie, \"Your mother is going to go and get the forms\" and Elsie said, \"She is not my mother\".  I felt like I had been kicked in the stomach.  In those moments, everything went through my head, including whether she was aware that, in law, I am not her mother, and whether she was aware of the conversations we will subsequently be having.  It felt like a lifetime but after two seconds she looked at the teacher and said, \"She's my mammy.\"  That is what it boils down to for me.<\/p><p> Irish Families Through Surrogacy is trying to raise awareness around this.  We have been involved in lots of advocacy.  We have done research studies with universities.  We have collaborated with international organisations to ensure best practice is in place, even in respect of how we talk to our children.  We have been a liaison between our members, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Senator Seery Kearney in order to make sure the information is quick, clear and concise to people.  That is all we can do.  We then come here to plead with members to make sure I do not have to face days like that any more.  On the issue of recognition, and Ted and Elsie understanding, I will pass over to Ms Keegan because NISIG has recently run workshops that have been very beneficial to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#R01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Cathy Wheatley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651705200,"counter":946,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her question.  I know she specifically mentioned secondary infertility.  NISIG provides support services to anybody who approaches us.  We have a helpline, run by Ms Helen Browne, who started the organisation in 1996.  I say a huge \"thank you\" to her because without her and the other two ladies there would not be any organisation.  There was no awareness in those days.  She said there was nowhere to go to and it was very difficult to talk about anything.  The options available in those days for assisted human reproduction, AHR, were very limited.  There were some options in helping someone to have a baby but many people were not able to get there.  Ms Browne said the world is our oyster now in that at least there are options or different procedures we can do.<\/p> <p>  We hold support meetings.  It is quite interesting because we had our first support meeting post-Covid last Saturday.  We held it in the Ashling Hotel in Dublin.  I did not know if anybody would turn up, as it was the bank holiday weekend.  I did not think it through properly when I was actually booking the room but seven beautiful people turned up.  Some of the conversations we have in support meetings are with people who are just starting to realise they may need a certain amount of help, including people who have been on a journey for quite a while and those who may have had one child without too much help, or everything went fine and then they suddenly realise.  I remember the husband of one couple who was at the meeting said to me they had their first child, who was six or seven, were trying for another child and this whole issue has dominated their house.  This couple tried to have their second child and did a number of things that did not work.  They then talked to a clinic in another country.  He said he felt that even though this couple have a child it kind of dominates the landscape.  Everything is about what they will do next and what their plans and options are.<\/p> <p>  We have people at our meetings who might have tried for a number of years to have a child, and may have a number of complex issues, but they also may be talking to us as an organisation about maybe not being able to have a child.  That conversation is very hard for anybody to have.  They might say to me they might have to face the fact they may not be able to have a child.  They may try for seven years but then there are conversations around how they know when to stop.  I have had all these conversations at many different meetings.  When I was at the meeting last Saturday, since we had not actually been physically in a room with people for a long time, one particular lady spoke who was very upset.  It only happened at the start of the meeting but it resonated with everybody.  Even though I had my son with help ten years ago, I could feel that it brings people back to that place again.  It can be very challenging for a couple.  At least with NISIG, people can come to a meeting and talk to others about couples constantly having that tension around what they will do next, how they will manage this and so on.<\/p> <p>  We are basically here for everybody and do the best we can to support people.  We are aligned with fantastic organisations that can help us.  We help each other.  I text Ms Merrigan or whatever when I need a little help.  Ms Wheatley mentioned the workshops we have been doing.  Specifically, we did them with couples through surrogacy.  They are counsellor-led, donor disclosure workshops.  They are about counsellors guiding people on the nuts and bolts of how to start the conversation with their younger children about their origins.  That is something we have started doing with a number of groups and we plan to do it in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Gillian Keegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":947,"content":"<p>There might not be time to discuss the Canadian model.

I am considering whether we move to a situation where we nearly have to prove every single ethical framework conversation, such as love and compassion for surrogate mothers, and try to balance that with the fact we just need to exercise children's rights.  At what stage do we balance those two things against each other?  People who have this lived experience are held responsible, in a sense, to keep portraying how much they care about the process, or care about the women who have carried the child for them and so on.  At what stage do we say that is one part of it, but we need to do something?<\/p> <p>  Ms von Meding spoke a lot about the Children and Family Relationships Act and what we need to do to improve that.  How do we get to that?  At the end of the day, we will never be able to account for every single thing that happens in every single jurisdiction.  It should not be constantly on the people here today to have to keep proving they are good people.  It is really hard.  They are saying, \"I am worthy, I am good\".  How do we shift that?  How do we move into actually looking into the raw detail of it and what we need to do to exercise children's and parenting rights in Ireland and take that responsibility away from the representatives?  It is on us as well to stop looking for that proof of goodness or proof of ethics and figure out a way to do that as legislators in terms of frameworks and where we can and cannot regulate.<\/p> <p>  I was coming up with questions in my head.  I was intrigued by Ms Wheatley's meeting with Ivana and I wondered if that was an optional matter rather than a protocol.  If I start asking those questions, they are so relative to every single situation that, regardless of how Ms Wheatley answers that, she cannot account for every single place in the world.  These questions are so individual and so relative to people's experiences that I am trying to figure out in my own head how we move away from that and figure out how we ensure our legislation in Ireland is reflective of our obligations to children and families.  That is more an observation.  I am thinking out loud about what we need to do.  Maybe Ms von Meding would like to come in on the Children and Family Relationships Act because she focused on that in her presentation.  Where does that Act have and not have jurisdiction?  Where can it claim jurisdiction and so on?  What do we need to do on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#S00600","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651705200,"counter":951,"content":"<p>I feel very deeply what the Senator said about those of us who share our stories feeling the need to prove ourselves as good people.<\/p><p>We are good people, but at the end of the day whether we are good people is not the issue.  It is the fact that our children are being denied the protection of both of their parents.  While Ms Delargy and I may not have the experience of having had a child through surrogacy, we both have the lived and real experience of knowing our children do not have the protection of both their parents.<\/p><p> In terms of the Children and Family Relationships Act, we are often asked, given that there is a framework now in place, why somebody would choose to go outside that framework.  This relates to the draft AHR Bill also because some might say there is a proposed framework and ask why somebody would go outside that.  In the context of the Children and Family Relationships Act, there are three reasons - circumstance, cost and choice.  In the case of circumstance, there could be a couple who live abroad, had their children abroad and they are fully recognised as a family in that jurisdiction regardless of how they conceived, be it through surrogacy or donor-assisted conception.  Once they come back to Ireland those rights are taken away and they are no longer viewed as a family.  In my situation, our circumstance meant that we could not access the fertility treatment we needed in Ireland, so we went abroad and we had our children.  We fought for a long time and, thankfully, we were retrospectively recognised as a family.  We only got our children's birth certificates a couple of weeks ago and that was a very special day.  I cannot wait to see my friends and colleagues experience that also.  However, because of that circumstance and because we went abroad, it means, bizarrely, that if we choose to use our remaining embryos that are in a different jurisdiction, they would not be granted the same retrospective recognition so we would be back in the same situation.  This is just to illustrate the different circumstances in which one might find oneself and fall outside the parameters of any existing framework.<\/p><p> In terms of cost, members are aware that the cost of fertility treatment is massive.  For some families and individuals it is just not something they can undertake.  They may choose to go abroad where the prices may be cheaper or they may choose not to use a clinic at all and do a non-clinical procedure, which is not currently covered by the framework.<\/p><p> The final thing is choice.  Most Irish individuals have choice when it comes to reproductive autonomy, conception, pregnancy and childbirth, even choosing where and how to give birth.  However, for some individuals, be they LGBT+ or they have a medical condition that means they have to access surrogacy, that choice is often taken away.  LGBT+ people, especially, should have the choice of whether they want to conceive through a fertility clinic or not.  I will not speak on behalf of my colleague, Ms Delargy, but I know it was important for her and her family that they did not conceive through a clinical setting.  Having the choice to use a known donor was incredibly important to their family, and I know many families for whom it is incredibly important, but that falls outside of any existing framework.<\/p><p> It is very important, as part of the broader conversation, to look at the Children and Family Relationships Act, at what is missing there and at the two-tiered structure that has been created where some same-sex female families and their children have equality now and others do not.  It would be very dangerous to create that type of two-tiered system again in the assisted human reproduction Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#S00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Ranae von Meding","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":953,"content":"<p>I cannot see if Senator McGreehan is on campus.

I have been like a headless chicken all morning running in and out.  I thank the witnesses for their contributions.  It is always lovely to see them.  I thank them for sharing their knowledge, stories and life experiences.  I find it profoundly sad and profoundly joyous to listen to the love and the joy they experience with their families now.  We all are so lucky.  Like Ms Wheatley, I have endometriosis and it can be a devastating disease.  It was devastating for Ms Wheatley and I was in tears hearing her contribution.  It cut deep for me, so I thank her for sharing that.  It was not an easy thing to do to share it with us here.<\/p> <p>  A great deal was covered today.  I have some simple questions for Ms Von Meding about the 2015 Act and the amnesty, where certain families were legally recognised.  I apologise because I do not understand all of that, and I want to learn a little more.  If a family has remaining gametes and embryos, do they fall outside that legislation or are they covered by the amnesty?  We have the 2015 Act and we are now creating a new AHR Bill.  Are there any lessons, mistakes or improvements that we can learn from as we move from then to now?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#T00500","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651705200,"counter":957,"content":"<p>In terms of retrospective recognition and the amnesty in the 2015 Act, there is an amnesty for children who fall outside the framework where an anonymous donor was used prior to 2020 or where an international clinic was used prior to 2020.  That is how my family and children were granted retrospective recognition.  However, if someone has embryos that were created prior to 2020 and if they are not in an Irish clinic, there is no retrospective recognition.  If they are in an Irish clinic and they do not meet the criteria but they are in an Irish facility and there are existing siblings generated from the same donor, there is a timeframe within which those embryos can be used.  I believe it was a two-year period, but I am open to correction on that.  There is a very limited window for retrospective recognition.<\/p> <p>  There is no retrospective recognition where a known donor was used prior to 2020, where a non-clinical procedure was used prior to 2020 or when a child is born abroad prior to 2020.<\/p><p> On the learnings, it was wonderful to have the 2015 Act put in place and to create this framework where once we had nothing.  It was amazing for all the families who got that day to finally celebrate both parents being recognised and both being legally connected to their children.  However, as I mentioned before it created a system in which some children were now more equal than others and it almost created a minority within a minority.  You had all these LGBTQ+ families who had been created through donor-assisted reproduction and you can look at two children and say \"now you have equality but you do not because you were conceived in a clinic and you were not or because you were born in the UK and you were born in Ireland\".  For me, that would be the biggest learning to take from that.  We cannot create a system in which some children are treated more equally than others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#T00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Ranae von Meding","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":959,"content":"<p>I thank Ms von Meding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#U00200","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":960,"content":"<p>Senator Seery Kearney wanted to come in and Deputy Funchion had a query about the Canadian model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#U00300","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1651705200,"counter":961,"content":"<p>Our guests may wish to come back with a written reply.

I say that as I stretch it a little bit.  Clearly I am exploitative and manipulative.<\/p> <p>  I thank all members for their contributions but Senator Ruane's contribution has been a seismic shift; I acknowledge her all-time genius but particularly today.  I met a couple and when Ms von Meding was on the radio I texted in abruptly about it and did not explain it very well.  The couple said they feel they have to be the very best lesbians there ever were in the whole world.  I started to cry.  I welled up imagining it.  It hit home far too much for me that there is this obligation to prove I am not a child-trafficker, not an exploiter of women, that I have not bought my child.  I have not done any of those things.  You go on a long list and that arises out of the stigma, the stereotyping, the language and the manner in which people are described or allusions to the extreme cases.  The norm is the stories in this room and all the other ones behind it.  On the one hand it is important we put in due diligence and guidelines but within that we need to not be so restrictive we oblige people to prove a relationship with the surrogate mother where she does not want it, where it may not be a healthy thing for there to be a relationship.  Not everyone would necessarily have the boundaries that Ms Wheatley and Ivana have with each other.  There is the recognition of vulnerability but also the fact we are going to the heart of identity and ensuring a child knows who he or she is, who his or her genetic parents are, his or her lived experience of who his or her parents are and the precious place in his or her life of the woman who gave birth to him or her.

There was one thing I wanted to pick up on.  I thank Senator Ruane for what she said because we very much feel there is a spotlight on us as parents and a burden of proof on us to ensure we can show we have done the right thing.  Like I said before, we bear witness to our children and they are the ones we answer to.  On some of the misconceptions around surrogacy the Chair talked about, in particular to do with a question from Senator Keogan earlier on about the surrogate mother and the birth mother and that situation, in surrogacy and the surrogacy we availed of, the surrogate is a gestational carrier.  She has no genetic link to the child.  Obviously she gives birth to the child and her place needs to be recognised in that but she is a gestational carrier and that is the term we use that they are happy for us to use as well.<\/p> <p>  That then leads on to the situation of birth certificates whereby if we have this thing of the surrogate being named on the birth certificate, that piece of paper is one your children must produce regularly throughout their lives.  I would not want to see children who are being in some way marked, standing out or stigmatised because there is a birth certificate.  The UN convention says our children have the right to a private life and that needs to be upheld.  In that regard, for all of our children, that needs to really be considered because this information is their private information as they go through life.  Obviously, I have been very public with mine but it is about who they want to share their story with and who they do not want to.  To have to produce a birth certificate that exposes them, given all the crazy things you need your birth certificate for - I do not want to see children being stigmatised and do not want to see them being marked in some way by the method of their conception.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ISS2022050500002#U01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Cathy Wheatley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1651705200,"counter":971,"content":"<p>If I may come in as well I can reply to Deputy Funchion.

They have legislation for international and domestic surrogacy so it would be important we look at both of those models.
