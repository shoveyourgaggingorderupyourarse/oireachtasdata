However, the current employment permits legislation does not provide for a refund to be granted after an employment permit has issued, or to offset the fee paid for an issued Employment Permit against a different\/new application. The employment permits legislation prescribes that where an application for an employment permit is refused or withdrawn, a portion of 90% of the fee paid is returned to the applicant.<\/p><p>With regard to the additional information provided by the Deputy the individual in question was issued an employment permit on 30 January 2020.

The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; and this is further reinforced through the implementation strategy set out in Climate Action Plan being published this week. Ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050. Electrification will be key to achieving this objective in the transport sector. <\/p>  <p>  In support of this, preparations are under way to establish an Office of Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV), as recommended in the EVPP Report; this will play an important role in our transition to zero-emission vehicles. OLEV will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point infrastructure. This Office will also play an important role in coordinating communications campaigns to encourage EV uptake. <\/p>  <p>  A generous suite of incentives is available to support individuals who wish to purchase an electric vehicle. In addition to this, officials in my Department are actively examining technological innovations which will in time provide more affordable options to the consumer wishing to purchase an EV. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently working with the SEAI to develop a commercial fleet trial for companies to trial an electric vehicle. It is anticipated that this program will launch in Q1 2022. <\/p>  <p>  A crucial step in the electrification of Ireland&rsquo;s national fleet is encouraging the commercial and public sectors to adopt electric vehicles into their fleets.  This pilot scheme will afford businesses an opportunity to trial an electric vehicle in real world conditions and showcase the suitability of electric vehicles in the commercial sectors.

In relation to the local radio sector, I have received quarterly reports from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) analysing the impact of COVID-19 on the commercial radio sector.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has put in place a range of supports for all businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which are available to local newspapers and local radio stations, such as the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Support for the production of audiovisual and audio content for Irish audiences is provided through the Sound and Vision Scheme, which is established under the Broadcasting Act 2009, administered by the BAI. The Sound and Vision Scheme is funded through the allocation of 7% of net licence fee receipts per annum. Under section 156 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, I as Minister may allocate additional Exchequer funding to the Sound and Vision Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of challenges facing the independent radio sector and its important contribution to society as a whole, in December 2020 I allocated additional funding of &euro;4.9 million for the Sound and Vision Scheme, &euro;2.5 million of which was to support the independent radio sector and &euro;1.4 million to support the live music sector. The &euro;2.5 million was awarded in April 2021 as part of a &euro;2.58 million Sound and Vision Scheme funding round to support all 32 radio stations in the independent radio sector. This funding was in additional to traditional Sound and Vision Scheme funding rounds.<\/p>  <p>  The loss the local media sector &ndash; newspapers and radio - has suffered from the impact of the restrictions has also been addressed by the public health advertising placed by the Government and HSE totalling at least &euro;17.14m from March 2020 to date.

As set out in the rent contribution agreement, this weekly rental contribution must be paid by them so that they remain eligible for the HAP scheme. HAP recipients are required to set up automatic electronic rent payment arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  The HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages the collection of all HAP tenants&rsquo; differential rents, on behalf of the relevant local authority, and the payment of all HAP rents to landlords on behalf of tenants supported by the HAP scheme. The HAP SSC follows a clear communication policy if rental arrears issues arise. This policy includes regular and early written communication with tenants, landlords and the relevant local authority. <\/p>  <p>  The approach taken by the HAP SSC has been very effective with minimal levels of rent arrears arising for HAP tenants. In 2019, the scheme had a 96% differential rent collection rate, with minimal arrears arising for tenants or local authorities. At Q3 2021, the scheme had a 98% differential rent collection rate. Therefore, only a very small number of tenants have fallen into difficulty with their differential rent.<\/p>  <p>  During the Covid-19 emergency, the HAP Debt Management Process (DMP) was suspended from March 2020 and partially re-commenced in October 2020. This meant non-payment of differential rent by a tenant during that time did not affect payments to HAP landlords. Tenants were, however, expected to continue to pay their rent with supports available for those financially impacted by Covid measures in place.<\/p>  <p>  The payment of HAP in respect of tenancies that had already entered the cessation stage of the DMP prior to the suspension of the process in March 2020 remained suspended, and local authorities were advised to proceed in ceasing those tenancies. In 2020, 18 tenancies have had their HAP support ceased for non-payment of differential rent, after the debt management process was fully completed.<\/p>  <p>  Following on from the successful roll out of the COVID vaccine programme and the reopening of society it was agreed to re-instate the full DMP, from September 2021. From 6 September 2021, the debt management process as applied pre COVID was applicable to tenants entering into arrears from that date. For tenants in arrears prior to that date, these tenants were given additional time to engage with the HAP SSC Debt Management Unit to assist them in remaining in the HAP scheme and preventing the suspension\/cessation of their landlord&rsquo;s HAP payment. In 2021, 42 tenancies had their HAP support ceased for non-payment of differential rent, after the debt management process was fully completed. Information on cessations is collated on a quarterly basis, therefore, 2022 data is not yet available.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the average time in, and amount of, arrears outstanding at the time of cessation, the SSC advise that this information is not readily available from their \"live\" operating system. Information is only recorded on the current balance, which could have changed since the tenancy was ceased, if a write-off of the amount outstanding had been approved or if the tenant began to pay off the arrears.<\/p>  <p>  HAP tenants in arrears should contact their local authority and the HAP SSC to discuss the options that are available to them to ensure the continuation of their HAP support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600084#WRD02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":140,"qnumday":73,"qnumall":"[3760\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600084#WRD03000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of tenants in receipt of HAP who have transferred to a local authority or approved housing body tenancy since 2014, by local authority in tabular form.","asker":"1551","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":141,"content":"<p>While the Department does not hold information on the number of Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) tenancies that moved directly into a social housing property, data is available in relation to the number of tenancies that moved from HAP to other forms of social housing support.

By the end of 2020, Irish Aid had allocated over &euro;113 million in assistance to education.  The final outturn for 2021 is currently being calculated.  These funds are supporting students in developing countries to complete primary and secondary education, as well as to move on to technical and vocational training or higher education.  <\/p>  <p>  Irish Aid&rsquo;s education support has a strong focus on equity and inclusion.  Irish Aid puts a particular emphasis on girls&rsquo; education, knowing that girls, especially as they reach adolescence, are more likely to have their education cut short. In 2020 Ireland launched a global call to action &ndash; the Drive for Five - calling on all governments and stakeholders to commit to transformative actions to get all adolescent girls into school and learning in safe, supportive, and healthy environments.<\/p>  <p>  The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted education across the globe. Schools closed in 194 countries and 1.6 billion students missed on classroom instruction, many for months. During the early days of the pandemic, Irish Aid helped countries to ensure continuity of education for all children, especially girls. We are now supporting partners to safely reopening schools, with improved facilities, and interventions to make up for learning losses. <\/p>  <p>  The Global Partnership for Education (GPE) is Irish Aid&rsquo;s largest education partner and is supporting over 67 developing countries to sustain learning and mitigate the education impacts of the pandemic.  Ireland contributed &euro;25 million to the GPE between 2018 and 2020.  Last year, I made a new pledge to contribute &euro;60 million to the GPE over five years, &euro;10 million of which is earmarked for girls' education. <\/p>  <p>  Children and youth in humanitarian emergencies or protracted crises are most vulnerable to missing education or dropping out completely. Ireland has a history of supporting education in emergencies, particular for Palestinian children through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.  Irish Aid also funds non-governmental organisations to provide education support for refugee and displaced children in the Sahel, in Central African Republic, Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, Jordan, South Sudan, Sudan and Somalia.<\/p>  <p>  In A Better World, the government committed to scaling up our support for education in emergencies.  In 2019 Ireland joined Education Cannot Wait, a global fund dedicated to supporting education in situations of war, forced displacement, natural and man-made, disasters and pandemics. To date, Ireland has contributed &euro;8.85 million to Education Cannot Wait, and has committed an additional &euro;3 million in 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600084#WRD06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1573"},{"type":"question","counter":173,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[3676\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600085#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the funding provided by his Department to an organisation (details supplied) in 2021;  and the countries or regions to which  this support was directed.","asker":"1523","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":174,"content":"<p>My Department, through the Irish Aid programme, is a strong supporter of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, a global humanitarian network of 80 million people that assists those facing disaster, conflict and health and social emergencies.

The build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine is a matter of great concern. It is important that dialogue be maintained, with the primary goal of de-escalating tensions in the region. In this regard, I welcome the intensive diplomatic efforts which have occurred in recent weeks, aimed at defusing tensions. These include bilateral discussions between the US and Russia, between NATO and Russia, and at the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. As a participating State in the OSCE, Ireland is pleased to express solidarity with Ukraine and seek a peaceful de-escalation of tensions in that forum.<\/p><p>Ireland has repeatedly reaffirmed its support for Ukraine at United Nations Security Council meetings on Ukraine, including at Arria formula meetings. We have also stressed our non-recognition of the illegal annexation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, encouraged full, secure and unimpeded access for the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission, and called for the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements. <\/p><p>EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in Ukraine at the Foreign Affairs Council on 13 December, in Gymnich formation on 13 and 14 January, and again at the Foreign Affairs Council of 24 January. In my own remarks, I have consistently underlined the need for strong and unified messaging from the EU. In remarks after the December Foreign Affairs Council, High Representative Borrell made clear that aggression against Ukraine, will come with political consequences and with a high economic cost for Russia. This has been re-enforced in Foreign Affairs Council Conclusions on 24 January, which state that preparatory work has accelerated on restrictive measures in case of further military aggression by Russia against Ukraine. The Council Conclusions also condemn Russia&rsquo;s continued aggressive actions and threats against Ukraine, and call on Russia to de-escalate.<\/p><p>I and my counterparts at the Foreign Affairs Council have dedicated significant time to the security situation in Ukraine this year, including through engagements with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. I also discussed these matters with Minister Kuleba when I travelled to Kyiv on 23 August to represent Ireland at the International Crimea Platform, a diplomatic initiative by Ukraine to seek a peaceful end to the illegal Russian occupation of the peninsula.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600085#WRE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Election Monitoring Missions","counter":181,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600085#WRE01100"},{"type":"question","counter":182,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[3753\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600085#WRE01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the plans by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe to run a full-scale election observation mission for the forthcoming elections in Serbia with both long and short-term observers; if long-term and short-term observers from Ireland will be provided for such a mission; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1628","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":183,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[3754\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600085#WRE01300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that 20 civil society groups in Hungary have urged the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe to conduct a full-scale election observation for the forthcoming elections in Hungary and that this has been supported by a number of MEPs; if he plans to support the running of such a mission; if he will convey same to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe; if he will support a call from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe to provide long-term and short-term election observers from Ireland for such a mission to Hungary; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1628","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":184,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[3755\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600085#WRE01400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the budget in 2022 for Ireland's election observation programme; if the budget includes provision for the recruitment to a replacement roster in 2022; the number of observers on the current roster; if observers must be tax resident in Ireland; if not, the number of non-tax resident observers on the roster; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1628","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":185,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 to 89, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  I refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Questions No. 120 of 29 January 2019, No. 410 of 24 November 2020, No. 304 of 25 May 2021 and No. 310 of 16 November 2021. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland's current International Election Observation Roster of 197 volunteers, which is facilitated by my Department, is in effect from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2023.

Stage one commenced in January 2021 and focused primarily on the Defence Organisation&rsquo;s partnership with Science Foundation Ireland (SFI). The partnership created the SFI &ndash; Defence Organisation Innovation Challenge which is an innovative programme with the overarching ambition to develop new technologies, aligned with our National Defence Policy and supporting Defence Forces capability requirements, that also have the potential to deliver significant societal impacts within Ireland.  Challenges in five areas plus an open challenge on disruptive technologies, were presented to Irish research institutions.  These proposals were then judged by an international panel of researchers in line with best academic practice.  <\/p>  <p>  The Challenge entered the concept phase in January 2022, where a number of research teams were selected by the international review panel to move forward within the Challenge.  This concept phase will be launched by me and my colleague, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in February 2022.  <\/p>  <p>  The RTI unit is in the process of moving into stage two in its development.  The focus during this stage will be on introducing applied research and development for capability developments, embedding a culture of innovation within the Defence Organisation as well as accessing international funding activities which will deliver long term strategic benefits.  A key focus of the RTI Unit going forward will be to support Irish research institutes and enterprise in securing funding from the European Defence Fund and also accessing the supply chains of major defence research and industry actors in the EU including as members of EU wide consortia.<\/p>  <p>  The Department, through the RTI unit, contributed &euro;250,000 to the SFI &ndash; Defence Organisation Innovation Challenge in 2021.

Schools have a responsibility to provide for this, in consultation with parents, having regard to the ethos of the school. Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is a mandatory curriculum subject in all primary schools and in post-primary junior cycle. Relationships and Sexuality Education (or RSE) is required at all levels, from primary through to senior cycle. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government states that &lsquo;<i>this Government will develop inclusive and age appropriate curricula for Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) and Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) across primary and post-primary schools, including an inclusive programme on LGBTI+ relationships&rsquo;<\/i>.<\/p><p>In April 2018, the then Minister for Education and Skills asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) to undertake a major review of RSE in schools across all stages of education to ensure that it is fit for purpose and meets the needs of young people today in modern Ireland. <\/p><p>The NCCA was asked to look at a number of specific issues in respect of RSE and the curriculum. These included but were not limited to consent; developments in relation to contraception; healthy positive, sexual expression and relationships; safe use of the Internet and social media and its effects on relationships and self-esteem; and LGBTQ+ matters.<\/p><p>The NCCA has established two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in this area and support the development of guidance material for schools. <\/p><p>The immediate focus of the NCCA work has been on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE\/RSE linked to the current curriculum and to provide guidance on how SPE\/RSE may be approached in a comprehensive way that meets the needs of young people today. These resources cover all topics including many of the topics that have been raised in the media during recent days as important for young people's education - there are resources to help teachers in teaching about rights and responsibilities in relationships, how to recognise healthy, unhealthy and abusive relationship, how to interact safely and respectfully (both online and face-to-face), the influence of the media (including pornography) on young people's understanding and expectations, sexual consent and assertive communication.<\/p><p>The NCCA Toolkits will be expanded during 2022 to include further age and stage appropriate guidance for teachers on how to address these and other related topics within the SPHE classroom. The Toolkit provides practical help designed to deepen teachers' understanding and skills so that they feel more confident in addressing important and sensitive topics.<\/p><p>In tandem with this work, preparation for the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum has begun. Updated curricula will be developed for Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle. It is expected that a revised Junior Cycle specification will be completed by the end of 2022, following a period of public consultation. Updated specifications for primary and senior cycle will follow immediately afterwards. <\/p><p>In redeveloping the SPHE curriculum, the NCCA will be making explicit the importance of fostering young people's self-awareness and self-esteem and building the foundational skills and dispositions needed for building caring and healthy relationships (including respectful communication, showing empathy, appreciating difference).

The reduction in the age threshold of the youngest child was implemented on a phased basis during the period 2013 to 2015.

The new plan will be the most ambitious to date and will be structured around the four pillars of Prevention, Protection, Prosecution and Co-ordinated Policies. It will set an overall goal of zero tolerance in Irish society for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. Under the Prevention pillar there will be a number of actions relating to training and awareness raising, both for specific sectors and for society in general. <\/p><p>I can also inform the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate has committed to carrying out a self-initiative inspection into the effectiveness and efficiency of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s response to domestic abuse.

The Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act 1986 no longer applies to the recognition of divorces covered by the Regulation.<\/p>  <p>  Part 19 of the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Act 2020 makes provision for the recognition in Ireland of divorces granted in the United Kingdom or Gibraltar and has been in operation since 11.00 p.m. on 31 December 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Where there is an issue as to whether a foreign divorce is entitled to recognition, section 29 of the Family Law Act 1995 allows a person to apply to court for a declaration as to marital status, including a declaration as to whether a foreign divorce is entitled to recognition in the State. <\/p>  <p>  The Thirty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution (Dissolution of Marriage) Act 2019 was signed into law on 11 June 2019 following its approval by the people in a referendum on 24 May 2019. <\/p>  <p>  That Act deleted the following subsection from Article 41.3 of the Constitution:<\/p>  <p>  &ldquo;3&deg; No person whose marriage has been dissolved under the civil law of any other State but is a subsisting valid marriage under the law for the time being in force within the jurisdiction of the Government and Parliament established by this Constitution shall be capable of contracting a valid marriage within that jurisdiction during the lifetime of the other party to the marriage so dissolved.&rdquo;,<\/p>  <p>  and substituted that subsection with the following:<\/p>  <p>  &ldquo;3&deg; Provision may be made by law for the recognition under the law of the State of a dissolution of marriage granted under the civil law of another state.&rdquo;<\/p>  <p>  The amendment will permit a future change in the law to introduce greater consistency in the recognition of foreign divorces.<\/p>  <p>  The Law Reform Commission, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform, is examining the recognition of foreign divorces. When the expert report of the Law Reform Commission is completed, it will provide valuable guidance for the development of proposals for legislation on the recognition of foreign divorces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600087#WRG03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence","counter":328,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600087#WRG03800"},{"type":"question","counter":329,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[3746\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600087#WRG03900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the steps she is taking to introduce legislation criminalising cyberflashing; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":330,"content":"<p>Flashing is a criminal offence under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017.

The penalty for such a conviction can be an unlimited fine or up to two years imprisonment.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above offences, persistent cyberflashing may amount to harassment within the meaning of section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997, which carries a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600087#WRG04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":332,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[3747\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600087#WRG04200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the steps she is taking to introduce legislation criminalising stalking; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":333,"content":"<p>Before Easter, I will publish a Bill which will include new criminal offences for stalking and for non-fatal strangulation.<\/p><p>The act of stalking itself is already covered by existing law, but I will propose the following changes to make the law clearer and stronger: <\/p><p>- Explicitly reference stalking as a criminal offence <\/p><p>- Make it clear that stalking includes watching or following a victim, even where they are not aware of being watched or followed<\/p><p>- Make it clear that impersonating the victim, and then communicating with a third party, is illegal<\/p><p>- Update the law to ensure that it covers all forms of modern communications.<\/p><p>I will also consider introducing a provision to allow a victim, in very serious cases, apply to the court for an order to prevent the alleged perpetrator from communicating with them in advance of a trial. <\/p><p>In respect of creating a new criminal offence for non-fatal strangulation, while choking and strangling are already illegal, creating this new offence should encourage victims to come forward and report what has happened to them.<\/p><p>It has been shown that this crime can be an indication of future, lethal violence and is a risk factor for homicides against women in the home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600087#WRG04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rights of Way","counter":334,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600087#WRG04400"},{"type":"question","counter":335,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[3772\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600087#WRG04500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she has plans to or will consider amending the legislation in relation to right of way matters and trespassing laws similar to the scenario raised by a person (details supplied; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":336,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, following strong concerns expressed by stakeholders, I recently brought to enactment an important reform of the law relating to prescriptive easements, the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2021.

It is likely that demand for testing for public health purposes will remain high in the coming period, particularly given the very high current infection rates in the community and the impacts arising in relation to Omicron.<\/p><p>In addition to running a very comprehensive community PCR testing programme, a number of serial testing PCR programmes, and PCR testing in acute hospital services, the HSE, under the guidance and direction of NPHET and the Department of Health operates a number of programmes involving supply of antigen tests, free of charge, to participants. The HSE focus is on supporting programmes with a clearly defined public health purpose. These programmes involve supply of antigen tests, free of charge, to all symptomatic persons aged from 4 to 39; to close contacts, of all ages, of confirmed cases; supporting the Department of Education in supplying antigen tests to children in primary schools as part of a pod in which there was a confirmed case of COVID-19; supporting the Department of Agriculture in the antigen testing programme in food processing facilities and for use for specific indications in the acute hospital setting, and as part of the response to outbreaks in community settings, supported by appropriate clinical governance and operational arrangements. While the focus remains on supporting those programmes with a clearly defined public health purpose, the HSE is also required to prioritise the available stock, supply chain and operational capacity in supporting these ongoing programmes and on continuing the national testing programme for public health reasons.<\/p><p>More widely, the Government&rsquo;s objective has been to ensure the widespread availability of antigen tests, that are CE marked for self-testing, at an affordable price level, for those people who wish to purchase their own. Following engagement by relevant Government Departments with leading retailers and wholesalers, there is increased competition in the market and the retail price of many of the available antigen tests for consumers are more affordable.

Given that there are legal proceedings ongoing I do not wish to comment unduly on these cases. <\/p>  <p>  The delegation of mesh claims to the State Claims Agency (SCA) is a technical matter that will not impact on how these claims are handled. The SCA has a statutory remit to manage personal injury claims on behalf of Delegated State Authorities including the Health Service Executive. The Clinical Indemnity Scheme (CIS) indemnifies hospitals (HSE and Voluntaries) in respect of clinical negligence actions against those hospitals by persons alleging personal injuries resulting from such negligence. CIS cover is confined to clinical acts and\/or omissions and does not cover product liability exposures, i.e., where the personal injury is alleged to have occurred as a result of a product not being fit for purpose etc.<\/p>  <p>  The Transvaginal Mesh litigation, currently being handled by the Agency, involves allegations in relation to the product itself (the mesh, tape etc.) and allegations of clinical negligence i.e., practitioner error\/faulty surgical technique. The CIS indemnifies the hospital in respect of alleged practitioner error, but it does not indemnify the hospital in respect of any product liability exposure that the hospital might have i.e., allegations that the product failed or was not fit for purpose.<\/p>  <p>  The State Claims Agency manages general indemnity claims, in named State authorities, as provided for in Delegation Orders under the National Treasury Management Act, under a Scheme known as the General Indemnity Scheme (GIS). Delegating the management of claims to the SCA ensures the efficient and effective management of claims and removes duplication of effort and legal costs where multiple State Authorities are defending a claim. Such claims relate to personal injuries, including bullying and harassment and third-party property damage claims, and their associated risks, against State authorities. Mass action claims and claims relating to product liability, where the latter have been specifically delegated to the SCA, are also dealt with under the GIS. <\/p>  <p>  An indemnity issue has arisen in some hospitals and in a minority of &lsquo;Mesh&rsquo; claims where the product manufacturer cannot be identified due to the relevant hospital charts not containing device\/product labels. The Liability for Defective Products Act, 1991 states that where the manufacturer\/producer of the product cannot be identified by taking reasonable steps, the supplier of the product (in this case, the hospital) is at risk of being found to be the producer of the product. Put simply, this means that the hospital could potentially be responsible for the product liability aspect of the &ldquo;mesh&rdquo; claim. As hospitals do not carry product liability cover, these hospitals could have an uninsured\/un-indemnified liability exposure in the circumstances described above. Such a situation would benefit neither the hospital nor the claimant, and so I have acted to ensure that it does not arise. <\/p>  <p>  In order to ensure that hospitals are not exposed to an uninsured liability and the financial exposure consequent upon that, Government agreed to the provision of general indemnity cover for the product liability elements of claims and the delegation of their management to the SCA, in a minority of cases where the manufacturer cannot be identified. This decision does not change the practical position with regard to the HSE - the SCA have been managing these claims to date, on behalf of the HSE on an administrative basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600088#WRH05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":403,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[3707\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600088#WRH05500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the additional actions he plans to take to provide redress for mesh-injured persons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1615","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":404,"content":"<p>I understand that complications from a mesh implant can be very distressing and painful for the women experiencing them.

The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.<\/p><p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.<\/p><p>  In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.<\/p><p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.<\/p><p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.<\/p><p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.<\/p><p>My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.<\/p><p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020\/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration. This applies to everyone whether or not they have a medical card\/GP visit card, as it is outside of the HPV immunisation programme.<\/p><p>  I have asked my officials to request the National Immunisation Advisory Committee consider the clinical effectiveness of providing the HPV vaccine to:<\/p><p>- girls and boys in secondary school who were eligible to receive HPV vaccine in 1st year but who did not receive it; and<\/p><p>- women up to the age of 25 years who have left secondary school and who did not receive the vaccine when eligible.<\/p><p>  If NIAC concluded that there is sufficient evidence to support providing the HPV vaccine to one or both groups, HIQA will undertake a cost-effectiveness assessment on that basis.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600089#WRJ02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":439,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600089#WRJ02900"},{"type":"question","counter":440,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[3780\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600089#WRJ03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress made to date in relation to the Programme for Government commitment to ensure that mental health services are accessible to persons in the deaf community; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1559","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":441,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600089#WRJ03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Citizens' Assembly","counter":442,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600089#WRJ03200"},{"type":"question","counter":443,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[3792\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600089#WRJ03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he expects the citizens&rsquo; assembly on drugs to convene; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":444,"content":"<p>Consideration is being given to the appropriate methodology for future citizens' assemblies, including one on drugs use. Decisions will be guided by the experience of the Gender Equality Assembly which completed earlier this year.  An independent researcher was appointed by the Assembly to monitor and record, amongst other things, the perceived deliberative quality of the Assembly.  This report, published in July 2021, will assist in decisions on future Assemblies use of virtual meetings.<\/p><p>By their very nature, citizens assemblies require large gatherings to be truly effective. Therefore, there has been an unavoidable delay in the establishment of the next citizens' assembly due to public health restrictions arising from the Covid-19 pandemic. <\/p><p>The Department of Health continues to liaise with the Department of the Taoiseach on the timing and format of the proposed citizen assembly on drug use. It is envisaged that the remaining citizen assembly, including the citizen assembly on drug use, will be established after the Dublin mayor citizens' assembly has completed its work. The specific timing of each assembly has yet to be confirmed.<\/p><p>The Department of Health's approach to the citizen assembly on drugs use will be informed by the Government's health-led approach to people who use drugs, as outlined in the national drugs strategy. An important component of the health-led approach is the Health Diversion Programme. The Health Diversion Programme offers compassion, not punishment, to people who use drugs and connects them with health services and provides a pathway to recovery, thereby avoiding a criminal conviction. As outlined in the Programme for Government, the programme will be reviewed after the first full year of implementation to ensure that it is meeting all of it aims and to make any necessary changes. This review could usefully inform the deliberations of the citizen's assembly on drug use. <\/p><p>A strategic priority for the implementation of the national drugs strategy for 2021-2025 is to promote alternatives to coercive sanctions for drug-related offences. This will include the exchange of best practice with EU member states, as part of the<b><\/b>EU Drugs Strategy 2021 &ndash; 2025.<\/p><p>I believe that a citizen's assembly could usefully consider the learnings from the health diversion  programme and other similar alternatives to coercive sanctions.

I would expect a decision to issue in the  two to three months, but this depends on the assessment of the submissions received and on there being nothing further outstanding.<\/p>  <p>  The FAC is operationally independent of my Department and issues its own decisions on forestry licence appeals when the appeal is discharged.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600092#WRM00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes","counter":597,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600092#WRM00600"},{"type":"question","counter":598,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[3844\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022012600092#WRM00700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason for the delay in issuing a GLAS application (details supplied); when payment will issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":599,"content":"<p>The person named was approved to GLAS 2 with a contract commencement date of 1<sup>st<\/sup>January 2016.<\/p><p>Processing of the 2021 advance payment in respect of the application of the person named is at an advanced stage.
