As the deputy is no doubt aware broadband capacity can vary across geographical locations and is dependent on\u00a0local infrastructure\u00a0which can  impact on the service that can be provided in individual schools. <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0school referred to by the Deputy voluntarily withdrew from the Schools Broadband Programme, which is provided and managed by my Department, during the summer 2018 and entered into their own contract with a service provider. As this service is provided outside the Schools Broadband Programme, my Department has no role and therefore the school will have to continue to engage directly with their provider to resolve any issues with service.<\/p>  <p>  The Schools Broadband Programme is open to all recognised primary schools as such should\u00a0this school decide to\u00a0re-join the scheme then the school should make contact with officers of my Department who can arrange for the\u00a0school to be included in\u00a0the next Broadband mini competition run by the Department. If this is what they wish to do, the school should make contact with the Broadband Service desk team at broadbandservicedesk@pdst.ie who will begin the process of including the school in the programme. <\/p>  <p>  The Department reviews the availability and quality of services and upgrades schools when the opportunity arises, in line with contractual and budgetary requirements. Currently,\u00a0over 1,100 primary schools have been awarded download speeds of 30Mbps or greater (the baseline download speed required under the National Broadband Plan). This represents more than\u00a0one third of all primary schools which is a\u00a0significant improvement in recent years, given that less than 100 primary schools were on those speeds in 2012. Further schools\u00a0are likely to be upgraded to those speeds\u00a0in 2018, through EIR's 300K Rural Deployment commitment. <\/p>  <p>  All post-primary schools and some special schools\u00a0are now on high speed broadband through the Department's\u00a0High\u00a0Speed Broadband\u00a0Programme, managed by HEAnet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800076#WRA04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education Welfare Service","counter":46,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800076#WRA04500"},{"type":"question","counter":47,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[49510\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800076#WRA04600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his views on whether the use of reduced timetables may leave the State open to legal challenges; his plans to address the underlying issues which lead to the use of reduced timetables; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":48,"content":"<p>The position of my Department is that all pupils who are enrolled in a school should attend school for the full day, unless exempted from doing so for exceptional circumstances, such as medical reasons.<\/p><p>Reduced timetables should not be used as a behavioual management technique, or as a de facto suspension or expulsion. <\/p><p>Where schools apply a shorter school day in relation to a child, such arrangements should only be put in place in exceptional circumstances in order to assist a pupil to return to a school, where a pupil has been experiencing an absence due to a medical or behavioural related condition. <\/p><p>Any such arrangement should be a transitionary arrangement, which is designed to assist the reintegration of a pupil to a school environment.<\/p><p>In making any such arrangements, school authorities should be mindful of the best interests of the child and of the child's right to a full day in school.

The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million.

It is open to schools to be innovative in how they implement this and many schools are already using mindfulness programmes and accessing training through the Education Centre&rsquo;s Network and other sources. Circulars 42\/2018 and 43\/2018 issued advising schools on the appropriate use of wellbeing programmes.<\/p>  <p>  A Wellbeing Policy Implementation Plan is included in the Wellbeing Policy Statement.

Following this, a gap analysis will be completed with recommendations identified for the implementation of priority actions to ensure clear pathways to support and resources are made available to all schools and centres for education.<\/p>  <p>  Mindfulness is a skill that can usefully be taught to young people as part of the SPHE curriculum. The use of mindfulness in education has a lot in common with and can complement the SPHE curriculum which aims to teach children about managing emotions and developing relationships etc. Mindfulness practice is likely to be a useful tool to support SPHE implementation but is unlikely to replace it.

Schools should seek the advice of the National Educational Psychology Service before implementing such arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 requires a school principal to inform an educational welfare officer in writing where a student is suspended from a recognised school for a period of not less than 6 days. The school is also obliged to record and maintain attendance records and to report to Tusla, unauthorised non-attendance above the threshold of 20 days, or where the school principal is of the opinion that a student is not attending school regularly.

Any exclusion imposed by a school is a suspension, and should follow the guidelines relating to a suspension&rdquo;. <\/p>  <p>  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 makes provision for a parent to take an appeal against a school in relation to suspension of a student.

The enrolment policy must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.<\/p>  <p>  My\u00a0Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in the area.

However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.

However, this concession is proving to be extremely problematic. <\/p>  <p>  Elements of the food supplement industry has made a sustained challenge to the application of the standard rate of VAT to a range of food supplements.  There are concerns that while elements of the industry apply the correct rates, others have a competitive advantage by applying the zero rate to products that are properly liable at the 23% VAT rate.

Among the key conclusions contained in the Tutty report is that clarification should be obtained on the precise legal status of PCPs and that relevant provisions of the Central Bank Consumer Protection Code, in particular the requirement to check the financial capacity of consumers, should apply to such financial agreements.

Accordingly, I have asked my Department to liaise closely with the Central Bank, the Attorney General's Office and the CCPC with a view to implementing the report's conclusions, and this process has now commenced.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800079#WRD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector","counter":237,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800079#WRD02300"},{"type":"question","counter":238,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[49741\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800079#WRD02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the progress that has been made in establishing a banking culture board; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":239,"content":"<p>As I have stated previously and to clarify for the Deputy, the Irish Banking Culture Board is a private initiative from the banking industry in Ireland aimed at rebuilding trust and confidence in the industry following the tracker mortgage scandal, and as such it is not within the remit of my Department nor the Central Bank as regulator. <\/p>  <p>  It is intended that the Irish Banking Culture Board will be an independently led entity to ensure that the industry is focused on the best interests of the customer and leads to a sustainable banking industry that promotes the highest standards of behaviour and professionalism.<\/p>  <p>  I have been informed by representatives of the five main lenders that over the next 12 months, the search for an independent Chairperson will be concluded, the wider Board will be appointed, and there will be an initial culture survey and a stakeholder consultation process. <\/p>  <p>  The initiative does not seek to replace or diminish existing regulation and will be run out of a separate entity to the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI) and the banks.

It is a statutory Code which provides a strong consumer protection framework, aimed specifically at the process to be followed by relevant firms, to ensure borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears in respect of a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner.  Banks, retail credit firms and credit servicing firms are all required to comply with the CCMA.  <\/p><p>The overriding objective of the CCMA is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of consumers in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears, and that due regard is given to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits.  The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and regulated firms to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow.  <\/p><p>The CCMA sets out the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process, (MARP), a four-step process that regulated entities must follow:  <\/p><p><b>Step 1:<\/b>Communicate with borrower;<\/p><p><b>Step 2:<\/b>Gather financial information;<\/p><p><b>Step 3:<\/b>Assess the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances; and<\/p><p><b>Step 4:<\/b>Propose a resolution<\/p><p>Each regulated entity must consider the borrower&rsquo;s situation in the context of the solutions they provide, which may differ from firm to firm.  The CCMA does not prescribe the solution which must be offered.At the end of the MARP process, regulated entities are required to provide a three-month notice period to allow co-operating borrowers time to consider their options, such as voluntary surrender or an arrangement under the Personal Solvency Act, before legal action can commence.  The CCMA includes requirements that arrangements be sustainable and based on a full assessment of the individual circumstances of the borrower and that repossession be used only as a last resort.  <\/p><p>Under the CCMA, a regulated entity may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where it has made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment arrangement (ARA) with the borrowers and other clear requirements are met or the borrower has been classified as not co-operating.<\/p><p>This framework requires lenders to exhaust the options available from the suite of ARAs offered before taking action which may result in the borrower losing his\/her home (whether by voluntary sale or repossession).  <\/p><p>Sections 49 to 55 of the CCMA sets out the appeals process available to borrowers which includes the establishment of an Appeals Board by every lender to consider and determine appeals made by borrowers in relation to decisions made by lenders.<\/p><p>Finally, I published the Central Bank's review of the CCMA earlier this month and the key finding of the Report is that for borrowers who engage with the process, the CCMA is working effectively and as intended in the context of the sale of loans by regulated lenders.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800079#WRD05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":267,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800079#WRD05500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Allowances","counter":266,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800079#WRD05400"},{"type":"question","counter":267,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[49807\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800079#WRD05500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of injury warrants issued historically by his Department for members of the Irish Prison Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":268,"content":"<p>The Civil Service Injury Warrants are a series of statutory instruments made under the Superannuation Acts.

NEPS also has a particular focus on supporting schools to promote the wellbeing of all children and young people. The scope of the NEPS service is broad and requires NEPS to work in a cross-cutting, collaborative manner with different sections of the DES and its agencies, and with service providers external to the DES. <\/p>  <p>  My Department, through the Special Education Teacher Model, has set out the Continuum of Support framework to assist schools in identifying and responding to the diverse needs of all learners.  This framework recognises that special educational needs occur along a continuum, ranging from mild to severe, and from transient to enduring, and that students require different levels of support depending on their identified educational needs.  The Continuum of Support enables schools to identify and respond to needs in a flexible way. This means that needs can be responded to as early as possible.  My Department supports schools to implement a continuum of support through the deployment and front-loading of some 13,350 special education teachers, including 9255 allocated to primary schools, and 4130 allocated to post primary schools.  Additionally, a total of 15,000 Special Needs Assistants are also available to allocate to schools.  This overall framework of support ensures that all children access an appropriate level of support in school, with students with the greatest level of need having access to the greatest levels of support.  My Department further supports schools to provide a continuum of support for all learners, through the provision of support services, including an educational psychological service, NEPS.  <\/p>  <p>  NEPS does not maintain waiting lists, but instead, provides a consultative, tiered model of service to schools, underpinning schools&rsquo; provision of a continuum of support.  This model of service is in line with international best practice for the effective and efficient delivery of educational psychological services that best meet the needs of all pupils\/students in schools.  It allows NEPS psychologists to support schools to provide an effective continuum of support.  At a whole-school level the focus of NEPS is on promoting inclusive practice in schools, ensuring appropriate support structures are in place and building capacity to provide universal, evidence-based approaches and early intervention to promote academic and social\/emotional competence and well-being for all.  This includes the provision of training in the Incredible Years Teacher programme, the Friends programmes and support for schools in the event of a critical incident. This is a crucial element of the support that NEPS provides, leading to increased capacity within the system to provide high-quality early intervention and prevention in an effective manner.  <\/p>  <p>  Schools are encouraged to engage in initial assessment, educational planning and intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties, documented in a Student Support file.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts, in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become directly involved with an individual child for more intensive support (casework).  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  <\/p>  <p>  The measure of NEPS output ranges across all aspect of the service as described above. For example in the last academic year NEPS psychologists undertook direct casework with 8,288 pupils\/students, and it is estimated that a further 25,100 teachers were supported by NEPS via consultation or training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800079#WRD06800","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Educational Psychological Service Data","counter":281,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800079#WRD06900"},{"type":"question","counter":282,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[49606\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800079#WRD07000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of schools which have requested an intervention from a NEPS practitioner in the event of a critical incident in the 2017-2018 term; the number of incidents at which a NEPS practitioner did not act; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1225","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":283,"content":"<p>By way of background I might inform you that my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides guidelines and resource materials for schools to enable them to deal with certain traumatic events which can adversely affect pupils and school staff. This publication 'Responding to Critical Incidents: NEPS Guidelines and Resource Materials for Schools' also outlines how schools can plan for crises. The guidelines refer to preventive approaches that schools can adopt in creating a safe and supportive environment. <\/p><p>The publication provides practical step-by-step guidelines for teachers and principals on how to respond when a tragedy occurs. It offers support to schools at a potentially overwhelming time. <\/p><p>The guidelines focus upon alerting schools to planning processes, structures and actions which will better allow them to cope with a traumatic incidents such as suicide or suspected suicide, murder, accidental death including road traffic accidents and drowning, and death through illness of members of the school community. In relation to suicide, advice is also given on prevention and positive mental health stratagems and approaches. <\/p><p>The Guidelines are kept under constant review and a third edition was circulated by NEPS to schools in 2016. Training in critical incident planning is part of the service provided by NEPS to schools and is a focus of my Department&rsquo;s Action Plan for Education 2016-19 for post-primary schools.<\/p><p>NEPS psychologists will also, at the specific invitation of school authorities, attend at schools immediately following such incidents to offer direct advice and assistance to school staff in managing the situation. <\/p><p>In relation to the Deputy's specific questions in this regard, critical incidents are by their nature situations so named by schools themselves &ndash; traumatic events which have the potential to overwhelm the normal operation of the school.  Depending upon the nature, severity or context of an event, schools may telephone NEPS for advice and support as to how they should proceed in relation to a particular event.  In many situations this advice and support is adequate to equip schools to respond appropriately, without further support required from NEPS.  In other situations, as is set out above, school authorities may request the attendance of NEPS psychologists on-site to provide support, advice and assistance in the delivery of the response. Therefore, in answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific quest, all critical incidents notified to NEPS are acted upon as appropriate to the context and the wishes of school authorities.<\/p><p>For data purposes NEPS records critical incidents at three response levels:<\/p><p><b>Level 1<\/b>- an incident which involves a telephone response to the school but where no on-site presence of NEPS staff is requested, <\/p><p><b>Level 2<\/b>&ndash; where the school, in their contact with NEPS, request the presence of NEPS personnel on-site to advise and assist,<\/p><p><b>Level 3<\/b>&ndash; events which have NEPS personnel on-site but are of a magnitude that involves a broader community response from other support services such as the HSE.<\/p><p>NEPS records show that some <b>328<\/b>critical incidents were registered in 2017\/18, many of which relate to events in single schools, but some of which impacted on more than one school.

This is in addition to separate funding that has been provided for pay deals and pensions, amounting to an additional &euro;41million in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  This new current funding will be used to fund the following measures: <\/p>  <p>  - provision for 3,500 additional places in our higher education institutions this is in addition to the 2,100 places provided in 2018<\/p>  <p>  - initiatives to support innovation and reward excellence<\/p>  <p>  - investment in teaching and learning capacity, and management and leadership<\/p>  <p>  - 1,000 additional places on Springboard+, <\/p>  <p>  - a new research fund for Institutes of Technology\/TUs, and <\/p>  <p>  - an expansion of part-time and flexible learning opportunities. <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2019 also announced a new Human Capital Initiative that will involve investment of &euro;300 million in higher education over the 5 year period from 2020 to 2024, with &euro;60m being made available in each of those years. This investment will be funded by the National Training Fund surplus.  A major objective of the Initiative is to incentivise continued reform and innovation drawing on international best practice through such mechanisms as graduate conversion, accelerated course completion, flexible and blended learning, intensified focus on employability and strengthened linkages and relationships with enterprise.  It represents a significant response to projected demographic pressures impacting on the HE sector over the next five years, as highlighted in the Expert Group Report on Future Funding.<\/p>  <p>  The National Training Fund is being reformed to make it more labour market focused, responsive to skills needs and providing additional investment in Further and Higher Education.

This reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p><p>Schools therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours may have been provided under the old model, or for pupils who have received a new diagnosis, as schools now receive a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile. <\/p><p>The number of special education teachers allocated to mainstream schools has increased by 13% in the last two years, with 13,400 posts available for allocation in the current school year, compared to just over 11,800 posts allocated in the 2015\/16 school year.<\/p><p>I am satisfied that the very significant levels of additional provision we have made in recent years, to provide for extra SNAs and Special Education Teachers, means that all schools, including schools in County Kildare, are sufficiently resourced to provide for the special educational needs and care needs of children in their schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800080#WRE05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":341,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800080#WRE05600"},{"type":"question","counter":342,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[49827\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800080#WRE05700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the progress of a project (details supplied); if this is likely to be completed on time in line with expectations and requirements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":343,"content":"<p>The project to which the Deputy refers has been devolved to the local Education and Training Board for delivery.

Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda Resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently undertaking a programme of accelerated recruitment, as part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a strengthened service through the Five Year High Level Reform and Workforce Plan to achieve an overall workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 Garda members. To support the Commissioner in this recruitment, I have also secured funding in Budget 2019 which facilitates the recruitment of up to 800 more Garda&iacute; next year.  The Budget also provides for the necessary civilian Garda staff to fill critical skills gaps and enable the further redeployment of Garda&iacute; to front line duties.<\/p><p>The Garda strength by Station and Rank for Mountjoy, Cabra and Santry Garda stations in each of the years 2009 to 31 October 2018 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website through the link:<\/p><p>For more general information on Garda Facts and Figures please see following link:<\/p><p><i>.<\/i><\/p><p>For the Deputy&rsquo;s information I have set out below in tabular form the number of Garda vehicles assigned to Fitzgibbon Street, Blanchardstown and Ballymun Garda Districts (the relevant districts for the stations in question) and the number of bicycles assigned to Mountjoy, Cabra and Santry Garda Stations, as of 23 November 2018, the latest date for which figures are currently available.<\/p><p><b>Mountjoy <\/b>&ndash;

Garda resources are deployed to areas designated as &ldquo;hot-spots&rdquo; and Garda&iacute; work with communities to tackle and reduce these crimes with a strong focus on collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour. I would, however, point to the need for parents to also ensure, to the best of their ability, that their children are respectful and law abiding.<\/p><p>The deployment of Garda personnel is continually monitored and reviewed in the context of crime trends and policing priorities to ensure optimum use of Garda resources. A dynamic distribution model of resource allocation, known as the Cohort model, has been in use by Garda management since 2015 for the allocation of personnel, including newly attested probationer Garda&iacute; from the Garda College. It takes into account all relevant factors and aims to impose a numerical measure on the policing needs of each Division. However, ratios such as the number of Garda&iacute; per head of population are not an appropriate tool to use as it fails to take account of the fact that crime levels and types can vary significantly amongst communities of similar population size. <\/p><p>With the moratorium on recruitment and the closure of the training college Garda numbers fell significantly.

The information provided in the table is on a Regional rather than a Divisional basis, as was sought.  This is due to the need to ensure that the anonymity of persons making reports is protected.  In dealing with any complaint of drug related intimidation, or advice sought in relation to this issue, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na do so with the utmost regard to the safety and the most effective means of affording the person or family subject to the threat, the best level of security, advice and support.

While liaison within and between Regional and Local Management teams takes place on an ongoing basis, such seminars provide an appropriate platform and opportunity to bring relevant personnel together for focused sessions, which in turn informs the Reporting Programme.  <\/p><p>With regard to the recent criminal activity in Drogheda, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has put in place a policing operation to prevent, detect and mitigate against any further escalation of violence between the groups involved. This includes high visibility patrols, supplemented by personnel from the Regional Armed Support Unit; Community Policing Units; District Detective and Drug Units and the Divisional Roads Policing Unit.<\/p><p>The Garda authorities have advised that every effort will continue to be made to disrupt the activities of these groups, to arrest and prosecute offenders and to deny access to the road networks for those involved. Liaison is ongoing with relevant stakeholders, including the Local Authorities, Tusla  and the HSE.<\/p><p>I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to update, promote and advise all members and Regional Management and their teams in relation to the Reporting Programme.  This is done through the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  All local issues are addressed with local management teams where necessary, mainly through the support of the nominated Inspector for that particular area. <\/p><p>Information in relation to the Reporting Programme and a list of the nominated Inspectors countrywide, including for Co.

The role of the Independent Adjudicator is:<\/p>  <p>  (a) to ensure that complaints about the conduct of a solicitor are dealt with fairly and impartially by the Law Society;<\/p>  <p>  (b) to review complaints about any decision by the Law Society concerning an application for a grant from the Law Society&rsquo;s Compensation Fund; <\/p>  <p>  (c) to recommend any changes in the Law Society&rsquo;s complaints procedures which are, in the Independent Adjudicator&rsquo;s view, necessary to maintain the highest standards.<\/p>  <p>  The holder of the Office cannot be a practising solicitor, a member of the Law Society or a practising barrister and shall be independent in the exercise of his or her functions. The Office of the Independent Adjudicator has been providing its services since 1997 having been established by Statutory Instrument No.406 of 1997 &ndash; Solicitors (Adjudicator) Regulations, 1997, as augmented by Statutory Instrument No.720 of 2005 &ndash; Solicitors (Adjudicator) (Amendment) Regulations, 2005.  At the same time, it is important to note that the Adjudicator&rsquo;s role is to investigate the handling of the complaint by the Law Society and not to investigate the substance of the complaint itself. <\/p>  <p>  The Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal deals with complaints of serious misconduct and such complaints are either referred to it by the Law Society or made directly to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal by members of the public. The Tribunal members are appointed by the President of the High Court and act independently of the Law Society. I would point out that, subject to the relevant provisions of the Solicitors' Acts, it is open to any person who has made a complaint to the Solicitors' Disciplinary Tribunal to make an appeal to the High Court where the Tribunal has not made a finding of misconduct in respect of the solicitor against whom that complaint has been made.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the remedies available under the statutory complaints handling framework that I have just outlined, it is important to be aware that aggrieved clients of solicitors may also choose to seek redress through the courts. This typically arises in cases of alleged negligence on the part of a solicitor which have had serious negative consequences for the client concerned. As with any court proceedings, it is considered prudent that persons considering taking such legal action seek independent legal advice on the strength or otherwise of their case, any limitations that may apply in relation to the passing of time and its possible legal costs implications. It will then be a matter for the aggrieved client concerned to decide which course of action might be best suited to the circumstances of their particular case. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also wish to be aware that, under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, a new regulatory framework is about to be introduced to deal with complaints about professional misconduct independent of the legal professional bodies along with a new Legal Practitioners&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal that will deal with allegations of serious misconduct by both solicitors and barristers. Members of the public who wish to make complaints will, therefore, no longer do so through the Law Society or the Bar of Ireland as they do at present, but through the new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority which was established on 1 October 2016. Under the Authority's Strategic Plan 2018-2020 these new measures, for which extensive preparations are being made, are due to come into operation in Quarter 2 of 2019. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800081#WRF03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Applications","counter":390,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800081#WRF03300"},{"type":"question","counter":391,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[49797\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800081#WRF03400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he is satisfied with the turnaround time on visa decisions; and if his attention has been drawn to the anxiety and stress the prolonged waiting times are having on applicants.","asker":"1291","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":392,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that decisions regarding the grant or refusal of visas are made in a number of INIS Visa Offices overseas, the INIS Visa Office in Dublin, and at Embassies of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which process certain visa applications under delegated sanction from my Department. <\/p><p>The processing times for visa decisions are published on the Visa pages of each Visa Office and Embassy website.

Not withstanding, processing times are on a par with, and in many cases have been significantly improved upon, those of the same time last year.<\/p><p>The processing time at each office and location worldwide is determined by a number of factors, such as the volumes and complexity of applications, whether investigation is required or not, individual circumstances, peak application periods (now coming off the busiest time of the year for visa applications generally), seasonal factors, and the resources available.  While every effort is made to process applications as quickly as possible, processing times inevitably vary as a result.  <\/p><p>In relation to applications under the Free Movement Directive (2004\/38\/EC), there had been an exponential increase from the second quarter of 2015 in the number of such applications.  That gave rise to a caseload of around 10,500 applications which had to be assessed very carefully to ensure that any fraudulent applications or potential abuses of the Directive were detected and dealt with appropriately. Considerable progress has been made in that regard with the majority of these applications now processed. <\/p><p>The central concern in deciding on visa applications, as with all visa services worldwide, is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime while at the same time facilitating travel for those who meet the criteria.  Each visa application is therefore decided on its own merits taking all factors into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800081#WRF03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service Administration","counter":393,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800081#WRF03600"},{"type":"question","counter":394,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[49798\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800081#WRF03700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the way in which he will address the difficulties with the online appointment system for both registrations and visas faced by clients of the service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":395,"content":"<p>As outlined in responses to previous parliamentary questions, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department became aware in September of customers  experiencing difficulties booking registration appointments.

This Plan includes a series of practical actions to support enterprise growth and job creation in the region, with clear timelines for delivery. <\/p>  <p>  In the past few months alone, we&rsquo;ve had hugely positive announcements in the Border Region both from indigenous and foreign owned companies including 80 jobs at Crust and Crumb in Cavan, 100 Jobs at Entekra in Monaghan, 400 jobs at WuXi Dundalk and 200 jobs at Combilift in Monaghan.

The unemployment rate in the Border Region at Q3 2018 stands at 5.1 percent, down from 8.6 percent in Q1 2015.

These occupations lists are reviewed twice yearly to keep pace with rapid labour market changes and to be proactively identifying and addressing shortages as they arise.  My Department has commenced the Quarter 4 2018 review of the lists of occupations for employment permits with a public call for submissions from stakeholders and interest groups requesting changes to the lists. The closing date for receipt of submissions was Friday 2nd November 2018. Submissions have been received in respect of a range of occupations including the construction sector, and those submissions are now being examined.<\/p>  <p>  In light of the changing economy and as we continue towards near full employment, it is imperative that the employment permits system is correctly oriented to meet the State&rsquo;s labour market needs.  To that end, I recently published a report reviewing the economic migration policies underpinning the current employment permits system to ensure our policies are fully supportive of Ireland&rsquo;s labour market needs, be they skills or labour shortages in certain sectors.  The report confirms that our employment permits system is largely robust with some adjustment required to ensure continued responsiveness, setting out recommendations to be addressed over the short, medium and long term that will ensure that our employment permits system will play its part in supporting Ireland's labour market needs.  <\/p>  <p>  In order to have an occupation considered for addition to the HSEOL, or removed from the ICEL, there would need to be a clear demonstration of current recruitment difficulties and shortages across the EEA and that difficulties are not as a result of other factors such as salary, employment conditions or lack of upskilling opportunities.  Organisations in the sector would need to provide the necessary data to substantiate their claims.  A detailed evidence-based case requesting the additional of an occupation to the highly skilled list would then need to be put forward by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government as the lead Department for the sector, to my Department for review and consideration. <\/p>  <p>  Minister Humphreys met with the CIF Representatives recently to discuss the labour and skills challenges in the sector and engagement is ongoing with her officials.

The Act of 2017 covers the open disclosure of all patient safety incidents, unintended and unanticipated, including near misses. It provides provisions to create a safe space for staff to be open and transparent with patients in order that they would be given as much information as possible, as early as possible, including an apology where appropriate. The Commencement of Part 4 of the Act and the Civil Liability (Open Disclosure) (Prescribed Statements) Regulations 2018, came into effect on 23<sup>rd<\/sup>September 2018. <\/p><p>During the Report Stage debate of these provisions, I also committed to examining how legislation could be expedited to provide for mandatory open disclosure to patients of serious incidents.<\/p><p><b>Patient Safety Bill <\/b><\/p><p>The general scheme for the Patient Safety Bill provides the legislative framework for a number of important patient safety issues, including: mandatory open disclosure of serious patient safety incidents and the notification of same, clinical audit guidance against explicit clinical standards on a national basis and the extension of the Health Information Quality Authority remit to private hospitals. <\/p><p>The General Scheme of the Patient Safety Bill is intended to provide clarity and assurance regarding the requirement for open disclosure to patients and or their family with regard to serious patient safety incidents, the management of the incident itself and the need to ensure the dissemination of any learning from the review of the incident across the whole health system. This is further facilitated by the requirement for mandatory external reporting of those same incidents by health service providers to the appropriate regulatory authority and the State Claims Agency. The general scheme of the Patient Safety Bill underwent pre-legislative scrutiny at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health on the 26 September 2018 and is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Council.<\/p><p><b>Patient Safety Licensing Bill<\/b><\/p><p>In addition to the legislation described above, my Department is also progressing a Patient Safety Licensing Bill.

It will also be a requirement to hold a licence in order to carry out certain high-risk activities outside of a hospital setting, which will be designated by the Minister for Health.  HIQA will be the licensing authority.<\/p><p>Once enacted, those entities in possession of a licence will have to operate in accordance with Ministerial regulations, so that there will be assurance that appropriate standards of clinical governance are being adhered to. This will also include a requirement to engage in open disclosure, as required.  <\/p><p><b>Establishment of a Surveillance System<\/b><\/p><p>Research of patient safety frameworks in place internationally has been undertaken and the outputs of this are being evaluated for their applicability or relevancy to the Irish healthcare context.  This research will inform the scoping work for the development of a national patient safety surveillance system. This patient safety surveillance system will build upon work already undertaken through the National Healthcare Quality Reporting System, the National Patient Experience Survey, Maternity Patient Safety Statements and Hospital Patient Safety Indicator Reports. <\/p><p><b>Clinical Effectiveness measures  <\/b><\/p><p>The National Clinical Effectiveness Committee, the NCEC, also continues to lead an ambitious work programme. This year saw the publication of National Clinical Guidelines for the Management of Type 1 Diabetes and the early warning system for the Emergency Department that focuses on clinical deterioration of patients. There are now eighteen NCEC National Clinical Guidelines in the suite providing evidence-based guidance to clinical staff across the health service. In addition, the NCEC has published 2 guidance documents and tool-kits; one on public involvement in clinical effectiveness and another on implementation of clinical guidelines. Aligning levers of policy and implementation help create a more integrated and evidence based approach to patient safety. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800082#WRG03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Reform","counter":463,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800082#WRG03200"},{"type":"question","counter":464,"qnumday":199,"qnumall":"[49681\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800082#WRG03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the Sl&aacute;intecare executives task force will be appointed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1436","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":465,"content":"<p>The Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Office is currently in the process of compiling a detailed action plan for 2019.

The purpose of the pilot project is to determine if the Outpatient data currently in the system is robust enough to implement Activity Based Funding (ABF). This pilot is ongoing. However, the introduction of a new Patient Administration System ( IPIM&rsquo;s) in a number of hospitals has impacted on the pilot by causing amendments to the mapping of clinics to the classification system.   <\/p>  <p>  Currently 39 of 48 public acute hospitals are using ABF for Inpatient and daycase activity.

The report of the focus group was published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 31 August 2018. It is anticipated that the output of the focus group should influence the actions of the mobile network operators in their work to reduce mobile phone blackspots.

Accordingly, from 1 February 2018, a number of key changes were being made to the scheme. These include: <\/p><p>- a reduction in the minimum lease term required from 10 to 5 years;<\/p><p>- increasing the proportion of market rent available to property owners where they take on more responsibilities under the tenancy, meaning that up to 92% of market rent will be available; and<\/p><p>- provision of additional funding for property owners, over and above the current &euro;40,000 limit, where the dwelling is a bedsit type dwelling being brought into compliance with the Standards for Rented Houses Regulations and made available for social housing. <\/p><p>Data up to end Q2 2018 has shown an increase in the number of applications although given the lead in time of at least 6 months for most applications, the real impact of the recent changes to the scheme will not become apparent until later in the year.

In that context, the Government has approved the General Scheme of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2018 to give legislative underpinning to a number of specific actions outlined in the Government&rsquo;s Rental Strategy and to enhance the powers of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) to protect both tenants and landlords in the residential rental sector, particularly with regard to enforcement of the annual rent increase limit in RPZs. The Bill's provisions are intended to strengthen further the effectiveness of the rent setting and rent review laws by empowering the RTB to investigate any contravention of the law relating to rent increase limits (4% per annum) in RPZs and to take enforcement action, if necessary.

Under Pillar 3 of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan, LIHAF is designed to specifically address the issue of housing supply, which is a crucial factor in terms of moderating house prices.<\/p><p>LIHAF provides much needed public infrastructure. No funding is provided to housing developers as the infrastructure is procured by the local authority, ensuring transparency and value for money. <\/p><p>Where a site has been activated by LIHAF, developers and local authorities have made individual agreements with respect to their particular projects in terms of the acceleration of housing supply to be delivered and making housing on associated sites more affordable than it otherwise would have been. Local authorities were directed to negotiate the best agreement possible for their own relevant local sites as each project was different. <\/p><p>Summary details of those agreements were made available in March 2018 and are published on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link: <i>.<\/i>In some cases developers have provided a cost reduction off the purchase price of units across the development.  In other cases, a smaller number of units will be provided for allocation by the local authority as affordable housing. <\/p><p>As outlined in the document published last March, in relation to the specific development referred to, the local authority secured an agreement with the developer to deliver 800 residential units within the Local Area Plan area by 2021.  In addition to the 10% social housing being provided at this development, the open market value of the units will also have a cost reduction of &euro;2,500 for the remaining 720 units. These units constitute much needed housing supply in that area and the provision of public infrastructure will be instrumental in its delivery.<\/p><p>LIHAF is a supply measure but the Government also continues to address affordability through a range of specific measures.  In particular, for those households earning low to moderate annual gross incomes, a multi-stranded approach is being taken to the targeted delivery of affordable housing including measures such as Help to Buy, the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan and the new Serviced Sites Fund (SSF). In order to support the affordable housing programmes of local authorities, the Government has committed &euro;310 million, over the three years 2019 to 2021, under the SSF announced as part of Budget 2019.

Part V obligations can also be fulfilled using a range of other options, subject to the agreement of the Local Authority, including the transfer of fully completed units at a cost reflective of the construction costs, existing use site value and a contractor&rsquo;s profit.  All Part V agreements must result in a &ldquo;gain&rdquo; or benefit being equivalent to the &ldquo;net monetary value&rdquo; of the land that the Local Authority would receive if the Part V agreement had provided for a transfer of land - the &ldquo;net monetary value&rdquo; being defined as the market value less the existing use value.<\/p><p>The Part V provisions were amended in 2015 to permit the obligation to be met by way of a grant of a lease of housing units to the Local Authority, either on the site subject to the planning application or on any other land within its functional area. <\/p><p>My Department has provided guidance to local authorities to the effect that  the preference is for Local Authorities to acquire units in order to comply with Part V although, in some instances, it may be more appropriate for the Part V obligation to be fulfilled by the leasing of units to the local authority. When considering a Part V agreement a Local Authority is obliged to consider a number of things, including whether,<i>inter alia<\/i>;<\/p><p>- the proposed agreement will contribute effectively and efficiently to the achievement of the objectives of the housing strategy;<\/p><p>- the agreement will constitute the best use of the resources available to it to ensure an adequate supply of housing and any financial implications of the agreement for its functions as a housing authority;<\/p><p>- the need to counteract undue segregation in housing between persons of different social background in the area of the authority.<\/p><p>Where the Part V agreement is for the leasing of units to the Local Authority from the developer, the net monetary value must be realised in the form of a discount from the payable rent over the period of the lease. Such a discount is in addition to the normal discount on the open market rent obtained by the Local Authority through a lease agreement with a property owner.<\/p><p>Currently, my Department operates two principal leasing schemes that can be utilised for the purposes of Part V agreements; standard Long Term Social Housing Leasing and the Enhanced Long Term Social Housing Leasing Scheme.  Both of these schemes are funded under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP).  The SCHEP is a funding programme that supports the delivery of social housing by providing financial support to local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) for the long term leasing of houses and apartments from private owners and developers.  Where the Part V negotiation between the Local Authority and the developer results in a long-term lease arrangement, there is no capital funding requirement and the annual cost of the homes are incorporated into the SHCEP budget.  <\/p><p>In terms of the management of the individual units, each leasing scheme has different arrangements. In standard Long Term Social Housing Leasing, the Local Authority manages and maintains the individual units with the Lessor responsible for the structure of the building(s) and will pay the Lessor up to 80\/85% of the open market rent (depending on the unit type).  In the Enhanced Leasing Scheme, the Lessor retains the responsibility for the management and maintenance of the building(s) in exchange for up to 95% of the open market rent.As indicated above, the rents payable under the lease would have to reflect the net monetary value discount over and above the normal discounts for the relevant scheme. In both schemes, the Lessor remains responsible for any management company or other communal charges and the Local Authority remains the landlord to the tenant and collects the differential rent from them. <\/p><p>The details of Part V units currently leased under SHCEP are set out in the tables below:<table><tr><th>Local Authority<\/th><th>No. of Units<\/th><th>Year of delivery<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire &ndash; Rathdown<\/td><td>124<\/td><td>2017<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South Dublin <\/td><td>18<\/td><td>2017<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><table><tr><th>Full year cost of all leased Part V units<br \/><br \/>2016<\/th><th>2017<\/th><th>2018 <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;0<\/td><td>&euro;2,019,661<\/td><td>&euro;2,019,661<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800085#WRK06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic and Social Research Institute","counter":713,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800085#WRK06400"},{"type":"question","counter":714,"qnumday":285,"qnumall":"[49143\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112800085#WRK06500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he or his officials have read the latest ESRI report on the construction industry.","asker":"1224","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":715,"content":"<p>Both my Department and I are fully aware of  the latest ESRI report on the construction industry.<\/p>  <p>  The report indicates that much of the additional labour required for housing supply and other construction and infrastructural work may have to be secured through inward net migration and that the present high cost of accommodation may act as a disincentive for workers seeking to come and work, particularly in the greater Dublin area.
