I thank him for taking this matter.<\/p> <p>The question we have raised, on foot of representations to both Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and me, is to ask the Minister for Education and Skills to inform the House why children with Down's syndrome are excluded from the July provision scheme administered by his Department and if he will explain the rationale behind the specific criteria being applied by the Department for this exclusion.  The Minister may be aware that this is of serious concern to many parents throughout Ireland who have children with Down's syndrome.  There is an online petition on the issue of July provision which has been signed by about 5,000 parents to date.  The issue they raise is what seems to be an irrational exclusion of children with Down's syndrome from a scheme of July provision which provides supports to children with certain intellectual disabilities over the summer months.  July provision is not available to children with Down's syndrome who have a mild or moderate intellectual disability.  This seems strange, given that children with the same level of intellectual disability with different conditions are able to access the programme.<\/p> <p>The parents who have come to us have told us eloquently how their children would benefit greatly from the programme for many reasons, in particular that the summer holidays are very long, their children crave routine and structure and are unable to participate in the majority of mainstream summer camps.  They fall behind in their schoolwork and their educational development as a result of not having access, through the July provision scheme, to educational supports in the summer months.  Their children also tend to be absent more often than other children during the teaching terms and they miss valuable learning time during those months which could be made up during the summer when they tend to be at their healthiest.<\/p> <p>Letters have been sent to the Minister's Department and officials and there does not seem to be any rational basis offered for the exclusion of children with Down's syndrome from the July provision scheme.  They should be provided with support and would definitely benefit from it.  The Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues, Deputy Finian McGrath, has also been approached on this issue, as was the previous Minister for Education and Skills.<\/p> <p>We are seeking some explanation from the Minister as to the basis on which children with Down's syndrome are not given access to this important programme which would give so much benefit to them and their parents and families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018102300002#B00300","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1540301400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas don gCathaoirleach as ucht a chuid focail.  I thank Senators Bacik and &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in for raising this matter.  I assure the House that ensuring that all children with special educational needs are supported and given the opportunity to reach their full potential is a key priority for the Government.  Funding for special education provision in 2018 will amount to &euro;1.75 billion, up 43% since 2011 and equivalent to almost 19% of the Department's overall budget.<\/p> <p>The July provision scheme provides funding for an extended school year for students with severe or profound intellectual disabilities and students with autism spectrum disorders.  The scheme was developed to reduce potential regression in learning associated with these specific categories of special educational needs over the summer holidays.  The scheme does not make provision for children with other categories of special educational needs.<\/p> <p>The National Council for Special Education's policy advice on education provision for children with autism spectrum disorders was published in July 2016.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Joe McHugh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2018\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2018&amp;amp;pid=JoeMcHugh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In the course of preparing the advice, the NCSE consulted widely with a range of stakeholders, including parents, teachers, academics, experts, psychologists, HSE officials and others.

The NCSE review found that in general parents value July provision because it provides daytime respite for families and a structured day for students.  However, the review found a number of problems with the scheme as currently organised.  This includes concerns that the scheme may be inequitable because it is not provided to all students with complex special educational needs.  The NCSE advised that in general the scheme is not meeting its original objective which was to reduce possible regression in academic learning.  The council recommended that the relevant Departments consider how an equitable national day activity scheme could be developed for all students with complex special educational needs.  The proposed scheme would provide a structured, safe social environment for all students with complex special educational needs, which might include some children with Down's syndrome.<\/p><p>My Department has convened an implementation group with representatives of the NCSE, NEPS, the inspectorate and representatives from other Departments and agencies to ensure the report's recommendations are fully and appropriately considered.

Issues may arise in that regard under the European Social Charter and it certainly appears to many parents that it is inequitable.<\/p> <p>I take issue with one aspect of the Minister's response where he states the NCSE review found \"parents value July provision because it provides daytime respite for families\".  The parents who contacted Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and me have made very clear this is not about respite but about ensuring their children do not fall behind in their educational and intellectual development over the precious summer months.

The lack of secondary school places in Rush and Skerries is a huge concern for parents.  Fingal is one of the fastest growing parts of the country, if not in Europe.  We have a very large young population and this is not changing but is likely to rise.  We found ourselves with the extraordinary situation where children in both villages, or towns as they are now with a population in excess of 10,000 each, cannot be guaranteed a place in their own secondary school in their own town.<\/p><p>St. Joseph's is the only secondary school in Rush and has a student population of approximately 740.  It opened its doors to new students and 220 people turned up on the day.  As a consequence of this, we have 102 children on a waiting list and 102 families terrified about their child and not knowing what to do.  There is a similar situation with a long waiting list to get into the secondary school in Skerries.  These are all in one catchment area.  Not only can they not now go to school in their own town, they cannot go to school in the next town over.  They will be forced to go to God knows where.  It is not satisfactory.<\/p><p>We have known that this growth has been taking place and that more houses are planned, yet here we are in this situation.  For the next five years, St. Joseph's will have to limit the intake of new students to 120 when it is getting in excess of 200 applications.  Some 89% of the 102 on the waiting list are from Rush.  The trend will continue for at least five years, as I said.  There are not alternatives in the immediate area.<\/p><p>I have a formal request for a meeting with officials from the Department of Education and Skills to meet members of the board of St. Joseph's to progress the purchase of approximately 14 acres for a new school and playing pitches in Rush.  Will the Minister arrange that meeting next month because the school site needs to be bought now?  The road access will be resolved in early December when the compulsory purchase order, CPO, is completed.  Two weeks ago, the board put in a formal application for emergency accommodation so that we can accommodate as many of these young people as possible, yet we have had no response.<\/p><p>Skerries community college has encountered the same problem, as I pointed out.  We are getting emails from frantic, worried parents in Skerries who cannot get their kids into school in their own town.  This never happened before.  This problem has been highlighted in the local newspaper, the <i>Skerries News<\/i>, and it is causing turmoil.  People are very worried and we need to have this new emergency accommodation put in place as soon as possible to give people some certainty.  They do not know where they are going to send their kids next year and that is not good enough.  The community college has planning permission for a permanent extension of five classrooms and other key facilities granted by Fingal County Council in 2017.<\/p><p>This problem is not going away.  We need to get this temporary accommodation put in place in Rush, we need the prefabs for Skerries community college, and we need an outline of the future for both of these schools.  This problem is only going to get worse.  We have the best of teachers giving the best of education to our young people, preparing them for the world, in surroundings that are utterly unsatisfactory in the case of Rush and which provide utter uncertainty for parents, which is grossly unfair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018102300002#D00200","speaker":"1421"},{"type":"speech","time":1540301400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Teach f&aacute; choinne an seans labhairt leis na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; inniu agus t&aacute;im bu&iacute;och as na focail cine&aacute;lta fosta.

The four-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.<\/p><p>The announcement includes three new post-primary schools to be established in the Fingal area, as follows: a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school to serve the Donaghmede, Howth and Dublin 13 school planning area, to be established in 2019; a new 800 pupil post-primary school to serve the Blanchardstown West, Dublin 15, and Blanchardstown, Dublin 15, school planning areas as a regional solution, to be established in 2020; and a new 800 pupil post-primary school to serve the Donaghmede, Howth and Dublin 13 school planning area, to be established in 2021.  <\/p><p>In addition to the new schools announced, my Department&rsquo;s capital investment programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms in existing schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified.  The requirement for new schools will be kept under ongoing review and, in particular, have regard to the increased roll-out of housing provision, as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.<\/p><p>With regard to St. Joseph&rsquo;s secondary school, Rush, my Department recently received an application from the school for additional accommodation.  The application is being assessed and a decision will issue directly to the school shortly.  I will make sure it is kept very firmly on the radar.  The Senator will also be aware that a major building project to provide a new replacement school building at St. Joseph&rsquo;s secondary school is included in my Department&rsquo;s six-year construction programme.  A site is required for this purpose and currently being pursued.<\/p><p>In addition, the Senator will be aware that in September 2013 my Department established a new 1,000 pupil multi-denominational post-primary school, Lusk community college, under the patronage of Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board, to serve the Rush and Lusk school planning area.<\/p><p>With regard to Skerries community college, my Department has been liaising with the school&rsquo;s patron, Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board, on the applicant level for school places.  I understand the school has indicated that it has been unable to offer a place to all applicants in September 2018.  I advise the Senator that, in response to an application for additional accommodation from the ETB, my Department approved in principle the provision of additional permanent accommodation consisting of three general classrooms, one science laboratory, one art room and three special education teaching rooms.  I am aware that the provision of additional accommodation on the site must be carefully planned, considering the limitations of the site.  In that regard, my Department&rsquo;s professional and technical staff will shortly be visiting the school site to determine how the project can be advanced.  As an interim arrangement, my Department has approved the rental of temporary accommodation to the school, pending the delivery of the permanent accommodation solution.  My Department will continue to work with the ETB to address the school&rsquo;s interim and long-term accommodation needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018102300002#D00300","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540301400,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

I am glad to hear that a more permanent solution will be forthcoming.<\/p> <p>In regard to St. Joseph's secondary school, we have been pursuing the site at Rush for some time.  All that is required is for the Department to instruct Fingal County Council to purchase the site.  It happily does this on a regular basis for the Department on the basis of shared facilities after school hours.  It needs to be done.  The CPO to open up the road and the lands is to be completed in December.  However, we are facing a delay because there was a misunderstanding between CEIST, EDUCENA and the Department about who was going to purchase the land.  CEIST and EDUCENA made it very clear they were not in a position to do it; therefore, it falls to the Department.<\/p> <p>With regard to Lusk community college, it is very welcome that we will have a secondary school, the second half of which is being built, but it is very clear to all concerned that it will not be able to accommodate the increased demand for place from pupils in both Skerries and Rush.

The National Parks and Wildlife Service, which comes under the aegis of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, is charged with the protection and conservation of habitats and species in designated lands around the country.

It runs through the River Moy special area of conservation, SAC.  The project was denied on account of over-design and whooper swans.  A minor upgrade to this same road has been sought at Cloongullaun to replace the bridge, and solutions have been sought on how to overcome the environmental issues since 2012.  A sum of &euro;4 million has been spent on this.  A sum of &euro;5 million was spent on the previous project and we still do not have planning permission.

Even a more minor job, that of the dredging of the River Deel to protect people's properties in the short term, has been refused permission.  One of the reasons cited was the presence of freshwater pearl mussels.  The same issue arises at Cloongullane Bridge.  Equally, the much-needed work on Glenisland Bridge on the R312 between Castlebar and Bellacorick has been allocated funding but has been delayed on account of freshwater pearl mussels.  On designated lands in Galway, the N59 works between Galway and Clifden have been delayed for years, notwithstanding the 17 or 18 consultations on it.  All of these areas fall within the auspices of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS.<br\/><br\/>We are reaching a point where Government agencies charged with the delivery of vital infrastructure projects are living in fear when proposing them.  For example, instead of seeking a major scheme for the worst section of national primary road in the country, namely, the N26, Mayo County Council is seeking a series of minor schemes because it believes it will fall foul of the environmental designation.  That is crazy.<br\/><br\/>The NPWS needs to undertake a major body of work.  Other than that, every planning application in a given SAC is dealt with on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis.  There is a lack of forward planning and schematic approach, as most SACs do not have management plans.  This is key.  It means that there has been no examination of the competing interests of conservation and socioeconomic objectives.  The need to be able to build bridges and roads and to farm land has not been balanced with the conservation objectives in any formal way.<br\/><br\/>A case for legitimate development has been identified.  Under Project Ireland 2040, there is a plan for 500,000 people in rural areas.  If we can get planning permissions, we can get developments through without having to wait years.  We have been left very far behind.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the recruitment steps taken in recent years to plug the science and biodiversity staffing gaps in the NPWS.  There was an increase of 15% in this year's budget to &euro;54 million, but that amount covers built heritage as well as natural heritage.  The culture budget has been increased to &euro;190 million.  There will be no culture or heritage in rural Ireland unless we get our act together.  This situation will impede Project Ireland 2040 and must be taken seriously by the Government.  The NPWS must be funded if it is to have a schematic approach to developments in designated SACs where there are already substantial settlements and roads.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018102300002#F00600","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540301400,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I am taking this debate on behalf of the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, and I thank the Senator for raising it.  I will talk to the Minister about the issues outlined.  Reading the answer before Senator Mulherin spoke, it might be approaching the question in a different way than the Senator addressed the matter.<\/p> <p>In 2018, the Department allocated &euro;11.982 million to the NPWS, which represents a more than 7% increase from 2017.  In addition, the overall budget for the heritage division in 2018 of &euro;47.146 million increased by 4% from 2017.  A further increase in funding of more than &euro;7 million, or 15%, in the overall budget for the division was announced earlier this month as part of budget 2019.  This investment represents a significant proportion of the Department's overall budget and reflects the continued commitment to the NPWS.<\/p> <p>Some 14% of the terrestrial area of the State is designated.  This includes many remote and inaccessible areas.  Most of the land in SACs, special protection areas and natural heritage areas is in private ownership.  Through the NPWS, the Department directly manages a property portfolio in respect of national parks, nature reserves and other conservation or recreational properties of approximately 87,000 ha.  This comprises 69,000 ha of diverse landscape within our six national parks and more than 18,000 ha within our other 80 plus statutory nature reserves and other heritage properties.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy John Paul Phelan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2004\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2004&amp;amp;pid=JohnPaulPhelan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Killarney National Park comprises over 10,000 ha.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service manages and maintains over 485 km of trails across these properties.  Approximately 4 million people visit these sites annually and while 50% of the national parks are in the western region, more than half of all visitors are to the Wicklow Mountains and Killarney National Park.<\/p><p>Staff levels across the Department are kept under regular review in line with emerging business needs and Government policy on public sector pay and staffing as advised by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Of the Department's total staff, approximately 335 work in the area of natural heritage through the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  In addition, the Department takes on in the region of 70 seasonal staff during the year to assist the NPWS.  Front-line conservation rangers are deployed through a regional structure and assignments are determined in light of departmental business needs and priorities.  As well as more senior regionally-based officers of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, there are 62 NPWS conservation rangers stationed around the country who deal with enforcement matters under the Wildlife Acts.  As the Senator may be aware, the rangers are involved on a daily basis in a range of enforcement activities.  These duties are not based upon a county basis.  For operational reasons, I cannot provide the House with specific levels of detail with regard to the exact number of rangers in a particular geographic area as such information could serve as an incentive for wildlife crime and compromise us from an operational point of view.<\/p><p>The Department is working towards increasing the overall number of rangers to 84, subject to constraints.  Any further appointments will be made across the country taking account of business needs and financial resources to meet pay costs in the context of Government policy on public sector pay and staffing.  As I said earlier, staff levels across the Department are kept under regular review in line with emerging business needs and Government policy on public sector pay and staffing, as advised by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The NPWS endeavours to fulfil a comprehensive and valuable role in the conservation and protection of our natural heritage and delivers an excellent service to the public.    <\/p><p>Capital funding is allocated by individual project as opposed to specific regions.  As the Senator may be aware, the Department entered into a strategic investment partnership with F&aacute;ilte Ireland last year.  The first project under this partnership is a &euro;2.1 million investment in Wild Nephin-Ballycroy National Park to develop a continuous 53 km walking-cycling trail from Newport to Ballycastle on the Wild Atlantic Way through the national park.  This follows on from a number of key strategic investments in Mayo, including the expansion of the Wild Nephin-Ballycroy National Park with the &euro;850,000 purchase of some 1,200 acres at Altnabrockey and the transfer of Coillte's Wild Nephin holdings to the national park.  These acquisitions not only consolidate the national park area, they provide excellent opportunities for the future development of the park, including improved access and trails, as well as other significant enhancements to the visitor experience at Wild Nephin on the Wild Atlantic Way.  They also build upon the recent designation of the area as Ireland's first gold-tier dark sky park.  A gold-tier award is the highest possible accolade, meaning that Mayo is now internationally recognised as one of the best places in the world to view the wonders of the night.  Mayo Dark Sky Park is a great example of collaborative projects between our communities, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Coillte, GMIT Mayo campus, South West Mayo Development Company and Mayo County Council. <\/p><p>Between 2017 and 2017, the Department invested in excess of &euro;7 million capital in the development of Ireland's network of six national parks and more than 80 nature reserves and other conservation and recreational heritage properties.  Under Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018-2027, capital investment of &euro;50 million has been earmarked for the national parks and nature reserves.  This investment ensures long-term protection of the national parks and reserves, and the Department is delighted to have this opportunity for investment and implementation of measures to protect our habitats, landscapes and wildlife.    <\/p><p>The Minister, Deputy Madigan, has asked me to assure the House that into 2019 and beyond the Department will continue its ongoing programme of maintenance works to safeguard the continuing management and operation of the national parks and reserves not just in the western region but nationwide.

The staff of 180, some of whom have given up to 25 years of loyal service to the factory, look set to lose their jobs.  The dogs on the street knew for some time that things were not right.  Appeals from staff for clarity about the future intentions of the company fell, unfortunately, on deaf ears in recent months and weeks.  The Unite trade union, the representative body of the workers, was conscious that the firm appeared to be in very choppy waters.  Local management, unfortunately, appeared to be sidelined and left in the dark.  We know there are no jobs in a closed factory and the union knows that as well.  On that basis, the Unite trade union did the responsible thing and formally contacted the company's parent operation in the UK.<\/p><p>As any responsible trade union would, Unite sought on several occasions to meet the key decision-makers from the company formally.  The union sought to establish the nature and extent of the problems at the Dundalk plant and to offer to work with the company if it needed to engage with the union to change course and ensure the survival of the operation.  Time and again, however, the union's approaches were rebuffed and stonewalled.  The union was, frankly, given the two fingers by the operation.  Against this backdrop and as the clock ticked towards the appointment of a provisional liquidator last week, workers at the plant reported the transferring of profitable production lines from the Dundalk facility to the parent company's facilities in the UK.<\/p><p>Given what we know and the Dundalk company's refusal to engage with its staff and the union, I can only conclude that the operation in Dundalk appears to have been deliberately run down.  Last week, the parent company in the UK pulled its support.  The Irish operation is a subsidiary of the UK parent.  The Minister of State and, more appropriately, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, need to take a close look at this. The behaviour of the Irish arm of the company and the activities between it and its parent in the UK need to be examined formally and forensically.  All too often we have seen workers left on the street as companies hide behind the protection of the courts in deemed insolvencies where fancy footwork and sharp practices are used to put assets beyond the use of redundant workers and other creditors.  Those are assets that should normally be used to pay decent redundancies and moneys owed to small businesses.  We have to be vigilant.  After the debacle of Clerys, we said that the law would and should change to protect workers better in insolvencies.<\/p><p>The Duffy-Cahill report, entitled Expert examination and review of laws on the protection of employee interests when assets are separated from the operating entity, was brought to the Government in April 2016 but no action has been taken since.  Now, 180 workers in Dundalk are in a desperately uncertain set of circumstances.  They have not formally been made redundant and they are not legally entitled to the 30 day redundancy notice period to allow them work with their trade union on an enhanced or improved redundancy package.  They have not earned any money since the plant closed and, despite the great support they have received from officials in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in the area, without a P45, entitlement to social welfare is moot.  They also cannot or will not take up alternative employment because they hope that, somehow, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland or other State agencies might find an alternative operator for the facility in Dundalk.  In the meantime, life goes on, mortgages and rent need to be paid, bills need to be paid and families need to be fed.<\/p><p>The law needs to be changed.  Does the Government intend to change the law as it applies to workers caught up in insolvencies like this?  Will the Minister of State and his colleagues support the workers and the union in their efforts to seek social protection support for the workers and trade union members in that plant over the next short period?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018102300002#J00400","speaker":"1398"},{"type":"speech","time":1540301400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Nash.

Section 11A of the Act provides that where an employee believes the employer to be in breach of sections 9 or 10, he or she may pursue a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  It is an offence under section 11 of the Act for an employer to fail to comply with sections 9 or 10.  Following contact from the Department, the joint provisional liquidators of the company have advised that the consultation process with employees began on Friday, 19 October and will continue for 30 days.  The Department will continue to engage with the provisional liquidators as required.<\/p><p>The Social Insurance Fund provides a safety net for the employees in cases of employer insolvency.  It is the responsibility of the liquidator to seek, on behalf of employees, payment from the redundancy payments scheme in respect of statutory redundancy and from the insolvency payments scheme in respect of wage-related entitlements.  An eligible employee is entitled to a statutory redundancy payment of two weeks' pay for every year of service, plus a bonus week.  Compensation is based on the worker's length of reckonable service and reckonable weekly remuneration, subject to a ceiling of &euro;600 per week.  In order to qualify for a statutory redundancy payment, an employee must have at least two years of continuous service, be in employment which is insurable under the Social Welfare Acts and be over the age of 16.  Entitlements covered under the insolvency payments scheme are arrears of wages, holiday pay, sick pay, payment in lieu of minimum notice and certain pension contributions.  Payments are calculated by reference to an employee's wages and are subject to a limit of &euro;600 a week.  Arrears of wages, sick pay, holiday pay and minimum notice are limited to eight weeks.<\/p><p>The Department will ensure the affected employees receive advice on jobseekers' payments and other income supports that may be available to them.  It will provide support to them on returning to work or accessing appropriate education and training and development options.  Staff of the north-east division of the Department met employees of the company on Monday, 22 October to give them information on the Intreo services available locally.  An information and recruitment event for the workforce will be held in the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Dundalk on Thursday, 1 November next.  This event will be supported by other key service providers.  Local employers with job vacancies have also committed to attend.  The key message for employees is that the Department will provide any redundancy, insolvency and jobseeker payments to which they may be entitled in a timely manner and will proactively help them to access available opportunities for employment.<\/p><p>The WRC's customer service section provides information on the rights and obligations of employees and employers under employment rights legislation.

I reiterate my appreciation of the efforts made by the staff of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to assist workers who find themselves in a dreadful position.  They were aware for some time that something was not right in this plant.  As I said, efforts were made by the union to engage constructively with key decision-makers in the parent company in the UK.  It is right that people are deeply suspicious about the circumstances around this.  It is incredibly important for the Unite trade union to be represented at the formal liquidation hearing in the courts on 12 November to make sure there is a robust forensic examination of the relationship between the Dundalk company and its parent company in the UK.  I have been told by workers and the trade union involved that some of the activities in the plant in recent months have left them very sceptical about the motivations of this company.  In the meantime, there is a human cost.  People do not have jobs or social welfare payments.  They are wondering whether they should find alternative employment.

I have made representations for a couple living on the south side of the city in Walkinstown.  They are aged 85 and 87 years, respectively.  Their family are looking for another four hours of home help per week to help them to stay in their home in order that they can stay together.  If they cannot receive this help, it looks like one of them will have to move into a nursing home, which would be more costly to the State.  We need to have a proper discussion on the provision of home help.  I know that my colleague in the Lower House, Deputy Willie O'Dea, has a Bill in progress that would apply the fair deal scheme system to the allocation of home help hours in order that people would be able to live securely in their home without having to move into a nursing home.

I know that some of the Leader's colleagues are in the constituency.  The question on my mind is whether we will pay for the mistakes of the Celtic tiger era a second time, as we find ourselves tearing apart brand new schools, or schools less than ten years old in order to repair structural faults.  I was delighted to hear the Minister say this morning that the cost of the work will be subject to litigation that will take place in due course.  I compliment Mr. Paddy Lavelle, chief executive officer of Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board, on taking rapid action and keeping the safety of students and teachers foremost in his mind in making a decision to close part of the school.  As the Leader knows, being a teacher, this is a serious decision.  We do not close schools or parts of them very easily.  It was rapid action on the part of the Minister and the CEO who are to be commended and complimented.<\/p> <p>I cannot let this session pass without discussing the Defence Fores.

Senator Gerald Nash raised the issue during the Commencement debate earlier.  Staff in the company were treated deplorably by management.  Its parent company has its headquarters in Manchester.  A total of 180 people were employed at the facility in Dundalk, most of whom had given a lifetime of service to the company, yet when they arrived at the factory on Friday, there was no work for them to do.  My colleague, Deputy Gerry Adams, wrote to the managing director on 21 October following the making of representations to his office.  Attempts were made to contact management, but there was no response until a letter arrived giving notice that liquidators had been appointed to the company.  I am also aware of unsuccessful attempts by Unite to speak to management to gain clarity on its intentions.  Staff should have access to the full redundancy arrangements contained in their contracts of employment, but they have no idea if the company will honour them.  Its conduct to date does not inspire confidence.  The staff are owed wages; some of them are owed a month's pay and shift premium payments, as well as their annual leave entitlements.  Technically they are still employed, as they have not yet been issued with their P45 and cannot access social welfare benefits.  The matter will be raised in the D&aacute;il Chamber by Deputies Gerry Adams and Imelda Munster shortly.  The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation must secure the sale of the business.  She must also take steps to ensure companies will not be able to use tactical liquidations to circumvent their responsibilities as the staff have been left in dire straits.  It is not the first time we have seen this happen.  It is reprehensible.  Workers and their families have endured the injustice of companies pulling out of the country without any explanation being given and certainly without showing any care for the workers who had worked for them for a  long time.<\/p> <p>It is only a few days to the presidential election.

I agree with Senator Ardagh that we all need to take time to become familiar with the issue of the epidermolysis bullosa awareness week and the impact that it has on children.  The Senator beautifully described them as butterfly children.  We should all join with her in her advocacy and ensure that there is a pathway of care for young children with rare diseases and conditions.  I commend the Senator for raising the matter.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> On the allocation of home help hours and home care packages, we all share the overarching desire to see people's quality of life improve, in particular older people.  That is why the State values the home support service which is at the core of what the HSE is doing for older people.  It is worth indicating that, in monetary terms, the home support service budget has grown from a base of &euro;306 million in 2015 to over &euro;420 million.  In saying that, it is important to acknowledge that the need is growing and that more people are looking to have home help hours allocated to them, as well as extensive home care packages.  The 2018 HSE service plan provides for the allocation of over 17 million home help hours to 50,500 people.  The Minister for Health has also secured a significant increase in the health budget.  I hope, therefore, that the Department and the HSE will continue to improve existing services.  If there is a blockage - to be fair, many of us understand there is a delay in the approval of some home care packages - there is a need to streamline the application process to make it user-friendly.  I hope we can make that happen sooner rather than later.  The point made by Senator Ardagh is valid, but it is worth noting, as I said, that there has been a significant increase in the budget for home care services.<\/p><p>I join the Senator in highlighting the issue of domestic violence.  While she did not reference the decision on sentencing in one of the courts yesterday, we must always encourage the victims of domestic violence or child abuse to come forward and speak with clarity and authenticity.  While the ordeal of having to go before a court can be horrifying, it is important that all of us involved in public life support victims who as citizens of this republic deserve our support and empathy.  They have a story to tell and need support to tell it.  It is important that we encourage them to do so.<\/p><p>Senators Craughwell, Reilly and Lombard referred to a number of schools, in particular Ardgillan community college which is a source of major concern.  I, too, commend the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, his Department and the Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board for being proactive in dealing with the matter.  It is of huge concern that a school built between 2007 and 2010 is today a source of worry in terms of the health and safety of the students and staff.  The Minister's first priority is to ensure their welfare and safety.  We all hope it was not a case of corners being cut or a compromise being reached in terms of the structure of the school.  As Senator Lombard rightly said, parents and staff want to know promptly about the issues involved.  It is welcome that the Minister having carried out a programme of safety assessments at the different schools, one of which is in my constituency.  It is a source of worry and the utmost clarity is required.  It is welcome that the Minister and the Department have engaged the services of a project manager and a full technical team to organise and oversee remedial works required arising from the assessments.  I hope the cost will not be borne by the State, but that is not a matter for me to decide today.<\/p><p>Senator Craughwell referred to the Defence Forces.  As he knows, in 2015 the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, commissioned the White Paper on the Defence Forces.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=23\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It was a comprehensive review of the Defence Forces and defence policy and involved a major engagement with a variety of stakeholders.  I welcome the proactivity of the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, who acknowledges that the Defence Forces face challenges in recruitment and retention.  He does not operate in an ivory tower but is a hands-on Minister of State who is acutely aware of the importance and value of the Defence Forces.  A public pay commission was established for this reason and it is also why members of the Defence Forces are rightly having their pay restored under the FEMPI legislation and some of the other pay agreements.<\/p><p>The Minister of State has also pushed for a White Paper to be published expeditiously to target the skills gaps in the Defence Forces.  I think Senator Craughwell will also agree that the extra &euro;47 million for the Defence Forces in budget 2019, of which &euro;6 million is for the pay and conditions of our Defence Forces personnel, is to be welcomed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018102300002#T00300","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1540301400,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Some &euro;10 million of that will go into the pension fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018102300002#V00200","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1540301400,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I think the Senator will recognise that the Minister of State is proactive, is attempting to redress the cuts of the past decade and is trying to restore the pay and conditions of the Defence Forces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018102300002#V00300","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1540301400,"counter":87,"content":"<p>The White Paper is a flawed document.

A report of the Law Reform Commission by Dr. Patrick Honohan, former Governor of the Central Bank, was launched this morning.  It recommends the establishment of a corporate crime agency to work directly with the new corporate crime agency in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I have gathered that this Bill does not actually address these matters.<\/p> <p>The report also calls for the Financial Regulator to be able to impose fines and other instruments on a company or individual that has behaved badly.  Interestingly, Dr. Honohan said he had taken the commonsense approach that reckless trading was a criminal offence that could and should be prosecuted.  However, he was told to dream on, that there was not sufficient case law to establish a case against these people.  That is an absolutely appalling statement from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  If there is not sufficient case law, it should be established.  The only way to establish case law is by taking cases.<\/p> <p>Dr. Honohan has pointed out that reckless trading formed no part of the convictions of individuals for white-collar crime.  That is appalling.  I served as chairman of several companies that were working in the charitable field.  They were limited companies.  I suspended the operations of one of them because I was afraid of a prosecution for reckless trading if we went on.  It seems to me that in light of the financial crisis that we went through eight or ten years ago, we really should establish a method of dealing properly with white-collar crime.  I do not see any reason reckless trading should not be a prosecutable offence.  It is time that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions was told to get off its backside and do something about this by establishing case law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018102300002#DD00600","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1540301400,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I think most of the banks were recklessly trading-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018102300002#DD00700","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1540301400,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Yes, they were.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018102300002#DD00800","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1540301400,"counter":138,"content":"<p>-----but the Senator might find another mechanism or-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018102300002#DD00900","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1540301400,"counter":139,"content":"<p>They should have been stopped in their tracks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2018102300002#DD01000","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1540301400,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.
