I am a rural Deputy and was brought up in Belclare.  Canavan's, the local post office, was beside us.  Over the years it was the financial centre of the village, where people drew their children's allowance, pensions and so on and they spent the money locally in the adjoining shop.  It is still in existence today, and it provides a valuable service to many people in the locality.  This is replicated throughout the country in the post office network.  During the Covid-19 lockdown, the post office assumed the role of a social contact and provided a reassuring knock on the door for many people.  The postman called to the doors of those on their own and provided a lifeline to many who were isolating.  Tomorrow, as we begin the second lockdown, the post office will again be the focus of providing all these services, including the provision of free postage to nursing homes and newspaper delivery to ensure that people are not on their own.  All of this is to be commended.<\/p><p>However, the post office network is at a very critical juncture.  There 891 postmasters and 45 An Post-operated post offices in the country.  During the Covid pandemic, their transactions are estimated to be down by around 25%.  Grant Thornton, which has done a report on the post office network, has estimated that there is a &euro;17 million shortfall annually in the costs of running the network.  The Government needs to act quickly to save the network.<\/p><p>Grant Thornton has also argued that the post office network remains a highly valuable asset, which contributes an estimated social value of between &euro;344 million and &euro;776 million per annum.  We are calling on the Government to do a number of things.  The first is to designate the post office network as the offline gateway of choice for citizens availing of the State services, due to its unique nationwide network and existing strong relationship with offline citizens.  Second, we ask the Government to commence the offline services by providing the motor tax renewal service through the post office network.  That would be a statement of intent.  We ask that recognition be given to the existing post office network, both as a rural economic lifeline service and a locus for future development of financial services outside the existing financial framework.<\/p><p>I ask the Government to take this motion seriously on the basis that we, in rural Ireland, need this network to ensure that it has a focus.  We see villages in which the doors have been closed.  The last beacon of light for many of us is the fact that the post office remains open.<\/p><p>I commend everyone involved in the post office.  My colleagues will expound more on the virtues of the post office network.  Critically, the post office network will be in a very serious position from June 2021, unless the Government acts now.  That is why the motion is being moved now, rather than leaving this issue to come to a cliff edge.  I would appreciate if the Minister, who is listening in Galway, would take this on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100003#A00200","speaker":"1482"},{"type":"speech","time":1603270800,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact the Regional Group has brought such an important motion to the D&aacute;il.  The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, will know as well as anybody else in this Chamber that we have seen Ireland grow into a city state.  With regard to size, Dublin, and in comparison to the rest of the country, is an outlier in relation to any other capital city in Europe.  Even in Britain, London does not have the dominance Dublin has here.  That lopsided development is continuing apace.  Right now we have an overheated capital, and a third of the country spending two or three hours per day commuting into Dublin.  People are commuting from Galway, Cork and Cavan to Dublin every day to work.  That lopsided development is phenomenally damaging for Dublin because of the fact that housing is not available, one cannot travel around the city and it is difficult to find places for children in schools.  It is damaging to people in the commuter belt, because parents are separated from their families for long periods.  We see regional and rural Ireland emptying of young people.  There are many reasons for this.<\/p> <p>The Government provides a number of sources of funding to try to stop this but in reality, it is only social welfare for rural Ireland.  This is happening at the same time as services are being gutted in rural Ireland.  In 2018 we saw well over 100 post offices close all over the country, including seven in my own county of Meath.  Garda stations have also been closed and rural pubs and shops have closed.  The fabric of rural communities is in big trouble at the moment.  At present, there are 900 post offices around this State and they are the centre of business and human interaction in rural areas.  If one takes those post offices away, a lot else falls.  If pensions are not collected on particular days in small towns and villages, then that money is not spent in those places.  The post office infrastructure is in serious trouble.  If 2021 turns out as predicted, each post office will make an average loss of &euro;19,500, which is startling.  Posts offices are not currently economically viable.  There is a hole in the funding for post offices at present of &euro;17 million.<\/p> <p> We have a choice here.  One of the problems I have noted in my time in this House is that there are certain issues or topics for which every single Deputy will declare support, for the sake of the common good, with post offices and credit unions being two examples but when it comes to action and putting money where our mouths are, this Chamber has let down those organisations for generations.  Rather than have everybody from all sides of the House saying nice things about the post office network, can we actually support this motion and make sure that there is money to pay for the continued existence of the network?  The &euro;17 million hole that exists must be filled.  The Government is throwing helicopter money to many other areas of society at present and it would be absolutely wrong not to stand up for post offices.  If we allow post offices to close in the near future, the trend  towards lop-sided development will accelerate.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100003#A00500","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603271400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>The debate this morning centres on the old adage that we know the cost of everything and the value of nothing.  In recent years the Government has, to a large degree, turned its back on the needs of the post office network and in doing so it has turned its back on the needs of regional and rural Ireland.  A significant group of our citizens have used post office services for many years and will not avail of the move to e-commerce that the Government and society more generally is pushing.  We need to acknowledge that in the first instance.  We also need to determine how we can future-proof the post office network for the modern age.  In that context, the Government must view the post office network as a strategic asset.  As someone who lives in regional Ireland with a large rural constituency base, I know the value of the post office network and the importance of post offices to citizens.  They want to do business in their local post office, which is a local community area where they feel safe and secure, are known and get recognition.  They value the services of post offices and have been prepared for years to support them through their taxes but unfortunately the Government is not so prepared.<\/p>  <p>  A public service obligation, PSO, levy will be required to support the services of post offices in the future.  We can look at initiatives like issuing social welfare payments through post offices and so forth but ultimately this is about a strategic decision as to whether the Government will support the network into the future.  That is both a strategic and cultural decision.  Once that decision is made by the Government, it can provide the initiatives that will ensure that money flows into the post office network.  I ask the Minister to consider the importance of the network to the social fabric of the country.  Previous speakers have referred to payments through the PUP scheme, motor taxation and driving licences being processed through post offices and there lots of other initiatives we can consider.  Some months ago I called for a joint initiative between post offices and credit unions to provide funding for the SME sector.  There are hundreds of millions of euro sitting in credit union accounts that cannot find a way of leveraging interest and at the same time, people in businesses are looking for money.  A natural efficiency could be arrived at but nobody has expressed any interest in examining this proposal further.  <\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to put a floor under the post office network and to make a strategic commitment to fund it into the future.  After that we can look at various initiatives that will provide revenue for the network but first and foremost, a political decision to support, save and expand it must be made.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100004#B00200","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1603271400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>The post office network is vital infrastructure for many in rural and regional communities.  Almost 950 post offices are operational throughout Ireland but unfortunately this number is decreasing.  The sector has seen significant cuts in recent years with the closure of hundreds of post offices, most of which were located in small rural communities.  County Wexford has 52 post offices but unfortunately this number is getting smaller.  They serve all types of communities, from the larger ones in our main towns such as Bunclody, Gorey, Enniscorthy, Wexford and New Ross to small family-run outlets in small villages such as Rosslare, Ramsgrange, Fethard-on-Sea, Wellingtonbridge, Foulksmills and Campile.  Post offices provide vital services to hundreds of communities but are under further threat at the moment due to Covid-19 restrictions imposed by the Government.  Transactions within the post office network are down by 25%.<\/p>  <p>  This motion calls on D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to recognise the significant challenges facing the post office network.  I have described the network as being under threat and with the wrong action, that threat can become a weakness but with the right action, it can be turned into an opportunity or a strength.  The right action is for the Government to ensure the sustainability of the network through a PSO.  This may involve emergency investment but more importantly, it requires an expansion of the role of the post office to give the network the opportunity to sustain itself.  <\/p>  <p>  It is also important to recognise the knock-on benefits of post offices for local communities.  The Grant Thornton report argues that the post office network remains a highly valuable national asset that contributes far more to the economy than the cost of the PSO.  It estimates that the protection and expansion of the network would result in a social value for Ireland of between &euro;344 million and &euro;776 million.  This social value can be seen when people travel to their local post office to do something and then decide to call into another local business while there, whether that be a butcher's shop, bakery, caf&eacute;, clothes or shoe shop or a sports shop.  Post offices help to bring economic activity to their areas and they need a PSO to get them back on track and ensure their survival.  They also need opportunities to develop by providing as many useful services for people in local communities as possible.  They need to be seen as the go-to venue for people to engage with State services.  <\/p>  <p>  The motion calls on the Government to designate the post office network as the offline gateway of choice for citizens.  Many people find online services totally alien and they need an alternative.  Every form that needs to be completed such as driver licence or passport applications should be available as a matter of course in every post office.  In all cases, the postmistress or postmaster is there to help people to complete these forms.  The motion also calls on the Government to commence the provision of offline Government services with the option of processing motor tax renewals through the post office network.  Many rural residents would need to drive for miles to the nearest motor tax office.  Let us save the carbon by allowing people to drive the few miles to their local post office instead.  This motion recognises the existing post office network as a rural economic lifeline and a locus for the future development of financial services outside of the existing bank framework.  The post office network is ideally placed to provide an alternative in this market.  I hope Deputies on all sides of the House will support this motion to protect and future-proof our post office network.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100004#B00300","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1603271400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The post office in Ireland has seen many changes.  It was established in the 16th century when it served just Dublin and a small number of major towns.  The postal service developed over the years from the days of the bellman and the post boy, to the mail coach, the mail train, the mail boat and eventually to airmail.<\/p> <p>Throughout its evolving history, the post office consistently played a crucial role in the development of Ireland and met every challenge with a determination to overcome it.  It has never changed and it is now up to the Government to ensure it never will.  The challenges facing post offices today are unlike any they have faced in the past.  The world of today demands that the post office carve out a new future for itself to ensure it continues to provide the services people need and demand.<\/p> <p> There are more than 900 post offices and they are used by 1.3 million people each week.  Studies have indicated that post offices are used more frequently and regularly by people living in rural areas.  Figures from 2019 show that 36% of people in Ireland live in what are considered to be rural areas.  This is a significantly higher number than the European Union average, yet the number of people who are traditionally considered to use post offices the most are not doing so to the extent they could.  The reason for that is that the post office is not offering them the enhanced range of services they need to conduct their business in the modern world.  This needs to change or the institution that is the post office will be consigned to the history books.<\/p> <p> Due to the use of technology and the emergence of rapid courier services, revenue from letter and parcel delivery is minuscule now compared with the major source of post office revenue it was in the past.  However, post offices have effectively handled the distribution of some &euro;4.6 million in social welfare payments, a large proportion of which is in dispersed rural communities.  This in turn benefits local businesses because, in general, money being collected locally results in it being spent locally.  If post offices can efficiently handle vital social welfare payments, it goes without saying that this should and could lead to them handling a wide range of other services.<\/p> <p> Post offices are ready and willing to work to save their future, but the facility to add the provision of additional services required by the public has not been made available to them.  The Government and its agencies have not lived up to their promises to empower An Post with new tasks and projects, particularly in the area of financial services.  The Government has been too slow to encourage these developments.  A prime example of that is the fact that post offices were not offered an option for the collection of the pandemic unemployment payment.  This oversight saw billions of euro channelled through banks despite research proving that making payments directly into a person's bank account can lead to up to 20% of it being spent outside the country.<\/p> <p> As things stand, average losses of &euro;19,000 are forecast per post office each year from 2021 onwards, impacting on the viability of post offices throughout the country.  It costs &euro;70 million to run the post office network.  The network generates approximately &euro;53 million in revenue, leaving a shortfall of &euro;17 million.  There is a small window of opportunity to help post offices.  Once that window closes, it will never be reopened.  No Government will wish to see the doors of post offices close forever.  No Government will wish to leave that legacy.  Post offices are willing to fight and work for their future.  The Government needs to give them that chance and opportunity.  Urgent and meaningful action is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100004#B00400","speaker":"1609","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603272000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:<br \/><br \/>&ldquo;recognises:  \t&mdash; the important role that An Post and post offices have played during the Covid-19 pandemic in its commitment to rural communities and to the elderly and vulnerable in our society, and its provision of a swift and sustained response to the crisis in the introduction of a number of initiatives, including check-ins on elderly and vulnerable customers, delivery of newspapers and a recent commitment to free mail to residents in care facilities until January next;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that transactions within the post office network are down by an estimated 25 per cent due to the Covid-19 pandemic;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that post offices provide crucial public and financial services to communities all around Ireland, especially to those in rural and isolated areas;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that the Programme for Government commits to supporting a modernised post office network that &lsquo;will provide a better range of financial services and e-commerce services for citizens and enterprise, as part of our commitment to a sustainable nationwide post office network&rsquo;;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; that An Post has potential to do more and make a further significant contribution across many areas of public, business and community life in Ireland, with an evolving mandate An Post can emerge as a central hub for a wide variety of valuable community focused services; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the strides made by An Post in offering an enhanced suite of financial services through the network; and  notes:  \t&mdash; that the Government is committed to a sustainable nationwide post office network as a key component of the economic and social infrastructure in both rural and urban areas;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; in pursuit of this objective, Government efforts to support An Post in the roll out of new services and the delivery of its strategic plan to ensure the financial viability of An Post and the continued fulfilment of its mandate to deliver a mails delivery service and a viable post office network, including: <blockquote> \t&mdash; the provision of State support to An Post of &euro;30 million in 2017, &euro;15 million of which was to support the post office network;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the approval of a capital expenditure programme, which as part of the Company&rsquo;s commitment to the sustainability of its network is designed to develop the newer elements of An Post&rsquo;s financial services business and mitigate declining core mail volumes and revenues on the retail side of the business;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the work under way, in consultation with An Post, to explore the scope to put more business through post offices; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Provision of Offline Services Report, which will be published in the coming months and considered as part of a national digital strategy and which proposes a more coherent approach to providing offline services to citizens; and <\/blockquote>&mdash; the commitment from the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection that all weekly social welfare payments, which had been moved to a fortnightly schedule from the end of last March, will be fully restored to being paid weekly with effect from Monday, 2nd November, 2020, noting the value of these transactions to An Post.&rdquo;  <\/blockquote>  <p>I thank Deputies for their contributions and the opportunity to address the motion.  Although the Government is opposing the motion, I wish to put on the record that I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by the Deputies who put down the motion, as the network has the capacity to do more business for the Government.  All Members agree on the end point, but where we differ is on how to get there.<\/p><p>I commend An Post and postmasters on the community initiatives put in place in response to Covid-19 which have been implemented with such goodwill and efficiency throughout the country.  Throughout the pandemic, An Post has kept its network of 940 post offices open, playing a hugely important commercial and societal role in communities.  Most recently, An Post announced that it will ensure free delivery of all card and letter mail posted to or from residents of nursing and care homes until the end of January.  Enabling family, friends and colleagues to keep in touch is of great importance.  The support provided to the elderly and most vulnerable through this and other important initiatives is an invaluable service during these times.<\/p><p>An Post, postmasters and the network are facing their own particular challenges.  The ongoing decline in core mail volumes through e-substitution has seen An Post working hard to diversify its business in recent years and to seek new business opportunities.  Deputies will recall that even before Covid-19 there were huge challenges for the business, with mail volumes declining by 6.3% in 2019, resulting in a &euro;25 million decrease in revenue.  An Post estimates that Covid has probably accelerated this process of volume decline by two to three years.  A further difficulty in that regard is that once customers have adapted to digital alternatives, they rarely return to sending mail and, as such, the decline is likely to be permanent.<\/p><p>Like many other aspects of our lives, the way in which the public accesses Government services is likely to have been profoundly affected by the pandemic.  We need to consider these changes and our response to them very carefully.  To take the example of motor tax, under the existing arrangements, motor tax is payable in person or by post through motor tax offices in 26 local authorities.  It is also payable online at any time, with the level of online usage increasing from 42% of all motor tax transactions in 2010 to just under 79% at the end of last year.  Although overall motor tax transactions have reduced slightly in recent months due to Covid-19, the percentage of online transactions has increased significantly during that time, averaging 92% of all motor tax transactions.<\/p><p>We need to consider our overall approach to offline service provision in light of our experience, and not in terms of individual services but rather as a whole.  Rather than considering individual services, a centrally driven, whole-of-government approach to offline service provision, similar to the adoption of digital government, would help to realise the commitment in the programme for Government to a sustainable nationwide post office network.  I am considering the report of the offline services group with a view to bringing it to the Government in the weeks ahead.<\/p><p>The Government has recognised in its programme that a modernised post office network will provide a better range of financial services and e-commerce services for citizens and enterprise.  We need to be imaginative and to explore other ways to use the post office network.  The Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, made reference in the House last week to the potential to use post offices as hubs for remote working.  Engagement has already begun with An Post and I am keen to work with it to explore this potential.  It has also been imaginative, diversifying and expanding the services it offers.  It recently launched its green hub facility as a one-stop shop for home retrofitting.  New services such as these will drive footfall through post offices.<\/p><p>There is no doubt that Covid has had a negative effect on post office footfall, with an estimated 25% decrease in transactions.  Social welfare cash payments, which were reduced to a fortnightly payment in March, will return to a weekly payment of on 2 November.  This announcement has been welcomed by postmasters.  The recent report commissioned by the Irish Postmasters Union, IPU, on the post office network states that without the introduction of a public service obligation and further Government services through the post office network to increase turnover, the network faces an annual shortfall of &euro;17 million per annum from 2021 onwards.  These issues need to be addressed quickly and I can assure Deputies that work is under way in this regard.<\/p><p>A significant amount of time and effort has been spent in the past three years working on restructuring An Post, and I acknowledge the work of my predecessors in that regard.  This work was critical to save An Post and protect jobs and the post office network.  An Post has invested in training for all post offices in 2019 and 2020 to better equip postmasters to run their business, manage a profit and loss account and promote their businesses locally.  Significant investment has been made in redefining the network, including reducing the number of post offices, modernising the postmaster contract and updating the brand.<\/p> <p>The consolidation of the post office network has assured the widest possible distribution across the State with an ever-improving network.  The focus of the business is on developing a full range of financial services which will mitigate the ongoing reductions on the retail side.  The key focus continues to be on future-proofing the company and keeping it relevant to its customers with regard to the types of services it provides.  This restructuring has seen the development of new areas of business, particularly in parcel delivery but also in new retail areas and in financial services, which has resulted in a return to annual profitability since implementation of the plan first began.<\/p> <p> It is important to remember that, as with any business, it needs to grow and develop new products and meet the changing needs of its customers.  An Post already has a significant presence in financial services, providing local banking through approximately 940 branches.  In recent years, it has launched a current account, a credit card offering and loans.  It also has a growing foreign exchange business.  It has expanded in the area of e-commerce and has seen massive growth in its parcel business as well as in new green initiatives, placing sustainability at the heart of its business and adapting its fleet to provide zero carbon emission deliveries in Dublin.<\/p> <p> An investment loan of &euro;40 million from the European Investment Bank aims to support the implementation of a number of the projects underpinning An Post's strategic plan including post office renewal to allow An Post to offer upgraded retail services in fit-for-purpose outlets with appropriate digital and physical infrastructure.  Government made &euro;30 million available in State funding to support the renewal of the post office network and the continued fulfilment of a 5-day-per-week mail delivery service.  This reflects the Government commitment to sustaining a nationwide post office network and daily mail service.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has also recently approved a capital expenditure programme which, as part of the company's commitment to the sustainability of its network, is designed to develop the newer elements of An Post's financial services business and mitigate declining core mail volumes and revenues on the retail side of the business.<\/p> <p> Government acknowledges that An Post has the potential to provide additional Government services.  As the Minister of State responsible for An Post, I intend to work closely with the company to see if there is scope to channel more services through the network.  It is my intention that all options will be considered fully and that efforts will be redoubled to give effect to our commitment to ensuring a sustainable and viable post office network.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100005#C00200","speaker":"1578","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603272600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Fitzpatrick.  I do not know if he is here yet.  I thank my colleagues for bringing this motion before the House.  I also thank Ms. C&aacute;it Nic Amhlaoibh in our office for all the work she has done in putting this motion together.<\/p>  <p>  The local post office has long been the focal point of communities throughout Ireland.  This is particularly true of rural areas but they have also played an important role in the social fabric of communities in many urban settings.  The whole local post office network stands on the edge of a cliff.  Unless action is taken to ensure its economic viability, more and more post offices outside the larger urban areas will shut for good.<\/p>  <p>  It goes without saying that any difficulties or challenges faced by individual postmasters up to now have been gradually added to by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has reduced the volume of transactions by approximately 25%.  Government needs to throw them an economic lifeline by offering them the chance to provide services such as motor tax renewal in their local areas.  People should be able to renew driving licences, pay hospital charges and avail of a range of other services in their own localities.<\/p>  <p>  The post offices need an injection of funds, as outlined by the recent report by Grant Thornton which recommended annual public service obligation funding of &euro;17 million to support the post office network.  That report outlined how funding models of this type are already in place to support the post office networks in the UK, France, Spain, Belgium, Italy, Finland and Poland.  These have the approval of the European Commission, which shows there is no barrier to introducing such a levy here.<\/p>  <p>  I remember I spoke in the D&aacute;il on the issue of the threat to the future of post offices six years ago, back in 2014.  I stressed then, as I do now, the very important and unique role they play socially, culturally and economically.  In the interim, things have got worse instead of better for them.  We had another report by Grant Thornton back then, which said: \"Despite continued assertions by government officials as to the importance of the post office network, little support is being offered to them.\"  At that time the big issue was the threatened loss of the contract to deliver welfare payments.  That report also showed how the total number of post offices had shrunk from 1,361 in 2006 to 1,152 by 2012.<\/p>  <p>  Grant Thornton's latest report outlines that the total number today is down to 944, of which 45 are company post offices run directly by An Post while 899 are run as franchises by postmasters.  Grant Thornton warns that the network \"faces significant levels of unrestrained closures by the end of 2021\" unless action is taken.<\/p>  <p>  I stress that there is an enormous return for the State in investing in local post offices and ensuring their survival.  While it might be difficult to put a monetary figure on it, the social impact on communities would be very significant.  The reverse is also true; further closures could have a devastating impact.  There is a great gr&aacute; among people for their local post office and there is great support for doing something to ensure they remain open and viable.  Independent research earlier this year found that 91% of people said their post office provided a valuable service to the locality.  Some 86% supported the Government providing financial support to keep their post office open and a further 86% wanted more State services to be available at their post office.

Post offices need urgent Government assistance in order to survive the current crisis and build for the future so that we will have a profitable and sustainable post office network.<\/p>  <p>  An Post is more than the post office, it is a vital part of every local community in every village and town.  Post offices are not only a place where people conduct business, but also a place where social interaction takes place and, more often than not, the lifeblood of a local community.  In recent research carried out by Red C, it was found that 91% of those surveyed agreed that the post office provided a valuable service to the local community, 86% supported the Government providing financial support to keep their post office open and 86% wanted more State services to be available at the post office.  It is fair to say that we all realise that the local post office is much more than just a post office.  I believe everybody in this House will agree with me when I say that Government must do everything in its power to ensure that local post offices remain open.<\/p>  <p>  When a post office closes, other local businesses also suffer.  This has been shown to be true over the years.  In our motion, we ask D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to recognise that the volume of transactions within the post office network is down by an estimated 25% as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, which further threatens the viability of the network.  We call on the Government to designate the post office as the offline gateway of choice for citizens availing of State services due to its unique nationwide network and existing strong relationship with offline citizens.<\/p>  <p>  The statistics behind An Post are quite impressive.  Some 28% of the population, or 1.3 million people, continue to use the services of the post office every week, which distributes &euro;4.6 billion in social welfare payments.  Coming from a business background, I know the challenges being faced in what seems to be an impossible situation.  The post office needs Government support and a roadmap to the future.  An Post's losses mainly result from the ongoing transfer of traditional post office services online and the reduction in its traditional mails business.  I call on the Government to provide, first and foremost, funding to safeguard our post office network.  A sum of &euro;17 million does not seem to be a lot of money.  I plead with the Minister of State to keep the post offices open.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the roadmap, the situation will be more difficult.  For An Post to be viable, it must return to profitability.  In order for this to happen, it must be allowed the opportunity to provide more services than it currently provides.  We have heard in recent weeks that some major banking institutions are talking about pulling out of Ireland in the near future.  l am not alone in saying that all the major banks would prefer not to operate personal bank accounts and not to deal with the costs associated with them.  The reality, however, is that personal customers require an operational bank account.  This account is needed to make debit card payments, direct debit payments, standing order payments, money transfers and so forth.  There is a real opportunity for An Post to provide this service to personal account holders, probably in the form of a basic payment account.<\/p> <p>An Post is in a unique position to offer these services.  It is clear that the high street banks are not interested in this type of business, which presents an opportunity to An Post.  An Post already has the infrastructure in place and with possible co-operation with the credit union movement, it could also have the IT structure in place.  It would provide an opportunity to An Post to work closely with schools, especially primary schools.  It could encourage students to open their first account with An Post.  One will find that once people open an account at an early age and become familiar with this, they will stick with it.  I know from speaking with members of older generations that they would be happy to conduct their business with An Post rather than the main banks.<\/p> <p> This evening, the country will commence level 5 restrictions for a period of six weeks.  Many so-called non-essential businesses such as clothes shops, gift shops and shoe shops will unfortunately have to close their doors to the public.  The Government is actively encouraging these businesses to develop online business.  While I agree with this approach, since it gives these businesses the opportunity to continue to trade, I also believe that it gives the post office an opportunity to expand its services.  Local post offices should be given support to work with local businesses to provide a cost-effective and reliable delivery service to the businesses that require delivery of goods.  I know that a number of couriers carry out a similar service but I firmly believe the post office can provide a unique partnership with local businesses to provide a more cost-effective solution.  Local businesses need help to compete with large competitors, many of which are based outside the country.  In Dundalk, we actively encourage people to shop locally and to keep business in the area.<\/p> <p> An Post could benefit with regard to the motor tax.  Surely this service could be provided by An Post and provide much-needed revenue.  It is important that we all recognise the vital service that An Post provides to the local community in every village and town in the country.  It is also vital that we come to its rescue and that the Government provides the necessary funding to fill the current gap of &euro;17 million.  It should be noted that the Government already provides substantial funding to the bus and rail services to keep them operating and An Post should be given the same treatment.<\/p> <p> I spoke about the figure of &euro;17 million and the local community.  The Minister of State comes from the Galway area and, more than most people, realises the disservice done to An Post.  There are opportunities and the Government could work closely with An Post.  I know it costs a total of &euro;70 million.  I plead with the Government not to let this service go down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100006#D00300","speaker":"1600","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603273200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Regional Group for tabling this important motion.  Sinn F&eacute;in is happy to support it.  We have submitted an amendment which we believe further adds to the motion and we hope that people can support it.  The work of postmasters and workers throughout our postal service has been vital during this pandemic, ensuring that people can stay in contact, access their weekly payments and pay their bills.  I commend An Post's recent initiative of providing free post to our friends and family who are resident in nursing homes.  It is a fantastic idea and commendable, and I hope people make good use of it.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has always been vocal in its support for protecting the post office network.  Post offices are crucial services in our towns and villages and are especially important in rural Ireland where they provide essential services and serve as a meeting point in local communities.  Despite the invaluable role that our post offices play, the network has regrettably suffered from years of neglect by successive Governments, with hundreds of closures and the loss of vital outlets throughout rural Ireland.  These include post offices in my constituency of Meath East which were closed in 2018, including my local post office in Tara, and at Bellewstown and Clonalvy.  I remember them as a county councillor at the time and there are other examples.  Post office closures have had a severe impact on individual villages and communities.  Local shops subsequently closed.<\/p>  <p>  At that time, Sinn F&eacute;in tabled a motion on the future of our post office network.  Some 159 post offices were earmarked for closure, including seven in Meath.  There was little more than rhetoric from the then Government.  Nothing was done to secure the future of the network.  We asked that the proposals contained in the 2016 Kerr report, which included post offices providing alternative services such as financial services and Government services, be implemented immediately.  We also suggested that a new model of community banking be established through the post office network to fill the void left by commercial banks in rural Ireland.  Two years later, we are in much the same place, with even more challenges facing our post office network and little interest from Government in dealing with it.<\/p>  <p>  Last month, the Irish Postmasters Union commissioned a report which sets out the significant challenges faced by post offices across the State and highlights the significant value and contribution they make to our economy and society.  One of the central recommendations in this report is that a public service obligation be introduced to secure the future of the network and allow post offices to continue to provide their excellent and important services.  Some &euro;17 million per annum was suggested for this annual public service obligation.  When Sinn F&eacute;in tabled its motion on the future of post offices in September 2018, Fianna F&aacute;il tabled an amendment calling for just such a public service obligation to be introduced.  With Fianna F&aacute;il now the lead party in government, will it follow through on this commitment, which can secure the post office network, or is this just another broken promise?  I note there is no such commitment in the Government's amendment this morning.  We have included it in our amendment and, on that basis, we ask Fianna F&aacute;il and its colleagues in government to withdraw its amendment and support the Regional Group's motion and the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.<\/p>  <p>  Another proposal that we have included seeks the expansion of the role of post offices as a one-stop shop for those inquiring about and applying for Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland grants or other similar green initiatives.  These will be crucial in future.  There is a welcome and much-needed commitment from Government to expand these services, which we appreciate, but many may not be able to access these grants through online portals.  Our post offices should become a place where people can access information about these grants, talk to a person about them, be encouraged and persuaded if needs be, and get help in applying for them.  This can help to increase the uptake of these grants and also provide our post offices with a new avenue of business.  We are having a conversation at the Joint Committee on Climate Action about public involvement in addressing climate change and our obligations.  I believe that post offices can play a key role in outreach and engagement.  It is a win-win for our post offices and environment, and I ask the Minister to consider further expansion of this emerging role for post offices.<\/p>  <p>  We need creativity from the Government.  We cannot have business as usual.  We cannot come back next year with another debate on the same challenges.  Post offices are critical State infrastructure throughout our island and need proper investment, ambition and attention from this Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100007#E00200","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speech","time":1603273200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I add my voice to what Deputy O'Rourke has said.  It is straightforward.  We need to make decisions about vital matters and provide support.  I think we all accept, even based on what has been said today, that An Post is a necessity.  We have postmasters talking about negotiations on subvention and its possible end.  They are worried about whether they will continue to be personally viable.  As with many of these situations, we could lose too many of these post offices.  With regard to An Post management and the Irish Postmasters Union, everybody is now singing from the same hymn sheet.  We have the Kerr report, the Grant Thornton report and a need for the Government to put money where its mouth is.  It needs to provide a &euro;17 million public service obligation.  Combined with that, we need to ensure that we facilitate An Post by ensuring it maintains itself as a viable option.<\/p>  <p>  We know the difficulties we have.  We know the Minister is meeting Ulster Bank about the possibility that it will leave the market.  We are aware that retail banks are not really interested in front end dealings.  They are trying to move away from those.  We have a facility in the community, especially in rural areas where it can be more difficult for people to get in, particularly if they are maintaining a 5 km limit at this point in time.  We need to ensure that post offices are given the facility to be the banking service for local people.  We need to ensure that whatever resources they require to do that are provided.  We welcome any Government services that can be provided.  People are worried that some social welfare payments that will be paid directly into banks could reduce the viability of certain post offices.<\/p> <p>All this must be examined.  We must ensure that we give post offices the capacity to be able to deliver State services and that community involvement will be taken into account from the point of procurement.  I agree with the comments on what An Post is doing and its potential as a one-stop-shop as a green hub, which could be facilitated and empowered to a greater degree.  These are the things we need to do.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100007#E00300","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603273800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I support the motion and the amendment tabled by my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke.  I fully agree with the proposal put forward in the Grant Thornton report commissioned by the IPU, which indicates a &euro;17 million PSO contract as the only realistic solution to support the post office network, as well as serious consideration of what further Government services could be put through the post office network to make it more viable.  There have been concerted efforts over the past number of years to get people on certain social welfare payments to have their payments paid through the bank.  It is time to go back to a form of community banking through the post office network, something that is done in many other European countries.  SEAI grants, as has been mentioned, could also be paid and delivery services could be enhanced.<\/p>  <p>  I come from a village in Cavan called Kilnaleck.  In January 2019, its post office was closed.  It was one of five post offices closed in County Cavan at that time, and one of 159 closed nationwide.  Kilnaleck is a small village with more than 80 businesses.  It is very vibrant and has a great hinterland but that was not taken into account.  The criterion was if it was a settlement of less than 500, its post office would close.  It took no cognisance of the hinterland or that the post office provides a service, not just something about making profit.  It forced businesses and individuals to go elsewhere for their financial needs.  It was another knock following the Ulster Bank closing in 2013 and the closure of the credit union in 2016.  It has meant a loss of business to the village, which has also had a serious impact on people.  There are many elderly people in the area who do not have transport and they had to find some way for going to a different village to collect their social welfare payment.  Many were in tears on the day that the post office closed.  Many foreign nationals living in the area depended on the post office and similarly they had no transport to go elsewhere.  They were also left at a loss.  They used the post office regularly.  We speak of investing in rural Ireland and we are talking about revitalising our villages in towns, yet we are draining people away by closing the services they need.  Investing in An Post and keeping the post offices open would be the best way to keep rural Ireland open as well.  I do not want to see what happened in Kilnaleck being allowed to happen anywhere else.  More services and more investment need to be put into the post office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100008#F00200","speaker":"1513"},{"type":"speech","time":1603273800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I thank the Regional Group for tabling the motion.  The post office network is the backbone of rural Ireland.  It provides a meeting place in the heart of our communities.  The familiarity of the post office gives many in rural Ireland great comfort at times of need.  They are usually run by local people who are well known and trusted in their communities.  It brings rural Ireland to the rest of the world.  It is a place where people can collect their money or send money to the four corners of the world to relatives and loved ones, which is vital to our rural communities who have lost many of their youth to emigration.  Furthermore, post offices are crucial to everyday life as they are often the only access to ATM services, the payment of household bills and the household budget package.  It also supports social interactions.  They are meeting places for many in our communities and they often provide the only face-to-face interactions for older people going about their business.  Our banks have turned to self-service and our younger people are leaving but our post offices have remained the beating heart of our communities.<\/p>  <p>  I am concerned by the risk for further closures in rural Ireland.  In 2016, the Government made a commitment to our post offices and, in 2018, closed 159 stand-alone post offices, including six in County Clare.  I recall attending all the meetings and then hearing An Post's announcement that it would pump &euro;50 million into the post office network in city areas and opening new shops at a time rural Ireland was losing them.

In many villages in Wexford, the local post office was the very first build in the parish after the church.  Country life is a different way of life.  The successive failures of Governments to support An Post in rural communities has harmed local parishes across this island.  Besides being an antidote to loneliness, the rural post office is also an antidote to digital isolation.  Many people in rural Ireland  do not engage with Zoom or Microsoft Teams.  For many citizens, particularly the elderly, an online life is not something they partake in.   We must ensure these citizens are given a guarantee that the Government will fund rural post offices and expand services.  That is why I particularly welcome this motion and the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment to invest in expanding the services offered by the network of post offices.  The original motion calls for a motor tax renewal service to be conducted in the post office.  That is one of the ways to safeguard our rural post offices, but other services included in our amendment such as applying for SEAI grants through the post office should also be examined. <\/p>  <p>  The introduction of a PSO to guarantee the current post office network and prevent any further closures, as the amendment calls for, would be a welcome solution. <\/p>  <p>  Now is the time for the Government to show its sincerity in backing rural Ireland, in backing communities and in backing an post and rural post offices.

No one in the bank will help customers to fill out a little application form or allow them &euro;5 off their ESB bill, for example.  It is the only hub left in some of our towns and villages.  Our amendment referred to having a one-stop-shop.  They are the only meeting places in many areas because they have lost their Garda stations, shops and pubs, and rural transport is very limited.  It might be the only chance that people have of getting out to meeting people once a week.  It is a vital service.  <\/p>  <p>  Recently, my own town lost our post office to a fire.  That affected more than 9,000 people and caused great panic and consternation.  That demonstrated how vital postal services.  It only took a few weeks before the post office was up and running again and I commend An Post on that.  There was great community spirit and tie-in between the post offices of Carrigtwohill and Castlemartyr, which offered their services.  It is often forgotten that postal services are about community.  They are community-led and are about community spirit and respect.  <\/p>  <p>  The final line of the Minister of State's opening contribution stated: \"It is my intention that all options will be considered fully and that efforts will be redoubled to give effect to our commitment to ensuring a sustainable and viable post office network.\"  Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment is precisely what the Minister of State committed to, yet the Government has tabled a counter motion.

It is not only an economic service they provide in these areas but also a social service.  The closure of post offices and how they have been treated over the years has been absolutely destructive to rural Ireland.  One postmaster from Mayo, with whom I was talking this morning, said that they just do not get it in Dublin about post offices.  I appeal to the Minister not to look at the cost-benefit analysis carried out by civil servants who do not understand rural Ireland and the importance of post offices.<\/p>  <p>  When I spoke to the Minister on the previous occasion, I raised the utility incentives being used to encourage customers to go online.  This has been done overtly and covertly in terms of trying to bypass the post offices.  That is wrong and detrimental to rural Ireland, as well as to the future of post offices.  It is time to stop talking about post offices.  We have done so for many years.  It is now time to put these actions in place.  There are real solid opportunities which need to be implemented urgently, such as motor tax and driving licence renewals, as well as SEAI applications and Passport Express, the latter which was taken away from post offices.

It calls on us to recognise their role and support the sustainability of this public service.  Rural post offices are vital connections and nodal points in villages, like Goleen, Kealkill and Kilbrittain, which sustain the local shop and other services.  Post offices also provide a sense of community.  It is a place for meeting people, sharing news and checking up on each other.  The network has a unique reach into every community.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, none of these qualities will feature on a balance sheet.  International research shows that post offices are used significantly more by rural populations than by urban ones.  Often it is the only place for banking and accessing State services.  Moreover, they are an incredible asset to local businesses enabling enterprise and employment.  Rural businesses rely on them for financial services and, increasingly, to send out online orders which have become more important under the new Covid restrictions.  My family business is dependent on our local post office in Skibbereen which provides excellent service.  Orders sent out on any evening arrive to destinations anywhere in Ireland the following day.  We cannot underestimate the importance of that network.<\/p><p>The 2018 document, A New Vision for Post Office Services in Ireland, claims to reimagine a new future for post office services in Ireland.  However, on rural post offices, it only guarantees the preservation of post offices in settlements of over 500 people which could lead to closures of over two thirds of the post offices in west Cork.  It also states that, in rural areas, 95% of the population should be within 15 km of at least one post office, which is of little consolation to people on the Beara, Sheep's Head and Mizen peninsulas.<\/p><p>An Post does not have a choice because of the financial constraints under which it operates.  It is up to us as legislators to set out the policies that recognise the role of post offices and the Government to fund them.  This age-old argument has been played out in the House many times and in other jurisdictions.  In a 1994 discussion on the closure of rural post offices, it was noted that communities feel disenfranchised and powerless by such closures, and that the affect the elderly, people with disabilities and those on low incomes most adversely.  Over 25 years later, these points remain as valid.<\/p><p>The motion recognises that post offices provide an important place for offline members of our communities, for those who do not or cannot access services online, elderly people, Travellers-Minc&eacute;ir, people with disabilities and those in direct provision.  While many of us are comfortable operating our administration and finances online, there are people who choose not to or who cannot due to financial reasons, no access to the Internet or other barriers.  It is incumbent on us to ensure the State provides alternatives.  The post office is ideally placed for this.  Post offices are offline gateways.  As the motion puts it, it is not just about transactions but about helping to fill out forms, checking up on people and getting people calling into town.<\/p><p>A report on Monday from Safeguarding Ireland and Banking and Payments Federation Ireland highlighted the vulnerability of people who needed help from others to manage their money during the pandemic.  Regrettably, Covid restrictions have increased opportunities for financial abuse or the erosion of financial independence.  As bank branches close and transfer their functions online, people are left without post offices and credit unions to carry out face-to-face banking and financial transactions.  It is important we help preserve these human-centred services for those who need them.  The Sinn F&eacute;in amendment recognises this role within the proposal for a new model of community banking through post offices.<\/p><p>Article 19 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities guarantees the right to live independently and be included in the community.  This means services and facilities should be available for people with disabilities in their area, regardless of their ability to go online or have access to a car.  Post offices need to be considered in this context.  They are embedded in communities, staffed by people who know the area as well as the needs of their patrons.  This is the type of service we should be lauding and trying to replicate, not letting wither for some limited economic reasoning.<\/p><p>This motion is a prompt to reflect on the role post offices have in all communities.

I am particularly impressed with the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, SWOT, analysis element of it.  The report refers to the strengths of the post office with its premium brand recognition and positive public perception, being at the heart of the community, supporting local economic growth and social vibrancy in those communities, a proven track record of service delivery, a loyal customer base, being community and social centred, having the capacity to handle additional business, as well as being Ireland's largest retail network with an unrivalled geographical reach and local knowledge of the network.  The weaknesses are the structural decline in letter post volumes, growing digitalisation and e-substitution, dependence on social welfare contracts, increased competition and the failure to grow profitable service lines, and uncommercial post office branches.<\/p>  <p>  It is a report which looks inward and is honest about what the post office's failings and weaknesses are.  The opportunities are a key element of the SWOT analysis.  They include assuming responsibility for additional Government services - \"the State on your doorstep\"- capability and infrastructure, the ability to extend business, available capacity to grow service offerings for public and private sector organisations, opening up the financial services market, e-commerce and parcel growth, capture new customers and increase market share through to provision of complimentary services and products.<\/p> <p>I could go through the threats but they have been well itemised.<\/p> <p> The executive summary of the report states \"[t]he Post Office Network consisting of 899 post offices, as operated by independent contractors serving local communities across Ireland, faces significant levels of unrestrained closures by the end of 2021 without urgent Government intervention\".  That is the key sentence.  Year in, year out we all stand up in the D&aacute;il and speak about the importance of postal service provision in this country.  We hear platitudes spoken on the issue.  At the end of the day, as the report highlights, the cost of operating the post office network is &euro;70 million.  The revenue generated by the retail element associated with postmasters is &euro;53 million.  Therefore, the funding shortfall which must be made good to prevent unrestrained closures of post offices is &euro;17 million. <\/p> <p> What can the Government do to bridge that gap?  As I have already noted, the report is very good at identifying the network's strengths.  How can we build the business base and expand the business model to give post offices a fighting chance, whether they are located in a rural setting or a city like Cork, Galway or Limerick?  Post offices everywhere face the same types of challenges.<\/p> <p> It is important that as consumers we make the conscious decision to use post offices.  The volume of customers is an issue.  The demise of letter-writing has obviously had a knock-on effect.  One could argue that the growth of the parcel service will be relatively short-lived because companies like Amazon are building their own parallel networks.  I wonder about the medium-term or long-term sustainability of that contract with An Post.  I have my doubts about whether it will turn out to be a profit centre for An Post after all.<\/p> <p> We need to move beyond platitudes.  This is a very good report.  The Government must examine and interrogate it further with an ethic of ensuring that post offices are planted firmly and sustainably in communities.  There is a template in this report.  If it is given a fighting chance, the imbalance in those figures can be addressed. <\/p> <p> One of the proposals involves a public service obligation.  This should be seriously considered by the Government.  As the report highlights, it is already in place.  This is an excellent report because it is written for politicians like ourselves, who probably do not have time to go through reports of this nature line by line.  The executive summary provides a very good synopsis of what is needed.  Countries with approval from the European Commission to operate a post office network through a PSO include France, Italy, Germany, Poland, Finland, Spain and the recently departed but still significant United Kingdom.  We do not have one but I think it should be considered.  Interestingly, the report also highlights that other industries that previously operated under a PSO in Ireland include agriculture, aviation, rail, finance, bus transport, radio, housing and energy.  That is particularly significant.  As politicians we are all given to the odd platitude.  If we can move beyond rhetoric, embrace the report and think differently about what a PSO can look like, we will have an opportunity to build a sustainable future for the post office network.  We will support the motion on that basis. <\/p> <p> We cannot look at post offices in a rural setting without looking at the whole area of rural development.  It is a tangential point, but it is worth highlighting the report of the Irish Local Development Network on budget 2021.  The report outlined three core concerns, namely, that no funding has been provided for new Leader projects in 2021; no funding has been identified for the delivery and administration of the Leader programme in 2021; and no interim national rural development programme has been announced for the period from 2021 to 2023, as committed to in the programme for Government.  One might say this has nothing to do with post offices.  However, post offices have everything to do with the rural economy, how money can be spent to sustain it and the multiplier effect of money flowing into it.  We need to be more expansive in our thinking about the rural economy and rural society.  The post office network must be the fulcrum through which rural society survives and thrives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100009#G00400","speaker":"1514","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603275000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>We will fully support this motion but I note that it is not the first motion of its kind that we have supported.  This issue came up again and again in the term of the previous D&aacute;il but nothing seems to have changed.  I thank the Deputies who moved the motion and congratulate the postmasters.  They have campaigned relentlessly on this issue.  They have given a lot of thought and effort to trying to convince the political establishment that keeping post offices open by subsidising them is the right thing to do.<\/p>  <p>  To refer to what the postmasters' submission to us actually sought, one recommendation is for An Post to provide the sole bank account for social welfare payments.  It seems eminently sensible that State money should go back into a State-subsidised entity.  There is a lot to be discussed in regard to An Post and banking.  We must have an entirely separate discussion of the German or Swiss community banking model that we have discussed in the past.  Again, that is eminently sensible.  The postmasters have called for investment to facilitate banking through An Post and for all Government Departments to channel their business through the post office.  They have also called for an overall strategy for the sustainability of the post office network.  I thank the postmasters for their struggle and for keeping the pressure on all of us to take this issue very seriously. <\/p>  <p>  I am sure it has not gone unnoticed that Covid-19 has had as much of an impact on this business as on any other.  An Post's business fell by 30% during the period of the pandemic, but it should be noted that it was one of the entities that stayed open through the last lockdown.  Without that sort of social connection, we would be a much poorer society.  <\/p>  <p>  We support the motion and we also support whatever degree of subsidy is needed to maintain and expand the network.  This is partly because of its importance to rural life and community and also because it stayed open through the Covid-19 pandemic.  However, I would also like to make a few points about its importance to urban life.  It is not just in villages and towns throughout the country that An Post plays an important role.  Postmasters have also put their shoulder to the wheel and campaigned to keep services open in villages and communities like Rialto, Ballyfermot and Chapelizod, to name just a few in my constituency.  They have a genuine social connection to the community.  Seeing this as a State service rather than something to be played around with for the sake of profit is crucial to maintaining the social fabric.  It is true that the era of electronic media has impacted on the volume of postal deliveries.  However, these developments are not what is killing our post office network.<\/p>  <p>  I think we can agree on the important role played by the postal network in rural communities and in urban working-class communities.  It plays a vital social role and represents a link to the wider community that should be safeguarded and extended.  Fianna F&aacute;il is now in power.  When that party sat on this side of the House it vociferously and passionately supported many motions to keep the post office network open, create a community banking system, etc.<\/p> <p>Instead, we are seeing the painful decline of the post office network.  This is not just down to demographics or the inevitable sign of modernity; rural post offices are closing as a result of a political decision.<\/p> <p> The inability and unwillingness of the Government to give the kind of direct subsidies and support that are required cannot be explained by ignorance of, disinterest in or a disconnect from with what is going on.  The reason for the post office closures is neoliberalism and the slavish devotion of many of the parties in this House to the rules and strictures of that economic model.  This is the tendering of Government contracts so that non-union, low-paid and precarious employment by firms can undercut what post office networks can achieve.<\/p> <p> This is happening across all services and sectors.  We have seen it with health, education and transport.  Unless something has a tangible or monetary value and can create profit, the neoliberal model deems it useless.  If the system does not have the ability to turn a profit, the idea is that it must be commodified and privatised.  That is the philosophy at the heart of the decline in our post office network.  This means there is a fight with whoever is in power to keep the social fabric that matters to rural and urban communities if the Government believes in that economic model.<\/p> <p> The other matter relates to not being able to expand the post office network as a rural or urban community banking structure.  This is no accident and it was not even a decision of this House, in many ways, as it is a reflection of the power and dominance of the pillar banks.  They have effectively killed a proposal to set up an alternative community banking system because they see it as a potential rival to their massive profits.<\/p> <p> We support both the motion and the postmasters in their campaign.  We believe the economic model at the heart of driving this once again puts the interests of profit before the interests of people and communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100010#H00200","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603275600,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank the Regional Group and Deputy Denis Naughten in particular for moving this very important motion.

This is a valuable resource as in rural areas, the postman or postwoman may be the only individual a person might meet in a day or week.<\/p>  <p>  What these people offer amounts to a meet-and-greet service.  They are always looking out for the needs of the people, particularly the elderly.  They know everybody by name rather than number.  All we seem to be doing now is rewarding the banks, who screwed us over while we bailed them out.

This is happening all around the country.<\/p>  <p>  When knowledge is required, what is the best source?  It is the post office.  Not everybody is an expert on the Internet but all the Government has done is discouraged people from going to communities and meeting and greeting others.  It is trying to take away everything from the people who go to post offices.  The Government wants people to use services where they are known by a number rather than a name.

In my time in the D&aacute;il, I have heard talk of support for the post office network from big political parties when in opposition but when in government that support seems to end.  Instead of creating a vision for post offices, we have seen successive Governments leave rural post offices starved of resources.<\/p>  <p>  I live on a peninsula with three post offices at Goleen, Schull and Ballydehob, and like post offices in Kealkill or even as far east as Kilbrittain, they are a lifeline to their communities.  More often I see the people in post offices looking to think outside the box because they are getting little or no state aid.  They know they are in serious trouble and struggling to survive.  They may be looking at setting up part of the post office as a caf&eacute; and they are trying their best to generate some sort of income for survival.  The State continues to refuse support for these post offices.<\/p>  <p>  There is state funding for the post office network in the UK, France, Spain, Belgium, Italy, Finland and Poland with the approval of the European Commission.  Unfortunately, this country has failed to recognise the great work that the post office network has done in this country, right down to the person delivering post on the street day and night.  With social welfare payments, people are being advised to move to the electronic system but people used to visit the post office and do their transactions there.  They are being pushed away.

He made important decisions that were difficult in the interest of nothing but keeping open as many post offices as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I declare that I am a postmaster of a very small rural post office and am glad of that.  I am very proud of the network.  I will nonetheless highlight mistakes that have been made and post offices have taken a hit.  For example, half of their business disappeared because payments were changed to being every two weeks instead of every week.  We should remember that salaries are not paid to postmasters but that we get a commission on every transaction.  Every time a transaction is made, whether it is selling a stamp, lodging money to a post office account or a person collecting a payment, the post office earns its crust.<\/p> <p>There is one thing I have no interest whatsoever in and it is very seldom people would be heard saying this.  I respect the work that was done on the report that was brought out recently but it is putting the hand out to the Government looking for money.  As the owner of a post office, I am looking for nothing from anybody for anything.  What I want is work.  I want more people to come into my post office and my neighbours' and friends' post offices.  We want footfall and business.  Let us take the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, for instance.  If that had been channelled through our post offices, it would have been a lifeline to us during this critical time because people would have been doing their transactions and business through our network rather than through the main pillar banks.  We should not forget community banking, which is the model in New Zealand.  That was a success there and I do not see why it could not have been used here.

They provide a service that needs to be maintained.  I was a Deputy between 2011 and 2016 when, because of the completely reckless behaviour of previous Governments, there was a complete retrenchment of public services.  Savings had to be found everywhere, in the most horrible places imaginable.  That put huge pressure on the post office network.  A number of post offices were marked to close.  I worked with local communities in Broadford and Cratloe and their work prevented the closure of those post offices.  Unfortunately, during the lifetime of the previous D&aacute;il, other post offices closed.<\/p>  <p>  The deficit we are running at the moment is going to lead to similar pressures on post offices and public services.  We are running a deficit of approximately 6% of GDP, which looks fantastic on paper.  It is the second lowest deficit in the eurozone, lower even than that of Germany.  However, we all know that GDP is not a realistic measure of the economy because our corporate tax take means we are effectively eating other countries' lunch and we cannot do that, or get away with doing that, forever.  If one looks at the deficit we are running as a percentage of GNI, Seamus Coffey pointed out in a frightening statistic this morning.  It is 11.5%, which is the highest deficit in the EU.  There is a price to be paid for that, which will be social services, including post offices.<\/p>  <p>  The delivery company, DPD ,has just announced it is hiring 700 people.  That is good news but why did the post office hand over the parcel delivery service to the extent it did?

I strongly exhort the Government to put structures in place that will ensure the long-term viability of the post office network.  I have been involved in community development and politics for more than 30 years.  At no time in that 30 years has the closure of post offices and campaigns to save them been off the agenda.  Sometimes these campaigns succeeded, sometimes they did not, and other times the threat of closure arose again a few years later despite the earlier reprieve.  That is why we need to ensure post offices can remain viable and that opportunities for further and enhanced provision of services are put in place.  Viability is the key issue and the sticking plaster solution of keeping the odd post office branch open for a few years is simply not working and will not work in the long term.  I do not need to emphasise the value of the post office network from an economic and social perspective, but I acknowledge that when we use the word \"lifeline\" to describe a post office, in many cases it is not an exaggeration.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, with the current move to working from home and people moving to towns, villages and rural areas across the country, the onus is on the Government to ensure the availability of local services.  The IPU, has produced an excellent report undertaken by Grant Thornton.  It is crystal clear that in 2021 there will be a &euro;17 million shortfall in revenue.  To break it down, each post office across the State will have losses of approximately &euro;19,000 per annum.  This shows the extreme urgency of the situation and, as I said earlier, the timeliness of this motion.  The IPU is requesting that An Post be the sole provider of the bank accounts required to facilitate the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection strategy to move to e-payments.  It also asks that all Departments channel business through the post office, including motor tax, driver's licences, etc.<\/p>  <p>  We are sometimes told that the EU public procurement directive will not allow any interference in the tendering process but governments can and must use the flexibility contained within that directive to help ensure both the social and economic value systems are embedded in the tender process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100012#K00400","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1603276200,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100012#K00500","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1603276200,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I thought I had three minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100012#K00600","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1603276200,"counter":42,"content":"<p>The Deputy has had three minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100012#K00700","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1603276200,"counter":43,"content":"<p>That is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100012#K00800","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1603276200,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak and commend the Regional Group on bringing this motion forward.  In the previous D&aacute;il, Deputies Danny and Michael Healy-Rae and the Rural Independent Group brought forward a motion on this matter and nothing was done.  I am critical of the IPU.  I will be straight about that.  I warned two years ago that the ordinary postmaster and postmistress never got an opportunity to see the legal advice on the new contracts being signed.  They were rammed down their throats at the time and they were told to either sign them or forget about it.  That was the beginning of where we are today.<\/p>  <p>  If one is in business, one has to be looking at new opportunities.  As was pointed out earlier, 700 people are being taken on by DPD.  If An Post were cute at it, it would be ahead of the posse because that opportunity was there for the company as well.  An Post would rather go around in big vans telling us it has gone carbon-neutral with electric vans than decide how to have a good banking model or bring in new initiatives to keep it viable in different areas.  We have to get the public on board.  We have to bring things into the post office network that will entice people to go in that door.  We have to make sure it is like a new service and is promoted but An Post seems to keep playing the same tune the whole time thinking it is going to get a different result.  That will not work.<\/p>  <p>  We need post offices.  They are not just about the post, letters, pensions or so on.  No one living in a large city understands what a post office means in a rural community where someone might not see another person for a full week.  People who might not have heard a word all week will go in and learn who died or who had a child or whatever went on in the area.  It is about being able to speak to someone for the first time in maybe a full week for their mental health and well-being.  If it is only for that, given the number of suicides we have seen around the country, we need to sit down and put a plan in place.  We cannot have this patch job of doing it year to year.

That is a testament to him and his commitment to his community, to which he has given his life in many forms.

We must examine where we place post offices as we consider where we are in the latter end of 2020.  There is an opening there to ensure that post offices are kept at the centre of our communities by having digital hubs.  There is much talk among various Government Departments about ensuring that there are digital hubs.  We have seen how society has transformed in respect of working from home and that has been way beyond the political curve.  Many of us in this House have been talking <i>ad nauseam<\/i>about decentralisation and getting Departments to rural communities, but the establishment was laughing at the idea.<br\/><br\/>Society has moved beyond that now and people are working from home in rural communities while giving as good a service as they ever have.  In that context, it is important that we look at the model of the post offices.  Before any more post offices close, it must be recognised that they are vital focal points in communities.  They must be engaged further, established as digital hubs and they must get more footfall.  Many speakers have asked how we can get more business into post offices.  To do that, it is necessary to offer the services society needs today.  I refer to making the post office more attractive and ensuring that it continues to be the centre it always has been.  I state that because there is as much need to have a centre in rural and urban communities today as there ever has been.  It behoves us to look at that aspect.<br\/><br\/>Many fine words, going back several years, have been uttered regarding a whole-of-government approach to post offices.  We are now, however, at a juncture where society has been transformed due to the impact of this desperate pandemic besetting us in recent months.  We must look at the positive aspects that exist for our rural communities and in that regard and to keep the focal point that is the post office, we must ensure that we enhance whatever State services can be put into post offices.  We must also ensure that our post offices are viable for the future and a system of digital hubs based on the post office network is the way to do that.

As the Minister of State with responsibility for eGovernment, I am keen to see as many public services put online as possible, not least because people expect it.  People are now used to conducting their commercial and social lives online, and there is no reason that the Government should not deliver services to people online as well.<\/p>  <p>  There was a huge increase in the uptake of online digital Government services during this pandemic.  That was by necessity, of course, and involved people who traditionally would not have used our services online.  There was a huge increase in sign-up and new services were also offered, including, for example, the PUP, which most people took up online.  People also got the results of their leaving certificate examination online and applied to the CAO for college places online.  The services availed of, therefore, went beyond the traditional online renewal of passports, which can be done completely without going into an office, or driver licences.<\/p>  <p>  However, there are people who cannot use digital services for various reasons.  That may be because of age, disability or difficulty in coping with the language, and those people will need help.  The State is not a commercial operation; we are here to provide public services.  People with those kinds of difficulties need what are sometimes referred to as assisted digital services.  They need to go into an office, and that could be a post office, an Intreo office or other locations such as Citizens Information offices, where somebody can sit down at a computer screen and help those people access the services to which they are entitled.  Such provision will ensure that people are not sidelined, and that concept and goal will be included in the updated national digital strategy this year.<\/p>  <p>  The Internet has been a threat and a difficulty for the post office network because the increase in email has been taking away what was that network's basic business of delivering letters.  Luckily, however, the post office network did not just sit there and the opportunities that were also presented by the Internet were adopted.  The post office network is thriving as an institution and post offices have sustained their presence because they have managed to get delivery business via the Internet as well.  When we have dealings in the post office with postmasters and postmen and postwomen, the staff are highly professional, innovative and a wide range of financial and public services are available.  The post office is an institution which is a shining example of a State agency and the post office network is to be admired.  One reason we should do that is because much post is being delivered by zero-emissions vehicles, thus saving people from air pollution in urban areas and reducing the impact on climate change.<\/p>  <p>  The importance of the post office network has been clearly demonstrated throughout the pandemic.  A range of initiatives provided through post offices has helped to support local communities, the elderly and the vulnerable.  Initiatives such as check-ins on elderly and vulnerable customers, the delivery of newspapers and the recent commitment to free mail to residents in care facilities have been welcomed across the country.  We all share an appreciation of these initiatives and a belief that there is potential for An Post and the post office network to make a further contribution across many areas of public business and community life in Ireland.  The programme for Government recognises this and also notes the Government's commitment to putting the post office network on a sustainable footing.  The serious decline in the volume of mail and the effect of Covid-19 on footfall through post offices have severely impacted the postal network and postmasters.  I am aware of the concern expressed by the IPU and that has been raised directly with the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton.<\/p>  <p>  Subsequently, the IPU published a report, commissioned from Grant Thornton, on the post office network.  According to that report, the network is at a critical juncture and faces an annual shortfall of &euro;17 million from 2021 onwards if a PSO levy is not introduced.  It has been long-standing policy of successive Governments that postal services will not be directly subsidised by Government.  The announcement by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, that social welfare payments, which had moved to a fortnightly schedule from the end of March, will be restored to a weekly schedule from 2 November, is very welcome.  The IPU had raised concerns regarding the impact of that change on local businesses and has also now welcomed this announcement.<\/p>  <p>  Government efforts have also been focused on supporting An Post in the roll-out of new services and the delivery of its strategic plan.  The ongoing transformation in the company aims to ensure the financial viability of An Post and the continued fulfilment of its mandate to deliver a mail delivery service and a viable post office network.  The Government has already made &euro;50 million available in State funding to support the renewal of the post office network and a further &euro;15 million has been made available to go towards the continued fulfilment of a five-day per week mail service.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister also recently approved capital expenditure designed to develop the newer elements of An Post's financial services business and mitigate declining core mail volumes and revenues on the retail side of the business.  A report by an interdepartmental group on the provision of offline Government services will be published in the coming months and considered as part of the national digital strategy.  It proposes a more coherent approach to offline service provision, with the adoption of a whole-of-government approach, which should be driven centrally.  The sustainability of the post office network is of enormous importance and significant work has been undertaken already on the renewal of the network as part of the transformation programme.<\/p>  <p>  Consolidation of the network has seen 152 post offices closed as part of the transformation programme, with business transferred to 128 nearby offices.  Some 89% of these offices saw an uplift in business and 51% saw double-digit growth, with an average growth across the 128 post offices of 9.6%.  The impact of co-location has been positive, with business in co-located offices up 11% compared to stand-alone offices, which includes An Post's own large 46 stand-alone company offices.  As a key pillar of the transformation strategy in 2018 this has worked, with 62% of the network now co-located.  This has increased from 48% in 2018 and the target for the network is 70%.<\/p>  <p>  The capital investment put in place as part of the transformation agreement with postmasters helps on the relocations.  An Post has been proactive in taking a range of steps in recent years to diversify into new revenue streams for postmasters through the provision of new services and the sale of additional retail products.  These initiatives include the expansion of financial services products with the launch of the An Post Money brand and the introduction of an An Post current account, credit cards and loans, as well as growing foreign exchange business and introducing card-based foreign exchange services.  I also refer to the expansion of e-commerce services, with a particular focus on the SME market, with such services being available across the counter in post offices to facilitate the growth in parcel business.  This has also facilitated growth in existing retail lines, such as gift cards, lottery tickets, bill payment and money transfer, through the expansion of these retail lines and focused promotion in all offices.  I also refer to the introduction of new, green-based initiatives, such as the green hub for home refurbishment and retrofitting.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to investment in post offices, through its capital investment fund, An Post has invested in training in all post offices, in 2019 and 2020, to better equip postmasters to run their businesses.  It has been noted in the House before that post offices must be equipped with a range of services which will attract and retain footfall, but these measures are pointless unless the public use the services provided by post offices.  Key to the survival of any renewed post office network is the provision of a range of services which are attractive to customers and of value to An Post.  The manner and method by which the public conducts its business has altered as a result of the pandemic.  Determining what Government services will best fit the bill in this current context is no easy challenge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100013#L00200","speaker":"1479"},{"type":"speech","time":1603276800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I am proud to be present this morning, as a member of the Regional Group, to promote this important motion to protect the Irish post office network.  As a number of speakers have said, it is timely due to the Grant Thornton report being released a couple of weeks ago.  The report had devastating findings.  There was an annual shortfall of &euro;17 million, which equates to approximately &euro;20,000 per post office.  The report's central recommendation is that a PSO levy is introduced or that a PSO charge from the State is used to plug this gap.  I take the Minister of State's point regarding the long-standing practice, but perhaps on this issue an exception should be entertained.  The main reason is that such a subsidy is available throughout the European Union at present.  If it is good enough for other European countries, with the blessing of the European Commission, it is something we should consider here as well.<\/p>  <p>  The Grant Thornton report is quite unpleasant reading.  It says there is huge strain on the post office network at present.  Footfall is way down, transactions are down over 25% and, as a result, the incomes of postmasters have fallen dramatically.  With over 900 branches nationwide, the post office network is crucial for urban, regional, rural and coastal communities.  Some 1.3 million people, and I include myself among them, use post offices every week.  Most importantly, the network provides a vital service for those who are financially or socially marginalised or excluded.  Other contributors mentioned that in the debate.  The postmasters want to stay in business, but the financial viability and sustainability of the sector are being challenged like never before.  Consequently, many local post offices are likely to close in the near term, unless the conditions in which they operate change dramatically.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the change from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection whereby it will begin to pay social welfare payments on a weekly basis from 2 November.  I was happy to hear the Minister of State confirm that this morning.  However, more can be done to modernise the service and enhance the viability of the network.  For example, as has been mentioned, the post office network should be designated as an offline gateway of choice for citizens availing of State services.  This would be a significant improvement, perhaps even a lifeline, for the sector.  Unlike many financial institutions, the post office is still a very trusted brand.  It maintains excellent relationships with all its customers, particularly those in the elderly or isolated demographic.  There is no reason that it cannot be designated as a one-stop-shop or hub for additional State services.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of motor tax renewals through the post office appears to be a logical first step.  Not only would this local service further reduce the list of standard excuses for not displaying a valid car tax certificate, it would also have the additional benefit of taking significant pressure off busy local authority offices, which should be focused more on providing strategic planning and direction for their counties instead of being distracted by routine administration.  Enhancing the amount of financial services available at post offices would also help considerably.  This is crucial.  With the reduction in the number of bank branches throughout the country, countless towns and villages have no direct access to financial services.  The Minister of State will appreciate that this has massive ramifications for communities across regional and rural Ireland, for both individuals and small and medium enterprises.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, the post office is a key component, and in many cases the only component, of the economic and social infrastructure of local communities throughout this country.  The network's recent commitment to provide free mail to residents of care homes is another example of this.  The network needs and wants to survive.  We should push more business through the post offices.  I look forward to the Government's report on the provision of offline services which is due to be published shortly.  If the Government is serious about the national spatial strategy and its commitment to balanced regional development, it must act swiftly and decisively to protect this vital network before it is too late.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100014#M00100","speaker":"1587"},{"type":"speech","time":1603277400,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I note the Government's amendment.  Its content and the speeches by the Ministers of State clearly acknowledge that nothing new has happened to support the post office network since I left office.  I was one of the very few Deputies to make a submission to the Kerr report.  I remind Members that I was presented with a situation in 2016 in which the collapse of An Post was about to happen within 18 weeks.  The decisions I took have led to a position where that company is profitable.  Every Member on the Opposition benches talks about the importance of the post office network but, other than me, every party and Member who went into government forgot about that network.  That said, the Government has, on foot of the motion, outlined its commitment to put more business through the network, including the provision of offline government services.  We will give it the opportunity to fulfil that objective, despite the fact that there was no Cabinet representative present throughout the debate.  However, I put the Government on notice that if there is no movement within the next six months, we will revisit this issue.<\/p>  <p>  Local post offices must become the one-stop-shop for all government services, not only to minimise the risk relating to Covid-19 but also to ensure that the 950-office network does not collapse.  Since the emergence of Covid-19 last March, access to many government services has been restricted for those who do not want to, or cannot, use the digital options.  The post offices have remained open throughout the pandemic.  There must be direct intervention by the Government to develop new State services for the post office network, in line with the previous commitment given to use the network as the offline option for all government services, and to pay a fee of &euro;17 million for this service, as outlined in the Grant Thornton report.  While we hear that we must learn to live with Covid-19, there has been a failure to deliver alternative ways to engage with government services other than by trying to force people to go online.  This does not work for everyone.  Some 55% of people aged between 65 and 74 years have never used the Internet, locking them out of those services.  Furthermore, 9% of the population in Ireland does not yet have Internet access, while 11% have never accessed the Internet.  One in six of the adult population cannot read and understand the instructions on the back of a box of paracetamol due to literacy issues.<\/p>  <p>  By the end of last year, 79% of people paid their motor tax online, which means that 21%, one in five people, still use the offline option.  That is just for motor tax, so consider how many people need other offline facilities.  One cannot renew one's motor tax online unless one has an email address.  This condition will be expanded across all online payments when the EU payments services directive 2 is implemented at the end of this year, 72 days hence.  Surely older people and those who are currently offline have enough to contend with due to Covid-19 and Brexit without being excluded from government services because they do not have an email address or cannot use technology.  While online transactions are going to get more complicated, the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland and Safeguarding Ireland are calling on older people to take back and keep control of their money, particularly vulnerable people.  Two thirds of people who needed help from others to manage their money during the Covid-19 lockdown have not taken back control of their finances.  This will get worse as the Covid restrictions outlined by the Government are implemented and Government office opening hours are restricted.<\/p>  <p>  Vulnerable people and those who do not wish to, or cannot, use technology or email would be able to maintain their independence if these services were available through the local post office.  This would save the taxpayer a considerable amount of money as the staff involved in these mundane, administrative paper processes could be redeployed into urgently needed contact tracing.<\/p>  <p>It would also eliminate the costly paper-based notices and transactions that I previously outlined in a case study I published on property tax.  We need decisive action to support rural communities, vulnerable people and the vital post office network.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100014#M00200","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603278000,"counter":52,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 2 is in the name of the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100015#N00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1603278000,"counter":53,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1603278000,"counter":54,"content":"<p>Motion, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1603278000,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I am sorry for interrupting you, a Cheann Comhairle, but an amendment was submitted by Sinn F&eacute;in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100015#N00500","speaker":"1463"},{"type":"speech","time":1603278000,"counter":56,"content":"<p>It cannot be moved, as amendment No. 2 in the name of the Minister has been agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100015#N00600","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1603278000,"counter":57,"content":"<p>That amendment has been agreed.

Workers, families and communities are being asked to make enormous sacrifices once again.  People will lose their jobs and businesses are being told to close.  Families are being told to stay apart and lives are being disrupted and put on hold.  Understandably, there is a great deal of anxiety.  There is also anger and frustration, but I have no doubt people will play their part.<\/p><p>In asking people to make these sacrifices the Government must also play its part.  The lockdown suppresses the virus and buys us time.  That is all.  The most important thing we have in our fight against Covid is an efficient and effective testing and tracing system.  It is hard to believe that we are nearly eight months into this pandemic and the Government has failed to get this right.  This matter has been raised endlessly with the Government during those eight months.  The contact tracing system became so swamped at the weekend that it completely broke down and collapsed.  Now, between 2,000 and 2,500 people who tested positive for Covid-19 will today receive a text message from the HSE and they will be asked to tell their own close contacts of their positive test and, in turn, to ask those contacts to immediately contact their GP to seek a test.  We are asking people who have tested positive to do the job of a contact tracer and to give their contacts health advice.  This is a sure recipe for infections being missed and further outbreaks not being caught in time.<\/p><p>I accept that the growth in demand will have put the system under enormous pressure at the weekend.  What I do not accept is the Government's failure to provide the necessary level of staff and resources.  The warning signs were there.  Dr. Anne Dee, a specialist in public health in the mid-west, rang the alarm bell loudly and clearly two weeks ago.  She made it clear that regional health departments do not have enough staff to do contact tracing.  She said: <\/p> <blockquote> \tWe can&rsquo;t cope with the volume of work, there are not enough of us.  Outbreaks will be missed, and the situation will get worse.  The regional public health system is as close to collapse as it has been at any time before. <\/blockquote>  <p>I commend our public health teams that are doing Trojan work in extraordinarily difficult circumstances.  They understand that contact tracing is absolutely essential to getting in front of the virus, controlling its spread and protecting our people.  We also know that failure to get this right will mean a cycle of damaging lockdowns, with all the hardship and suffering that entails.  The reality is that we have to lock down when the virus is out of control and we lose control of the virus when testing and tracing do not work.<\/p><p>Will the Taoiseach indicate what is going wrong that we still do not have the number of contact tracers that we need?  Promises were made by the Government in July and again in September that recruitment would take place.  Why is that is taking so long?  We need to get to a point where we have a 24-hour turnaround for testing and a 24-hour turnaround for contact tracing.  Does the Taoiseach accept that that is where we need to be by the end of this six-week lockdown?  If he does accept this, which I hope he does, can we get weekly progress reports on how many staff are being hired and how we are progressing towards meeting these goals?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100015#N01200","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1603278000,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McDonald for her remarks and for raising this issue.  Since the new Government was formed and came into office at the end of June, we have been determined to build up our testing and tracing capacity.  That is what has happened.  Without question, the contact tracing dimension has come under extreme pressure in recent days, in particular over the weekend.  I recall the Deputy asking some weeks ago about the target of 100,000 tests per week.  We have now reached a testing capacity of 120,000 in our laboratories.  We processed more than 115,000 tests in the past seven days.  We continue to test in the community and in hospitals and we conduct serial testing in nursing homes, meat plants and direct provision centres.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE informed me that we are meeting all the demand for testing from the community and hospitals.  Yesterday was the highest day, with more than 12,500 appointments in community swabbing centres and that is in addition to acute swabbing and serial testing.  Our laboratories have processed up to 19,000 swabs on a given day, the highest ever, and they have done this within their committed turnaround time of 24 hours or less.  Our testing capacity at the moment is more than 120,000 weekly.  That capacity will increase again in November and December.  Capacity is increasing every week.  We will continue to have offshore testing capacity during the winter.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE informs me that on metrics, tests are completed end to end in less than three days, more than 95% of GP referrals get a same-day or next-day appointment, more than 90% of people get their result in less than 48 hours from swabbing appointment, and the overall end-to-end median is less than 2.2 days.  Of course, there are always improvements to be made on that and to further consistency at the end of the testing process.<\/p>  <p>  I do not have to go through all the serial testing, but 35,000 tests have been undertaken in 82 meat plants since 21 August, with 151 positive cases emerging.  Some 3,300 tests have been carried out in direct provision centres, with 18 positive cases since 12 September.  A total of 234,000 tests have been carried out on healthcare workers in 574 nursing homes since early July, with 631 positive cases.  There are concerns about schools.  The HSE says it has tested approximately 13,289 students and teachers, with 355 positives, which is a positivity rate of about 2.6%.<\/p>  <p>  Recruitment has been ongoing.  Currently, 400 staff are employed in contact tracing.<\/p> <p>There will be 220 added before the end of next week and there will be ongoing additions.  As the Deputy knows, we did not have a testing system at the beginning of the pandemic.  Many front-line staff came from within the health service, for example occupational therapists and physiotherapists, and from other Departments, and they went back into services.  At the moment substantial recruitment for contact tracing is going on.  The first 700 people are through the interview process.  Some 220 new staff have started already.  There will be 74 next week and 128 will start on 2 November.  They want to bring in about 60 to 70 new staff every week to work on contact tracing, ultimately to get to somewhere close to 800 contact tracers.

Covid has spread in multiples that we do not know.  As regards contact tracing, it is in the thousands or tens of thousands; we do not know.  This happened before but never on this scale.<\/p><p>What is the status of the famous app?  How effective is it?  I think its effectiveness now is seriously questioned.  The HSE has a huge amount to do.  I am not saying that Paul Reid and his team are not under pressure, because they are.  It is not always about jumping up and down about them.  However, could the tracing aspect not be separated from the HSE and done as a different component under another regulatory body?  It is not right to have it in charge of regulating itself as regard the accuracy and efficiency of this tracing.  We need to know that in a spike such as this we have enough resources and enough people.  The public do not mind if the people working on tracing do not have much to do because they will be there in case there is a spike.  Will the Government consider a process by which the regulation of tracing will be done separately from the HSE to ensure that we know the figures are accurate, allowing the HSE to do its proper job?<\/p><p>I ask the Taoiseach to reveal when he knew and when the Minister knew.  Will he commit that publicly we will get the community end-to-end testing and tracing rates every week from now on?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100016#O00800","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1603278600,"counter":72,"content":"<p>I got a text last evening which included <i>The Irish Times<\/i>article.  That was when I first knew.  I was not informed of the operational measure the HSE undertook in response to the extraordinary demands it was under over the weekend with community tracing.  The HSE has reconfigured the call structure to deal with 1,500 positive cases per day this week.  All the cases yesterday were dealt with.  It has essentially reset the process so that it is managing all the contact tracing as and from yesterday again as per normal.  They reconfigured the call structure to deal with 1,500 positive cases per day this week.  It believes it should be able to get to everyone within 24 hours.  Next week it will introduce the ability for a close contact to arrange their own test online and this will be a significant development.  The Deputy will be aware of that development in enhanced technology which will speed up the process of contact tracing.  That is important.  It will have additional staff again next week.<\/p><p>The Deputy is correct in identifying that the pressure is on contact tracing and that is where the issue is.  I have been pushing for a week-to-week acceleration of the recruitment process.  There are many issues.  Some people need to leave jobs to take up new jobs.  There is the Garda vetting process of the new staff coming on board, which is going fast to be fair to it.  My understanding is that Army personnel are still involved.  They would have been more involved earlier in the year, but Army personnel are still involved in assisting with contact tracing.<\/p> <p>I understand they have been very effective in the application and professionalism they bring to bear to the job.  There would have been far more of them involved early in the first phase.  The idea is to create a permanent workforce in contact tracing.  Ultimately, that is the only way to deal with a pandemic of this sort, and that is provided for.  There is no shortage of resources to enable this to happen, either financially or in any other way.<\/p> <p> I accept that testing and tracing is very important to deal with the pandemic but it is not the primary shield.  We are moving into level 5.  We must reiterate the importance of our individual behaviours and collective behaviour in reducing our social contacts and physical distancing to stop the spread of the virus.

The virus spreads when people congregate.  That is, unfortunately, the truth of this virus.  It is very challenging for people generally because we all have to do things we would not normally do.  It has upended our lives when it comes to the normal practices of daily life.  That is the unfortunate reality of the virus and that has to feed into any strategic approach towards it.  I have been honest and candid about this.  I do not believe a zero-Covid approach is the correct approach.  I do not think we can do that given our geographic location.  I do not think we can seal the Border and we have very close relations with the United Kingdom.  That is a view I have and NPHET shares that view.  NPHET has said to us that it does not believe a zero-Covid elimination strategy is a doable proposition.<\/p> <p>Likewise, herd immunity is something no one wants to contemplate for obvious reasons in terms of its impact.  Therefore, we are in a suppression strategy, and that is dependent on a number of factors.  Testing and tracing is very important, and I do not want to understate that.  Human behaviour is also important, as is learning from the earlier phases of the pandemic, and constantly evaluating what is happening within our treatment situation, hospitals and acute settings more generally.  For example, we started the serial testing of nursing homes as far back as August 2020.  We have done 234,000 tests, with very low positivity rates.  We did that to keep on top of the virus in an area of acute vulnerability, as we had learned from the first phase of the pandemic.  We then extended the testing to meat plants because there was an outbreak in those plants during the summer.  We learned from that serial testing the likelihood is that the actual origin of the virus was outside of the meat plants, but that when it came in, it spread.  The positivity rate from the serial testing is low.  This is also the case in respect of testing in direct provision centres.  Such serial testing statistics are important as they enable us to keep on top of the pandemic.  That is the overall strategy.<\/p> <p> On the recruitment side, there is a hell of a lot of recruitment going on for community swabbing and contact tracing.  As regards recruitment for community swabbing, more than 1,000 people have gone through the interview process and are now at the compliance checking stage.  That started before this month.  As regards recruitment for contact tracing, 700 people have been through the interview process.  Deputy Catherine Murphy attended the briefing held last week by the HSE.  It stated that it is recruiting and is hoping to take on 70 to 90 people per week.  The ultimate objective is to recruit close to 800 people on the community tracing side, and 1,000 on the swabbing side, and those numbers may grow.  We should have a briefing from the HSE on this particular situation.  <\/p> <p> I have been in touch with the people directly responsible for, and overseeing, testing and community tracing within the HSE.  What I am imparting is the information I have been given by the HSE on this matter.

Two weeks ago, a senior public health person had to take to the airwaves to say how under pressure they were.  It was no surprise that what happened at the weekend happened.

Members referred to what other countries are doing and I believe other testing technologies should be considered.  HIQA conducted a major study on this, which has been clinically validated in terms of antigen testing and rapid testing by public health.  I hope we can get early reports on it so that by the end of this lockdown, we can supplement the existing testing technology with additional testing technology.  That is important in terms of dealing with the situation.<\/p>  <p>  There have been policy differences on the efficacy of such tests for quite some time.

It is a prudent and sensible thing to do under the circumstances.  As an individual who comes from a constituency that covers the Laois, Offaly and Kildare region, I am familiar with the additional burden that lockdown will put on the local population.  However, I also recognise that it is a viable strategy as a last resort to keep a lid on this virus and prevent it from gaining a foothold in our vulnerable populations, although I appreciate that this is not a universally held view.  Even members of the medical profession differ in their opinions on this, however that is not unusual.  We are dealing with something that is at the very frontiers of knowledge, and we are learning more about it every single day.<\/p>  <p>  However, I wish to focus on something which is more hopeful.  It concerns the potential discovery of a vaccine.  The discovery of a vaccine is not going to fit into a very rigid political timescale, but it is something on which we should definitely focus.  While we cannot influence the process directly, we could be looking at improving the environment or conditions to expedite that process.<\/p>  <p>  I have three questions for the Taoiseach.  First, where are we from a vaccination perspective?  Most Members in the Chamber recognise that a vaccine would be a game changer.  We are familiar with what is available from an open source perspective, but is there any information at a national level or European level to which the Taoiseach might be privy, that he can share with the House?  Where are we from a vaccination discovery perspective?<\/p>  <p>  Second, we have an extensive pharmaceutical industry in this country.  Is it playing its part in this global effort?  Are we leveraging the expertise we have in Cork or in Newbridge where the Pfizer plant is located?<\/p>  <p>  Third, is there anything else we can do from a State or governmental perspective?  Are we leveraging organisations such as Enterprise Ireland and the new Department with responsibility for further and higher education, research, innovation and science?  Are our public universities involved with commercial industry, taking a collaborative approach, so that we can expedite this process from a vaccination perspective?  Those are my three questions and if the Taoiseach could shed some light on them, I would very much appreciate it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100018#Q00400","speaker":"1587"},{"type":"speech","time":1603279800,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his comments.  I recall that in the summer when we introduced restrictions that were equivalent to level 3 in counties Laois, Offaly and Kildare, which people may forget as things are moving so quickly, there was anger at the time, and understandably so.  Those level 3 restrictions had an impact on that occasion, in terms of reducing the spread of the virus in those locations.  Interestingly, I just saw comments from the chief medical officer in Northern Ireland that the measures taken in the Derry and Strabane areas, which were equivalent to level 3, appear to have had an impact in terms of reducing the number of cases, although it is early days.  That is something that we need to follow in terms of how it might inform us.<\/p>  <p>  On the vaccine question, the Government is part of an EU advanced purchase procurement agreement so we are part of an EU approach.  Under that, the EU has already entered into agreements with Oxford University and AstraZeneca, for example.  We are part of that and we make a financial contribution, having signed off on it.  Yesterday the Cabinet took decisions to participate in agreements with Sanofi Pasteur, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals and Janssen.<\/p> <p> The EU is currently exploring other options with additional vaccine manufacturers, including with CureVac for the initial purchase of 225 million doses on behalf of the all the EU member states.  Exploratory talks between Moderna and the European Commission are under way for the purchase of 800 million doses on behalf all EU member states as are talks with BioNTech-Pfizer for the initial purchase of 200 million doses on behalf of all EU member states.  Three are more or less signed off on and there are three more on which talks are currently under way between the European Union and the pharmaceutical companies.<\/p> <p> As part of the European Union's vaccination strategy, it is helping countries to prepare their vaccination campaigns so we asked at the European Council meeting two weeks ago to co-ordinate priority distribution of the vaccine.  When one vaccinates, who does one vaccinate first?  Will it be similar to the flu vaccination programme where it is the elderly and those who are compromised who need it initially?  That is ongoing.  In other words, it is about a fair distribution and that the most vulnerable get priority.  It is about safe, affordable and effective vaccines.  A vaccine on its own is not a panacea.  There will be challenges when it arrives.  The effectiveness of the vaccine is important.<\/p> <p> In terms of our situation domestically, early in September I visited APC.  All these companies, including Pfizer, have locations in Ireland but the manufacturing is not occurring here.  I met with Pfizer recently in Cork, more generally about its operations in Ireland.  Pfizer was reasonable confident about the prospect of it having a vaccine by the end of the year.  That has been widely reported, so that is not news.<\/p> <p> APC is an award wining Irish pharmaceutical research and development company supported by Enterprise Ireland.  I met with it in early September.  It has developed the manufacturing technology.  It is working with an Australian biotechnology firm, Vaxine Pty, which is working on a vaccine as well.  That is interesting and I take the Deputy's point in this regard.  Enterprise Ireland is supporting that company with a view that it can increase its capacity so that should a vaccine or vaccines arrive, it would be able to assist the global manufacturing effort because it will take an enormous manufacturing effort globally to get enough vaccines to vaccinate everyone in the world.  That is an interesting company with an interesting technology that could be of great value to these companies which are currently researching and producing vaccines because it could add manufacturing capacity to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100018#Q00500","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603280400,"counter":109,"content":"<p>That is great.

In the US, the government there has been doing it.  There has been a big debate there in the context of the presidential election etc. and that is why the companies came out strongly and said they will not have a vaccine before the election.  They wanted to separate themselves out from any potential perception of politics playing a role in it.  The advance purchase enabled it to go for it.<\/p>  <p>  These processes in terms of the research, development and production of a vaccine are, in historical context, taking place at breakneck speed.  They are really moving at pace.  The US has the FDA approval and authorisation process and in the EU it will be the EVI process.<\/p>  <p>  I can get a breakdown for the Deputy in terms of the contribution we are making.  I want to be specific for the record.  We are reasonably satisfied in terms of the contribution and the potential output in terms of the supply of a vaccine.  It is hopefully an area where Europe can leave its mark in terms of co-ordination across member states and that it is not every member state for itself when the rush comes if and when a vaccine is produced.  I have asked that considerable work continues on this so that when vaccines arrive we are in a position to distribute to the most needy and most vulnerable first and to those who will benefit best from an effective and safe vaccine.

Some people believe that during a pandemic or a crisis, there are times when they push on with other things because they will not get enough notice.

The group expressed all of its concerns and said it was a positive meeting.  The Minister has issued a letter to the group in the last 24 hours in which he says he is going ahead with the tribunal from next week, in the middle of a level 5 pandemic, despite the fact he has addressed none of their concerns.  I am not going to let him do that and bury this.  He has not taken on any of the issues the 221+ group raised, such as being non-adversarial; allowing women who have recurrences of cancer to go back to the tribunal; why labs have to be brought into it has also not been addressed; a guarantee the HSE will not object; the time period of nine months is being put on the tribunal; and how the Statute of Limitations is affecting the women.

I am being candid with the Deputy.  There has been a policy issue here.  Many people on the public health side were not, in the early stages, convinced about the effectiveness or validity of antigen testing.  Other countries have adopted it.  I mentioned that in an earlier exchange.  I am interested in seeing if antigen testing can be an important complement to PCR testing and if it could help in certain settings.  When this is clinically validated <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>PCR and get outcomes, hopefully, we can get some results and some clear trajectory on the direction of travel in terms of the utilisation of antigen testing more quickly than I had been told earlier.

These are things that play an immediate and constant role in the everyday lives of people, things that can and should ensure the common challenges facing all of the peoples of Europe can be addressed collectively by their political leaders.<\/p>  <p>  Social solidarity will prove crucial if we are to overcome Covid-19 and keep down infection rates.  We have been living with the pandemic for eight months and we will be living with it for some time to come.  There is now a very real demand from people for domestic, European and global strategies to tackle the challenges ahead.  The strategies need to put social cohesion at their core.  Once agreed, leaders need to ensure the path ahead is properly and wholly communicated.  Critical issues such as job insecurity and job creation must not only be dealt with but prioritised by member states.  Of course, there are some areas where member states are ahead of Ireland and the provision of sick pay is just one example.  We have seen throughout the pandemic those employed in precarious sectors attending work for fear of losing pay or losing their job.  The absence of a mandatory sick pay scheme in Ireland lags behind other EU states and that this provision remains at an employer's discretion really makes very little sense in a modern economy and is positively dangerous in the grip of a global pandemic.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will update us on the Cabinet committee's wider Covid-19 responses and strategic discussions in terms of a cohesive European response to the social challenges and the economic challenges in the months and years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100024#X00300","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1603283100,"counter":207,"content":"<p>The European Council discussed co-ordination in the fight against Covid-19.  It should be self-evident that at European and national level we need an integrated and properly resourced approach to combat Covid-19.  It is worth dwelling on the fact that countries such as Germany have managed better because they have a tremendously well resourced and well staffed integrated national health service.  This contrasts with our fragmented semi-privatised understaffed and underresourced service.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach discussed co-ordination and contact tracing at the European Council.  The debacle over contact tracing has everything to do with something I highlighted last week, namely, that the HSE is recruiting people on the worst possible temporary contracts.  I fundamentally disagree with what Deputy Alan Kelly said today, that the solution to this is to separate contact tracing from the HSE, when the opposite is necessary.  We need an integrated publicly run health service whereby workers in contact tracing and throughout the health service are paid properly as part of a single well-resourced health service.  Does the Taoiseach agree this is the problem?  The reason we do not have a contact tracing system, why hospital front-line healthcare workers are overrun and why we have high infection rates is because it is not properly staffed and we do not properly look after the health staff.  We have this ridiculous situation where contact tracing, which is essential for us to be able to get on top of the disease, is outsourced on rubbishy contracts to workers in a fragmented, poorly organised system.  This is the key and we should move in the direction of paying contact tracers and other front-line workers properly, giving them decent jobs, staffing things properly and resourcing the front-line services we need to challenge Covid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100024#X00400","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1603283100,"counter":208,"content":"<p>The question relates to the Cabinet committee on Europe.

He went on to say this is an important message that is of great relevance to Ireland.  I ask the Taoiseach to address my intrigue and tell us what exactly he means by this.  What are the unilateral contingency measures the Taoiseach envisages will be implemented by the European Union on Brexit?  Does it mean deploying additional resources?  Does it mean new legislative provisions?  What exactly is the Taoiseach saying on this?  As he knows, money is available under the Brexit adjustment reserve fund of &euro;5 billion.

The committee deals with Europe and we have a separate Cabinet subcommittee on Covid-19, which deals with all aspects of that.  This committee meets to discuss broader European issues, specifically in preparation for European Council meetings.  The most important response of the European Council and member states to Covid-19 has been the multilateral financial framework and the next generation EU funding programme, which is unprecedented in that European member states decided, on advice from the Commission, to act collectively to borrow money on the markets to support member states which are under particular pressure as a result of Covid-19 and to underpin them.  This type of solidarity manifests itself in terms of giving resources to member states to enable them to deliver on social solidarity domestically.  Under the EU institutional rules, of course, this has to get the approval of the European Parliament and there is ongoing trilateral dialogue between the Parliament, Council and Commission.  I made the case that it needs to be accelerated.<\/p>  <p>  The European Parliament has its demands and objectives and I say to Deputies who have party members in the European Parliament that the overriding consideration is to get this package through so the funding can start to be distributed and delivered to enable supports to be given to people.  In Ireland we are borrowing at very low interest rates at present.  We are not necessarily dependent on the borrowing capacity that these funds will afford us, although we will utilise the SURE fund, as the Minister for Finance has said, in respect of borrowing to support the pandemic unemployment payment and the wage subsidy scheme payments.  This is the most fundamental response.<\/p>  <p>  On Covid, the European response has been predominantly on the vaccine and the advance purchase agreement, which has been a good development.  In previous potential pandemics, such as SARS, Europe was not co-ordinated on vaccine procurement.  Developing that type of co-operation was quite embryonic.  The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control is providing much advice to Europe.  Europe has developed a proposal on co-ordination on travel.<\/p> <p>As I stated earlier when responding to Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; in respect of the testing technologies, Europe is pursuing whether we can get a co-ordinated approach to the various technologies that different member states are using for testing.  Most do PCR but there are other tests such as antigen and so on.  The quarantining frameworks that should apply are also being examined.<\/p> <p> I read a very interesting article about testing in Germany.  It uses a network of private laboratories for testing.

The outcomes in Ireland during the first phase, in terms of hospital treatments, were quite good, which speaks well of the clinical qualities in our hospitals, such as the quality of clinicians and all our staff, including those in nursing and all involved in intensive care.  An excellent programme produced by RT&Eacute; looked at some of the metrics at St. James's Hospital, for example.  The outcomes should give us some reassurance.<\/p>  <p>  We can always attack our service and there is endless language of attacking, condemning and undermining it, but there are some very bright spots in our health service.  The Health Act 1970 affords people access to our acute hospital system.  We have many improvements to make but we have put &euro;4 billion into the health service this year to advance State services and the health service across the board, from home care and primary care to community care and acute hospital care.  My ambition on the health front is that after the pandemic, we will have embedded improvements into the health service, as a result of the additional resources, that will be long lasting and to the benefit of the citizens of the country in availing of our health service.  That point has to be made.<\/p>  <p>  I am absolutely assured that the contracts are not zero-hour contracts.  We have made it clear they cannot be and that they must be proper contracts.  Good-quality people are being recruited and it is important the job be done well.

A shared island unit has been established in my Department to support this work.  The unit is led by an assistant secretary and its work is proceeding to examine the considerations for a shared future in which all traditions are mutually respected, underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement.  Operationally, the unit is focusing its work on three areas, namely, commissioning research, fostering dialogue and building a shared island agenda, including delivery of the commitments in the programme for Government.  The unit is developing a comprehensive research programme and will work with the Economic and Social Research Institute and other partners.  North-South and east-west collaboration will be an important part of this work.  My Department has also asked the National Economic and Social Council to prepare a comprehensive report on shared island issues in 2021.  This will provide valuable input from economic, social and environmental partners.  Tomorrow, I will launch an online shared island dialogue series, which will start next month and inform the work of the unit.<\/p>  <p>  Strengthening social, economic and political links on the island and the promotion of all-island approaches to the strategic challenges facing Ireland, North and South, are key objectives for this work.  I briefed the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, on the Government's shared island commitments and made it clear we are happy to develop east-west as well as North-South initiatives.  In budget 2021 last week, the Government announced a shared island fund, with a planned &euro;500 million to be made available out to 2025.  The shared island fund provides significant new multi-annual capital funding for investment on a strategic basis in collaborative North-South projects that will support the commitments and objectives of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The funding will foster new investment and development opportunities on a North-South basis and support the delivery of the key cross-Border infrastructure initiatives set out in the programme for Government.  It opens the way for investment in new all-island initiatives in quite a number of areas, including primarily infrastructure but also research, health, education and the environment, as well as addressing the particular challenges of the north-west and Border communities.  It will also support our community to achieving greater connectivity on the island and to enhancing the all-island economy and all aspects of North-South co-operation.  The funding will be dispersed to Departments and agencies in line with the programme for Government priorities and on the basis of collaborative North-South projects.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Covid-19, recognising that viruses know no borders it was decided early on in advance of the establishment of the shared island unit that co-operation between administrations would be instrumental in tackling the outbreak.  Processes are in place for regular engagement to take place at ministerial, official and technical levels.  The shared island unit has no involvement in the management of the Covid-19 pandemic.  There has been significant engagement throughout the pandemic on how each health system is implementing various public health responses.  There has been long-standing close co-operation in health for many years.  The memorandum of understanding to strengthen North-South co-operation in respect of the public response to the Covid-19 pandemic, as agreed to in April, copper-fastened and formalised this ongoing close co-operation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100025#Y01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1603283700,"counter":228,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach has taken Questions Nos. 2 to 6, inclusive, together.

Countries that have delivered consistent controls internally and controlled their borders, such as New Zealand and Australia, have kept their numbers low and saved lives.  The cost of not doing this is hundreds of lives, massive ill health in the country, a wiped-out economy and tens of billions of euro of debt.  Ireland is an island and, as such, should have a competitive advantage in this regard.  Co-operation is no small thing and we have heard so much about co-operation on Covid-19 but there is precious little evidence of it.  The Taoiseach mentioned that there are processes in place to allow for co-operation.  Seven months out, we have a situation where there are processes in place to allow for co-operation.  We had a Fine Gael Minister previously who, when asked on the radio why he did not give the Northern Executive information about a lockdown, stated he wanted to tell the Irish people first, ignoring the Irish people in the North of Ireland.  I want to see practical, real proof of co-operation.  Where is the locus of co-operation?  Is it in the Taoiseach&lsquo;s Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Department of Health?

We need to get this matter right.  The appropriate forum to do so is the British-Irish Intergovernmental Council.

We did so not because we like restrictions or lockdowns - we dislike them - but because we support a zero-Covid strategy based not on perennial lockdowns but on precisely trying to end the need for lockdowns by eliminating the virus.  The excuse the Taoiseach has given for not pursuing an elimination strategy, which would present the possibility of getting out of the perennial lockdowns that the Taoiseach's strategy is essentially offering us, is the issue of the Border with the North.  I do not accept that excuse.  If places such as Australia can pursue a zero-Covid strategy quite effectively, I do not see why we cannot do so.<\/p> <p>What tangible, concrete measures has the Government taken to co-ordinate the Covid-19 response on contact tracing, testing and the timing of restriction levels?  Countries such as Wales are now making decisions about restriction levels independent of Boris Johnson.  That raises the question as to whether there are others in Wales, Scotland and England to whom we should be talking to discuss the possibility of real co-ordination, which would open the possibility of pursuing an elimination strategy.  <\/p> <p> This should not be mischaracterised.  The elimination strategy is about getting rid of community transmission, which we had almost done in June, and then having a tracing regime that can pounce like a fire brigade on an outbreak of fire.  A zero-Covid strategy is like a zero-fire strategy.  It does not mean there can never be a fire but the intention is never to have an uncontrolled fire and the fire brigade can jump on the odd outbreak.  That is what the zero-Covid strategy is about and it would mean there is no need for lockdowns.  That is a prize worth pursuing as an alternative to having lockdowns for the next year.

It was my initiative to secure &euro;500 million additional and ring-fenced funding for the shared island agenda.  Deputy Howlin, as a former Minister, will be aware that successive Governments since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, and I am not casting aspersions on any specific Government, have only done some projects on canals and all of that.  If only one Department is given responsibility for shared island projects, it will always find other projects that will come ahead of a North-South one and the idea of greater connectivity.  That is unfortunate, but it seems to have been the reality.  Inevitably, if design is slow or delayed, projects in this space can fall victim to that process.  We are clear that this additional &euro;500 million is ring-fenced for shared island projects.<\/p>  <p>  All Deputies, including Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, asked about projects, and I will come back to other issues.  There are obvious projects that are in the Good Friday Agreement itself and the New Decade, New Approach document.  We have been committing to the A5 for a long time and it is time to deliver.  We will explore projects including Narrow Water Bridge, the Ulster Canal and the cross-Border greenway.  We provided some initial funding for a greenway between Sligo and Enniskillen in the July stimulus package.  We could make a lot of quick progress on greenways in different locations.  We provided funding for the feasibility study on the Sligo to Enniskillen route.  <\/p>  <p>  We will look at the education area in the north west.  We have not done a breakdown because, as we know, sometimes the worst thing that can be done for infrastructural projects is to hand over &euro;50 million and then people go off designing the Taj Mahal and nothing ever happens.  This has to be done in a robust way with proper design and procurement to make sure that a project can be realised and delivered on the ground and that the various local agencies and authorities are also playing their roles to accelerate a project so that we can make the contribution when it matters.  We could, for example, make a contribution over three years, as the project is being designed and developed.  It puts flesh on the bones of the shared island concept.<\/p>  <p>  Connectivity is a key objective.

The RAIU is the independent statutory body that carries out railway accident investigations in the State.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the background to this matter.  The EU railway safety directive of 2004, Directive 2004\/49\/EC, established a common regulatory framework for railway safety across member states through the harmonisation of safety rules, certification, the roles of national safety authorities and investigation of accidents.  The directive required that member states established an independent national investigation body and to that end the RAIU was established here.  The objective of the RAIU investigation is to identify the causes of accidents but it is also a means to improving railway safety in general and preventing future accidents from happening.  I am sure that all Deputies will agree that in the operation of the states railways, safety is paramount.  To enable this, it is essential that the RAIU has a strong statutory basis to underpin its role in regard to the reporting and investigation of accidents and incidents on our railways. <\/p>  <p>  The EU railway safety directive of 2004 applied to all categories of railways and the provisions in chapter 5 of the directive for the investigation of accidents were transposed here in the European Union (Railway Safety) (Reporting and Investigation of Serious Accidents, Accidents and Incidents) Regulations 2014.  These regulations are referred to in the Bill as \"Regulations of 2014\".  The RAIU was conferred with powers and functions under the 2014 regulations in respect of all railways.  This includes heavy rail, that is, the railway operations on the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann network and light rail, which includes the Luas tram railway in Dublin.  Those powers and functions also covered the metros and other railways such as heritage railways, of which there are a number throughout the country.  <\/p>  <p>  The need for the provisions in this Bill arise from a change in law at EU level.  Under the EU fourth railway package agreed in 2016, the EU railway safety directive of 2004 is being repealed and is being recast by Directive EU (2016) 789 on railway safety.  This replacement directive, which I will refer to as the recast railway safety directive, will come into operation on 31 October 2020.  The focus of the EU fourth railway package is on the promotion of the rail market in a single European railway area and on the technical interoperability of the Union railway system to support rail passenger and freight transport services.  As a result of this, the recast railway safety directive has a reduced scope and it expressly excludes light railways, metro and other local railway systems.  In the context of the railway systems in Ireland it is only heavy rail, that is, the railway operations on Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann network, including the DART, that now come within the scope of the recast railway safety directive.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, the Minister for Transport made the European Union (Railway Safety) (Reporting and Investigation of Serious Accidents, Accidents and Incidents) Regulations 2020.  These regulations are referred to in the Bill as \"Regulations of 2020\".<\/p> <p>These regulations transpose Chapter V of the recast railway safety directive and provide the railway accident investigation unit, RAIU, with investigatory powers and functions in respect of the<b><\/b>heavy rail system.  The regulations will take effect from 31 October 2020 to meet the EU transposition deadline.<br\/><br\/>As the regulations of 2020 only provide the RAIU with the necessary powers and functions to carry out reporting and investigations in respect of<b><\/b>heavy rail, that leaves us facing a situation where, on 31 October 2020, a gap will arise in the legislation that would leave the RAIU without a statutory basis to investigate accidents involving any of Ireland&rsquo;s other railways, including the Luas and heritage railways.  The measures in the Bill will provide a solution to prevent any such gap arising.  The application and modification measure that is proposed in this Bill will operate so as to apply the regulations of 2020 to the categories of railways that are specified in section 3.  The RAIU will, through the operation of the measures in the Bill, be in a position to use the regulations of 2020 to carry out its full investigation functions, the same as it has done in respect of light railway, Luas, heritage railways, etc.<br\/><br\/>The Bill also contains saver and continuity safeguards to provide for a seamless continuity of the work of the RAIU as regards investigations that are under way at present or reports that are in preparation or existing reports and safety recommendations.  The net effect will be that the <i>status quo<\/i>will be maintained regarding the powers for investigating and reporting on all railway accidents.  From 31 October 2020, with the combination of the regulations of 2020 and the provisions of this Bill, the RAIU will have a complete statutory basis and can continue to carry out investigations in respect of any accidents and incidents involving heavy rail, the Luas light railway in Dublin, metros and other railways such as heritage, tourist and privately owned railways.<br\/><br\/>It has taken some time to get this RAIU related legislative proposal published in a Bill.  Steps were initiated in 2018 to bring forward a legislative provision to address the matter that is in the present Bill.  A head was included in the general scheme for a Railway Safety (Amendment) Bill 2018 which advanced as far as it being subjected to pre-legislative scrutiny by the relevant Oireachtas joint committee in June 2018.  Since then, however, while the Bill was included in the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme, it was not possible to progress it, mainly due to the competing demands of other priority legislation, including those relating to Brexit.<br\/><br\/>Towards the end of 2019, because of the increasing urgency attaching to this issue, the Department developed the provisions into a single-issue Bill and, at the same time, explored the option of attaching these provisions to some other priority legislation within the Department&rsquo;s remit that was close to being published.  However, those options were effectively closed off when the general election was called earlier this year and, since then, the extended impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has removed any opportunity for progressing the matter until now.<br\/><br\/>I will give a short overview of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions.  Section 1 is a standard Interpretation section to provide for the specific terms used in the Bill.  The terms &ldquo;heritage railway&rdquo;, &ldquo;investigation unit&rdquo;, &ldquo;light railway&rdquo;, &ldquo;metro&rdquo; and  &ldquo;public road&rdquo; are existing terms under other Acts and the relevant cross references are given.  The term &ldquo;regulations of 2014&rdquo; refers to the regulations that transposed into Irish law the previous EU Railway Safety Directive 2004\/49\/EC and which gives the RAIU a statutory basis to investigate accidents involving all railways.  &ldquo;Regulations of 2020&rdquo; refer to the statutory instrument that was made by the Minister for Transport on 13 October 2020 and transpose the relevant part of the new recast railway safety directive.  As already mentioned, these give the RAIU a statutory basis to investigate accidents involving heavy rail only.<br\/><br\/>Section 2 is also a standard provision and provides for the commencement of the proposed Act on 31 October 2020.  As I mentioned already, the recast railway safety directive comes into operation on 31 October 2020, which is why this Bill is needed to be enacted by that date.<br\/><br\/>Section 3 on reporting and investigation of accidents is the main provision in the Bill.  This section provides that the regulations of 2020 will apply to the other types of railway that are not included within the scope of the recast railway safety directive.  These include metros, trams and other light railway systems, including the Luas.<br\/><br\/>They also include privately owned rail networks used for freight, to the extent that those railways interface with public roads or with another railway system.  As Deputies may be aware, there is one such railway currently operational in Ireland and that is the extensive Bord na M&oacute;na network used for its peat operations.<br\/><br\/>Heritage railways are also included and there are a number of these throughout the country, including in Clare, Donegal, Kerry, Laois, Leitrim and Waterford.  The running of vintage steam train leisure excursions on the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann network are also covered.  Through the operation of section 3, the regulations of 2020 will therefore apply to all of these railways, as well as to the heavy rail network.<br\/><br\/>Sections 4 to 6, inclusive, are, once again, standard provisions that seek to ensure the continuity of the reporting and investigation work that the RAIU has done to date and is continuing to do at present.  Section 4 ensures that any investigation and the preparation of any report that have been already commenced by the RAIU under the regulations of 2014 can continue and be completed under the regulations of 2020 from 31 October 2020.  Section 5 ensures the continuity of any relevant existing investigation reports or other reports of the RAIU and section 6 ensures the continuity of any relevant safety recommendations issued by the RAIU prior to 31 October 2020.  Section 7 is a standard citation provision.<br\/><br\/>This is an important Bill to provide that the RAIU is provided with full statutory powers to enable it to continue in a seamless manner from 31 October 2020, to carry out reporting and investigation into accidents and incidents involving all railways.  I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to the Deputies&rsquo; contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100029#HH00800","speaker":"1578","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603286400,"counter":268,"content":"<p>The Department was in contact with us and it explained the background to this Bill, as she has done again today.  I thank her for that.  She outlined the nature of the time pressure due to legislative changes at EU level so Sinn F&eacute;in is happy to support the legislation.  I will keep my comments brief given the requirement to deal with all Stages this week to ensure the legislation can be put in place by 31 October.<\/p>  <p>  Railways are an incredibly important part of our transport infrastructure serving workers, tourists and businesses across the State.  The neglect of our railways by successive Governments in the 20th century set us back decades and it is a price many people continue to pay today.  Some 81% of people who leave my county of Meath daily to go to work do so by car because the rail infrastructure was allowed crumble and disappear in the past 60 or 70 years.  It is a terrible shame which is replicated in many other areas, most evidently in the north west where there is a total absence of rail connection.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke to the Minister of State previously about the need to invest in our railways to make up for lost time and contribute to our efforts to reduce carbon emissions.  There is a compelling case to be made for passenger and freight rail.<\/p>  <p>  The work of the RAIU is to investigate when things go wrong on the rail network.  The purpose of an investigation carried out by the RAIU is to improve railway safety by establishing the cause of an accident with a view to making recommendations for the avoidance of similar incidents in the future.  In 2019, the RAIU completed 43 preliminary examination reports into a wide range of incidents on our railways.  These included tram road traffic collisions, a trap and drag incident on the Luas, level crossing collisions, derailments, fires, cattle strikes, apparent self-harm occurrences and a near miss collision between a train and a rail worker.  It is clear from those few examples that the work of the RAIU is very important and is central to establishing what has gone wrong in a particular situation to try to prevent its recurrence in the future.<\/p>  <p>  It is vital that these powers of investigation are available for rail accidents including those on light rail and heritage railways.  This Bill seeks to ensure that continues to be the case after 31 October taking account of changes at EU level and therefore we are happy to support the Bill and facilitate its expedient passage.  The RAIU is a small operation that comprises very few individuals but the work they do is extremely important and often goes under the radar.  We want to thank them for that work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100030#JJ00200","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speech","time":1603286400,"counter":269,"content":"<p>At the outset, I congratulate the Acting Chairman, Deputy Murnane O'Connor.  I know the people of Carlow will be very proud of her.  I wish her well.<\/p> <p> I wish to speak about two matters.  The Minister of State might have heard of the first, the Kilnageer railway crossing in Breaffy, Castlebar.  This feeds in to what my colleague Deputy O'Rourke has been saying about the RAIU.  The railway crossing is unmanned and it needs automated gates.  It is extremely dangerous.  For years, the community has been asking for a solution.  The solution is quite simple in that the crossing just needs automatic gates.  We must be careful not to make unmanned crossings inaccessible to those with disabilities and the elderly, who have to get out of their cars when trying to get from one side to the other.  There have been many accidents and near fatalities at the crossing.  We need to do the simple jobs and tackle the health and safety issues that need to be addressed on the railway.<\/p> <p> I welcome the declarations and intentions of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, regarding the western rail corridor.  We very much hope in the west that the work on this corridor will proceed at speed.<\/p> <p> The need for this Bill arises from the changes to the EU law related to the EU fourth railway package, passed by the EU in 2016.  I caution against the move to harmonise arrangements across Europe.  I refer to the privatisation of railways in Britain and other countries.  We have seen the aggressive move to privatise railways in France.  That is not the way we need to go in this country; we need rail to be a public good.  The western rail corridor would never be developed if it were privatised.  I caution against privatisation but, as my colleague said, we support this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100030#JJ00300","speaker":"1501","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603287000,"counter":271,"content":"<p>The Minister of State will be fed up, having seen me a number of times in the past while.  That the RAIU should be able to investigate for all rail types is a necessity.  That is a given.  This is an anomaly Bill and clean-up Bill and it needs to be passed.  We could not possibly operate without decent rail safety infrastructure.  I am reminded of a book I once read, <i>Black Box Thinking<\/i>by Matthew Syed, which refers to new thinking on aviation.  The idea was that after a near miss or near accident, there would be a two-week amnesty period in which pilots could report it.  The idea was that one could analyse what happened and ensure the mode of operations could be improved to avoid a recurrence.  It led to major safety improvements and, obviously, the saving of lives.  When I saw this Bill, I was reminded of the book.  We need this kind of thinking to be introduced to ensure we have the best safety infrastructure possible.<\/p><p>We completely support this necessary Bill.  I agree with comments that have been made by some of my colleagues on the missed opportunities regarding rail in this State.  We are living with the consequences.  Regarding the difficulties experienced when installing the Luas, it would have been a hell of a lot easier had we been dealing with the tram system that never should have been removed in the first place.<\/p><p>I engaged in questions and answers with the Taoiseach earlier, specifically on the shared-island unit.  He spoke about the difficulty experienced by the State over the years regarding many projects it agreed to.  He talked about cross-Border projects, such as Narrow Water bridge and the A5, and promises that were made.  When the projects were left with individual Departments, they found reasons, probably genuinely good ones, not to proceed with them.  They found other things to do.  While I might have difficulties with some parts of the terms of reference of the shared island unit, I believe the unit is necessary if we are to complete some of the necessary cross-Border projects.  We have all heard tell in the past while of possible high-speed rail, particularly on a cross-Border basis.  This needs to happen.<\/p><p>Many commuters in the likes of Dundalk use the Enterprise train, which runs from Dublin to Belfast and back.  The problem is that, in many cases, it only runs every two hours.  We need to have a greater level of connectivity and ensure more trips so it will be more possible to use the rail network for commuting.  The price can also be a dissuader.  We need to examine this.  We have to give people opportunities.  We are talking about the benefits of rail travel in dealing with the climate problems we face so we need to make it easier for people.  We need to consider an overall strategy - a cross-Border strategy but also a strategy for this State and beyond - to ensure we will have the best possible rail infrastructure and a system that delivers for passengers.  Obviously, rail safety and security are absolutely necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100031#KK00200","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1603287000,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I support this Bill.  We welcome it.  I wish to take the opportunity to remember the Buttevant rail disaster that occurred on 1 August 1980, those who were injured in it and the 18 who died.  This is pertinent to this legislation because the response to the disaster by the community, emergency services and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, or CI&Eacute; at the time, was absolutely tremendous.  The event still haunts the community of Buttevant and the wider area.  It is appropriate that we are discussing legislation on railway safety and the reporting and investigation of serious accidents and incidents on certain railways.  I pay tribute to everybody involved in the response to the disaster, which left so many people scarred.  It is still remembered today.<\/p>  <p>  I pay tribute to the workers in Irish Rail.  I am a weekly user of rail services from Cork to Dublin and also a weekly DART user.  At this time of Covid, I pay tribute to those who operate the railway service for us in very difficult circumstances.  When I depart Mallow on a Tuesday morning, there is always great banter on the platform with the workers.  They are always jovial and full of good humour.  The same applies to the staff on the trains.  They bring professionalism and friendliness to dealing with customers such as me in their daily work.  We should remember this as something that is positive and contributes to society.  What underpins it is the ethos of safety on the railway system.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome this Bill.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, for her deliberations and introducing legislation that codifies and tidies up elements of railway safety in respect of investigations into serious accidents and incidents.<\/p> <p>It is important that we have this legislation.  I again pay tribute to everybody who was involved in the response 40 years ago to the Buttevant rail disaster.  The people within the community and those who professionally responded to that disaster still carry the memories of that fateful day with them.  It is important that we acknowledge their memories and also acknowledge the people who were injured and still bear the scars of that disaster.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100031#KK00300","speaker":"1514","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603287600,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I congratulate Deputy Murnane O'Connor on her appointment as Acting Chairman and I wish her the best of luck in the role.  I want to concentrate my remarks on the Ballybrophy to Limerick rail line which has been seriously neglected over many years.  Reports about the line often focus on the cost of keeping the service open.  Journey times remain too long and there is little uptake on a route that stops in four locations in my constituency.  Until the issues facing this line are addressed, it will become increasingly difficult to convince people to avail of the service.  The <i>status quo<\/i>of no increase in train speeds, no revised timetable and continued restrictions on the line due to works must change, as otherwise the numbers using the service will continue to decrease, the gap between revenue and the cost of operation will continue to increase and a valuable piece of infrastructure will be lost to rural Ireland.  In the context of climate change, we should be investing in rail rather than contracting services.<\/p><p>I have been asked by North Tipperary Community Railway Partnership to work with it to improve the quality of Ballybrophy to Limerick rail service.  What they are asking for will result in very little cost to the Exchequer.  The partnership has a number of different requests, including that a district engineer at Limerick Junction be tasked with reviewing the line speed between Ballybrophy and Limerick.  This has not been done for years and, as such, line upgrades have not been taken into account.<\/p><p>Irish Rail has invested considerable sums in this rail line in order to upgrade worn jointed track which was responsible low speed restrictions on the line.  Continuous welded rail track is now in place for the 31 mile journey from Ballybrophy to Limerick.  What is the point in spending huge amounts of money on improving the line if it does not result in the increased speeds of which the line is capable?  I recently submitted a parliamentary question requesting that an engineer be sent to inspect the line in order that faster train speeds can be signed off on.  The reply I received from Irish Rail did not even address this issue.  It is my understanding that an engineer is required to sign off on these newer, safer tracks so that trains can operate at faster speeds.  These new lines should be able to support speeds of up to 60 mph rather than the 30 mph or less that currently pertains on this route.  Such speeds will reduce the journey time between Ballybrophy and Limerick considerably.  By doing this, this form of public transport could become more popular in my area and be used more frequently.  By introducing minor changes to the current timetable, an additional service could be operated every day at midday between Ballybrophy and Limerick, alongside the morning and evening service.  A little initiative and drive are all that are required to improve the quality of this form of public transport in my constituency, resulting in increasing numbers availing of the service. <\/p><p>The partnership is also calling for the appointment of a dedicated regional manager for regional lines so that priority and attention can be given to regional lines that have the potential to transform the way people in rural areas commute.  I am calling for action to be taken on this route.  In today's world, we need more efficient, reliable, safe and faster public transport, not less of it.  We need major investment in our rail network so that those commuting have viable alternatives to driving.  As it stands, the Ballybrophy route does not offer this service but it has the potential to do so.  I ask the Minister of State to act on these issues, listen to the community-based group and invest in transport need in rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100032#LL00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1603287600,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and the legislation.  Irish Rail has an excellent safety record.  I will focus on an incident that occurred on 21 August 2009 on the Balbriggan to Pearse Station service.  As the train, carrying 60 passengers, was crossing the Malahide Estuary, 20 m of the track started to collapse.  Were it not for the professionalism and ability of the driver, not only would those 60 lives have been lost, the lives of those travelling on the trains coming in the opposite direction at a key peak commuter time would have been lost.  Those trains were packed to the gills with commuters from Drogheda in particular, but also many other stations.  The driver saved all of their lives.  A shocking accident was avoided, but this was a hugely serious event.  Any money that can be spent on improving our rail safety merits that investment.  Any improvement or further oversight of rail safety in our country is warranted.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the comments from across the House by Sinn F&eacute;in, the programme for Government provides for very significant capital investment in our railways.  A sum of &euro;2.6 billion is to be spent under the national development plan.  Under that plan, the DART service will be extended to my constituency, and thousands of new commuters will be carried on the northern line.  We want the extension now but hopefully it will come sooner rather than later.  This will allow people to live away from the city of Dublin and at the same time have access to rapid transport to their places of work.  That new carriages have been ordered points to a very significant development in this regard.  <\/p>  <p>  The programme for Government also provides for improvements to the Dublin-Belfast rail line and improved rail links to Cork.  These works are extremely welcome and necessary.   I take this opportunity to highlight the significant concern in County Louth in regard to the discrimination of commuters from Drogheda, Dundalk and Laytown by Irish Rail in regard to the what are known as promotional tickets.  Commuters in these areas pay double the fare for double the distance in that the cost of travelling to Dublin from Balbriggan is half the cost of travelling to Dublin from Drogheda.  Irish Rail operates promotional fares which discriminate against towns outside of the greater Dublin area.  This matter needs to urgently addressed.<\/p>  <p>  I have one question for the Minister of State.  The most recent rail accident in the United Kingdom occurred due to flooding on a line which was unexpected.  Sadly, but luckily, the number of people killed was low.  Is Irish Rail or its safety inspection unit looking at the impact of climate change on our railways, in particular in areas which may flood suddenly?  I ask that the Department reply to me separately on this question, if that is appropriate, or, if necessary, I can submit a parliamentary question on it.  Things are changing in our society.  In the last year, 100 million people travelled via Irish Rail or the Luas, which is a huge number of passengers.  The vast majority of these journeys were safe.  We need to keep up the good work and the investment in rail.  We need to address the climate change issue to ensure commuters can get to work safely.  Rail is the way to go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100032#LL00300","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1603287600,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their support for the Bill.

This is no less true for the mother and baby homes and county homes that operated in this country throughout much of the previous century.  Our most fundamental duty today is to acknowledge the profound failures and mistreatment of Irish women and their children.  They were cruelly deprived of their choice and agency, and in so many cases were coerced into institutional settings that were designed to reinforce in brutal terms that their power to exercise a free choice about their own lives would not be tolerated in the society in which they Jived.  Over the past two decades, as a country we have been working to confront this terrible legacy.  The names of the various investigations and institutions are known to us all, and we feel a collective sense of outrage and of sorrow when the truth is finally revealed.  Even over the past two weeks, people have spoken about their experiences, the experiences of family members and the hurt and pain that was caused and that was silently carried for far too long.<\/p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge all who have written, emailed, and called Deputies, Senators and my office about this Bill.  It speaks to the genuine and profound depth of feeling, and sense of both solidarity and empathy that Ireland has for those who suffered institutional abuse at the hands of State and religious institutions.  I have read the letters and emails received, and listened as survivors and their family members spoke about their experiences and the anxiety that much of the reporting around this legislation has created.  I know that this debate will be watched closely, and I am acutely aware of the responsibility that I have, as Minister, to do the right thing by the survivors of mother and baby homes, as well as their families.  This is not ancient history.  This is real and live trauma for a great number of people in this country.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to state clearly that this Bill does not seal the mother and baby homes archive for 30 years.  The legislation has one objective: to stop invaluable information from a database tracing the entry and exit of women and children from the mother and baby homes from being put beyond reach.  In doing so, the Bill aims to try to address some of the core concerns of those who were so badly let down in our recent past; those who were robbed of their identities and of their capacity to navigate the course of their lives by virtue of being placed in a mother and baby home.  Nothing in this Bill will seal important records, or put invaluable information beyond reach.  In fact, we are trying to do the opposite.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015, the then Government established the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes and certain related matters to comprehensively examine the experiences of mothers and children who were resident in mother and baby homes and related county homes over a period of 75 years in the 20th century.  I am informed by the commission that this has been an exhaustive and rigorous investigation that will result in a substantial report exceeding 4,000 pages.  The investigation will shine a light on the pain and anguish experienced by women who found themselves in these institutions, and on the children who began their lives behind those institutions' walls.  Women were hidden away in these places because of the stigma associated with being an unmarried mother at that time in our history.<\/p> <p>The commission's report will finally allow us to share and acknowledge the lived experiences of these women and children during a period of our history defined by silence and shame.<\/p> <p> The Commission is charged with investigating specific sensitive issues with the practices and procedures in respect of the care, welfare, entry arrangements and exit pathways for women and children who were residents in these institutions.  It is also tasked with completing an academic social history spanning a period of 75 years.  This will chart the journey of many of those who passed through these places and the lifelong trauma they unjustly experienced as a result.  The commission's report will put these experiences into the context of the society in which they occurred.<\/p> <p> As Deputies will know, the commission established a confidential committee to enable former residents to provide an account of their experiences in private.  These accounts will be captured in the final report, thereby giving explicit voice to the mothers and their children.  The hidden secrets of life in these establishments, as told by survivors, will finally be reported and, most importantly, their brave contributions will assist the commission to ground its findings in lived experiences.<\/p> <p> I understand the anxiety felt by those who have associations with the mother and baby homes in waiting for this much-anticipated report.  The commission of investigation is due to submit its final report to me by 30 October 2020.  As prescribed by the Commission of Investigation Act 2004, on submission of its final report the commission will stand dissolved and, prior to its dissolution, must deposit all commission records with me as the prescribed Minister.  The 2004 Act provides for the publication of the final report of a commission by the prescribed Minister and further provides that the archive of records will remain sealed tor a period of 30 years, after which time its availability for public inspection is governed in accordance with the National Archives Act 1986.<\/p> <p> It is essential to recognise that when we talk about a commission's records we are taking about the evidence established by a statutory inquiry using the significant statutory powers provided to it by the Oireachtas.  The use of such powers, which include extensive powers to question witnesses and direct the production of records, must be balanced with proportionate safeguards to protect the constitutional and legal rights of all parties.  The 2004 Act is a legal framework specifically designed to achieve this careful balance and it is not credible to suggest we can now rapidly alter the basis on which the entirety of this evidence was compiled without due regard for the legal consequences of doing so.<\/p> <p> However, although much of the debate has conflated the genuine aims of this Bill with the pre-existing legal requirements in place in respect of the sealing of the commission's records for 30 years, it is impossible to ignore the volume of correspondence I have received expressing very legitimate and grave concerns that some important commission records - essential validating personal information for survivors - would be put beyond reach for 30 years.  I understand the anguish this legal requirement may cause, especially where people may have been only learning of this rule for the first time.  It has become very apparent to me this week that although I believe it is absolutely vital for survivors and their families that we enact this legislation to allow the database to be preserved, the Bill has nevertheless brought into sharp focus other very real and grave concerns which absolutely must be listened to.  These concerns are centred on how the 30-year archiving of records, as required of the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes, impacts the legitimate expectations of survivors and relatives to access important personal information related to the circumstances of their time in these institutions.  It is clear that a re-examination of the current approach on how access is provided to the archives of the commission for certain validating personal information for survivors is needed.  In so doing, it is my view that there exists an obligation to survivors and their relatives that goes beyond purely legal questions.  To begin this process, I am today committing to two actions.<\/p> <p> First, I have requested - this has been agreed - a detailed engagement with the Attorney General's Office on the issue of personal data access in the commission's archives, which is so vitally important to so many former residents.<\/p> <p> Second, I intend to request the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children, Disability, Equality and Integration to lead on this re-examination in a format that would allow for survivors and their representatives, expert legal opinion and other leading academics to explore thoroughly the major principles underlying the debate on access to personal information in the commission's archive and to make a set of recommendations aiming to resolve the very real difficulties which the passage of this legislation has highlighted.  As part of this, I am committed to working closely with the committee towards finding a way forward.<\/p> <p> It remains my intention to pass the Bill through the Oireachtas in order to safeguard the database.  I believe, however, that by giving time, space and substantive consideration to the complex issues raised, we can and will do right by all those who passed through the mother and baby homes.  In the meantime, I must stress that although it is the commission records that are required to be sealed, there will nevertheless be a very significant quantity of information available.  The commission's final report is vast and comprehensive.  It will include survivors' personal stories in anonymised format, accessible to all those who told their own stories.  Many of the records of the commission are copies of originals held by other institutions, such as the HSE, the Department of Health and so on.  The originals remain available for access under the relevant law.  As part of the final report, the commission will publish an 80-page index listing the information it accessed in compiling its report.  This index will be available to survivors and researchers freely.<\/p> <p> The Bill I am putting before the House deals with serious legal and practical issues raised by the commission of investigation regarding the finalisation of its records.  It aims to safeguard records gathered by the commission over the course of its five-year investigation in order that they be preserved intact and available into the future.  The Bill does not put information beyond reach; the intent is quite the opposite.<\/p> <p> The commission has compiled digital databases, with details of the mothers and children who were resident in 15 of the main mother and baby homes under investigation, from the records available to it.  These databases have been painstakingly developed over a long number of years and at considerable cost.  The commission believes that these databases and related source records would be of great assistance to those involved in providing information and tracing services.  It believes, however, that as the records compiled contain sensitive personal information, it is obliged to redact the names and other identifying information about the residents of these homes from its archive, including its databases and related records, prior to transfer.  Notably, the commission believes that legislation is required in order to address these matters.<\/p> <p> It is important to consider in the discussion of records, archives and databases what exactly is at stake here.  This database contains the names and personal details of young women, babies and children who passed through these homes.  It will be a lifeline for many vulnerable people to establish their full identities or shine a light on that part of their past that has been hidden.  This could help heal the wounds that this system of institutional abuse created.  It is effectively irreplaceable.<\/p> <p> Having examined the issue, the Government concluded that there is a strong rationale for legislation to be passed in order to protect the complete records of the commission and to provide specifically for the transfer of the valuable databases and related records from the commission to Tusla in order that they can support information and tracing services for former residents.  This is the essence of the bespoke legislation before us today.  It is about preserving a priceless and unique source of information.<\/p> <p> The Bill ensures that the records of the mother and baby homes commission of investigation are deposited without redaction.  While the main archive will be deposited with the Minister in line with the provisions of the 2004 Act, significantly, the Bill also provides for the transfer of the databases and related records directly to Tusla.  This ensures that this unique and invaluable resource is preserved and maintained and remains available, albeit on a limited basis in the first instance.  This limitation is reflected in the restrictions set out in the Bill.  These provide that the processing of records or data is limited to the purposes authorised by the data protection regulation, the Data Protection Acts 1988 to 2018 or any other enactment.  However, nothing in the Bill prevents Tusla from processing information from a related record given to the commission by Tusla itself.<\/p> <p> The Bill also enables appropriate access for the essential maintenance of the digital databases and related records.  The Bill provides no new entitlement to access information.<\/p> <p> By legislating for the urgent protection of these databases now, my intention is to provide an important foundation on which we can build.  In the future I plan to advance comprehensive information and tracing legislation which will expand access to the entire suite of information now being transferred to Tusla.  As Deputies will appreciate, however, this is a complex challenge which requires the balancing of constitutional rights and is not one which can be progressed in the present urgent legislation.<\/p> <p> The Bill also includes a number of technical amendments to the Judicial Council Act 2019 as proposed by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/p> <p>Given the timeframe for the finalisation and submission of records, there is an urgent need for this Bill to be passed and signed into law prior to the dissolution of the commission on 30 October.  It is imperative that the valuable information compiled and developed by the commission, that is, the database, is preserved for posterity by passing this legislation before that date.<\/p> <p> I will outline the key provisions of the Bill as initiated and I propose to bring forward a number of amendments in response to some of the concerns that were raised in the Seanad debate.<\/p> <p> Section 1 is a standard provision, which provides definitions of key terms used in the Bill.  The term \"database\" specifically includes all the databases developed by the commission with regard to the former residents of the institutions being examined.  The definition of \"related record\" refers to the source material from which information was obtained for the purposes of creating the databases.  In practical terms, these sources are institutional and public source records that were obtained by the commission in the course of its work.<\/p> <p> Section 2 provides for the commission to deposit the database and all related records with Tusla as soon as possible following enactment.  Section 2(2) confirms that the material shall be transferred without redaction.  It is declaratory of the current position under section 43(2) of the 2004 Act and has been included in the Bill purely for the avoidance of doubt.  My understanding is that these records do not contain any witness testimony.<\/p> <p> Section 3 deals with restrictions on processing of the database and records received by Tusla.  It stipulates that Tusla may not process records or information provided to the commission except where authorised or required by or under the general data protection regulation, GDPR, the Data Protection Acts, 1988 to 2018, or any other enactment, or for legitimate purposes related to maintenance.  The section expressly states that nothing in the Bill or the Act of 2004 shall prevent the processing of information that originated from any record given to the commission by Tusla itself.  The Bill does not provide any new entitlement to access to information in the possession of Tusla, or to the archive, which transfers to the Minister in accordance with section 43(2) of the 2004 Act.  This would have to be addressed by separate legislation in the future.<\/p> <p> Section 4 deals with the application of section 45 of the 2004 Act in respect of evidence and documents to be available to tribunals.  This section ensures consistency with the 2004 Act insofar as the evidence and records to be deposited with the agency can be made available to a tribunal of inquiry in the event of the future establishment of such a body.<\/p> <p> Section 5 provides that, for the avoidance of doubt, the obligation to deposit records with the Minister, in accordance with section 43(2) of the 2004 Act, is an obligation to deposit such evidence and documents without redaction thereof.  The section is declaratory of the current position under section 43(2) and has been included in the Bill purely for the avoidance of doubt.<\/p> <p> Section 6 amends the Judicial Council Act 2019.  That Act provides for the establishment of various committees of the Judicial Council, including the personal injuries guidelines committee.  It provides that the committee shall submit the first draft of personal injuries guidelines to the board of the council within a defined period and also provides that the draft guidelines will be considered and adopted by the council itself as soon as practicable and in any event not later than 12 months after their submission.  It is these provisions which are the subject of the amendments in the Bill.<\/p> <p> Section 6 substitutes a new paragraph for section 7(2) of the Judicial Council Act 2019 and amends section 18(4) of the Act to allow the personal injuries guidelines committee to complete its work within a new, extended, statutory deadline of 9 December 2020, and for the council to adopt the personal injuries guidelines by 31 July 2021 at the latest.<\/p> <p> Section 7 is a standard provision enabling expenses incurred in the administration of the Act, other than section 6, to be paid by moneys coming from my Department.<\/p> <p> Section 8 is a standard provision to provide for the Short Title of the Bill.  The Act may be cited as the Commission of Investigation (Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters) Records, and another Matter, Act 2020.<\/p> <p> I propose to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage to respond to a number of concerns that have been raised.<\/p> <p> First, it has become clear that an expectation of privacy was given to persons who attended the confidential committee.  Those who voluntarily came forward to tell their story believed they would remain fully anonymous.  However, I know some people who told their story may wish for their names to remain attached to their story for posterity.  For these reasons, I propose that the legislation should respect the agency of each person to decide on whether their story, as contained within the archive, is anonymous or bears their name.  Accordingly, I will table an amendment that can address both viewpoints.  The amendment will facilitate the commission to remain in being after it reports on 30 October for the purpose of engaging with each person to determine their preference with regard to anonymisation.  The commission will take account of these preferences when finalising its archive of records.<\/p> <p> Second, I want to ensure that a copy of the database and related records are deposited with my Department as part of that archive.  This will deliver a complete sealed archive while still ensuring the database and related records can also transfer to Tusla and remain available for use in accordance with existing and future statute.  On both these issues, I have listened to the concerns raised and I have acted to address them.<\/p> <p> Due to the urgent need to pass this legislation before the commission is dissolved, the requirement for pre-legislative scrutiny was waived by the Business Committee at my request.  I appreciate that this urgency is unfortunate as is the time limit available to review the proposals.  I hope, however, that the briefings I have provided, as well as the information outlined today, has been helpful.<\/p> <p> Ireland has come a long way from the Ireland of the 1920s.  We are, I hope, a more progressive, tolerant and equal society.  As a society, our commitment to acknowledging, remembering and learning from our past must be absolute.  The forthcoming report of the commission is a crucial element of that national process of learning, understanding and acknowledgement.  This legislation is crucial to ensure that records of the commission are preserved and the opportunity presented by this valuable database in laying the path towards fuller access to early life information is not overlooked.<\/p> <p> I believe we have a duty to the former residents and survivors of these institutions to pass this legislation and I would welcome the support of Members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100034#PP00800","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603289700,"counter":296,"content":"<p>Before I begin to outline why my colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in and I believe strongly in the serious concerns we have with this legislation, I wish to pay tribute to the courage and resilience of the women and children who suffered so horrifically in mother and baby institutions and who continue to suffer, unfortunately, at the hands of the State as they try to secure their records.  I had the pleasure of meeting some people in my constituency and, recently, some people in Tuam.  Their courage and resilience astounds me.<\/p><p>As my colleague, Senator McCallion, stated on Friday in the Seanad debate, these were not homes; they were detention centres.  That was an excellent point.  Innocent women were subjected to cruel practices.  A home is supposed to where someone feels safe, loved and protected, not a place where someone is tortured, imprisoned and forced to give birth in the most appalling conditions, often without medical support or even basic pain relief.<\/p><p>One survivor vividly recalled that no doctor was present when she gave birth, only nuns, and there was no formal medical care or any kind of pain relief.  Another woman retold the story of her birth and said: &quot;When her mother cried out in pain during labour, she was told by one of these nuns that she should not be surprised as my mother was paying for her sins.&quot;  I again pay tribute to these women and their families and the dedicated campaigners who have persevered for years in such a dignified manner.<\/p><p>A part of me cannot believe that in 2020 we are here discussing the rights and wrongs of what should happen to records and whether records should be sealed.  I acknowledge the point the Minister is making and that he firmly believes that, although I disagree.  Now is the opportunity, however, to deal with the sealing of the records and to bring forward any amendments to any legislation that are needed to do so.<\/p><p>Following all the testimonials and all the State-backed investigations and inquiries into State-sanctioned abuse, we are here again witnessing another injustice against these women and their stolen children.  I am not sure if the Minister has had the opportunity to read any of the experts from the Clann project.  Witness testimonies and stories of obstruction and indifference by religious institutions and State authorities are harrowing and disappointing, but tragically, they are not surprising.<\/p><p>Regarding tracking records, one survivor said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI have found it incredibly difficult to access information about my childhood, my mother and my siblings.  Whenever I attempted to obtain information I was made to feel that I was a nuisance.  I got the impression that the authorities close ranks on you when you try to obtain information.  I have been told countless times by various institutions that my records have been lost in a fire, a flood, or that the nuns are very old now and they wouldn&rsquo;t remember. <\/blockquote>  <p>Another describes how:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe information I was given was deliberately inaccurate, or misleading.  I felt that some of the details I was provided were given in order to lead me down a garden path.  This experience has made me very angry and I feel like I have been lied too.  I do not know what to believe. <\/blockquote>  <p>Child survivors tell story after story of hitting brick walls, many tragically missing the opportunity to reunite with their mothers before they passed away.<\/p> <p>Some tell stories of reuniting with their mothers only months before their passed.  One survivor detailed that:<\/p><blockquote>\tWhen the social workers finally took me to my birth mother&rsquo;s ward, I walked into the room and kissed her on the forehead.  I told her who I was and she replied by saying &lsquo;I knew you would find me some day&rsquo;. <\/blockquote> <p>She passed away a month later.  That women probably hung on until her child found her.  Anyone who has listened to these stories, who has spoken to survivors &ndash; and every Deputy in and Minister in this House was contacted by survivors and their supporters as their stories flooded into our inboxes last week - cannot but be moved to do whatever it takes, within our power as elected representatives and legislators, to ensure justice for abuse survivors.  It is painfully clear to all that rushing this legislation and not giving these important issues the time, debate, and dialogue they deserve is another injustice altogether.<br\/><br\/>I would like to make several points about this unfairly rushed legislation.  The first relates to how little consultation with survivors there has been.  There are several survivor groups throughout the country and many dedicated advocates who are unanimous in their condemnation of the Government on this point.  They have a very valid point.  Survivors have two key asks: that their records do not go to Tusla and that their records are not sealed for the next 30 years.  Is that too much to ask for these women and children, whom we have totally failed?  While the Minister&rsquo;s amendments attempt to speak to the alarming issue that has emerged with keeping the records in one whole archive, they will still go to Tusla and this goes completely against the direct wishes of survivors.  Many survivors tell of their experiences with Tusla and their stories are not altogether complimentary.  One survivor tells of how they have not &ldquo;been entitled to review anything on my file held by the Child and Family Agency. They have been obstructive from the start and I have been refused access to a large amount of information&quot;.  Tusla is simply not the appropriate body to retain these records.  It operates legally troubling and discriminatory practices, including defining adopted people&rsquo;s birth name as third-party data, and undertakes risk assessments of all adopted people who request their records. Can the Minister appreciate why there is such apprehension about these records resting with Tulsa and why there is such anger?  Several other organisations have the skills and expertise to properly collate and archive this extremely sensitive material.  Why is it that only Tusla has been considered?<br\/><br\/>My next concern is that neither the Minister or the commission have provided a rationale as to why section 43 of the 2004 Act is not sufficient for providing a legal basis for the transfer of the personal data.  We have only been told that the commission feels it does not have a legal basis to transfer these records in their entirety to the Minister.  The most emotive issue to emerge over the past week is the development of the sealing of the records.  I acknowledge the Minister's point but I believe, as I said earlier, that now is the time to deal with this.  For many, the answers and any type of closure regarding babies who died, lie within these records.  One mother tragically and so poignantly recounts how her &quot;son was kept in a closed off area called the dying room.  I begged the nuns to take my son to a hospital but they only did so after two weeks had passed&quot;.  He died in hospital.  Another mother does not even know &quot;whether he was buried in a coffin ... there was never even a kind or sympathetic word spoken&quot; to her.  I tell these stories because it is important that they are read into the Official Report.  It is the least we owe people.  How can we stand here and tell these woman and children, survivors of State-sanctioned abuse, that there is a possibility these records are going to be locked away or destroyed?<br\/><br\/>If this legislation passes through the House, every Member who votes in favour of the Government's amended Bill has essentially held the key and locked the personal records about these people's treatment in these cruel institutions away in a vault for the next 30 years.  We need to ensure that this is not rushed.  We need to give it the time it deserves.  We cannot allow this legislation to pass in its current form.  I appeal to all Members, particularly those in Government parties, to please stand up for these woman and children and to do the right thing.  We must be mindful that this law is going to have real consequences for people.  We each have an equal mandate in this Chamber and each an equal responsibility to ensure that justice is delivered for these women and children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100036#RR00200","speaker":"1449","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603290300,"counter":298,"content":"<p>What happened behind the high walls of the mother and baby homes casts a long and very dark shadow over our country.  The women and children, many of whom were placed in these institutions by the State, were abused and exploited. They were stigmatised, vilified, and considered outcasts from society.  The awful abuse of single mothers, the forced separation of families and the horrors of what happened in places such as Tuam are still so very hard to comprehend.  Perhaps, as a society, we will never fully understand or be reconciled with the brutal way these women are treated, or how that awful treatment impacted on their lives and walked every step of the way with them.  We will perhaps never know fully or grasp the full extent of the abuse that they suffered, the horror and the pain.  There are depths to the trauma perpetrated in these mother and baby homes that we can never hope to understand but we can know and we can learn.  Survivors can uncover more about who they are and they expect, as a minimum, the veil of secrecy to be cast aside for good.  I appreciate absolutely that this archive must be protected intact; there is no dispute on that matter.  However, the wretched cry of every child who was wrenched from their mother's arms has to echo today as a cry and a demand for what is right.  The evidence must be preserved and protected and those whose story it tells - the most intimate and painful details of their lives - must have access to it.<\/p>  <p>  I find the Minister&rsquo;s position this evening contradictory.  He told us on the one hand that his Bill will not have the effect of sealing the archive for 30 years and then he went on to reiterate the position of the 2004 legislation in which he stated categorically that the records will remain sealed for a period of 30 years.  Consequently, whatever the Minister&rsquo;s intent, the net effect of his course of action is that these archives will be sealed for 30 years.  He said that the entire process and those who came forward to tell stories and with information had a guarantee of privacy, and so they did, but nobody was guaranteed secrecy and he should not uphold that approach.  The Minister said that victims, survivors and their families have what he called a legitimate expectation of access to important personal information.  I put it to him that they have a legal entitlement to their personal information.  I further put it to him that that entitlement is clearly and cogently set out in European law, which has primacy in these matters.  He has not addressed that matter.  I take particular issue with him saying that many of the records of the commission are copies of originals held by other institutions.  Oh by God they are, and if the Minister only knew the hardship, the frustration and the heartache experienced not by a minority but by the vast majority of survivors as they seek those records.  I assure him that if he really understood that he would not have presented legislation this evening.<\/p>  <p>  It seems to me that the Minister has advanced with this legislation without proper thought and certainly without proper consultation.  He told us that Ireland has come a long way from the 1920s.  I must tell him that when I was brought home to my house as a baby, we passed the Bethany Home.  I was not born in the 1920s.  Our last Magdalen laundry closed in the 1990s, so not alone is this not ancient history, this is very real, very recent history.  This is the story of people's lives and the Minister has no right, and should not have the authority of this Oireachtas, to lock those files for the next 30 years.  The legislation he needs to bring to us, which we will all welcome, is legislation that ensures privacy rights for sure and absolutely proper procedures but, above all else, the right and entitlement of those survivors to the records, the storybooks of their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100037#SS00200","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1603290300,"counter":299,"content":"<p>A total of 798 babies and small children died at the Tuam mother and baby home in my home county of Galway.  Many of the babies died because of malnutrition and neglect.  They were buried in unmarked graves.<\/p> <p>The horror of this reality, that 798 small children died in this way and that they were not given the dignity of a marked grave, is something that we, as a State, must recognise, and we must never let this happen again.<br\/><br\/>For those women who took part in the commission the objective was to be fully transparent.  They laid their souls on the table in the hope they would finally get truth and justice.  They have told us just how painful and traumatic it was to submit their evidence and tell their story.  For many it was a reliving of the trauma they had endured in the mother and baby homes.  Some have told me that their very personal stories were so horrendous they did not think they would be believed.<br\/><br\/>The mental and physical distress they are going through now, with the potential sealing of their testimonies for 30 years, the fact that once again the State is taking an attitude of locking away their realities, and their truths and lived experiences are being brushed under the carpet, is causing them huge pain.  The reason these women took part in the commission was so that truth would finally be out.  I want to quote some of these women that their experiences will be on the D&aacute;il record.<\/p><blockquote>\tDaily life was so bad that I attempted to run away twice with two other girls but they always found us and brought us back.

She was buried on the day this was being discussed in the Seanad.  Sadly, the State failed her once more but it must not fail other women.<br\/><br\/>The Minister can change this and I urge him to be the Minister who finally recognises that what happened to these women was wrong and to be part of a Government that stands with these women.  We must no longer hide from these horrors.  The State must face the faults of the past and do better for victims of State-sponsored abuse.

I have friends and neighbours who were in mother and baby homes.  It is an issue of which I am keenly aware and I know they are watching.  One survivor speaking to the Clann project about conditions in the mother and baby homes stated: <\/p> <blockquote> \tMy birth mother was allowed to see me just once a day for an hour each day after my birth when the babies were brought in to be fed.  The mothers were actively prevented from bonding with their babies. <\/blockquote>  <p>On infant deaths, a survivor stated: &quot;I do not even know whether he was buried in a coffin.  There was never even a kind or sympathetic word spoken to me&quot;.  I quote these testimonies as a reminder to us all of the dark days in the State's past when not all of the children were cherished.  I read out these testimonies because they should be heard and not locked away.<\/p><p>I am conscious this is a very emotive topic and that many of those watching today will have been directly or indirectly affected by the State-sanctioned abhorrent treatment of women and children by religious orders in these institutions.  For those who provided testimony to the commission I am sure it was a very personal and difficult process for them and their families.  I thank them for undertaking this important and, I am sure, painful task.  They have performed a service for all of our citizens, young and old.  Their personal stories are part of our history and we must embrace and learn from our history, and the good, bad and appalling aspects of it.<\/p><p>A constituent in Limerick with whom I spoke today described the ordeal she faced during her year in one of the institutions.  She was sent to the Sean Ross Abbey institution in Tipperary.  On arrival she was given a false name.  She knew no one.  She was worked and punished and had her baby taken from her.  She was forced to work in the laundry while heavily pregnant.  At the birth, her family was telegraphed to say she was dying.  When she had the temerity to ask what she had done to deserve this, the answer she received was that she had committed a sin.  In their eyes she was a sinner.  Is she not entitled to her records?<\/p><p>Another woman I spoke to, my former neighbour in Ballynanty where I grew up, Ann O'Gorman, and I use her name because she asked me to, spent time in Bessborough.  Ann gave birth in the summer of 1971 at Bessborough.  She heard her baby cry but she passed out and when she awoke three days later she was told the infant had died.  She asked whether she could see where her daughter was buried but she was refused.  There are three things she would like me to raise with the Minister.  She does not want the history of Bessborough to be forgotten; she wants the site to be preserved and not built upon; and she wants the unmarked graves to be recognised even if it is by a simple bench.<\/p><p>Another woman to whom I spoke recently, and who has become a very good friend of mine, is Teresa Collins.  She was in Sean Ross Abbey and she has also asked me to use her name.  When Teresa was returned to her grandparents they paid &pound;100 to get her back.  She also has a number of questions that she would like answered.  Why separate the files when they should all be kept in a single archive?  Obviously, those who wish to keep their files private should have the right to do so.<\/p><p>In an investigation by the order of nuns it was claimed there were 296 dead children at the Sean Ross Abbey but through a freedom of information request by a journalist, 1,024 birth certificates were discovered.  Where did all these children go?  Where is the paper trail for the moneys that passed through Sean Ross Abbey?  Where did the money go?  These are the questions these people want answered.<\/p><p>We have an opportunity, even at this late hour, to correct a further wrong before it is committed.  The Minister is trying to ram through the Bill with the most spurious of explanations.  He said the requirement for pre-legislative scrutiny was waived by the Business Committee of the House at his request.  I am sure it was the Government's request.  The Minister maintains that sealing the records is necessary on technical data protection and legal grounds.  The Minister is entitled under GDPR and the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 to take custody of all of these records.  This and the Data Protection Act provide that archiving purposes in the public interest is a lawful ground for processing personal data.  It looks as though perhaps the Minister is being thrown under the bus.  Is that by his partners in government or the Attorney General?  I plead with him, even at this very late stage, to do the right thing and withdraw the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100038#TT00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1603290900,"counter":302,"content":"<p>Nothing speaks to the harshness and horror of the Irish experience in the almost 100-year history of our State than the experiences of those who had to endure and survive, and in some cases the experiences of those who did not survive, our State-sponsored institutions, such as mother and baby homes.  Quite frankly, it is shocking, disheartening and totally avoidable that the Government is ramming through this legislation without pre-legislative scrutiny or consultation.  It was rammed through the Seanad last week and there is an attempt to ram it through the D&aacute;il this week.  The 76 years of experience in these homes are being rammed through the Houses in fewer than eight days.<\/p>  <p>  I am very privileged, along with many people in the Chamber, to have grown up at a time in this country when we did not have to experience the horrors of these institutions but they were being reported to us and information on them was coming out in dribs and drabs through the bravery of survivors and the work of brave journalists.  In some cases, those on the fringes of politics and public representatives on the outside acted as amplifying voices for these victims.  Finally, the State began to listen in a substantive way, or at least the survivors thought so.<\/p>  <p>  When it comes to what we are facing this week, survivors are again feeling totally let down.  This is completely avoidable.  We could be ramming through legislation to amend the 2004 Act and push it back a couple of months to allow us the time to discuss this without a guillotine or contrived urgency, because that is what it is.  It is a contrived urgency.  It does not have to be this urgent.  This requires and deserves as much time as is needed.  We should not be having this discussion under the yoke of a guillotined Bill.<\/p>  <p>  I know the Minister, and I worked with him in local government.  He is of the same generation as me.  I know he cannot be happy to stand over what is happening at this time with the Bill.  We all received what has been described as an avalanche of emails.  In my ten years working in politics as staff or a public representative, I have never seen such a wave of correspondence on an issue.  I cannot profess to have read them all, and no one in the Chamber will have been able to have read them all, but I read as many as I could.  I am viewing this as a legislator and not as the citizen I was, who was shocked by all of the stories in the news.<\/p> <p>I looked at it through the lens of a legislator and through the responsibility we all share in this House to ensure that we deal with the Bill with much more sensitivity and a greater sense of justice than we do with any other legislation that comes before the House.  That is our responsibility but it is being lost in how the Bill is being rammed through.  The Minister stated that the Business Committee agreed to waive pre-legislative scrutiny but the committee does not agree to such matters; the Government does that.  Members of the Business Committee, such as my party colleagues and I, have dissented as a matter of principle in the waiving of pre-legislative scrutiny in respect of a number of Bills, but none more so than the Bill before us because of the reasons I outlined.  I will accept that since the Bill was debated in the Seanad a number of days ago, there has been an inching on the part of the Minister, with the tabling of a couple of amendments.  It is just an inching, however, and it does not come anywhere near where we need to be to feel confident that the treatment of these very sensitive and important archives will be to the standard the survivors deserve.<\/p> <p> The Government is introducing amendments to ensure that the Minister will receive a full copy of the commission's entire archive, including a copy of the part being sent to Tusla, which is okay.  Those amendments further seek, however, to allow the commission to continue to operate until February 2021, although it will still have to deliver its final report by 30 October 2020, so that it can contact all those who gave evidence to the confidential committee to ask whether they would like the commission to redact their personal data from its archive prior to the commission depositing the archive with the Minister.  While the commission and the Government should give those affected by the abuses under investigation a choice as to whether they wish to be identified in the transcript of their evidence in the commission's archive, the amendment in question is not the way to do that.  The commission and the Government should apply the framework of the GDPR, which gives individuals many rights in respect of their personal data, including the right to be informed, the right of access, the right to rectification, the right to erasure and the right to object to data processing.  It makes no sense to single out one of these rights and omit the rest, including the immediate right of the subject to access personal data held by the commission.<\/p> <p> One of the arguments the Minister made is that as part of its work, the commission has created a database of every person to have passed through the main mother and baby homes, that the legislation needs to pass by 30 October or the database will be destroyed, and that the Government cannot allow this important information to be lost, which is why this is being done urgently.  We do not know why exactly the commission believes it will have to destroy the database of mothers and children that it created from the records it received if the legislation is not passed by 30 October.  It has not been explained why that is the case.<\/p> <p> From what we can tell, the commission has self-imposed this deadline of 30 October to give its final report to the Minister.  The current legislation, the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, states that on delivery of its final report, the commission will be dissolved.  This means the archive has to be sent to the Minister along with the final report under section 43 of the 2004 Act.  The commission appears to believe it cannot deliver personal data to the Minister, despite section 43 of the 2004 Act explicitly stating that every commission of investigation has to give every document or item of evidence gathered or created by it to the relevant Minister on concluding its work.  The GDPR was introduced in 2018 but poses no barrier to the transfer of these data to the Minister.  Archiving in the public interest is a legitimate ground for data processing under the GDPR.  Furthermore, if the commission were to destroy personal data, it would be a highly questionable form of data processing because the commission has no legislative basis on which to do that.<\/p> <p> This debate on the Bill, and the anger associated with it, is predicated on the belief, which the Minister has not dissuaded us from, that these records could be sealed for 30 years.  I ask him please, in the short time we have, to bring forward amendments that will put this right or, better still, withdraw the Bill and change the self-imposed deadline.<\/p> <p> We have all received long lists of correspondence.  One item stood out to me and what got to me was the first line of the email, which was from a woman called Anne.  She wrote that as far as she knows, she was born in Dublin to an unmarried mother on 7 March 1952.  I expect that all of us in the House have seen our birth certificates.  We probably have photos and stories and everything has been passed down to us.  Those privileges have been afforded to us by the luck of the draw of where we were born.  The email broke my heart.  Anne went on to detail her fight for information throughout the 68 years she has spent on this Earth, seeking basic information on who her mother and father were, where she was born and what happened to her.  She has no one left in this world apart from her sister.  This is just one of many stories.  They are stories that have so much horror to them, some of which have been outlined by other Deputies, and there are thousands more such stories out there.<\/p> <p> That is why the Bill demanded a sensitivity beyond that of any other legislation but that has been lost.  It is being rammed through and is another Bill being put through on the guillotine list.  It did not have to be like this and it still does not have to be like this.  There is still time and I ask the Minister please to reflect on it.  There is sound legal advice from the Justice for Magdalenes group and political will on this side of the House to do this in a different way.  We will support it but we cannot do it in this way.  This is not doing justice to the survivors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100038#TT00300","speaker":"1564","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603291500,"counter":304,"content":"<p>It is very difficult to countenance supporting the Government on the Bill in its current form.  I would characterise its passage as one of sowing additional confusion and obfuscation and having the effect of traumatising further the many women who look to the House and expect us to legislate on the basis of reason.  The manner in which the Bill was brought before the Seanad and now this House leaves one utterly disappointed because the subject matter is so sensitive that the least we would have expected, and that the women would have expected, is that we would give it proper and due consideration and time to reflect on all the issues in order that we could all move with one voice.<\/p>  <p>  The effect of the Government's stance, position and approach to the Bill will be to divide the House.  A minority of us will vote against the Bill, as it is currently constituted, while the majority will vote for it.  I expect that many on the Government benches will privately agree with the positions we are adopting, because we do so on the basis of reason and, one hopes, intelligence, but will still walk through the lobbies and vote T&aacute; with the Government.  I understand that happens even at the best of times, because I followed the Whip many a time when I was in government, but on an issue such as this, there has to be time and consideration.  I wrote to the Ceann Comhairle earlier to express my disappointment at the way in which certain Bills are being dealt with and to see whether we could find some mechanism to ensure that a Bill as sensitive as this would find a better way of progressing through both Houses in order that we could interrogate further what the Minister proposes.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, in his contribution, stuck rigidly to the 30 October deadline.<\/p> <p>I have been confused by this and perhaps the Minister will give us the benefit of his wisdom but it is my simple understanding that there is nothing injurious to the Constitution such that the Minister could not provide for an extension of time for the passage of this legislation or even an extension of time for the commission.  Is it overly simplistic of me to put forward the argument that there is nothing that says we as a legislature could not amend the Commission of Investigation Act 2004 to make provision for the very sensitive issues that are inherent within this Bill and for which the Minister is arguing he cannot move beyond the 30 October deadline?  That is the first point I will make and it is one on which I would love to receive an answer when the Minister is responding to this debate.<br\/><br\/>The second issue is that the Minister sent us a note by his advisor or staff earlier in which he says:<\/p><blockquote>\tFinally, with regard to the unfortunate urgency of this legislation, the Commission is due to submit its final report and stand dissolved in law by 30 October.  At present, that timeframe can only be amended where the Minister receives a request for an extension from the Commission which is grounded in an interim report.  This request then has to be considered and approved by Government.  To date, no request for an extension has been received.  As such, if this legislation is not enacted by 30 October then we will have failed to preserve the unique database developed by the Commission and provide for its use in line with data protection and other existing law. <\/blockquote> <p>Forgive my blinding ignorance and I seek the assistance of the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister on this but I would have thought, having served in Government, that there are lines of communication between the commission and the Government such that, if the Minister's argument is that he has not received the request and therefore has to adhere to the law, there is some mechanism that could be found to allow for us to give further consideration to this and some formal or informal line of communication can be established such that the Minister stands up in the House and says he would like more time to deliberate and that he would like an extension beyond 30 October.  How can we develop a mechanism or a protocol to be able to do that?  I am sure something could be found to do that and to facilitate both Houses of the Oireachtas to be able to give more time to the passage of this legislation.  Will the Minister please respond to that question because it is not just about me?  More important, it is about the people outside of these walls who are looking to us, who have written to us, who are traumatised and hurt, who want to ensure that whatever happens in here happens in a way that is sensitive to their needs.  Right now, the way they feel is that they are being traumatised again and we need to address that as a legislature.  If some mechanism can be found to find an extension then it should be found.  I think it can be found and that can be done easily.<br\/><br\/>The third point I will make is in respected of the Minister's speech where he says:<\/p><blockquote>\tI intend to request the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children, Disability, Equality and Integration to lead on this re-examination in a format that would allow for survivors and their representatives, expert legal opinion and other leading academics to explore thoroughly the major principles underlying the debate on access to personal information in the commission's archive and to make a set of recommendations aiming to resolve the very real difficulties which the passage of this legislation has highlighted.   <\/blockquote> <p>I am a member of that committee and my interpretation of that statement is that the Minister is asking me, as a member of that committee, to do the work the Minister should be doing as a Minister regarding the process of pre-legislative scrutiny and giving more time to deliberation of these issues such as the balance of rights between seeking information and of personal privacy and the issue of agency.  These issues should all be sorted before we come to the House to legislate, not after the fact, because Deputy Funchion, who made an astounding contribution to this debate earlier on, is chair of that committee and there is now an expectation being foisted on the committee that we would deal with and deliberate on these and come up with a set of recommendations.  Given the history of that committee under a previous mandate and not under the chairmanship of Deputy Funchion we have made umpteen recommendations through umpteen reports, as have many Oireachtas committees, which are gathering dust on shelves.  It insults my intelligence for the Minister to bring that before me as a Member of this Oireachtas when there is a mechanism and that is pre-legislative scrutiny, which was waived in this instance, and proper consideration in committee of all of these issues so that we can legislate properly, there is no request afterwards and we do not legislate in haste such that we are correcting errors after the fact.  It has permutations for how we do our business but it is an insult to the people who have been traumatized.  It is insulting to them to bring legislation in this way.  This should be non-partisan and it should dealt with in a way that ensures it progresses and every Member of this House agrees on it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100039#UU00200","speaker":"1514","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603292100,"counter":306,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Second Stage debate on the Commission of Investigation (Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters) Records, and another Matter, Bill 2020.  I will deal with the other matter that is dealt with in section 6, which is not connected specifically with the mother and baby home records but it is in this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  At the outset, I welcome the inclusion of section 6 of the Bill that makes amendments to the Judicial Council Act 2019 in respect of amending the timeframe for completion and adoption of personal injury guidelines which are so important.  This is an insurance issue in section 6 of this legislation.  As the Minister of State in the Department of Finance with responsibility for financial services, credit unions and insurance, I have a particular interest in this section as it has been of particular relevance to the Government's work on insurance reform, which is a key policy priority for the Government and which is reflected in the programme for Government.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of addressing premiums in the small businesses, leisure and community sector, a necessary step is to bring the level of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in comparable jurisdictions.  In this regard, the Personal Injuries Commission conducted a benchmarking of awards between Ireland and other jurisdictions for the first time.  This research showed that the award levels for certain injuries in Ireland were substantially higher than in England, Wales and other jurisdictions.  This situation may be unsustainable and the establishment of a judicial council last December is very important in addressing this issue.  It is hoped the personal injuries guidelines the council is to adopt could play a role in lowering the award levels and lead to a more consistent application of making awards in the courts.<\/p>  <p>  As things currently stand, pursuant to section 18(4) of the Judicial Council Act 2019, the personal injuries guidelines committee has no more than six months from the date of it establishment, 28 April 2020, to prepare and submit to the board for its review the first draft of the personal injuries guidelines, which meant not later than 28 October 2020.  However, the chair of this committee has requested a short extension to complete the work on this first draft of the guidelines rather than presenting them in an incomplete state by the current deadline.  Given the wider circumstances over the past few months in relation to Covid-19, we were satisfied to accede to this request.<\/p>  <p>  The overall effect of the changes proposed in section 6 addresses the concern expressed by the committee.<\/p> <p>To provide more details on this, the proposed amendments to section 18 of the Judicial Council Act 2019 substitutes into section 18(4) the phrase \"not later than 9 December 2020\" in place of the current phrase \"not later than 6 months\" which, in effect, was 28 October.  This amendment has the effect that the personal injuries guidelines committee must submit draft guidelines by 9 December 2020 to the board of the Judicial Council.  I believe this extension is important in order to allow the committee to produce draft guidelines in as complete a manner as possible.<\/p> <p> I turn to the proposed amendment of section 7.  As matters stand, the Judicial Council is to adopt the draft personal injuries guidelines prepared and submitted by the committee to the board with the modifications, if any, made by the board as soon a practicable and, in any event, not later than 12 months after such submission and to publish the person injuries guidelines as soon as practicable following such adoption.  This would have meant that the outer bound for the adoption of the new personal injury guidelines drawn up by the Judicial Council, the new regulations, would have been as late as October 2021.  The amendments to section 7 of the Judicial Council Act 2019 will have the effect that the Judicial Council will have to adopt the first personal injury guidelines not later than 31 July 2021 and publish them as soon as is practicable thereafter.  It should be noted, however, that where the personal injuries guidelines committee prepares guidelines in future years, the council will have up to 12 months to adopt them but they will, ideally, be adopted as quickly as possible after receipt of submission.<\/p> <p> I am of the view that accelerating the adoption of the personal injuries guidelines from a potential date of 28 October, which is imminent, to 31 July shows that the Government is serious about implementing reform in the insurance area as quickly as possible.  I reiterate my view that it is key that we reduce some personal injury award levels in this country and that there is consistency in award levels.  This would provide stability which would allow for an increase in both insurance availability and affordability.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge the role of the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy O'Gorman, for facilitating the inclusion of this particular section in this legislation.  It is before the House this week due to the urgency of the timeline in dealing with this insurance matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100040#VV00200","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603292700,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I have three and a half minutes to try to explain to the Minister how people have suffered for the past 70-odd years.

She is a friend and hero of mine.  She was forced to face a wall and they tore that child from her chest.

It is about doing the right thing in this Chamber.<\/p><p>They say that a bad law is an unjust law.  This law is a disgrace, as bad as any holocaust.  We must be the laughing stock of the world that we have a Government that wants to bury stuff.  Once we had the retention of records for 75 years, now we want them buried for 30 years.  As another Deputy said, we are not technically burying this information for 30 years but we are doing a bit of this, and putting that over there.  The people outside this Chamber are hurting and we are giving them no clarity as regards when they will get closure.  This was an absolutely disgusting, horrible and despicable thing to do to a human being.  Someone who treated an animal in that way would be punished hard today.<\/p><p>I met a man called Frank in Bessborough about three or four years ago.  He is deceased now.  He spoke to a crowd of survivors there.  He thought he was the only fellow sent from Ireland for adoption in Canada.  He brought back his little pants and jacket.  He did not get closure and he is dead now.  Another victim said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tMy childhood, there was years of intermittent abuse, but severe in many cases.  We were deprived of food if we disobeyed the rules.  We were beaten, we were abused sexually, emotionally, physically.  I bear some physical scars but for many years I bore the mental and emotional scars of my time.  It was there that I learned how to begin to resist. <\/blockquote>  <p>I have noticed that all of the Government's spokespersons for tonight are male.  What is wrong with the women coming in here and listening to the stories?  I feel it is tough and I am not a mother, although I am a parent.  I have spoken to people who have gone through this.  I appeal to the Government to do the right thing.  This can be changed and the Government must be able to do something.  There must be something within the provisions of this Chamber to change things and let it not go down in history that we have failed in 2020, dealing with matters stretching back as far as 1920, because we have not done the right thing.<\/p><p>I say to the Minister again that this is supposed to be in the public interest.  These survivors wanted their stories told so that what happened to them will never happen to somebody else.  That is what we are debating here and are supposed to get right.  Do not condemn the people who lived in hell in this country to live in hell when they die.  Many have, and we should be ashamed to have let them down.  <\/p><p>I ask the Minister to withdraw whatever we have to, sit down and let us do it right.  Everybody should have a choice and that is what it is about.  It is about people having choices.  We have silenced many people and families for the past 70 or 80 years and it is shameful, disgusting and decrepit, the most vile thing that can be done to a human being.  This was supported by the State and the church.  The Minister knows as well as I do that somebody made a profit out of it.

I absolutely agree.  We and the Government need to acknowledge that.  We need to acknowledge the bravery and dignity of those women and their children.  We also need to make sure we do not repeat those mistakes, that we do not use today, tomorrow and this legislation to silence those women and children again and sweep their stories and history under the carpet.  We need to listen to their voices and make sure that as we make our decisions today, we hear those voices when we are doing so.  It is important that we do not disenfranchise those people again and use this legislation to do that.<\/p>  <p>  I understand the rationale for this legislation.  The Minister does not want the records to be destroyed and because of that, there has been a bit of a rush with the legislation.  What he is essentially saying by doing that, and what the Taoiseach was saying yesterday, is that we will get this legislation through and come back later to the other issue.  The Minister is asking those women to trust him.  They are being asked to put their trust in the Government and in a State and institutions that have repeatedly failed them and let them down.  I really think it is a bridge too far, to be honest.  The State needs to build up trust and the onus is on it to do that.  It is not, and should never be, on the survivors - the women and children.  It should not be their responsibility to build that trust with us.  The Government needs to build that trust with them.<\/p>  <p>  When we are talking about building trust, it is about listening to voices.  I have a major concern about this legislation in that there was no consultation in respect of it.  I will talk about consultation with Deputies and about the democratic process later, but there has been no consultation with the survivors.  The collaborative forum, established by the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Katherine Zappone, was to be the new approach in the State's response under the theme \"Nothing about us without us\".  It was to involve the victims in an open and consistent engagement on these matters.  That forum was not consulted in the drafting of this legislation, nor were other groups.<\/p>  <p>  This is a complex and emotive issue.<\/p> <p>There are so many voices, but those voices need to be heard.  This Bill has not done that.  If that consultation had happened, we would not be in this position today where so many Deputies will find it impossible to vote in favour of the Bill as it currently stands.<\/p> <p> The Minister mentioned in his speech and in the media that the Bill does not seal the mother and baby homes archive for 30 years.  With all due respect, that is a cop-out.  This legislation triggers the 2004 Act.  The Bill could be used for good and to not allow that information to be sealed.  <\/p> <p> Deputies from across the House have tabled amendments, and many of them are very feasible and valuable.  It is really important that the Minister scrutinise them.  This Bill could be used to amend the 2004 Act and re-emphasise the legal superiority of the Act giving effect to the GDPR.  In doing so, that would ensure that the sealing of documentation does not happen.  They are relatively simple amendments that have been put forward to enable and ensure that the sealing of this documentation does not happen and women's histories are not sealed and hidden again for a long time.<\/p> <p> I listened to the debate in the Seanad and the debate today and there were so many emotive and upsetting stories.  As a mother, I do not understand how someone would get through something like that.  Those women did.  We cannot forget those stories.  The database is spoken of as being a valuable resource.  We use very technical terminology to describe all of this.  We cannot lose sight of what it will mean for those women and families.  We need to acknowledge that.<\/p> <p> I am a relatively new Deputy.  I have received over 3,500 emails to my office about the Bill.  They did not come only from those directly involved in the issue.  People from all over the country heard the story and wanted to express how frustrated and worried they were for the survivors and how they felt it was wrong to seal the documentation.  <\/p> <p> The Government has misread the mood of the nation on this.  Perhaps something like this would have gone through ten years ago and we would not have had such an outcry.  I do not think the Irish public will allow this to happen.  They will not want to see the women further impacted and silenced.  It is important that the Minister looks at this with an open heart. <\/p> <p> Very good amendments have been put forward by many Deputies across the Chamber.  I ask that the Minister consider how he can improve the Bill to make sure the database is not sealed.  I understand that in the amendments that have been put forward the dissolution of the commission will be what triggers the transfer or sealing of the information, and that dissolution will not happen until February.  Can the Minister confirm that?  Does that provide some breathing space to put forward something else in a month or two to make sure the information is not sealed?  It is very important that we do not allow this documentation to be sealed, that we listen to the voices of the women and do what is right in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100041#WW00800","speaker":"1627","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603293300,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I am very conscious of how we give other people's histories back to them.  With that in mind, I want to acknowledge that there are people listening to this debate who will be impacted by many of the stories and discussions we are having.  I want to acknowledge them and try to do justice to the testimony that we will bring forth today.<\/p>  <p>  I want to begin by commenting on one aspect of the Minister's speech.  He talked about the Ireland of today being very different to the Ireland of 1920.  That is a gross misunderstanding of how pervasive the legacy of institutional abuse and incarceration has been in this country.  I promise the Minister that the Ireland of 1920 continued until 1996 when the last Magdalen laundry on Sean MacDermott Street closed.  There are people today, young and old, who are still being impacted by discussions we have.  The Ireland of 1920 continued long after.<\/p>  <p>  I am always conscious of a human rights lawyer in the United States, Bryan Stevenson, when I think about restorative justice and how we own our own memory.  I will paraphrase him badly.  He said when one becomes conscious of the injustices contained within one's own nation's past, one starts to see them replicated elsewhere.  Bryan Stevenson was talking about the legacy of slavery and how it continued with the incarceration of African-American men in the United States.  However, we can apply that concept to the injustices of our nation's past and how we can see them replicated throughout our history should we choose to open our eyes and look. <\/p>  <p>  The injustices of the Irish nation are ones we often ascribed to our struggle against the British empire and our fight for freedom.  Far more injustices occurred within these islands long after that freedom was delivered.  We never really discussed what that independence meant for the average person on the street who lived in Ireland throughout that period and what became of him or her.  The injustices that were inflicted upon our own population are something we have never really opened our eyes to.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill we are discussing deals with 4,000 pages that give life to many of those injustices.  It is lamentable in the extreme that the Minister &ndash; I do not want to personalise this &ndash; is going to wilfully seal those documents from public perusal, discussion and understanding.  Contained within them would be a fundamental understanding of who we are as a people and what we have inflicted upon ourselves throughout the course of the State's short history.  That is really important and I want to acknowledge that.<\/p>  <p>  Contained in the 4,000 documents we are discussing and struggling over access to is a social, ecclesiastical and feminist history of this country.  If we are to have a strong, thorough and real interpretation of who we are as a people, those documents will be essential to that understanding.<\/p>  <p>  There was a contradiction in the Minister's statement, in the sense that he said he is not sealing the records and people will have access to them, but in fact they will be sealed from any sort of discourse and discussion and will not be available for people to explore their full detail.  That is really important. <\/p>  <p>  The Minister said he did not know what was in the documents.  Is there information on, for example, forced adoptions, the physical abuse perpetrated in these institutions and the medical experimentation that was discovered?  This is all absolutely essential information and it will be locked away.  We will not have access to it.  Is there information on the collusion of the State with church organisations in continuing this practice over decades of our history?  That knowledge is what we will lose when the documents are sealed. <\/p>  <p>  The opportunity to understand ourselves will be lost if the Bill passes.  Of equal importance is what those 4,000 documents would say about who we are today as a people.  Does the Minister not feel that if we are fully aware of the injustices of the past, we would be more conscious of the manner in which we replicate them today?  Some of the practices, which I know the Minister would stand against, would be deemed unconscionable.  <\/p>  <p>  Does the Minister not see that there is a continuum in terms of the mother and baby homes, Magdalen laundries, asylums and industrial schools that leads right up to direct provision centres?  There is a continuum that leads up to the fact that the most vulnerable group in our society, even today, are lone parents who are statistically at risk of poverty and the structural violence that goes with that.<\/p> <p>If we fully appreciate the horrors of our institutional past, measures such as family hubs where women and children are incarcerated to the profit of other companies would be unconscionable.  If we fully understand that past, which is what we are fighting over here, these practices would become grotesque in our mind and unconscionable and perhaps we would not continue them.  That is what we are struggling for.<\/p> <p> I lament the manner in which the Bill has been dragged to this House at this point.  It has been very unfortunate.  We received more than 4,000 emails from citizens all over this country which crashed the servers of the Oireachtas last week.  I tried my best to get through as many as I could but it was simply impossible.  The ones I did get through talked about their personal stories and about how they, their mothers and family members were impacted.  Under the cover of a pandemic we are not allowed the opportunity for civil discourse and discussion.  I imagine that if we were not in the midst of a pandemic, many of those voices and faces would be outside Leinster House and we would have to look them in the eye and the passing of this Bill would become a lot harder.  Rather, it was rammed through the Seanad and we had no opportunity for pre-legislative discussion, it will face a guillotine tonight and under the cloak of a pandemic, it will pass.  This is really unfortunate.  <\/p> <p> I expected to find this Minister a reforming one but the sheer absence of engagement with civic society on this Bill suggests that this may not be the case.  There was no substantial engagement with survivors.  Human rights lawyers and civic society representatives were offering to meet the Minister and to discuss their genuine concerns about this Bill. These are people who do not come from the oppositional politics sphere, which exists across this Chamber.  They have dedicated their lives to standing up for the truth and revealing a broader understanding of who we are and the injustices that were inflicted on people in our country.  These people have not been dealt with.<\/p> <p> The data protection expert, Simon McGarr, produced a very interesting piece of information in that he felt that this legislation would not be permissible in accordance with EU law and that the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and GDPR practices would supersede the 2004 Act, which we seem to be clinging to in this Chamber, and that we will end up in the courts next year.  An administrative error and a moral wrong would be upheld in the European court.  There was no engagement there.  <\/p> <p> Who was the Minister talking to?  Is it just the same officials who were just telling him what to do?  I expected better than that.  <\/p> <p> The Minister asked for trust in bringing forward new legislation.  Speaking to him as a representative of the State, the State has no legitimacy to ask the survivor community for trust.  We have failed them at every turn.  He should not ask this community to trust us now.  We have no grounds for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100042#XX00200","speaker":"1560","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603293900,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle.  It is so important during this debate to remember the gravity of it.  We are talking about the worst human rights violations imaginable: missing children, enforced disappearance, illegal adoptions, incarceration and so much more horrific systematic institutional abuse.  It is so important to remember that this commission was formed in light of the discovery of the remains of 800 babies and young children found in Tuam in unmarked graves and a disused septic tank.  This is one of ten Irish institutions run by religious orders, to which approximately 35,000 unmarried pregnant women were sent.<\/p>  <p>  What happened and what was allowed to happen was disgraceful.  It is hard to imagine something even more disgraceful than that, but here it is.  Instead of talking about what immediate action we can take to provide justice to those affected, we are talking about letting these documents be sealed for 30 years, denying survivors access to their own information.  <\/p>  <p>  This is contrary to the wishes of survivors, researchers and human rights lawyers and to recommendations of previous reports on institutional abuse, torture, rape, and forced adoptions.  This legislation is also simply incompatible with EU law concerning access to personal information.  <\/p>  <p>  Can anyone even imagine any other scenario whereby crucial information about crimes of this magnitude, when no one has been held to account, would be sealed for 30 years?  Justice delayed is justice denied.  Many affected have already passed away without justice.  If those records are locked away for 30 years, many survivors will be denied any opportunity to seek the resolution they deserve.<\/p>  <p>  The State continues to treat this as a scandal to be contained rather than an opportunity to do what is right and to provide dignity and healing for survivors and their families.  If what the Minister said is true, and he has no intention of keeping these files sealed then why on Earth does he not just legislate for that now?  The bare minimum the State can do after all of its failings in respect of institutional abuse is to at least consider what impact legislation such this may have on survivors.  The sealing of archives by previous Governments, the gagging order and the hostile treatment of survivors by the State authorities on the whole have compounded the trauma for so many and now it is happening again.<\/p>  <p>  That people deserve more is an understatement.  They deserve access to their own information, compensation, justice in every imaginable way.  Not only do they deserve it, it is their right.  At the very least they deserve respect.  To ignore survivors' pleas, regardless of anything else, to amend this legislation and to unnecessarily push it through these Houses without pre-legislative scrutiny disrespects them and is quite frankly disgusting.<\/p>  <p>  I believe Deputy O'Gorman became a Minister to try to do good, I believe he knows that this Bill goes against that intention and I believe him that it is complicated and technical, but he is morally obliged to do everything possible to listen to the survivors.  We will all support him in this.  We do not want this to be a partisan issue.  I ask him to please make the necessary changes and accept the well-researched and survivor-centred amendments to make this a law we can all get behind.  <\/p>  <p>  At this point, if the legislation is pushed through in its current form, the only question worth asking is: whose interests is he protecting?  It is not those of survivors. <\/p>  <p>  We have a history of staying silent and silencing people on these issues.  When we do that, we hurt the thousands of people who have suffered.  We live alongside these people every day. <\/p>  <p>  I plead with the Minister to prevent further injustice for people seeking basic dignity and access to their stories.  There is no closure without justice and there can be no justice if the State continues to protect everyone&rsquo;s interests except those of the survivors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100043#YY00200","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1603293900,"counter":319,"content":"<p>This is a very important Bill.  I agree with all of the sentiments expressed in the context of those who have suffered most.  To them we owe the most truth and that is the core of what I believe, as does everybody in this House.  This is not just about one political party but all of us together, as Irish people and as Oireachtas Members.  We all want to vindicate the rights of the people who suffered so greatly and abominably in the mother and baby homes together with the terrible and appalling vista that was visited on those children.<\/p>  <p>  We can all be emotional and I am as emotional as anybody else in the Chamber.  I am a parent and a grandparent and I know from my understanding what happened to some of those families, as other people here do.  We all want the whole and all the truth.  We want, most of all, the report of this commission to be published and to be available.  We want in particular for the survivors to be satisfied and fully consulted in what is going to happen following the Second Stage debate.  A darkness was at the heart of a great deal of what happened in our country after we achieved our freedom in 1922.  There was a heart of darkness there and no soul or light.  It was bleak, dark and appalling.  <\/p>  <p>  When the Oireachtas passed the legislation to allow this commission to commence operation, it dealt fully and comprehensively with all the issues raised by Sinn F&eacute;in, the Labour Party, and that we all raised here.  Nobody is hiding from anybody here.  I do not believe, in fairness to the Minister, that he is hiding either.  The commission was asked to establish the circumstances and arrangements relating to the entry of single women, what happened to their children, to examine mortality among mothers and children, to investigate post mortem practices, to examine arrangements for the entry of children into these institutions, what happened to children who did not remain in the care of their parents, together with the extent of their welfare considerations, and so on.  It goes to the heart of the role played by religious orders, civil society, the State, families, and partners&rsquo; families in respect of single women and their children, and so on.<\/p> <p>Nothing will be hidden in this report.  What is most important is that it is published.  Putting all the politics aside, the Minister is saying that unless legislation is passed to allow this to happen the commission is legally obliged to redact all and every bit of the data it has, in other words, we will never get to the bottom of this issue.  It is not beyond the capacity of this House for the Minister, the Taoiseach and the leaders of all the parties to get together and find a way forward that will allow the report to be published, the data to be protected and to examine the issues that seem to avoid us.  I do not believe they divide us at all.<br\/><br\/>The Leader of Sinn F&eacute;in said that she supports privacy as an issue but she does not support secrecy.  I absolutely agree with her but when we established the commission we said that it had the power to establish a confidential committee which could provide in its procedures for individuals to have their identity remain confidential during the conduct of the commission and its subsequent reporting.  The commitment given legally by us as Members of the Oireachtas at that time was that the privacy of the individual would be respected.  That is what we said must happen and that is what I believe is happening.  Is that not the kernel of the issue?  There should be no secrecy about that fact.  Subsection (7) of the statutory instrument establishing the commission states:<\/p><blockquote>\tIn order to assist public understanding the Commission should provide in its reports an outline of the archival and other sources of most relevance to these issues and the nature and extent of the records therein, together with the challenges and opportunities in exploiting these sources for the purpose of further historical research or examination. <\/blockquote> <p>It is clear that the intent of the Oireachtas was that this issue would be addressed by the commission and in its report it is asked to report on those issues and how we might deal with them.<br\/><br\/>I do not believe there is any real issue dividing us.  If it requires the Minister meeting all the leaders of the parties, with the Taoiseach and so on, he needs to do that.  We need to get this right.  The legislation establishing the commission is very clear.  If the difference that divides us is about the privacy of the individual who was given a commitment that his or her name will not be used, that does not prevent publication.  There is no secrecy about publishing it with the name redacted.  That is not unfair or unreasonable.<br\/><br\/>Nobody in this House has a monopoly on caring.  Nobody in this House, in opposition or in government, has the right to stand in the way of the survivors and their right to full transparency about what happened to them but it is in the context of the legislation established.

We want the truth to come out and I suggest to the Minister that that is what we need to do.<\/p>  <p>  The Attorney General has to give legal advice and so on but we can all solve this issue.  If the Minister has been advised that 30 October is the deadline, which is irrevocable in terms of the data if the commission does not request an extension, the House has to recognise that.  We have to find a way that will satisfy all Members of the House that we can resolve the issue after that date.  I believe that is at the heart of this.  I will not vote for something that involves hiding records for 30 years, as we have been challenged on here.  We are not trying to hide something.  We do not want to hide the truth.  We want the report published.  I want it published.  Deputy Gannon wants it published.  Let us come to the truth, and the truth will out.

If it is the case that they have not been consulted the Minister must consult with their representative bodies, organisations and associations immediately.  Above all, they are entitled to closure.

What is wrong with this State that it will add public insult to the personal injury it inflicted on thousands of girls, women and their babies?  Its pursuit of decency, morality and respectability resulted in the persecution of the poor, the innocent and their children.  What is wrong with this State that to this day, in 2020, it is still suspicious of poor women?  It will scrutinise them for a few quid while it gives the bankers who broke us free rein.  The Minister said that things have changed.  I disagree because while we are debating almost a century of abuse, Aoife Grace Moore is writing about single mothers being intruded upon and pursued by inspectors from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.<\/p>  <p>  I will tell the House what is wrong with this State.  It is a century of two conservative parties which between them toiled with the plight and the fate of Ireland's women.  When the Irish revolution was done and independence was won for the Twenty-six Counties, the counter-revolutionaries of those two conservative parties shunted the women and the girls, the gun runners and the soldiers of Cumann na mBan back to their proper duties in the bedroom and in the kitchen, making the babies and making the dinner.  I am talking about poor women especially, the miracle workers who managed to get themselves pregnant all on their own.  For decades, these miraculous women were put away.  Their children, taken, stolen and trafficked, were buried in septic tanks to ensure that, in the context of power and influence, the governing parties could call themselves the God-fearing Government of respectable mother Ireland; the irony of that.<\/p>  <p>  That is why there was a tsunami of public calls and emails to Deputies and Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; on this Bill.  Given the evidence of a century of women being put into laundries, industrial schools, asylums and mother and baby homes, today's women and feminists do not trust Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to do what is right now and was then, and the Minister should not trust them either.  The tsunami brought about amendments from the Green Party Minister but the campaigners are not satisfied with his amendments.  First, Tusla should never be given hold of these records.  Second, we cannot have a report in November that reflects testimony given up to February.  Third, these records must not be sealed because we must be able to examine what happened to these women and their children - our women, our children, each one a missing person, accused by propriety, convicted by the State for their crime of poverty, the worse crime of expressing their sexuality in a way that was beyond the control of church and State or their cheek of being victims of rape, sexual abuse or incest.  <\/p>  <p>  This State did it wrong but Sinn F&eacute;in and the Opposition, in their policies and amendments, are determined to right that wrong.  The story of these missing women and their missing children tells itself in terms of the rubbish choices this State makes.  It is our social dysfunction and the sadness that is just beneath the surface.  It is a story that needs public examination and not the sealing of records.<\/p> <p>I beg the Minister to accept our amendments.  I beg the Members, including the women of the governing parties, not to support this Bill.

It interviewed over 500 people who lived or worked in the homes from 1922 to 1998.  Over 70,000 women went to these homes.  I do not wish to personalise anything but I just want to give a flavour of the extent of this issue.  In the party I belong to, People Before Profit, we get a flavour of what went on from our own elected representatives.  Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett was born in a mother and baby home.  Deirdre Wadding, a former councillor of ours in Wexford, had a child in Bessborough in 1981.  She states they were not the darkest days but that the darkest moments she remembers were when she had to go into the laundry room, where she felt the shadow of the generations of the women who went before her.  Mr. Gino O'Boyle, a councillor for People Before Profit in Sligo, lost his father at the age of 56.  His father, Seamie, had been a councillor and had no access to his medical history.  He was raised in Nazareth House, which is in the Sligo region.  Since he had no access to his medical history, he was not aware that he had a congenital heart disease that would end his life early.  Therefore, Mr. O'Boyle believes that, in a roundabout way, the deprivation of access to the records took his father away from him.  Although the representatives I have mentioned are happy for their names to go on record, I am really mentioning them as a way of showing this is not a niche subject; it hits and touches to the heart tens of thousands of people.  Not alone is the existing generation affected but the generations that follow will also be affected.  It is not just the people who gave birth or grew up in a mother and baby home who are affected because their children and the children who come after them will be also.  Therefore, this matter is extremely important.  I realise that the Minister understands that and is on the right side of this but I want to explore what I cannot understand about what is going on.<\/p>  <p>  My first point is that we keep hearing that if we do not pass this Bill tomorrow night when we vote, the archive assembled by the commission will be destroyed.  This idea seems to have entered the Minister's head, and it is deeply embedded in the Taoiseach's head given what he said quite emphatically here yesterday.  Is it the case that, as in \"Mission Impossible\", the archive will self-destruct after midnight on 30 October?  How is that going to happen?  If we accept it is a fact that the archive will somehow be destroyed after 30 October if we do not pass this Bill and the commission is dissolved, what should we be doing here tonight?  What should be the first priority of this House and the Minister?  I suggest it would be not to accept it as a fact that the archive must be destroyed.  The first thing the Minister should do is introduce an emergency measure, an amendment to the relevant Act, that will ensure the commission's archive will endure and will not be destroyed.  It gets ever more curious because, try as we might, we could find no reference in the 2004 Act that confirms that destruction must happen.  It states what should happen with the records deposited with the Minister and what is and is not covered by data protection, freedom of information or national archives.  Nowhere did we see a reference to the idea that, on the date of the ending of the commission, this State will have a group of civil servants surround a brasier to burn or shred the archive.  Could the Minister please tell me where in law it states it must be destroyed at midnight on 30 October?  If he can point that out to me, we should set about amending the relevant Act immediately.<\/p>  <p>  We are rushing through legislation, as has been done time and again.  We rushed through legislation on financial provisions quite recently.  The legislation was 300 pages long.  Even one of the Ministers speaking on it said he did not fully understand it.  We rushed through the bank bailout legislation overnight and we have rushed through legislation on deadlines in law and regulations in a matter of hours without really knowing the implications but we must not do the same thing now.  We do not seem to be able to prevent the imposition of a law that seems to be somewhere on the Statute Book that requires the archive to be destroyed.  If the Minister can prevent that, he would be doing hundreds of thousands of people and their families, from the past, present and future, a great favour.  This is one of the most shameful episodes in our history and the State has to stop the archive from being destroyed.<\/p>  <p>  I believe the Minister is genuine in his statements but I am astonished he believes the narrative.  If he is being told by the top echelon of civil servants that the archive must be destroyed if it is not sealed once it becomes his property, he should explain to this House and, more important, the public how that can happen.  One would have to have lived on another planet not to understand why the survivors and their families are affected so badly by this and are so angry and outraged over the way in which this has proceeded.  Even if we accept that the Minister is genuine in his concern, we are dealing with people who have seen a different side of this State than he has.  It is the side of the State that has washed its hands of the responsibility for the safety of children.  The individuals affected have seen a state collude in the abuse, rape and torture of the most vulnerable women and their children, and they have seen a state watch over the malnutrition of children.  They have seen a state collude in the selling of babies and the absolution of past crimes of religious orders and church authorities for which they should have faced justice.  I refer, in particular, to the Woods deal made by Fianna F&aacute;il &mdash; the disgraceful redress deal struck with the Catholic Church.  Is the Minister surprised by how the affected people and their families react to the news that the archive and documents of history will be sealed for 30 years or face destruction?<\/p>  <p>  There is another question I want answered.  I appreciated the Minister's briefing yesterday and that he is tabling some amendments that will go some way towards meeting the concerns of people who did not sign up to privacy, as in the case of former councillor, Deirdre Wadding.  Ms Wadding said quite deliberately that she wanted her name on her story, as did many more like her who sat in a hotel with the former Minister, Katherine Zappone, to determine a sort of framework by which the commission would investigate matters.  They wanted their names in the public arena but they were handed some silly leaflet &mdash; I hand out leaflets all the time, which the Minister will know is what agitators like me do &mdash; that has attached to it a great amount of legal importance that I believe it should not have.  The Minister needs to answer the question in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The questions of privacy or secrecy seem to morph into each other.  I asked the Minister yesterday what exactly will be sealed.  He stated that personal stories, the evidence and a large number of records collected by the commission, many of which he said are already accessible, would be sealed.  I then asked him whether they are all accessible and he said he does not know.  If he does not, who the hell else will?  If he is prepared to seal the records for 30 years without knowing exactly what is in them, it is outrageous.  He must not do that.  If he is not going to be able to do it, he should please table an amendment to whatever Act states civil servants can stand around a brasier and burn the files at midnight on 30 October.  We cannot tolerate it and the Minister has to do something about it.<\/p>  <p>  Let me respond to Deputy O'Dowd, who stated we are all in this together and that we could all sit down and bang our heads together.  That is what we do as legislators and that is why we read legislation, come up with amendments, have arguments and try to stop Bills such as this one being rushed, as I and other Deputies did during the week.  We are genuinely trying to stop the Minister from rushing this through but the whole apparatus around him seems to be determined to do so.  The Taoiseach was adamant today that these records will be destroyed if we do not seal them for 30 years.  I remind Deputy O'Dowd that the party he belongs to and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party have overseen the legacy of this State.  In the past 100 years, they have dominated the running of this State so they cannot just wash their hands of this matter and say we are all in this together and that we should come up with a universal solution.  The universal solution is not to do what is proposed; it is to listen to the survivors.<\/p> <p>The Minister is introducing emergency measures to prevent the archive being sealed or destroyed.  I do not understand that notion.  The Minister needs to come up with an amendment that would be acceptable to us and the survivors.  Many of the survivors have died since the report was published.  We welcomed the publication of that report.  The Minister needs to come up with a means of defending those people by allowing the public to have access to all of the documentation.  The Minister himself does not know what documentation will be sealed.  That is an outrageous element of this that I cannot accept.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100045#AAA00200","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603295700,"counter":329,"content":"<p>There is something seriously wrong in this.  The women who went through the abuse of the mother and baby homes experienced many horrors.  The one thing they all had in common was that there were other people telling them what was best for them, what was supposedly in their best interests and making decisions for them.  These people might have been the parents who drove or brought the young woman to the mother and baby home and decided that was where she should live for the next number of years, the garda who collected the young woman on the roadside, put her into a car and drove her back to the home from where she was trying to flee or the nuns.  <i>The Light in the Window<\/i>, by June Goulding, who was the midwife at the Bessborough mother and baby home in the 1950s, tells the story of the nun who would march up and down the corridor outside the room where women were giving birth and gleefully deny them painkillers as a punishment for their sins which resulted in them getting pregnant.  The nuns, the garda or the parents made the decisions for these women.<\/p><p>In the year 2020, Ireland is now a modern state, a republic.  Despite this, thousands of women and people have written to us in the past week or ten days beseeching, begging and appealing to us not to do what the Government wants to do.  The Government and the Minister, who has just left the Chamber, say they know best and they will make the decision despite what people want.  This might be more modern and sophisticated than what the parents, the garda and the nuns did, but is the attitude in any way fundamentally different?  &quot;We know best&quot; says the Government.  <\/p><p>There is a saying that is used by groups of people who are oppressed in society when they want to make the point that decisions should be made by them about their lives and not by other people about their lives.  That saying is, &quot;Nothing about is without us&quot;.  People should have a right not just to a say but to decide what is in their best interests.  This is being completely pushed aside in this process.  The Government and the Minister say they know best.  A hard-nosed civil servant would blush at what is going on here.  I shake my head at the thought of this being steered through the D&aacute;il by a Green Party Minister.  Is this where the Green Party is at these days?  <\/p><p>I would like to make a point about Tusla.  It is clear from the emails that came into my office, and I thank each and every person who sent me an email, that people do not want Tusla in control of the files.  People suggest alternatives.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland was mentioned in many of the emails as an alternative.  The Minister knows this.  He knows, too, that the mother and baby home collaboration forum, the chairperson of which was appointed by the former Minister, Katherine Zappone and comprised 20 members, including advocates, raised specific criticisms of Tusla in regard to this issue and said in its report that there was a practice in Tusla of withholding identity and personal information from applicants detained as children across various institutions.  The Government and the Minister know best and they are giving this responsibility to Tusla despite what people want.  It is disgraceful.  <\/p><p>The sealing of records for 30 years means people will not have access to them for 30 years.  Many people, because of their age, will never have access to them.  Is this another form of abuse?  I believe it is and it should not happen.  Points were raised about anonymity and confidentiality.  Nobody is minimising the importance of these issues, least of all the campaigners, the advocates and the survivors.  They are very aware of these issues and the sensitivities around the information but they rightly point out that many people who gave evidence are not just willing, they are happy to have their names included, as evidenced in the examples given earlier by Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.  They want the story to be told and known and for their names to be part of that story.  The anonymity, confidentiality and wishes of other people can be protected and respected by way of redactions.  This does not require files to be sealed, let alone for a period of 30 years such that people whose lives have been affected so much may never get a chance to see them.  This decision should not be rushed.  The debate should be extended.  Additional time for discussion can be provided by way of emergency legislation.  The Government will have the support and co-operation of every party and none in respect of any emergency legislation to provide for an extension to enable this matter receive the time it deserves, thus respecting the wishes of the survivors.  The Government needs to learn how to listen on this issue.  It is not about what it wants or how it feels.  Rather, it is about what is in the interests of the survivors, society and the greater good.  I reiterate the phrase I mentioned earlier, &quot;Nothing about us without us&quot;.  It is a good way of approaching issues like this.  These people who were born in the mother and baby homes have been treated badly by society.  They should not, and must not, be treated badly again because of a bad decision, a wrong decision, on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100046#BBB00200","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1603295700,"counter":330,"content":"<p>On 19 February 2013, the then Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, gave a State apology and the Visitors Gallery was full that night of survivors of the Magdalen laundries.  It was one of the stand-out nights of my time in this House to meet those women, to see their courage and their strengthen and to hear of their journeys and how they survived them.  Those people are still on that journey.  I am deeply uneasy at the haste in which this legislation is being brought through given all of the horrible things that were done and the many blockages they faced on that journey.  This legislation will proceed through both Houses in less than seven days.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister's opening statement this evening.  <\/p> <p>I know he is genuine about trying to address the issues raised.  We had a good meeting with him yesterday but there are still questions relating to several issues.<\/p> <p> We are being told about the 30 October deadline.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith raised the matter just now.  Where is that deadline provided for?  Who set it?  I too have searched to find out where it is laid out in legislation.  Was it imposed by the commission?  Initially, we were told that the lifetime of the commission was to finish on 30 October, yet we have an amendment that will extend the lifetime of the commission to do work on access to the database.<\/p> <p> I know people want to see the commission's report and the steps that will be taken.  They want to see their stories told.  However, for the sake of a couple of weeks, the various competing claims around this legislation need to be analysed and fully gone through properly on Committee Stage, not in the convention centre with all its space.  In a committee room we get a chance to go through legislation line by line and hear the views of different people.  In any event, I recognise the genuineness of the Minister in trying to deal with the issues.<\/p> <p> We speak of sealing records for 30 years.  The Minister must clarify what exactly he means by sealing and what exactly will be sealed.  He referred to information being shared with multiple Departments and organisations.  In many ways, that is part of the problem.  It is the kernel of the problem.  Information was being shared and split and this was used as a block to getting information.  People had to go to A, B, C, D and E to get personal information, which added to the time involved and the distress and agony.<\/p> <p> I understand the balance that has to be reached.  I understand the major complications relating to personal information and permission around personal information.  The archive and database contain institutional information, including information on methods and financing relating to the various institutions.  If we are proposing to lock away all of that, we will lock away the opportunity to hold these institutions, methods and financing to account.  It is wrong to lose that opportunity.  It cannot be allowed.  None of us wants to do that.  Who will account for the institutional stories within the archive if it is to be locked away?  I know the Minister will seek to clarify that this evening.<\/p> <p> The Minister has given assurances.  The briefing we had with him yesterday was useful and I thank his staff.  From his speech today, it is clear he is genuine in his assurances.  However, these women have been given a lifetime of assurances along many steps of the way.  They were told things would be done differently.  There was acknowledgement of the pain.  They are not listening any more because they have been let down so often.  I know this Minister will not do that.  I know he will try not to, but the system seems, either deliberately or by accident, to conspire to consistently let them down.  We are rushing through this legislation.  I know it is not meant personally but inadvertently it tramples on the sensitivity of what we are discussing.  It is simply another episode in a catalogue of mistreatment and abuse that the Oireachtas will not give enough scrutiny to every legislative measure around this issue.  We need to consider where these people have come from.<\/p> <p> The issues raised by the commission around Tusla, the way the agency does its work and engages with survivors and people looking for information need to be dealt with.  These people need to be assured that if Tusla is managing and handling this information, it will do so showing the utmost respect and dignity for those whose information they are handling.  The commission has flagged this as an issue that needs to be addressed.<\/p> <p> This is extraordinarily complex.  It is unfortunate that people are trying to score party political points out of it.  That is not helpful.  Every Deputy and Senator wishes to get this right.  If we had more time, we could make a better job of getting it right.  Given the Minister's commitment this evening and his sincerity, I am prepared to support him but he cannot become the latest Minister and institution to let these women, these heroes, down.  He cannot do that to them or to the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100046#BBB00300","speaker":"1602","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603296300,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I am conscious that the Chamber and the Houses of the Oireachtas have approached this legislation and this type of question numerous times in the past.  Those most vulnerable and in need of support have often fared poorly.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and Certain Related Matters was never meant to be an end in and of itself.  Maybe there are those who hoped it would be.  Maybe there are those who wished it never happened.  There is no doubt that the commission in its terms of reference was far from complete or comprehensive.  For example, in my county of Meath, the Good Shepherd Sisters Ard Mhuire home in Dunboyne was included in the work of the commission but the St. Joseph's and St. Clare's institution in Stamullen was not, despite the fact that we know it was a mother and baby home in every practical meaning of that term.  Unmarried mothers were separated from their babies there.  Babies died there.  Some babies underwent vaccine trials there.  Advocates estimate there were over 180 such institutions.  Many survivors were excluded from the process.<\/p>  <p>  In the conduct of its business the commission has refused survivors the opportunity to a public hearing.  Then it made the case that there was little demand for such public hearings.  In this way and in other ways the commission was not what it could be and not what it should have been.  Despite that, it has done important work.  It has compiled, collated, generated and gathered information.  The sum total of its work will be made up of each component part and that is what it will leave.  A report of 4,000 pages, or however many pages, based on the commission's distinct perspective and analysis, will not suffice and could never suffice.<\/p>  <p>  In the first instance, the archive and records must be available to survivors.  This is their wish and it must be respected.  The records must stay intact and must not be sealed.  They must not go to Tusla.  The Minister has the power to make that happen.  He can amend the 2004 legislation if needed, although I am unsure whether that is needed.  He can retrospectively prescribe if needed - he is already doing that.  The Minister should take this opportunity to put right these wrongs and show survivors that Ireland has changed.  We stand ready to support him if that is what he wants to do.<\/p>  <p>  Several of my colleagues have used this opportunity to read the words of survivors into the record of the D&aacute;il.  With my last few seconds I will do the same.  One survivor who spoke to the Clann project on the subject of coercion and forced adoptions said: \"In early February 1968, when my baby boy was six-seven weeks old, he was wrenched from my breast by one of the nuns whilst I was breastfeeding him and taken away for adoption.\"  She made clear that \"at no time did I give my consent to my son's adoption.\"  Another said she was not given any other options.  A survivor I spoke to said she did nothing wrong and her baby did nothing wrong.  They did nothing wrong but they were failed and now is the time to change that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100047#CCC00200","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speech","time":1603296300,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I had hoped to move a reasoned amendment at this stage to delay the Second Reading of the Bill for 30 days because I believe it is being rushed.  It is being rushed because we are being asked to consider legislation without all the relevant information being disclosed to us.<\/p>  <p>  Let us remember that the commission of inquiry was established by the Houses of the Oireachtas and not by the Minister or the Government.  The reports should have been published and made available to this House before we considered this legislation.  The sixth interim report, which Deputy Connolly will speak about later, specifically raises the issues before us today in terms of the transfer of records to the Minister.<\/p> <p>However, we are being asked to consider this legislation without having access to information that was intended to be presented to us.  The Minister's predecessor, former Deputy Zappone, said on 16 February last that she intended to publish that interim report as soon as practicable.  We are being asked to consider this legislation without that relevant information being provided to us.  That is wrong.<\/p> <p> I had drafted a considered amendment providing that the legislation be delayed for one month and that the final report of the commission of investigation would not be published until 30 November.  I received the support of Deputies Connolly, Berry, Canney, Fitzpatrick, Grealish, Lowry, Verona Murphy, Shanahan, Pringle and Joan Collins on the point that the report would be made available to us before we would consider Committee Stage of the Bill.  The reason it is imperative to do that is that the Minister will not answer me as to what records are being held under article 1(V) of the terms of reference of the commission, concerning vaccine trials.<\/p> <p> This is an issue I have consistently raised in the House for the past 20 years and I have yet to get clear answers on it.  It was referred to the Laffoy commission but because of a legal challenge, the commission did not consider it.  In an act of nothing short of criminal negligence, the records collated by the Laffoy commission were handed back to the original sources in 2012.  When this legislation establishing the commission of investigation was before us in 2015, I asked if those records could and would be acquired again.  The then Minister, former Deputy James Reilly, assured me that could and would happen.  Since that date, however, I have received no information, as a Member of this House, as to what records were collated.  Now we are being told that even if those records are retrieved from the various orders again, we will not be able to see them for the next 30 years.<\/p> <p> The reality is the children in these institutions were used as lab rats.  They were the guinea pigs for vaccine trials.  It is unbelievable to think that the normal, standard vaccine at the time, the three-in-one whooping cough vaccine, was given to the general population but the trial vaccine was given to the children in the institutions because those involved did not have to worry about the issue of consent.  The State provided consent for that because some of these trials were published in scientific papers.  There is no way these trials were ethical when all of the guinea pigs were children in the institutions.  While some of the trials were supposed to take place for a two-year period starting in 1973 and consent was given by the National Drugs Advisory Board at the time, that particular trial went on into 1976.  From digging around, we know there were trials in the late 1960s and into the 1970s.  Some go back to the 1930s but none of us knows when they finished.<\/p> <p> The children involved, who are adults today, have a right to know what concoctions they received and why they were involved in trials.  Some of them were involved not in one, two or three trials but in four separate trials.  No records are available because they were handed back to the religious orders back in 2012 and we have not heard anything since.  Now we are being told that even when those records come back, they will locked in a safe for the next 30 years.  Sixty or 70 years after these babies were used as guinea pigs, with some having potentially suffered adverse medical conditions as a result of being used in those trials, there is not much point in these people getting access to those records.  Their children and grandchildren can find out why their grandparent had a particular chronic illness because he or she was used as a guinea pig.  The State colluded in that.  The religious orders were involved in it as well, as was Wellcome.  It is a scandal that those particular records were handed back by the State.  I argued at the time that they should not be handed back but, sadly, my argument fell on deaf ears.<\/p> <p> I have no doubt about the Minister's sincerity or that of Deputy Calleary.  I know the Minister wants to do the right thing.  These records will not be available for 30 years.  The Minister knows that and I know it.  The Minister also knows there is a culture of non-disclosure because if there were not such a culture, those records would not have been handed back in 2012 and measures the Minister is now taking would have been taken at that stage.  I ask the Government not to rush this legislation but to give us the chance to consider it properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100047#CCC00300","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603296900,"counter":335,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this emotive issue.  We have been listening all evening to Deputies' contributions.  This is an emotional debate.  It should be non-political and an issue on which we should all work together.  I come from just outside Tuam and I went to school in the town.  I know many of the people who live near the Tuam mother and baby home.  We have a lot of media attention on Tuam but it is not about Tuam; it is about what happened in a particular institution.  Many people who lived in that home suffered greatly.  This debate tonight and tomorrow is the time for us to start to do something to put things right.<\/p>  <p>  For these people, it has been a long road and a tough and arduous life.  Examples of that have been given here all evening.  People were treated terribly by the State.  They are the survivors and we have to do right by them.  The commission of investigation was set up to carry out an investigation and present a report to this House.  The purpose of the Bill is to respond to a number of serious legal and practical issues raised by the commission in relation to finalising its records.<\/p>  <p>  In the five years since I have been in the D&aacute;il, I have never had so many people contact me about an issue.  They are exercised about various aspects of this legislation.  Three glaring issues come up all the time.  The first is the speed of the process by which this Bill is being pushed through these Houses without legal scrutiny.  We must bear in mind that the commission has said there are serious legal issues with the records and how they are to be stored.  This serious concern has left us without any legal scrutiny to enable Oireachtas Members to make decisions based on what we know to be right or wrong, allowing us to act accordingly.  The lack of legal scrutiny is a glaring and serious omission in the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The second issue that has been brought to my attention is the fact that Tusla is being entrusted with these records.  A large number of people have told me that to give the guardianship of these records to Tusla would be wrong.  Most of the adoptees, birth parents and survivors do not have confidence in Tusla.<\/p> <p>They do not believe Tusla will give them access to their records when they need it, based on their past experiences.  This is a serious issue, and if we are to restore faith among the adoptees, birth parents and survivors, we need to listen to them.  There is an alternative to this measure, which is to lodge the database with the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  This is the preferred way of many of these survivors.<\/p> <p> The third issue which has been raised this evening is the sealing of the documents for 30 years.  This is perceived, rightly or wrongly, that this is a way of burying all this information for 30 years.  It has not been fully explained to the survivors, the adoptees or the people who were affected by all this.<\/p> <p> This legislation is very important.  It is so important that I believe the first mistake we are making is to push it through in the next two days.  We need to take stock of what we are doing, for the right reasons, in order that, first, we achieve political consensus and, second, we do the right thing such that nobody in a year's time says we should have thought of this or thought of that.  This is too serious.  The question is this: what can we do about it?  My colleague, Deputy Denis Naughten, has suggested, and tabled an amendment to this effect, that we should put a stay on this for one month to allow the legal scrutiny to be carried out and allow us, as Oireachtas Members right across the House, a chance to go through all this and explain it to the people who matter.<\/p> <p> I know the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, having worked with her in our constituency.  I understand that the Minister and the Minister of State want to do the right thing.  Everybody does.  It is so obvious, however, that many people do not know whether we are doing the right thing because we are doing it too quickly.  This is not legislation to fill a gap or emergency legislation relating to Covid-19, whereby there could be anomalies or consequences.  This is legislation that would have a profound effect, if it is not got right, on many people who have had such a miserable existence since perhaps the day they were born.  We have to think about what this legislation is about, who it will affect and how we might get it right.<\/p> <p> I repeat that we need time.  We need to make sure we use the next month to do things right.  This is above politics and there are no winners here, but we still need to do it right.  I therefore urge the Minister and the Minister of State to consider everything that has been said in the House.  It is genuine.  We need to reach consensus rather than pushing this through, forcing it through, which would be wrong.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100048#DDD00200","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603297500,"counter":337,"content":"<p>F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an deis labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar seo.  One of the major problems with the D&aacute;il and with Leinster House is that often political parties come to a decision as to how they will vote and proceed on these really important issues before we even have the discussion or the debate.  I ask the Minister to make of this an opportunity for the D&aacute;il debate and the information brought to the Chamber to have an impact on the position the Government takes.<\/p>  <p>  Not since the water charges have I seen such a level of outrage from the public over what is happening in Leinster House.  The level of correspondence my office has received over recent weeks has been massive.  Some Deputies have indicated 5,000 as the number of emails that have come through to their offices, and I believe the Oireachtas server was nearly stuffed with the number of emails.  The sentiment in all these emails was the same: do not bury the mother and baby home records.  It is as simple as that.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to talk briefly about the process of the debate we are having.  The initial deadline for tabling of amendments was to coincide with the debate on the Bill in the Seanad, but then the deadline was extended until Monday.  On Tuesday we learned that the Government amendment had come in, after the deadline for amendments, which is incredibly strange.<\/p>  <p>  My office has spoken to a coalition of mother and baby home survivors this afternoon.  They are phenomenally upset with the lack of consultation on this debate.  Some of them have described the debate in the Seanad, especially the Minister's contribution and engagement, as like watching mice run around a roundabout.  One survivor said she could not watch it and had to leave the room.  All of them said they were phenomenally disappointed by the Green Party.  It is shocking to think that the Bill is being railroaded through here in the absence of consultation with the survivors.<\/p>  <p>  I have tabled a number of amendments to this shocking and strange Bill, and I was happy to work with Deputies Connolly and Canney on this important issue.  The proposal to lock up records with Tusla for 30 years is particularly cruel.  It is a sad reality that in 30 years' time most of the former residents of the mother and baby homes will be dead.  That is the truth of the matter.  An interesting view has been put to me - a number of Deputies have echoed it - by so many of the former residents that it is particularly difficult to work with Tusla.  For that reason my amendments will propose alternatives to Tusla, specifically the storing of records with the Department or the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  What the Government needs to understand is that, in general, people in this position do not have a good relationship with Tusla.  Former residents of mother and baby homes and people trying to locate their birth mother or biological relatives have said this over and over again.  The majority of people who were born in a mother and baby home are getting on in years.  They have said to me that Tusla does not realise the urgency of their locating their families.  The Minister can imagine that for someone who is 60 years old and trying to find information on his or her mother, every single hurdle that Tusla puts in that person's path, whether a piece of red tape or a delay in information, makes the chance of reunion with the mother slimmer and slimmer.  Given how difficult many in Tusla have been on this front, it is totally inappropriate for the agency to take charge of these records.  Nobody should have to resort to a freedom of information request to find out his or her own personal records.<\/p>  <p>  Survivors of institutional abuse have been contacting me and Aont&uacute; representatives across the country with their concerns.  They have said this Bill, as originally written, has huge flaws.  For example, if people just want to access their medical records - perhaps someone had smallpox as a child - my understanding is that that information, if it were unearthed by the commission, would not be given to the individuals themselves.  I have also heard that if survivors have testified before the commission, under this Bill they will not even be given access to the transcripts of their own testimonies.  How incredible is that?<\/p>  <p>  I know we will have time to discuss this tomorrow and debate the amendments, but I have a simple question for the Minister in the last few seconds I have.  The commission was originally due to issue its first report in 2018.  An extension was granted until January 2019, then until February 2019, again until February 2020 and then until June 2020.  Now we are told it will happen by the end of this month.  Can the Minister bring some clarity to the status of the report and simply tell us definitively, when will it be published?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100049#EEE00200","speaker":"1504"},{"type":"speech","time":1603297500,"counter":338,"content":"<p>It is only right that I begin my statement by acknowledging the deep hurt and trauma experienced, and still being experienced, by people affected by this issue.  I am sure I am not alone in the House in saying that no other issue has seen so many people contact my office, by either phone or email or indeed in person.  I have had a number of conversations with survivors about their experience.  The period investigated by the mother and baby homes commission is a very dark chapter in the history of this country and one on which we have just begun to shine a light.  Much more needs to be done to deal with this awful legacy.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the briefings provided by the Department and conversations I have had with the Minister in person to help me better understand the scope and intention of the Bill.<\/p> <p>We need to be clear about what this legislation does and does not do and the consequences of not enacting it.  I hear and understand some of the legitimate concerns of the Opposition and, indeed, Deputy Calleary, regarding the speed with which this legislation is passing through the House.  We must also be clear, however, on the specific time constraints that make this necessary.  Put simply, and as the Minister explained it to me, the Bill allows for the preservation of a database of records that will otherwise be lost on the dissolution of the commission at the end of this month.  All the work and effort of compiling these records will be put beyond future use.  This cannot be allowed to happen.<\/p> <p> The intention here is not to seal records, it is to preserve them.  As I understand it, information contained in the database will still be available under current law.  I believe we will all acknowledge, however, that said law needs to be revisited.  That is a significance and sensitive piece of work and I am aware the Minister will not countenance work of that nature being rushed.  In view of the deficiencies of current legislation, I welcome the commitments the Minister has given to engage with the Attorney General's office in order to find a way forward on the issue of personal data access in the commission's archive, which is vitally important for former residents, and to ask the Joint Committee on Children, Disability, Equality and Integration to lead on this re-examination.<\/p> <p> This issue is so big and runs so deep that everyone in this Chamber will agree that it needs to be given the time and space it deserves.  The Oireachtas committee will allow that time and space for survivors and their representatives, legal experts and leading academics to forensically drill down into the issues.  They are issues around access to personal information in the commission's archive, the rights to privacy and the real and deeply felt trauma the survivors still experience.  The debate on this legislation has highlighted real difficulties and these need to be addressed.  I have no doubt that the Minister will work closely with the committee towards finding a way forward for this vital work.<\/p> <p> I will conclude as I began, by acknowledging the hurt of those people I have spoken to who are so deeply affected by this issue.  These past few weeks in the run up to the debate on this legislation must have been incredibly difficult for them.  I cannot begin to fathom how hard this debate has been for them.  I am aware, however, that it is not the intention of the Minister or of this Bill to re-traumatise victims or deny their suffering or experience, but to preserve a vital record that would otherwise be lost.  I would prefer, as I know the Minister would, to give this issue the time and space it deserves.  I am confident that the Minister will make space for it.  I do not believe, however, this House can allow these records to be lost to that future conversation.  I understand that is the matter addressed in this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100049#EEE00300","speaker":"1617","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603298100,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I, too, thank the Minister for the considerable amount of engagement he has had with Members regarding this Bill on this difficult subject matter.  I refer, particularly, to the briefing yesterday which clearly outlined the intention behind this Bill we are discussing today and the difficulties with the existing commission legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation being considered today has an objective and that is absolutely not to seal away information.  It is, in fact, to stop information from being put beyond reach.  This information concerns those who were treated so poorly in our recent past, namely, the mothers who were deprived and denied a normal life and whose futures were denied by being placed and imprisoned and trapped in mother and baby homes.  Their stories are horrific.  We have heard some of those stories tonight.  I have been contacted by those people and had their stories relayed to me.  For any parent, mother or child or anybody with any ounce of compassion, what happened to those banished to those homes is painful to listen to and is a most shameful period in our history.<\/p>  <p>  I, too, have received thousands of emails on this matter.  There is no other issue in respect of which I have received more emails.  I fully understand the concerns expressed by all those who contacted me.  I understood them and I understand the fear that this Bill will seek to bury the secrets of the past.  That is not the intention behind the Bill.  This Bill will not seal those important records or hide the information or put invaluable information beyond reach.  From my understanding, what we are trying to do tonight is the very opposite.  We are here to protect this record.  We need to give back a voice to those who were subjected to the horrors of the mother and baby homes, the lives that were destroyed and the lives of the survivors who were so badly damaged in so many ways that many of us will never be able to understand.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the commission report is a comprehensive document and comprises the survivors' personal stories which will be accessible to each person who told their story.  It will inform us all on how society and religious institutions in the past acted to banish and destroy mothers and their children and how this despicable part of our history ever happened.  I understand that many of the records of the commission are, in fact, copies of documents held by other agencies, such as the Department of Health, and that those originals are accessible and available through certain processes.<\/p>  <p>  From my understanding tonight, the Minister has confirmed that he will ask the Oireachtas Committee on Children, Disability, Equality and Integration to lead a re-examination of the access to this personal data in a way that will enable survivors and their representatives and legal experts and academics to thoroughly explore the issues surrounding this debate on access to personal information in the commission's archive, and to issue recommendations which can resolve the real difficulties the passage of this legislation has highlighted.  I trust that the Minister is acting sincerely and in the best way possible to protect this data and this Bill will safeguard the database created by Tusla in respect of this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100050#FFF00200","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1603298100,"counter":341,"content":"<p>The way this Government has attempted to rush through the Bill is nothing short of disgraceful.  Survivors, their families, their legal representatives and their advocates have understandably been deeply distressed by the appalling way in which their wishes have been disregarded.  It is not right for their testimonies to be sealed away for 30 years.  They have been brave in speaking out and share their stories and we must ensure their stories are heard.  Thanks to witness testimonies, their life stories will not be silenced anymore.<\/p><p>I will share some of these horrific and harrowing stories this evening.  One survivor spoke about their ordeal in accessing information, saying:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIt makes me angry to think that I was pushed as far as becoming an emotional wreck in order to obtain such simple information about myself.  Everyone has the right to know their name; the right to know their mother's name. <\/blockquote>  <p>Another spoke about the conditions her mother endured while giving birth, stating:<\/p> <blockquote> \tMy mother was tied to the bed and when she couldn't push, one of the nuns sat on her chest to make her. <\/blockquote>  <p>On the immoral and evil practice of forced adoption, one person stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tMy son was wrenched from my breast by one of the nuns while I was feeding him and taken away for adoption ... at no time did I give my consent to my son's adoption. <\/blockquote>  <p>One mother spoke about the death of her child.  She said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI do not even know whether he was buried in a coffin ... there was never even a kind or sympathetic word said to me. <\/blockquote>  <p>The psychological impact on mothers has been enormous.  One person stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe nuns at Bessborough made my life hell and changed my life forever.  I could not get over what happened to me.  I think I am still in shock, still traumatised.  My time in Bessborough was a horrible, horrific experience ... I think I will die with the pain and trauma that was caused during this time. <\/blockquote>  <p>After being adopted, some of the children did not have the best childhoods.  One said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tMy childhood was not a happy one and I do not view adoption as a guarantee of a 'better life'.  My upbringing was dysfunctional primarily involving my adoptive mother's alcoholism and sexual abuse by my brother.  As I grew older, I felt a sense of loss within me that I didn't know my true origins, I felt very lonely all my life.  I was nothing like my adoptive family. <\/blockquote>  <p>These stories are horrific.  They are harrowing and heartbreaking.  I am even trying to keep the emotion in as I recount them.  Once again, I urge the Minister to do the right thing and put a stop to this unfair and indefensible Bill.  As one survivor said to me outside Leinster House earlier: &quot;l am a Mother and today is my Mother's Day.&quot;  I ask the Minister not to rip away these mothers' rights the same way their children were ripped away from them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100050#FFF00300","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1603298100,"counter":342,"content":"<p>I appeal to the Minister.  I cannot believe what is going on here.  The Green Party is in government with the two big parties, which have had a hand in dealing with this matter for a long time now, and it is colluding to keep these records and have them put away out of reach for 30 years.<\/p> <p>The records we get from the National Archives are the subject of 20- or 30-year limits.  These survivors, Gold help us, have suffered long enough.  Some of them have suffered for 40 or 50 years.  What is the Government trying to do by adding a further 30 years?  The Government has made all sorts of excuses and offered all sorts of platitudes and some of its backbenchers have said that what it is doing is right.  I do not know that it is and I do not believe the Government is making a proper effort.<\/p> <p> The Minister mentioned a briefing but the Rural Independent Group did not receive any briefing from him and I do not think we were invited to it either.  I stand corrected if we were but I did not see anything like that.  We would like all groups to be treated equally here.  We have all met the survivors and I met them earlier.  I met Rosie McKenny and her daughter Mags.  Those outside need justice and I thank them and their supporters for the many thousands of emails they have sent us over the last number of weeks and for their dignified manner.  One could see the raw emotion, the hardship, the pain and the trauma in their writing, in the phone calls and of those who we engaged with on the street here.  This is 2020, in the middle of a so-called pandemic.  Hardships have been experienced by many people but this was a hardship that went on supposedly in the murky past.  We should be well able to deal with it and to do so sensitively and appropriately now.<\/p> <p> I understand why the Minister says he is afraid that the records might be lost if we do not pass this legislation.  However, any legislation that is rushed is bad legislation.  We all know that and goodness knows we have rushed enough of it here in the past six or seven months and will be rushing more of it tomorrow and on Friday.  That legislation is draconian and some of it will actually create a tyranny but the Government has a majority and that is its wont.  It is an awful situation for the people of our country to be in.  However, we have had experience of this matter.  There have been investigations and reports upon reports.  I listened with great interest to Deputy Canney and others and look forward to hearing from Deputy Connolly.  They are closer to the situation because of where they live, as is Deputy Denis Naughten in County Roscommon.  They have a greater understanding of what went on in Tuam.<\/p> <p> This is a sad situation and a sad way to go about dealing with it.  The Minister is saying that the purpose of this legislation is to project the records but we believe that by passing it, he is putting the records way beyond arm's length, 30 bliain anuas, for 30 more years.  The families, children, grandchildren or great-grandchildren of survivors and victims will not be able to get their records.  These people are entitled to those records.  That is the very least they should be entitled to and all of the wrongdoing must be put right.  I plead with the Minister but I suppose it will fall on deaf ears.<\/p> <p> As a previous speaker indicated, unfortunately, despite all these debates that are very sensitive in nature, or should be in any case, the Government makes up its mind on the basis of advice from the Attorney General, a Cabinet sub-committee or Departments of Health, Children and Youth Affairs or Justice.  It makes up its mind and whips everyone into line.  That is no way to deal with a sensitive issue like this.  Where are the new politics?  Where is the new Government?  Where is the change?  Why must things be adversarial and confrontational in a situation like this when the people out there deserve honesty and for us to put our best foot forward in dealing with their issues sensitively and respectfully and with a sense of decent haste, not the indecent haste we are seeing here.  The Government is rushing this Bill through the House and it rushed it through the Seanad last week.  I received many complaints about the debate in the Seanad as well.  I appeal to the Minister on the basis of the fact the people are entitled to better.<\/p> <p> As far as Tusla is concerned, given its record, I am 100% opposed to its involvement.  I have little faith in Tusla.  There are some good people in Tusla but I have had so many complaints about it, it is unbelievable.  I could fill a book with them.  What is the agency after all but a big section of the HSE that was hived off into a new body called Tusla, with no proper training, scrutinising or set up and worst than that, no proper accountability.  I am dealing with some awful, harrowing cases that are ongoing.  Members of the Garda will state that Tusla staff will ring on a Friday evening because they are going off for the weekend and they are getting garda&iacute; to intervene to take families away.  These are very sensitive and delicate issues and I am not going to be judgmental about them but I do not have the faith in Tusla to let them have these records.  I do not have any faith in Tusla and I appeal to the Minster not to bury the records in the way he is going to.  History will not be kind to him if he does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100050#FFF00400","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603298700,"counter":344,"content":"<p>The Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home operated between 1925 and 1961.  It was located in Tuam, County Galway.  I say to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Deputy Canney that this is no reflection on the people of the county.  I am very lucky to have my only living aunt, Ms Peggy McEnerney, living in Kinvarra, County Galway.  She would not have me say a bad word about the county.  The mother and baby homes were used for single mothers who were stigmatised because they were unmarried.  The treatment of these women was horrendous.  It was claimed that there may have been up to 800 babies interred in Tuam following the closure of the home.  Former Taoiseach Enda Kenny said that the babies of single mothers had been treated like some kind of subspecies.  In view of this, is history going to repeat itself?  Will this Government prevent the survivors from viewing their files?<\/p>  <p>  I understand that last week in the D&aacute;il the Minister spoke of the necessity of getting this legislation through.  He said it is necessary \"to preserve information, including a critically invaluable database for future use to the maximum extent possible\" under the law.  I take it that what the Minster is saying is correct and that the files will be treated sensitively in order to give the survivors some dignity on the long journey of healing ahead.  However, earlier today I spoke to one of the survivors who has been trying to track his mother down for 40 years.  He claims he was given false information by Tusla, resulting in upsetting a family in the UK and upsetting his own family.  The only way he could locate his family was by doing DNA testing, which resulted in him locating a sister he never knew he had for most of his life and who lived only ten miles away.<\/p>  <p>  I consider myself to be a very lucky person.  I had a father, who was born in the early 1900s, and a mother.  I have brothers and sisters; 11 of us in total.  I have aunts and uncles.  I am now a husband and father myself.  I have four sons and one grandchild.  I appeal to the Minister for these victims.  If I thought for one minute that I could not find out anything about my family I could not bear it.  I cannot bear to see what these people have gone through, what these mothers have gone through and what their children have gone through.  That lady outside the front gate today said that she was here for the people who came out of the homes, for the children who survived the homes and for those who never got out of those homes.<\/p>  <p>  I appeal to the Minister not to lock things away for 30 years.  These people need to find the information relating to their families while they themselves still live.  Let us not have any more families go through pain or go through all the bureaucratic bull people would have to get through in order to try to get information on their past or their families.  The Minister should do the right thing by ensuring that these files are not locked away and that the families can have full access to them at any time they wish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102100051#GGG00200","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1603298700,"counter":345,"content":"<p>The failure to record the deaths and burials of so-called illegitimate and abandoned children who died in various institutions during the last century is appalling.
