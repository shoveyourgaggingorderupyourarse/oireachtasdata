Our psychologists work with teachers, parents and children\/young people in schools to provide a range of services as follows:<\/p>  <p>  -  Psychologists support schools to identify and respond to need, through regular planning and review meetings.  <\/p>  <p>  -  They provide support to schools in the event of a Critical Incident.  <\/p>  <p>  -  They provide a school staff Support and Development Service, which supports school staff in their work.  This might include, for example, training staff in the provision of trauma informed school approaches, or in the provision of evidence-based programmes to strengthen resilience and reduce anxiety.  This broad service is provided to an estimated 25,000 school staff annually. <\/p>  <p>  -  Psychologists also provide an individual casework service for children and young people, and this is a much valued element of their work in schools.  This is where the focus of the work is on individual students, and the psychologist meets school staff, parents and the student themselves, in order to identify and assess student strengths and needs and agree on an appropriate plan of intervention and review.  In these cases, NEPS psychologists always provide a written report for parents and the school principal.  In 2021, the NEPS casework service extended to over 8500 students.

This means that, for the first time since 2017, the programme has been significantly expanded to an additional 322 schools. Those schools are now gaining access to targeted supports to address educational disadvantage.

Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools. The model uses information from the school&rsquo;s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation index. It also takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. A detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on gov.ie <\/p>  <p>  Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed.

The policy on Irish-medium education will be developed in the context of the overall framework of the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030.<\/p><p>The key objectives of the policy on Irish-medium education outside of the Gaeltacht include:<\/p><p>-  the provision of a framework for the delivery of high-quality Irish-medium education in Gaelscoileanna and Gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute; and in Irish-medium early learning and care settings (na&iacute;onra&iacute;) outside of the Gaeltacht<\/p><p>-  increasing the proportion of children and young people attending Irish-medium schools, including by building on the foundations laid in Irish-medium early learning and care settings (na&iacute;onra&iacute;)<\/p><p>-  considering how opportunities for the establishment of Gaelscoileanna and Gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute; can be increased as part of the patronage process <\/p><p>-  developing a clear policy on the establishment and sustainability of Aonaid\/Sruthanna (Units\/Streams) in existing English-medium post-primary schools to strengthen Irish-medium education provision<\/p><p>-  examining how the supply of teachers and other staff with a high standard of Irish can be increased to meet demand in Irish-medium education settings<\/p><p>-  looking at ways to deepen community engagement around Irish-medium schools and early learning and care settings.<\/p><p>A steering committee has been established with representatives from relevant Government Departments and Agencies to oversee the development of the policy.<\/p><p>A review of national and international literature has been commissioned through a public procurement process, to inform the development of the policy. <\/p><p>A public consultation process will take place in the coming months to gather the views of stakeholders, including young people, their parents, school staff and leaders, and Irish-language stakeholders.<\/p><p>I look forward to progressing this important work of strengthening Irish-medium educational provision and building on the positive outcomes already being achieved in the implementation of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education.

The 2022 summer programme built on the expanded programmes of 2020 and 2021. From 2021, all schools were given the opportunity to run at least one summer programme.<\/p>  <p>  In line with last year, the total funding available to provide summer programmes in 2022 was up to &euro;40 million.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the programme continues to focus on supporting pupils with complex special educational needs and my Department has provided support to schools to run the summer programme to cater for these students. <\/p>  <p>  To support and facilitate schools and principals with organising and running the programme, the 2022 Summer Programme allowed principals to delegate these functions to other members of staff. Capitation funding and preparation hours were provided to schools who participated in the programme, with additional funding and hours provided to schools that run the Special Class and Special School Programme.  Further funding was also made available to Special Schools, in recognition of the extra complexities in running programmes in their schools.<\/p>  <p>  I am very pleased to be able to say that an additional &euro;20 million funding has been approved under Budget &lsquo;23to continue the expanded summer programme for 2023, bringing the total to &euro;40m for 2023. This early announcement that funding has been secured will allow schools several extra months to plan for a summer programme next year.<\/p>  <p>  The programme has gone from strength to strength with 2022 seeing more schools and more students participate than ever before. Final figures for this year&rsquo;s programme will be known later in the year but based on the information available to date, it is anticipated that over 45,000 pupils will have participated with over 1,000 schools running a programme. <\/p>  <p>  I am however very conscious that parents want this programme to be available in more schools in 2023 and, as part of the planning that has already begun for next year, it is a priority for me that children in Special Schools have access to a school-based programme. I am committed to the on-going development of the Summer Programme with a view to ensuring that children with the most complex needs have access to a scheme. My Department is currently undertaking a review of the 2022 programme with a view to improving it for next year and with a committed focus on increasing the number of schools participating, particularly schools serving children with very complex needs.<\/p>  <p>  In 2022 the Department had productive engagements with the National Association of Boards of Management for Special Schools (NABMSE). This led to positive initiatives to assist special schools such as through the hosting of information webinars and the introduction of a new grant for these special schools. I expect that these engagements will lead to more positive measures for the 2023 programme and beyond.<\/p>  <p>  Following the review of this year's programme and finalisation of planning for next year, the details of the 2023 Summer Programme will be published at the earliest possible opportunity. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100074#WRB04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":59,"content":"<p>Question No. 79 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education and Training Boards","counter":60,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100074#WRB05100"},{"type":"question","counter":61,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[49479\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100074#WRB05200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason that ETBs no longer have the authority to grant cover for workforce leave as they did prior to the moratorium; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1579","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":62,"content":"<p>The arrangements in relation to the allocation of teaching posts, and to the allocation of special needs assistants to all schools, including ETB schools, are set down in various circulars issued by my Department.

It is the responsibility of each ETB to recruit and manage staffing levels within this allocation, including the assignment of such staff to the different functional areas in the ETB in accordance with the needs and priorities of the organisation. In line with the position across the public sector generally, every ETB must also operate within overall approved staffing and pay budgets for its administrative and maintenance staff.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to ancillary staff in schools, ETBs have discretion to temporarily employ a substitute for existing ancillary staff in schools who are temporarily absent due to sick leave etc. where the temporary absence would otherwise result in either no secretary, caretaker or cleaner being in the school on the day(s) in question; and where the ETB can fund the temporary employment of the substitute from within its existing pay budget for non-teaching staff.<\/p>  <p>  However, ETBs are required to seek prior approval from my Department for new posts or to replace existing sanctioned administrative and maintenance posts, whether on a temporary or permanent basis. In considering such requests, my Department will consider factors such as the particular circumstances and need arising for the ETB concerned and will also have regard to the affordability of the post, or replacement post, within the administrative and maintenance pay budget of the ETB itself and within the relevant pay budget for the ETB sector as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  I can confirm over recent years that my Department has, as resources permitted, granted a significant number of additional administrative and maintenance posts to the ETB sector.

Bus &Eacute;ireann continue to process a small number of remaining on time applications, where additional services may need to be put in place for eligible children, any capacity on these services will be offered to concessionary applicants. <\/p>  <p>  Following discussions with Minister McGrath and officials in DPER as part of the budgetary process some additional funding has been approved for the scheme which will allow officials in consultation with Bus &Eacute;ireann to consider and evaluate where temporary additional capacity may be available.  <\/p>  <p>  The initial focus will be where families applied on time and who previously held concessionary tickets, to alleviate the impact of the increased demands on the scheme for those families.   However, it is important to stress that this is subject to capacity considerations.

The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and how it currently operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability and that it adequately supports the provision of services to students and their families. <\/p>  <p>  The review encompasses the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs. The review of the Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes will examine each element of the schemes and include eligibility criteria, trends, costs, cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Government Departments that also use transport services.  <\/p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are taking place in the current phase of the review.  As part of the current phase of the review, the Technical Working Group has undertaken extensive consultation including running a public survey for parents\/guardians and students who use the service and those who do not use the service but who would like to.  These engagements have yielded extensive data for consideration.  The Group has also consulted with a broad array of stakeholders including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Government Departments. <\/p>  <p>  While work on the review was impacted somewhat by the challenges of the pandemic and the impact of the current conflict in Ukraine, it is anticipated that the final phases of the review will be completed shortly with recommendations on the future operation of the Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme. The Steering Group will continue to report to the Minister on an interim basis as the review progresses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100075#WRC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":93,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100075#WRC00500"},{"type":"question","counter":94,"qnumday":89,"qnumall":"[50001\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100075#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the requirements that would need to be in place in order for her Department to support the establishment of a special school in east Cork; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1515","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":95,"content":"<p>I would like to thank the Deputy for the question and would like to advise the following:<\/p><p>Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education is a priority for this Government.<\/p><p>For 2022, my Department will spend in excess of &euro;2 Billion, or over 25% of the Department&rsquo;s budget on providing a wide range of schemes and supports for children with special educational needs.<\/p><p>For 2023, this spend will be substantially increased by over 10%, meaning that for 2023 my Department will spend over &euro;2.6 billion on special education.<\/p><p>This level of educational funding and support is unprecedented and represents in excess of 27% of the Department&rsquo;s total allocation for 2023.<\/p><p>This includes additional teaching and care supports.

The Report shows that overall, 91.5% of the students who entered first year in 2014 sat the Leaving Certificate examination in 2019 or 2020 or were provided with calculated grades, while 97.6 % sat the Junior Certificate examination in 2017 or 2018. The retention rates for Co. Carlow in these figures was 96.7% to Junior Certificate examination and 87.5% to Leaving Certificate. As the total cohort in some counties was small the retention rate can fluctuate based on small changes from year to year.<\/p>  <p>  DEIS &ndash; Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools is the main policy initiative of my Department to address educational disadvantage at school level.  My Department provides a wide range of supports to all schools, DEIS and non-DEIS, to support the inclusion of all students and address barriers to students achieving their potential. Supplementing these universal supports, the DEIS programme provides a targeted and equitable way to address concentrated educational disadvantage that promotes equity and has benefits for students.<\/p>  <p>  In March this year I was glad to be able to announce a major expansion of the DEIS &ndash; Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools programme. This means that, for the first time since 2017, the programme has been significantly expanded to an additional 322 schools. Those schools are now gaining access to targeted supports to address educational disadvantage. This expansion included 12 Co. Carlow primary schools who were added to the programme for the first time and 2 primary DEIS schools who were reclassified and will receive additional supports. This means that in the 2022\/23 school year there are 17 Primary and 3 Post Primary DEIS schools in Co. Carlow.<\/p>  <p>  Schools participating in the DEIS programme have seen retention rates to Leaving Certificate improve since the introduction of DEIS. The gap in retention rates between DEIS and non-DEIS schools has narrowed from a gap of 16.8% for the 2001 entry cohort to approx. 8.6% for the 2014 cohort.<\/p>  <p>  All DEIS post-primary and DEIS urban primary schools are provided with access to supports from the Home School Community Liaison coordinator scheme, the School Completion Programme and an Educational Welfare Officer. <\/p>  <p>  In the DEIS programme, the Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL) seeks to promote partnership between parents, teachers and community family support services. The overarching goal of the HSCL Coordinator is to improve educational outcomes for children through their work with the key adults in the child&rsquo;s life to promote attendance, participation and retention in school.  All DEIS post-primary and all DEIS urban primary schools in Carlow have access to a HSCL coordinator.<\/p>  <p>  The School Completion Programme (SCP) is a targeted school and community support service. The desired impact of SCP is retention of a young person to completion of the leaving certificate, equivalent qualification or suitable level of educational attainment which enables them to transition into further education, training or employment. <\/p>  <p>  The Educational Welfare Service work with children and families who have difficulties in relation to school attendance, participation, retention. This is a statutory service and its primary role is to ensure that every child either attends school regularly or otherwise receives a certain minimum education; to ensure and secure every child&rsquo;s entitlement to education. There are currently 2 Education Welfare Officers providing services to all schools in Co. Carlow. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. Conscious of this and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, my Department is now working to explore the allocation of resources to schools across the education system, DEIS and non-DEIS, to tackle educational disadvantage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100075#WRC04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":138,"content":"<p>Question No. 105 answered with Question No. 85.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education Policy","counter":139,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100075#WRC05100"},{"type":"question","counter":140,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[50027\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100075#WRC05200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the actions that she has taken to ensure that universal design learning and universal design principles are implemented in primary and secondary schools to make the classroom fully accessible for all children; the actions that she will take to ensure that a multi-sensory learning approach is included in the school curriculum; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1513","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":141,"content":"<p>I would like to thank the Deputy for the question and would like to advise the following:<\/p><p>Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education is a priority for this Government.  <\/p><p>There are two aspects to this question, one in relation to teaching and learning and the other in relation to school building.<\/p><p>It is important to recognise that the vast majority of children and young people (over 97%) with special educational needs access mainstream education, with the reminder accessing special class and special school placements.<\/p><p>My Department is supporting schools through guidance and professional development to implement the Universal Design for Learning framework in our schools.  Universal Design for Learning is a framework that facilitates the inclusion of all learners to access the school curriculum in a meaningful way.<\/p><p>A core value of the curriculum, across all levels of schooling in Ireland, is inclusivity and diversity. The curriculum at primary and post-primary is for all learners, from all backgrounds &ndash; regardless of gender, socio-economic background, race or creed.

While the issue of pay alone will not resolve these issues, the Government is committed to the delivery of quality public services, and will continue to approach public service pay in a balanced way that is reasonable and fair to both public servants and the taxpayer. There is an important balance to be struck between maintaining industrial peace and protecting the Exchequer.  <\/p><p>The value of public pay deals to the Government and the taxpayer is ensuring that pay costs are managed in a sustainable and orderly way and in a climate of industrial peace. By and large public pay agreements have delivered on these objectives over the last 12 years.  Following the conclusion of discussions on 30 August, the parties to Building Momentum, with the expert assistance of the WRC who oversaw the talks' process, have come forward with a set of proposals, to extend the terms of Building Momentum to 31 December 2023. These proposals have now been ratified by public service unions and associations representing the public service workforce. In addition to the 1% increase due in October 2022 under Building Momentum, the  extension of the agreement will provide for a further increase of 6&frac12; % over the lifetime of the agreement.  The starting salary for a new entrant teacher in 2012 was &euro;30,702. This will rise to over &euro;41,000 under the extended agreement. Overall, teachers will see increases from &euro;3,200 to &euro;5,600 under the extension of the agreement. <\/p><p>In recent years my Department has established a comprehensive programme of work to support the supply of teachers at both post-primary and primary levels, including the introduction of new programmes of initial teacher education and teacher upskilling programmes in targeted subject areas and the Teaching Transforms campaign, which encourages young people to follow a career in teaching. <\/p><p>I have allocated significant additional posts to the primary substitute teacher supply panels in areas where significant challenges in sourcing substitution continue, bringing the total to 610 posts on 151 panels, covering approximately 2,800 schools, including 29 base schools covering the Dublin area. <\/p><p>The supply panels work alongside the existing methods of sourcing substitute teachers, such as <b><i>Sub Seeker<\/i><\/b>, the national substitution portal service operated by the Irish Primary Principals' Network and schools can also make local arrangements to have their own regular substitutes to call on if needed. <\/p><p>The Teaching Council is also currently processing applications for registration from newly qualified teachers, who will represent a new source of supply in 2022\/23.

The Department&rsquo;s Wellbeing Policy and Framework for practice has given recognition to the importance of promoting wellbeing in education.  The approach set out in the Wellbeing Policy is a whole school and preventative approach which has multiple components that include providing children and young people with opportunities to build core social and emotional skills and competencies, experience supportive relationships within the school setting and be part of a school environment and culture that feels both physically and psychologically safe. <\/p>  <p>  Aligned with this policy, a number of supports are currently being offered to schools to support wellbeing and mental health.<\/p>  <p>  - Schools are encouraged to use a reflective, school self-evaluation approach to identify and prioritise the needs of its own school community in relation to the promotion of wellbeing and mental health, and to respond to meeting those needs.  To support schools in this work the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) is currently providing training to schools to ensure that the promotion of wellbeing will be at the core of the ethos of every school. Schools will be navigated through an introduction to the Wellbeing Framework and how to use the School Self Evaluation (SSE) process in guiding wellbeing promotion in their schools. These seminars will be supported by two webinars and in-school visits.  <\/p>  <p>  - Following the publication by the National Education Psychological Service (NEPS) of guidance for post primary schools on establishing a Student Support Team or reviewing an existing team, psychologists are currently facilitating post-primary schools to improve the Student Support Team process.  Student Support Teams are the structure through which key wellbeing and wellbeing-related policies are implemented in post-primary schools. <\/p>  <p>  - NEPS has developed training for school staff on the promotion of wellbeing and resilience in schools which include upskilling school staff on the use and implementation of therapeutically-informed approaches in schools.  These include trauma-informed approaches, approaches based on the principles of cognitive behaviour therapy, and attachment-aware approaches. The approaches outlined in the training are based on research findings, on the experience of experts in their fields and on the experience of practicing psychologists working in schools. The training will build the capability of school staff in both primary and post-primary settings, including for school leaders, teachers and SNAs. <\/p>  <p>  - NEPS will shortly resume the provision of training for school staff on the Friends for Life programmes to help reduce anxiety in children and also the Incredible Years Classroom Management System.  Priority will be given to schools new to DEIS. <\/p>  <p>  - NEPS has launched an eLearning course - Responding to Critical Incidents in Schools.  This course is aimed specifically at the school&rsquo;s Critical Incident Management Team, but open to all interested staff. <\/p>  <p>  - NEPS has developed a number of resources to support the wellbeing of children and young people from Ukraine enrolling in schools in Ireland.  This includes:<\/p>  <p>  Revised Guidance for primary and post &ndash; primary schools in relation to supporting the wellbeing of children\/young people from Ukraine at this time. This includes support for students with special educational needs.<\/p>  <p>  Guidance for Parents and Carers from Ukraine on Supporting the Wellbeing of their Children<\/p>  <p>  A model of Psychological First Aid (PFA) to help teachers support students. The document is called Look, Listen &amp;amp; Link.<\/p>  <p>  NEPS has also delivered a series of wellbeing webinars via the Education Support Centres of Ireland, to further support schools.<\/p>  <p>  The programmes and initiatives set out above are in addition to the educational psychological support that NEPS provide to all primary and post-primary schools. This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to individual pupil casework where there is need. NEPS works closely with the HSE and its agencies to ensure those who may require the provision of therapy or counselling are referred on to the appropriate clinical services for intervention and support.<\/p>  <p>  At post primary level, counselling is a key part of the role of the Guidance Counsellor, offered on an individual or group basis as part of a developmental learning process, at moments of personal crisis but also at key transition points. The Guidance Counsellor also identifies and supports the referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals, as required. Each post primary school currently receives an allocation in respect of guidance provision, calculated by reference to the approved enrolment.  <\/p>  <p>  While the Department of Health has responsibility for mental health services in Ireland, my Department has an important role to support the wellbeing and positive mental health of all our young people. My Department has built strong links with the Department of Health and both Departments are exploring ways to improve supports for young people, including around increased awareness, promoting help-seeking behaviour and sign-posting to the wide range of available services.  I am pleased to confirm that we will invest more than &euro;5 million in piloting a programme of counselling supports for primary school students.

One of the principal reasons for Ireland&rsquo;s investment in ESA programmes is to nurture and build a base of technologically sophisticated enterprises that develop and trial technology solutions via space applications, and then go on to develop new markets in a wide range of application areas based on the expertise they have built up, such as in other high reliability sectors such as automotive and aerospace.<\/p>  <p>  Importantly, the global space economy presents real commercial opportunity to Irish companies.  It was estimated to be worth over $350 billion US dollars in 2020 and prior to the COVID-19 crisis, it was expected to grow to $1 trillion US dollars by 2030.<\/p>  <p>  ESA is the only access point for Ireland&rsquo;s space active industry to develop and qualify their space technologies.  Engagement with ESA creates a unique opportunity for Irish companies to win a share of the overall space economy. It complements national supports to Irish industry and offers a unique pathway to access highly specialised facilities and knowledge.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s annual contributions, funded by my Department to ESA from 2002 to present date cumulatively is just over &euro;325 million (including a direct contribution by Enterprise Ireland of &euro;2.5M in 2021 to support specific industrial development activities). <\/p>  <p>  ESA operates on the basis of &ldquo;geo-return&rdquo;, meaning a proportional amount of the money invested into ESA is returned to Irish businesses to develop and build new technologies.

Construction is underway across 26 counties demonstrating that the project is reaching scale. To date, the level of connections is increasing on a daily basis and is in line with or exceeding projections. <\/p>  <p>  The network rollout for the NBP is divided into 227 Deployment Areas (DAs) across the country.  These are typically an area of approximately 25km in radius and in total they cover 96% of Ireland&rsquo;s landmass. The architecture of the network design is specifically based on the design of the NBI network coming from the eir exchanges or the metropolitan area networks (MANs). It is based on an engineering design that allows NBI to reach every premises as quickly as possible working within the confines of how fibre networks are built. Villages, townlands and counties may be covered by a number of DAs which means there are differing timescales for the rollout across county areas.<\/p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Sligo and County Leitrim through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.<\/p>  <p>  NBI has made recent improvements to their website to enhance the provision of information to Oireachtas members. NBI has now completed a suite of changes, creating a portal that will serve as a means for Oireachtas members to proactively search for information relevant to their county\/local area. The portal provides an up-to-date picture of NBI&rsquo;s deployment schedule across the 227 Deployment Areas (DAs) in all 26 counties. A particular county can be selected to view an update of the overall number of premises in the Intervention Area, the overall NBP investment in the county, the number of premises passed and connected to date and the status of each of the Deployment Areas with the anticipated date for connection over the lifetime of the project. The dedicated webpage can be accessed here: www.nbi.ie.<\/p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. Some 749 BCP sites have been installed by NBI to date and the high-speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. In County Sligo, 9 BCP&rsquo;s have been installed to date with 11 sites installed in County Leitrim. Further details can be found at nbi.ie\/bcp-locations\/.<\/p>  <p>  In County Sligo, some 21 schools have been installed by NBI to date for educational access, with 9 now installed in County Leitrim. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high-speed broadband, within the Intervention Area.

The CRU published a decision for the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff in December 2021, which outlines arrangements for implementation of the tariff, including eligibility criteria and remuneration methodology. As part of this, the CRU decided that suppliers will set their individual CEG tariffs on a competitive market basis which must be reflective of the market, or wholesale, value of the electricity, in line with the requirements of Article 21(2)(d) of the recast Renewable Energy Directive. It is important to note that a key aspect of the eligibility criteria for the CEG is that microgenerators must meet the definition for &lsquo;renewables self-consumers', as per the Renewable Energy Directive. This places a focus on generating electricity for one's own consumption and thereafter with an entitlement to receive remuneration for excess electricity fed into the grid. <\/p><p>  This remuneration is different to the retail electricity market and the prices a domestic electricity consumer is charged by their supplier. Retail prices take account of the cost to purchase electricity on the wholesale market, while covering the operational costs of the company, as well as the network charges required for use of the electricity grid.

As you are aware, a draft national EV charging infrastructure strategy, covering the crucial period out to 2025 was published for consultation in March. The draft strategy sets out the government&rsquo;s ambition regarding the delivery of a public EV charging network to support up to 195,000 electric cars and vans by the middle of the decade. Responses and submissions received as part of the consultation are currently being considered in the development of the final Strategy for publication later this year.<\/p><p>Home charging is the primary charging method for most Irish EV owners as it&rsquo;s convenient and cheaper for the consumer as well as assisting in the overall management of the national grid. Over 80% of charging is expected to happen at home.<\/p><p>However, there is also a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible, such as on-street and residential charging, destination charging and workplace charging. <\/p><p>&euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022.<\/p><p>In terms of progress ESB eCars have:<\/p><p>One hub of 4 High-Powered Chargers with 8 charging bays constructed, with 2 in progress.

This includes the key requirement of requisite professional competence, which is a public interest sectoral requirement in a road safety context.<\/p>  <p>  The professional competence requirement is satisfied where an operator designates a natural person to act as &ldquo;transport manager.&rdquo; The transport manager will continuously and effectively manage the transport operations of the licence holder.

The Department has engaged extensively with Mr Fitzpatrick on this matter and in July 2022 proposed to suspend the operator licence for continued non-compliance with licensing requirements. Mr Fitzpatrick has made representations to the Department indicating that he misunderstood the timeline within which remedial action should be taken. In these representations, Mr Fitzpatrick requested that the Department allow him until end of November 2022 in order that he can return to compliance with licensing requirements. This request was granted by the Department.  Article 13 of Regulation (EC) 1071\/2009 allows for a maximum time limit of 6 months to return to compliance in respect of professional competence, as a result no further extension is possible. Where an eligible natural person is not designated transport manager by end of November 2022, the Department is required by the European Regulation to suspend the licence from 1 December 2022 until Mr Fitzpatrick again demonstrates requisite professional competence requirement. It remains open to Mr. Fitzpatrick to procure the services of an external transport manager, even on a temporary basis, in order to comply with licensing requirements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100081#WRJ03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bus Services","counter":506,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100081#WRJ03500"},{"type":"question","counter":507,"qnumday":236,"qnumall":"[49974\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100081#WRJ03600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the estimated number of additional buses that would be required if buses on each route on H-spine increased their frequency to every ten minutes.; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":508,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport; however, I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport.

Accordingly, for the tax year 2022, an income tax deduction amounting to 30% of the cost of vouched expenses for electricity, heat and broadband in respect of those days spent working from home can be claimed by taxpayers.<\/p>  <p>  The amount of the relief will depend on the particular circumstances of the remote worker in terms of the level of costs incurred and their marginal tax rate. However, this measure provides some relief for those with additional expenses arising from working from home, and at the same time it ensures that the traditional burden of employer related costs are not transferred from the employer to the State and the wider body of taxpayers.  In addition, I would point out that, as the current deduction relates to a proportion of the cost of the relevant expenses, the amount that may be claimed will increase as those expenses increase. There are no immediate plans to further increase the tax relief for working from home.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to cost of living increases, the Government is acutely aware of the cost pressures currently facing households and businesses and has responded to help alleviate some of this burden.  A Budget package of &euro;6.9 billion was recently announced, as well &euro;4.1 billion of one-off measures, which included the provision of energy credits for all households. This is in addition to &euro;3 billion of measures that were implemented before the recent Budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100082#WRK04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":573,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100082#WRK04200"},{"type":"question","counter":574,"qnumday":258,"qnumall":"[49452\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100082#WRK04300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if renters under a licence agreement will be entitled to the renters' tax credit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":575,"content":"<p>On Budget Day, I announced a &euro;500 Rent Tax Credit which it is proposed will be claimable in respect of rent paid in 2022 and subsequent years to end-2025.

There is no differentiation between different types of coal with regard to the rate of SFCT that applies. This means that smokeless, low smoke, and smoky coal all attract the same SFCT rate, currently &euro;107.98 per tonne. SFCT rates are available on Revenue&rsquo;s website at www.revenue.ie\/en\/companies-and-charities\/excise-and-licences\/energy-taxes\/solid-fuel-carbon-tax\/rate-of-tax.aspx. VAT at 13.5% is also applicable to coal and this is applied on top of the consideration and SFCT.<\/p>  <p>  SFCT is not an import duty and neither the movement of solid fuel into the State, nor its physical presence in the State, generate a liability to SFCT; it is not until solid fuel is first supplied within the State that SFCT becomes liable. Under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Revenue cannot impose any barriers to the movement of solid fuel into the State from other Member States or Northern Ireland. This means that solid fuel coming into the State from Northern Ireland is not subject to cross-border movement controls typical of the harmonised excise regimes: mineral oils, tobacco and alcohol.<\/p>  <p>  Where a solid fuel supplier based in the State sources some or all of their solid fuel supplies from outside the State, they must register with Revenue to account for and pay SFCT. Where a supplier based outside the State brings solid fuel into the State for supply direct to consumers, they must register with Revenue for SFCT. Similarly, suppliers based outside the State who deliver solid fuel into the State to a private individual, must register with Revenue and pay the tax. This means that suppliers from outside the State, including Northern Ireland, who take orders for delivery to private individuals in the State are liable for SFCT and must register with Revenue. Approximately 5% of solid fuel suppliers registered for SFCT are based in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Where an individual personally purchases solid fuel outside the State and accompanies that solid fuel into the State, they do not have an SFCT liability provided the fuel is for their own private use. However, if that individual, instead of using the solid fuel themselves, supplies it to another person in the State, they will have made a first supply and will be liable to pay SFCT and must register with Revenue accordingly.<\/p>  <p>  Currently in Northern Ireland there is no carbon tax on solid fuel and this factor combined with that jurisdiction's lower VAT rate give rise to price differentials which can incentivise the sourcing of solid fuel from Northern Ireland. Revenue is aware of the concerns expressed by suppliers about cheaper coal entering the State from Northern Ireland. Where a person suspects, or has evidence, that a solid fuel supplier, based in the State or in NI (or, indeed, elsewhere), is not paying SFCT on first supplies of solid fuel they should report any information to Revenue, and this can be done by contacting Revenue&rsquo;s Confidential Freephone 1800 295 295. As is the norm with all self-assessed taxes, Revenue addresses non-compliance with SFCT law on a risk basis and, where appropriate, utilises relevant powers of enforcement to collect the tax. However, as already outlined Revenue cannot impose any barriers to the movement of solid fuel into the State from other Member States or Northern Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Bringing solid fuels that do not comply with Ireland&rsquo;s environmental standards into the State does not constitute a Revenue offence. While Revenue (as the tax authority) cannot impose any obstacles to the free movement of solid fuels into the State from other Member States and Northern Ireland, such imports are open to challenge by Local Authorities (as the relevant authority responsible for enforcing environmental standards) if the fuel does not meet environmental standards in this State. I understand that placing such fuels on the market, distributing them, selling them and burning them in the State are actions that must comply with a regulatory regime which operates under the Air Pollution Act 1987. Last year the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Mr. Eamon Ryan T.D., announced the introduction of significant enhancements to the regulatory framework dealing with domestic solid fuels from October 2022. The Minister indicated that his Department would support local authorities to ensure implementation of the most effective model of environmental enforcement for the enhanced regulatory regime.<\/p>  <p>  While Revenue does not have a direct role in relation to these environmental enforcement matters Revenue has participated in several joint operations with other agencies including Local Authority solid fuel inspection teams, with a view to checking for compliance across several tax headings, including SFCT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100082#WRK05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":590,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100082#WRK05900"},{"type":"question","counter":591,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[49593\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100082#WRK06000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will address a query raised in correspondence by a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1493","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":592,"qnumday":277,"qnumall":"[50143\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100082#WRK06100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the rationale to justify the benefit-in-kind rise in budget 2023; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":593,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[50281\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100082#WRK06200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will agree to a full review of the benefit-in-kind tax system; if he will defer the proposed budget 2023 changes until the review is undertaken; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":594,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 264, 277 and 280 together.<\/p>  <p>  At the outset, the Deputy should note that recent Government policy has focused on strengthening the environmental rationale behind company car taxation. Until the changes I brought in as part of the Finance Act 2019, Ireland&rsquo;s vehicle benefit-in-kind regime was unusual in that there was no overall CO2 rationale in the regime. This is despite a CO2 based vehicle BIK regime being legislated for as far back as 2008 (but never having been commenced).<\/p>  <p>  In Finance Act 2019, I legislated for a CO2-based BIK regime for company cars from 1 January 2023. From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new CO2 emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. The number of mileage bands is reduced from five to four. EVs will benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22.5% depending on mileage. Fossil-fuel vehicles will be subject to higher BIK rates, up to 37.5%. This new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges will incentivise employers to provide employees with low-emission cars. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware there have been arguments surrounding the mileage bands in the new BIK structure as they can be perceived as incentivising higher mileage to avail of lower rates, leading to higher levels of emissions. The rationale behind the mileage bands is that the greater the business mileage, the more the car is a benefit to the company rather than its employee (on average); and the more the car depreciates in value, the less of a benefit it is to the employee (in years 2 and 3) as the asset from which the benefit is derived is depreciating faster. Mileage bands also ensure that cars more integral to the conduct of business receive preferential tax treatment.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that better value for money for the taxpayer is achieved by curtailing the amount of subsidies available and building an environmental rationale directly into the BIK regime. It was determined in this context that reforming the BIK system to include emissions bands provides for a more sustainable environmental rationale than the continuation of the current system with exemptions for electric vehicles (EVs).  This will bring the taxation system around company cars into step with other CO2-based motor taxes as well as the long-established CO2-based vehicle BIK regimes in other member states.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above and  in light of government commitments on climate change, Budget 2022 extended the preferential BIK treatment for EVs to end 2025 with a tapering mechanism on the vehicle value threshold. This BIK exemption forms part of a broader series of very generous measures to support the uptake of EVs, including a reduced rate of 7% VRT, a VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000, low motor tax of &euro;120 per annum, SEAI grants, discounted tolls fees, and 0% BIK on electric charging.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that this new BIK charging mechanism was legislated for in 2019 and was announced as part of Budget 2020. I am satisfied that this has provided a sufficient lead in time to adapt to this new system before its implementation in 2023. Therefore there are no plans to review it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100082#WRK06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Budget 2023","counter":596,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100083#WRL00200"},{"type":"question","counter":597,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[49620\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100083#WRL00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will address a matter in relation to the squeezed middle (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":598,"content":"<p>Budget 2023 included a significant personal tax package with an estimated cost next year of over &euro;1.13 billion.

The Standard Rate Cut-Off Point, which is the entry point for the higher rate of income tax, is being increased by &euro;3,200 from &euro;36,800 to &euro;40,000 for a single individual (8.7% increase), with commensurate increases in the bands applying to married persons and persons in civil partnerships. The main personal tax credits (personal credit, employee tax credit and earned income credit) are also being increased by &euro;75 from &euro;1,700 to &euro;1,775 (4.4% increase), and the home carer tax credit is being increased &euro;100 from &euro;1,600 to &euro;1,700 (6.3% increase).<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the 2% rate band ceiling for USC will also be increased in line with the increase in the national minimum wage to ensure that a full-time adult worker who benefits from the increase in the hourly minimum wage rate of &euro;10.50 to &euro;11.30 will remain outside the top rates of USC. Further details can be located at the following link - www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/ccc22-budget-2023-taxation-measures\/<\/p>  <p>  I will bring forward legislative amendments in Finance Bill 2022 to give effect to the above measures from 1 January 2023. These measures will apply to all taxpayers, including persons aged over 65, as appropriate to their individual circumstances and income levels.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, there is an income tax age exemption for persons aged over 65 which means that single, widowed or surviving civil partners aged 65 or older do not pay any income tax if they earn less than &euro;18,000 per annum with a threshold of &euro;36,000 in place for a married couple or civil partners where one person is 65 years of age or older. The relevant income thresholds may be increased further if the individual has a qualifying child. The thresholds are increased by &euro;575 in respect of both the first and second child, and &euro;830 in respect of each subsequent child.<\/p>  <p>  Marginal relief may be available where the individual&rsquo;s or couple&rsquo;s income exceeds the relevant exemption limit but is less than twice that amount. Where marginal relief applies, the individual or couple is taxed at 40% on all income above the exemption limit to a ceiling of twice the exemption limit.  Once the income exceeds twice the exemption limit marginal relief is no longer available and the individual pays tax under the normal tax system.  <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted, however, that where the individual&rsquo;s income is greater than the exemption limit but below twice that limit, the taxpayer is always given the benefit of the more favourable treatment as between the use of marginal relief or the normal tax system of credits and bands.  <\/p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question, Budget 2023 did not include an increase to the current thresholds for the age exemption. While I have no plans to change the thresholds in relation to exemptions currently granted to persons aged 65 and over, it must be noted that the current tax arrangements for persons aged 65 or older compare favourably with the tax treatment of the generality of taxpayers. <\/p>  <p>  Persons aged 65 or over may also avail of the age tax credit, which currently amounts to &euro;245 per year for single persons or &euro;490 per year for married couples or civil partners. Reduced rates of USC also apply for persons aged 70 or older where their total income is &euro;60,000 or less.<\/p>  <p>  Additional guidance on the range of tax credits and reliefs that may be available for individuals over 65 years of age can be found in Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-26, which can be located at the following link &ndash; Tax and Duty Manual: www.revenue.ie\/en\/tax-professionals\/tdm\/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax\/part-15\/15-01-26.pdf.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to cost of living increases, the Government is acutely aware of the cost pressures currently facing households and businesses and has responded to help alleviate some of this burden.

The payments in 2020 also included an additional allocation to Galway of &euro;1m; funding that was linked to the operation of municipal districts, and in 2021 an additional allocation of &euro;600,000 for discretionary income was made.<\/p>  <p>  For 2023, the Government is making a significant contribution of &euro;333 million to support local authorities.  A large portion of this figure (&euro;199 million) will be towards assisting local authorities with the cumulative effect on pay costs arising from the National Pay Agreements and the unwinding of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) legislation. This allocation will ensure that local authorities will have the necessary resources, in terms of people, to perform their functions and provide essential public services to our citizens; in excess of one thousand services in fact.  Furthermore, as has happened in previous years, we will be engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of any additional pay increases that are confirmed for 2023.  The pay allocation for Galway County Council for 2022 is &euro;4.4m. The 2023 pay allocation for Galway County Council, which will be in excess of the 2022 allocation, will be determined and notified to the local authority shortly.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is very aware of the current financial environment in which local authorities, including Galway County Council, are now operating and, in recognition of the ongoing pressures, support of &euro;60m has been secured to assist the sector.  It should be noted that this funding is additional to the &euro;333m outlined above, and its purpose will be to provide additional support to assist local authorities in meeting the increasing costs involved in providing a wide range of services.  The individual allocations of additional support under this scheme and any other additional support to be provided are currently being finalised and the allocation for Galway County Council will be notified to the local authority shortly.<\/p>  <p>  As committed to in the Programme for Government - Our Shared Future, the move to 100% retention of Local Property Tax (LPT) will take place in 2023. All Equalisation funding will now be met by the Exchequer, to ensure that all authorities receive, at a minimum, an amount equivalent to their Baseline. Local authorities may also vary their LPT rate by up to 15%; authorities that increase the rate retain 100% of the additional income, while local authorities that decrease the rate bear the full reduction in income. Galway County Council has opted not to avail of this opportunity to raise additional locally sourced income since 2018. The council could have benefited from an additional &euro;2.15m in 2023 if it had applied the additional 15% upward local variation in the same manner as many other authorities. Galway County Council will receive &euro;155,561 in LPT equalisation funding for 2023 in addition to an expected &euro;14,362,329 LPT yield to achieve a baseline funding of &euro;14,517,890.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that it is intended to commence a comprehensive review of the current LPT baselines in the coming months. This review could not commence in time for the 2023 LPT allocation process without reliable and up-to-date data, primarily the detailed census data. The overall funding position of Galway Co Council and all local authorities will be considered as part of this review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100085#WRN03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Properties","counter":752,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100085#WRN03900"},{"type":"question","counter":753,"qnumday":318,"qnumall":"[49756\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100085#WRN04000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the status of the apartments in Finglas, known as Prospect Hill, that were taken back into the possession of Dublin City Council; if they remain in full ownership of the State; if a block of apartments recently sold by the National Asset Management Agency in the same complex were the ones owned by the State; the status of that particular block; and when the apartments will be allocated.","asker":"1504","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":754,"content":"<p>Prospect Hill consists of 469 apartments the majority of which are in private ownership. <\/p><p>Dublin City Council (DCC) has full ownership of 58 apartments located in Blocks 2 and 2a. <\/p><p>DCC has advised my Department that following a scope of works exercise, the tender for remediation works was advertised in Q2 2022 for these 58 apartments.

The Act provides a legal basis for the various policies and procedures that are applied by the Passport Service in the issue of passports.<\/p>  <p>  Section 10 of the Act provides that a passport will issue in the name of a citizen as it appears on his\/her birth certificate or naturalisation certificate. However, a name change for a passport from that which appears on a person&rsquo;s birth certificate is permitted under the Act in certain situations such as marriage, or civil partnership, where civil or legal documents are available to verify this change.<\/p>  <p>  Applicants who wish to change their name on their passport arising from marriage or civil partnership must submit their original civil marriage certificate or civil partnership certificate. These applications are complex due to the change of name and are currently taking up to the 15 working days expected for an adult online complex renewal. <\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service does not accept deed polls to change the name on a passport.<\/p>  <p>  In cases where name change arises other than by marriage or civil partnership, the Act requires evidence of the use of this new name over a two-year period.<\/p>  <p>  The question of what a person&rsquo;s name is, at any given moment in time, depends upon its usage and the evidence to support the constant and sustained use of this new identity. Evidence of this for at least two years through documentation such as bills, bank statements or official correspondence, is required as a deed poll is not adequate evidence of the constant use of a new name. This policy seeks to protect the integrity and security of Irish passports against passport and identity fraud while allowing for genuine cases where name changes have occurred.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service takes its responsibility to protect the integrity of the Irish passport very seriously. The Irish passport has a strong international reputation due to the strength of the security features within the passport book and the robust processes involved in its issuance.

These companies and research projects also create high-level employment across Ireland and export cutting edge technology around the world.  <\/p>  <p>  The event was well attended by Irish companies and research institutes, including the higher education sector. Contributors included the European Commission (Directorate General for Defence Industry and Space), the Association of Finnish Defence and Aerospace Industries and the Irish Defence and Security Association. The event also involved a number of Irish and European enterprises sharing their experience of the wide-ranging opportunities that there are for Irish research institutions and industrial entities in the security and defence domain, particularly for exploitation of dual use technologies. This included a small number of companies which exhibited some of their products. <\/p>  <p>  The event follows on from the 2021 publication by my Department and the Defence Forces of a Feasibility Study which, inter alia, identified the value of having a research technology and innovation capability within the Defence Organisation that focuses on technologies at lower technology readiness levels (TRL) that have broad potential utilisation in both the civil and security and defence spheres and on leveraging innovations from the civilian sector in a manner that offer potential benefits for our Defence Forces as well as for industry and academia. <\/p>  <p>  The establishment of the Research, Technology and Innovation (RTI) Unit in Defence will set a new strategic direction for Defence innovation and collaboration in Ireland by driving internal innovation in the Defence Organisation and contributing to the development of a security and defence dual-use innovation eco-system.

The allocation model, which was recommended by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), is designed to distribute the total available number of Special Education Teachers across primary and post-primary schools based on the relative need of each school, as evidenced by a number of key indicators.<\/p>  <p>  The SET model is a fairer and more transparent way of allocating teaching resources to schools.<\/p>  <p>  The SET model represented a significant shift in the way that students with SEN are supported in mainstream classes.  Previously, students needing additional teaching support required a diagnosis in order to access support which caused delays in providing the support and also imposed a burden on both schools and parents. The change in policy was welcomed by both schools and parents. The Model is based on the principle that those students with the greatest need receive the most support. <\/p>  <p>  When the SET model was introduced, it was designed to be updated on a regular basis (most recent update was for 2022\/2023 school year) so as to distribute the total available resources across the school system based on profiled need. Because the level of student need may change in a school over time, some schools will gain under this distribution, with these gains balanced by equivalent reductions in schools where the model indicates reduced need.

Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments. The Departments policy is supported by a strong research programme with 53 research projects at various stages including the energy website www.energyineducation.ie., a joint partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).<\/p>  <p>  The Department recognises  the importance of minimising water demand through measures to reduce water usage, such as push type spray taps, low flushing toilets, urinal controls, repairing leaks etc. To this end schools were invited in 2010 to apply for Water Conservation measures and funding of almost &euro;10m was made available to promote water conservation measures as part of this initiative.<\/p>  <p>  In our new school design we provide for water conservation in two key ways.<\/p>  <p>  The first approach is the substitution of mains potable water with rainwater for toilet flushing. There is good potential for recovering or harvesting rainwater in schools to use for flushing toilets and where feasible these systems are provided for in new school projects. All new schools and major extensions have a rainwater recovery system installed.<\/p>  <p>  The second step is the elimination of unnecessary water use, this is achieved a number of means. Water supply for ablution is provided through a single percussion (push) type spray taps. Engagement with schools highlighted that young children used only the cold water taps in schools for washing their hands as they were afraid of the hot tap, associating it with those in their homes which may lack anti-scald provision. Supplying a blended reduced temperature to the hot tap made no difference in their behavior. In response, the Department has adopted a single tap solution to all wash hand basins where the hot and cold water are mixed at the tap intake with anti-scald protection; thus all water outlets for ablution are single percussion taps giving a blended safe water supply.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above low water content dual flushing toilets are also installed and automatic urinal flushing devices are also installed in post primary schools (urinals are not installed in new primary schools for operation reasons).<\/p>  <p>  Drinking water outlets have for many years been provided in schools, all primary schools would typically have drinking water provision in each classroom and the external play areas and post primary schools would typically have drinking water distributed both in internal and external play areas.<\/p>  <p>  In line with Climate Action Policy on single use plastic, schools promote and encourage pupils to have their own reusable drinking bottle which they can top up as needed during the day, thus supporting water conservation and plastic reduction while not imposing additional operating costs on School Management. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100088#WRQ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Admissions","counter":910,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100088#WRQ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":911,"qnumday":372,"qnumall":"[49485\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100088#WRQ01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of Ukrainian children that have been unable to secure school places in the Fingal area (details supplied); the way that she plans to accommodate these children; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":912,"content":"<p>I want to assure the Deputy that meeting the educational needs of children and young people from Ukraine is a priority for me as Minister and for the Government.

Of course, the Deputy will appreciate the scale of the response needed, given that well over 50,000 people have arrived in Ireland from Ukraine since the beginning of this war.  By end of September, figures show that over 11,000 children from Ukraine had enrolled in schools in every county across the State.  Approximately 7,400 children from Ukraine had enrolled in primary schools, while over 4,300 had enrolled in our post-primary schools.  With regard to the area of Fingal in particular, Ukrainian students who are living in the Fingal area of Dublin have so far been accommodated in local schools close to their accommodation.  I am advised that the local Regional Education and Language Team (REALT) co-ordinator has engaged with families in the area.  My Department carried out surveys at Primary and Post Primary level to identify potential capacity.  My Department has incorporated this information with other information in the Geographical Information System (GIS) system to enable quick identification of potential capacity through the Community Analyst reporting system.  This includes the Fingal area.  Our understanding is that there is sufficient capacity in the surrounding schools and neighbouring schools within a reasonable travel distance. The impact analysis from the GIS system sets out the available capacity as well as information on distance, school planning area, current school enrolment information, number of Ukrainian students enrolled etc.  Each REALT team has access to this tool.  This reflects their key role in assisting children in finding school places and in supporting schools in their area to meet the needs of these children as they emerge.  This reporting tool enables the REALT co-ordinator to quickly assess the impact of the arrival of a large number of Ukrainian children on school capacity in a particular area.

Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.

The Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.<\/p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.<\/p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal\/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. <\/p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. <\/p><p>Under the SNA allocation model for special classes and special schools there is a prescribed special class to SNA ratio. An ASD special class, for example, has an allocation of 1 teacher and 2 SNA posts to cater for the educational and care needs of 6 students.

This means that, for the first time since 2017, the programme has been significantly expanded to an additional 322 schools. Those schools are now gaining access to targeted supports to address educational disadvantage.

Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools. The model uses information from the school&rsquo;s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation index. It also takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. A detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on gov.ie<\/p>  <p>  Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed. The DEIS appeals process was applied fairly across all appellants and the results are final. My Department will continue to support schools to deliver high quality, inclusive teaching and learning to students and young learners. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this, and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, following the National Census 2022 held on the 3rd April last, it is envisaged that an updated HP Deprivation Index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in Q3 of 2023.

The NCSE advise my Department that there are sufficient primary and post-primary special class places available at the start of this school year 2022\/2023.<\/p>  <p>  For 2023, a further 370 special classes will open, taking the total number of special classes to over 2,900 in 2023. My Department is engaging intensely with the NCSE in relation to the forward planning of new special classes for the next school year 2023\/2024. This work involves a detailed review of statistical data in relation to forecasting demand for special class places, consideration of improved data sharing arrangements and a particular focus on the provision of special classes at post-primary level.<\/p>  <p>  Information on the list of schools with special classes, the types and locations of these classes is published on the NCSE website and is available at www.ncse.ie.<\/p>  <p>  NCSE is continuing to engage with schools regarding the establishment of additional special classes for the next school year 2023\/2024.

Teachers are allocated at a ratio of 19:1 in the Free Education System and 23:1 to schools in the fee-charging sector.<\/p>  <p>  The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratio shows an improved ratio of teachers to pupils from 15.7:1 to 13.7:1 at primary level when comparing the 2016\/17 school year to the 2021\/22 school year.  This compares favourably with the OECD pupil teacher ratio which is 1:15. In the same period the staffing schedule improved from 27:1 to 25:1.  Average class sizes improved from 24.6 to 22.8 in the same period.  The budget measures will continue the positive trend of improving class sizes for this school year, and statistics on this will be published at the end of the school year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100091#WRT04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":1127,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100091#WRT05000"},{"type":"question","counter":1128,"qnumday":447,"qnumall":"[50293\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100091#WRT05100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of school building projects currently in-hand in County Kildare at primary or second level; the expected dates of completion for each project; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1129,"content":"<p>Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive a total of approximately &euro;4.4 billion capital investment over the period 2021-2025.

The Action Plan contains 12 actions that focus on the provision of support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aims to ensure that all forms of bullying are addressed.  A number of these actions have been implemented in full while others, which by their nature involve continuous action, are the subject of ongoing implementation. <\/p><p>As part of the implementation of the Action Plan, anti-bullying procedures for all primary and post primary schools, which include a specific reference to cyberbullying, were published at the beginning of the 2013\/14 school year. The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils and in dealing with any negative impact within school of bullying behaviour that occurs elsewhere. They include specific requirements in relation to the use of prevention and education strategies and the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour. <\/p><p>The procedures recognise that a positive school culture and climate is key and set out a very practical way on what schools must do to both prevent bullying and to deal with bullying when it occurs.In accordance with the Anti-Bullying Procedures, where a parent is not satisfied that a school has dealt with a bullying case in accordance with the procedures the parents must be referred, as appropriate to the school's complaints procedures.<\/p><p>All Boards of Management are required to adopt and implement an anti-bullying policy that fully complies with the requirements of these procedures.

Small schools are highly valued in their communities in that they provide a vital link to local heritage and history, help sustain rural populations and often act as a link for sports and social activity.<\/p>  <p>  There is a commitment contained in the Programme for Government to continue to recognise the importance of small schools. There is a further commitment not to close any small school without the consent of parents. The decision making authority for a school closure belongs to the Patron of a school. Any proposal to close a school must involve consultation with all of the relevant stakeholders, parents, teachers, students and local communities and follow decisions taken at local level. Proposals must be agreed with the Department.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2020 provided for improved teacher staffing levels for small schools. This measure saw a more favourable pupil teacher ratio in small schools from September 2020. This improved schedule will apply in two, three and four teacher schools and ensure one less pupil is required to retain\/recruit a teacher. This builds on measures in previous budgets which has seen improvements in the appointment and retention thresholds for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th classroom teacher and more favourable enrolment thresholds for one teacher schools situated 8km or more from the nearest school of the same type of patronage and\/or language of instruction.<\/p>  <p>  Small schools have also benefitted from further improvements to the primary staffing schedule for all schools implemented in recent years and the staffing schedule at primary level will now reduce to 23 pupils to 1 teacher from September 2023, which is historically the lowest ever allocation ratio at primary level.<\/p>  <p>  This builds on measures in previous budgets which has seen improvements in the overall allocation of teaching posts and specific targeted measures for small and isolated schools as well as primary schools on our islands.  The staffing process also contains an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria, including a specific one aimed at small schools, to an independent Primary Staffing Appeals Board.  <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, in July 2021, my Department launched a two-year action research project aimed at supporting small rural schools. This project officially commenced in January 2022. The purpose of the project is to inform the development of a policy of supports for small schools through working with education partners to trial innovative approaches to support and sustain small schools in a number of clusters. Six project clusters of small schools have been formed, two in Galway, and one each in Donegal, Kerry, Wicklow and Waterford, consisting of 3\/4\/5 schools per cluster. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100092#WRU02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":1160,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100092#WRU02500"},{"type":"question","counter":1161,"qnumday":459,"qnumall":"[50306\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100092#WRU02600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the current and expected position in regard to the provision of permanent accommodation on a single site for a proposed school (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":1162,"qnumday":463,"qnumall":"[50317\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100092#WRU02700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which the old school buildings at a school (details supplied) are scheduled to be utilised for educational or other purposes; if provision is being made for outlay for various improvements made by the former school authorities in respect of individual expenditure items; if the new school authorities are likely to be compensated for this expenditure and carried over to the new campus; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1163,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 459 and 463 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, my Department is committed to providing permanent accommodation for the school to which he refers. <\/p><p>In this regard, my Department has been in contact with the school patron following consideration of the options study.

This position is set out in Departmental Circular 13\/2016, published in February 2016, which states that schools should avoid using resources developed by the alcohol industry. This message is also reiterated in the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment&rsquo;s <i>SPHE Guidelines for Teachers<\/i>. My Department is giving active consideration to how best to ensure that this position is reflected across our schools. In that regard, my Department will continue to liaise with the HSE, in the context of ongoing work with both the HSE and the Department of Health and HSE on the cross- Government Healthy Ireland programme, the national framework for action to improve the health and wellbeing of the people in Ireland. <\/p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that the issue of alcohol misuse is addressed in the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme, which has a specific module on the use and misuse of a range of substances. As students progress through the SPHE programme, they encounter a wide range of issues, including substance misuse. Schools have a role to play in supporting their students to develop the key skills and knowledge to enable them to make informed choices when faced with difficult issues, including drugs, alcohol and gambling. SPHE is currently mandatory in all primary schools and in Junior Cycle, where it forms part of the mandatory 'Wellbeing' area of learning. Schools are also encouraged to deliver the SPHE programme in senior cycle.<\/p><p>In addition to the above, the 'Know the Score' programme is a substance misuse programme published in 2019 for Transition Year or 5th year pupils. The content is based on research about effective approaches to the prevention of substance misuse. It was jointly developed by the HSE, my Department and the Drugs and Alcohol Task Forces. Students and teachers were involved in the design of the 14 lessons and supporting digital content, which aim to facilitate informed discussions about alcohol and drugs in the classroom.<\/p><p>As the deputy will be aware, the SPHE curriculum is in a process of redevelopment at all stages.

The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE\/RSE linked to the current curriculum and to provide guidance on how SPHE\/RSE may be approached in a more holistic way.<\/p><p>In tandem, work on the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum across Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle is progressing.  <\/p><p>A draft revised Junior Cycle specification was published for consultation on 18 July, with the consultation process running until 18 October. The consultation will take feedback from teachers and students as well as other interested groups and individuals. More information on the consultation process, including how to contribute to it, is available on the NCCA&rsquo;s website. It is expected that the finalised Junior Cycle specification will be presented to Council for approval by the end of this year, and will be implemented in schools in September 2023.<\/p><p>The draft updated specification provides clear direction on the knowledge and skills that all students should gain during the three years of Junior Cycle SPHE. It places a strong focus on the development of important life skills that young people need growing up in a fast changing and complex world. For example, the draft specification addresses the issue of alcohol and addiction in <i>Strand 2: Making healthy choices.<\/i>The learning outcomes of this strand includes investigating how unhealthy products are marketed and advertised to appeal to young people; analysing the supports and challenges for young people when it comes to healthy choices about addictive substances and overcoming them; and discussing the physical, social, and legal consequences of their own or others&rsquo; use of addictive substances.<\/p><p>In relation to Senior Cycle, preparation to update the SPHE\/RSE specification has commenced and a background paper was published earlier this month for public consultation on the NCCA website.

At the start of the last school year, there were circa 103,600 children carried on mainstream school transport services so already in the region of 21,400 additional places have been created, which is over 20% of an increase.  There has been an increase of over 18% to date in the number of tickets issued to eligible pupils and an increase of over 27% to date on the number of tickets issued to concessionary pupils, compared to the start of the 2021\/2022 school year.<\/p>  <p>  The normal eligibility criteria of the scheme still apply and tickets continue to be allocated in line with this criteria.  Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live no less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest primary school. At post primary level, students who live no less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest post primary school\/education centre are deemed eligible.<\/p>  <p>  Any pupils\/students who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or otherwise known as concessionary applicants, and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for.<\/p>  <p>  In line with normal practice, all eligible children who completed the application and ticket registration process on time for the 2022\/2023 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.<\/p>  <p>In addition, pending completion of the outcome of the full review of the School Transport Scheme, Temporary Alleviation Measures at post-primary level will be continued for the 2022\/2023 school year. Under these measures, which were initially introduced in 2019, transport will be provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second nearest school and who applied by the 29th April and registered for a ticket by the 29th   July.<\/p>  <p>  It is very important for families to note that the application deadline for 2022\/23 was 29 April 2022, and that the deadline to confirm registration for tickets was 29 July 2022.  Any application completed after this date is a &lsquo;late application&rsquo; and therefore, many school transport services are already operating at full capacity.

However, it is important to stress that this is subject to capacity considerations.  Constraints in sourcing vehicles and drivers in certain areas of the country may also mean that it may take a number of weeks to explore solutions for additional capacity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100092#WRU04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":1183,"qnumday":467,"qnumall":"[50354\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100092#WRU04800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will outline the process employed in appealing a decision by her Department to refuse an application for school bus transport; the persons involved; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1520","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1184,"content":"<p>The School Transport Scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.

This figure includes 44,299 new applications as well as roll-overs from the previous school year. <\/p>  <p>  The normal eligibility criteria of the scheme still apply and tickets continue to be allocated in line with this criteria.  Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live no less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest primary school. At post primary level, students who live no less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest post primary school\/education centre are deemed eligible.<\/p>  <p>  Any pupils\/students who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or otherwise known as concessionary applicants, and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for.<\/p>  <p>  In line with normal practice, all eligible children who completed the application and ticket registration process on time for the 2022\/2023 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.<\/p>  <p>  The application deadline for 2022\/23 was 29 April 2022, and that the deadline to confirm registration for tickets was 29 July 2022.  Any application completed after this date is a &lsquo;late application&rsquo; and therefore, many school transport services are already operating at full capacity. Late applications will only be assessed after all &ldquo;on time&rdquo; applications have been processed and there can be no guarantee of places for late applicants. <\/p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that the child referred to by the Deputy is eligible for school transport under the terms of the scheme but was unsuccessful in obtaining a seat on board a school transport service for the 2022\/23 school year as they did not complete the ticket registration process by the closing date of 29 July.  All existing services in this area are currently operating at capacity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100092#WRU05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":1188,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100092#WRU05300"},{"type":"question","counter":1189,"qnumday":469,"qnumall":"[50380\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100092#WRU05400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will outline information in relation to newly established collaborative efforts between HSE children's disability services and education to examine if services to children with complex additional needs and their families has been rolled out in all up and running CDNTs to date; and when and how such a collaboration will be evaluated in the future.","asker":"1560","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1190,"content":"<p>The availability and provision of health-related therapy services for children with disabilities, including physical and sensory therapy supports are provided by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and matters in relation to the provision of health-related services should be directed to the HSE or to the Department of Health.<\/p>  <p>  Matters in relation to the HSE&rsquo;s Children's Disability Network Teams should also be directed to the HSE or to the Department of Health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100092#WRU05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","counter":1193,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100093#WRV00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Rates","counter":1192,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100093#WRV00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1193,"qnumday":470,"qnumall":"[50359\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100093#WRV00300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if the domestic abuse rent supplement will be maintained or adjusted for inflation in the next year; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1520","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1194,"content":"<p>The accommodation needs of victims of domestic violence are met through a joined-up service delivery model provided by Tusla with the close involvement of the various housing authorities nationwide.  <\/p><p>Access to Rent Supplement can be provided on referral by Tusla or by prescribed Tusla funded service providers.

These minimum rates vary between occupations and sectors but in all cases craft apprenticeship rates are expressed as a proportion of the qualified rate, increasing yearly from 33% of the qualified rate in year one to 90% in year four.<\/p><p>Periods of off-the-job training are funded from the National Training Fund with payments of the agreed rate made directly to craft apprentices by the education and training boards during this time.<\/p><p>Training allowances for apprentices are calculated with reference to gross-wage norms payable in industry for the different trade sectors.

The gross-wage norm is per week and the norm to be used will be determined by the industry in which the employer is engaged.<\/p><p>On that basis any review of those rates currently payable is a matter for negotiation and agreement under the appropriate industrial relations structures in place and it would not be appropriate for me to be involved in the determination of apprenticeship pay or training rates.<\/p><p>While attending off-the-job training, craft apprentices are paid a training allowance appropriate to their training phase.

In fact, one of the very first actions I took after my appointment as Minister in 2020 was to write to all publicly funded higher education institutions outlining my commitment to tackling sexual violence and harassment in higher education and requesting that institutions take a number of actions in this area, including the development of institutional action plans on tackling sexual violence and harassment. All publicly-funded institutions now have such action plans in place.<\/p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made regarding the Framework for Consent in Higher Education, since it was first launched in 2019. The Framework aims to ensure the creation of an institutional campus culture which is safe, respectful and supportive. As part of monitoring requirements moving forward, the HEA requires that institutions, in respect of both staff and students, report progress annually on implementation of the Framework for Consent.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has provided support for a number of consent awareness raising and training initiatives in the HEIs, including the:<\/p>  <p>  - NUIG Active Consent Programme;<\/p>  <p>  - UCC Bystander Training;<\/p>  <p>  - Speak Out report and support online platform; and<\/p>  <p>  - The ESHTE Toolkit and It Stops Now Campaign led by the NWC in conjunction with USI.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also partnering with the Department of Justice and the NUIG Active Consent programme to support the development of an online hub that will provide, for the first time, an integrated, publicly available resource on sexual consent awareness and learning, which will be an important resource for our further and higher education institutions and the wider community.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to work closely with the Department of Justice in this key policy area and has provided a number of actions for inclusion in the Third Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence Strategy which my colleague Minister McEntee published in June.<\/p>  <p>  I fully support the core principle underpinning the new strategy that we must take a zero tolerance approach. Everyone is entitled to a safe environment to study and work free from violence and harassment, and that informs the policy approaches and interventions that have been adopted across the sector. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I launched the reports on the National Surveys of Student and Staff Experiences of Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment in Higher Education back in January. A total of 11,417 responses were analysed (7,901 students and 3,516 staff) and inform the findings. My officials have been working in recent months with the HEA and key stakeholders to review the recommendations contained in these reports and I intend to make a further announcement on the plans to implement these recommendations shortly. <\/p>  <p>  The creation of an institutional campus culture in each of our higher education institutions which is safe, respectful and supportive, is a key priority for me.

Graduate Entry Medicine (GEM) is one<b><\/b>of the pathways to study medicine. Students pursuing graduate entry medicine (GEM) programmes do so as second degree courses and consequently are not eligible for free fees funding or for student grants. However, in order to widen access to GEM programmes and give assistance towards the financial burden on each student pursuing these programmes, the fees of participating EU students are partly subsidised by the State via the Higher Education Authority (HEA).

The agreement reached with the medical schools has begun with an additional 60 EU students in September 2022, which will climb to 120 in September 2023, and up to 200 by 2026. This marks a significant expansion in the number of places available to students applying through the CAO system. It increases the opportunities for students to progress to study medicine in Ireland and to help build our talent pipeline. Budget 2023 saw a significant increase in the amount the State pays for medicine places, including graduate entry. As part of this agreement, the state contribution for new places will increase to &euro;14,500.

The Strategy has a particular focus on prevention, and on ensuring victims are better supported. As part of this it contains actions for nationwide delivery of refuge accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategy commits to the delivery of additional refuge spaces nationally and aims to address the current shortfall, double the number of refuge spaces in the medium term, and meet the targets set out in the Istanbul Convention in the longer term. This will be the fastest ever expansion of refuge spaces. By the end of the strategy we aim to have over 280 refuge spaces, and we will also work to deliver additional safe homes as a key part of this.<\/p>  <p>As the Deputy will be aware, Tusla, the Child and Family   Agency completed a review of accommodation services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence which identified a number of priority locations where there is a particular urgency.

Further analysis, as well as the work of an Inter-Departmental Group on the provision of domestic violence accommodation, has identified 12 locations nationwide where the delivery of additional family refuge spaces would have the most impact, if prioritised. <\/p>  <p>  These locations represent areas where there is the most significant under-provision and are a starting point to increasing refuge spaces comprehensively across the country.<\/p>  <p>  The 12 priority locations nationwide identified include Carlow, where eight family places are suggested as a potential refuge size requirement.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the work to implement the Third National Strategy, my Department will advance the recommendations made in the Tusla review to improve how effectively, we deliver refuge spaces.<\/p>  <p>  A practical approach will be taken to achieve targets as many factors can influence the speed at which a project is delivered such as, the identification of a suitable site or building, planning processes, tendering processes, appointment of contractors, etc. The areas identified are a priority for the development of refuge accommodation and every effort will be made to ensure this happens as speedily as possible while ensuring a high standard of quality.<\/p>  <p>  The strategy contains actions for doing so both in the immediate and longer term and commits to the delivery of 24 refuge places currently underway in Wexford, Dundalk and Navan by 2024 with all units in priority locations delivered by the end of the strategy in 2026.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100098#WRAA03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"question","counter":1550,"qnumday":589,"qnumall":"[49664\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100098#WRAA03800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will outline her proposed spending plans for the &euro;9 million additional investment in domestic, sexual and gender-based violence response awarded to her Department in budget 2023; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1520","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1551,"content":"<p>Under Budget 2023 I have secured an additional &euro;9m, which represents a 22% increase, for combatting domestic, sexual and gender based violence.

In respect of delivering on this commitment, I recently published the Review of Policy Options for Prison and Penal Reform 2022-2024. <\/p>  <p>  The review seeks to find the balance between ensuring that people who commit serious crimes receive a punishment and a period of incarceration proportionate to that crime, while at the same time acknowledging that sometimes community based sanctions are more appropriate in diverting offenders away from future criminal activity. <\/p>  <p>  Sentencing is a matter solely within the discretion of the trial judge, having regard to the circumstances of the case and of the accused and subject to any limits as may be prescribed by law for a particular offence. While these proposals do not change this, they are intended to strengthen the options available to judges when they are considering cases, to facilitate the effective and efficient use of community sanctions by the courts, and to ensure that the courts have a wide range of appropriate options for dealing with people who have committed minor offences.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, as part of delivering the Penal Policy action plan, the need to ensure the continued availability of modern prison facilities with adequate capacity will continue to be central to the work of the Irish Prison Service and will be core to the development of the new Irish Prison Service Capital Strategy 2023.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100099#WRBB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na","counter":1579,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100099#WRBB00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1580,"qnumday":599,"qnumall":"[50049\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100099#WRBB00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the current status and estimated completion time for the new Garda station at Macroom, County Cork; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1583","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1581,"content":"<p>As provided for in the National Development Plan (NDP) 2021 - 2030, the new Cork County Garda Divisional Headquarters in Macroom, Co.

I fully acknowledge the need for a significant increase in the provision of refuge spaces and I am committed to achieving this in order to ensure that victims have a safe place when they need it.  <\/p>  <p>  Last June, I brought to Government Zero Tolerance: the Third National Strategy to combat Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence. The Strategy has a particular focus on prevention, and on ensuring victims are better supported. As part of this it contains actions for nationwide delivery of refuge accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategy commits to delivering additional refuge spaces nationally to address the current shortfall, double the number of refuge spaces in the medium term, and meet the targets set out in the Istanbul Convention in the longer term. This effect of the implementation of the Strategy will be the fastest ever expansion of refuge spaces over the next 5 years. By the end of the strategy we aim to have over 280 refuge spaces, and we will also work to deliver additional safe homes as a key part of this.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, completed a review of accommodation services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence which identified a number of priority locations where there is a particular urgency.  It is my intention to use the findings of this review as one of the ways to address gaps in the provision of refuge places.<\/p>  <p>  A key recommendation of the Tusla review  is to provide more safe accommodation with a focus on short-term safe &lsquo;emergency&rsquo; accommodation. Further analysis, as well as the work of an Inter-Departmental Group on the provision of domestic violence accommodation, has identified 12 locations nationwide where the delivery of additional family refuge spaces would have the most impact, if prioritised.<\/p>  <p>  These locations represent areas where there is the most significant under-provision and are a starting point to increasing refuge spaces comprehensively across the country.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the work to implement the Third National Strategy, my Department will advance the recommendations made in the Tusla review to improve how effectively we deliver refuge spaces.<\/p>  <p>  A practical approach will be taken to achieve targets as many factors can influence the speed at which a project is delivered such as, the identification of a suitable site or building, planning processes, tendering processes, appointment of contractors, etc. The areas identified are a priority for the development of refuge accommodation and every effort will be made to ensure this happens as speedily as possible while ensuring a high standard of quality.<\/p>  <p>  It is envisaged that development of refuges in the priority areas will be characterised by local interagency working, with key stakeholders involved throughout the process. I have secured resources to make a range of supports available to organisations and communities taking forward development of refuges and associated services, including project management support and resourcing to bring staffing and organisational processes to the level required for operation of these sensitive, high-risk services.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategy contains actions for doing so both in the immediate and longer term and commits to the delivery of 24 refuge places currently underway in Wexford, Dundalk and Navan by 2024 with all units in priority locations delivered by the end of the Strategy in 2026.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100099#WRBB05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Antisocial Behaviour","counter":1627,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100099#WRBB05600"},{"type":"question","counter":1628,"qnumday":615,"qnumall":"[50368\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100099#WRBB05700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of anti-social behaviour orders issued for each of the years 2019 to 2021 and up to 1 October 2022, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1481","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1629,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, management of the courts, including operational matters and logistical functions, are the responsibility of the judiciary and Courts Service, which are independent in exercising their functions under the Courts Service Act 1998, and given the separation of powers in the Constitution.

He specified GP services, prescribed drugs, medicines, aids and appliances, dental, ophthalmic, aural, home support, home nursing, counselling, chiropody and physiotherapy services and formed the opinion that the health provisions should operate in a manner similar to the scheme made available to certain persons under the Health (Amendment) Act 1996. <\/p>  <p>  Subsequently, these services were agreed by the then Government and were legislated for by the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Act 2015 (RWRCI Act).  <\/p>  <p>  It has been commented on that Judge Quirke&rsquo;s report also included the recommendation that Magdalen women should have access to the full range of services currently enjoyed by holders of the Hepatitis C HAA card. However, the HAA services differ from the range of services explicitly recommended in the report and this difference was not reconciled in the report. However, Judge Quirke&rsquo;s report acknowledged that the HAA services were reproduced for illustrative purposes and recognised that not all of the HAA services described may be relevant to the Magdalen women. In fact, Judge Quirke&rsquo;s draft legislation in the report did not include all the services that were provided for under the 2015 Act. The Act is based on the specific areas recommended by Judge Quirke on page 6 of the report. <\/p>  <p>  Eligibility for HAA services is based on the Health Amendment Act 1996. The purpose of the 1996 Act was to meet the health care needs of persons who contracted hepatitis C from a blood product or blood transfusion. It is generally accepted that these hepatitis C patients are a particularly vulnerable group who have specific health needs as a result of their infection. It is apparent that the Quirke Report recognises that the Magdalen women and the groups of people who contracted Hepatitis C are not identical and face different circumstances. In that light, it is not unreasonable to provide eligibility entitlements tailored to women who were admitted to and worked in a relevant institution and who are now facing medical circumstances that are typical of that age cohort. It should be noted that Judge Quirke did not identify complementary therapies, such as reflexology, aromatherapy, massage, hydrotherapy and acupuncture, or other alternative therapies as health services meeting the medical needs of the women.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100099#WRBB06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":1634,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100100#WRCC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1635,"qnumday":617,"qnumall":"[50274\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100100#WRCC00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the provisions that his Department has in place to have a bike station installed on the grounds of Wexford General Hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1622","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1636,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100100#WRCC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Transport","counter":1637,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100100#WRCC00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1638,"qnumday":618,"qnumall":"[50120\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100100#WRCC00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if there is a policy regarding the appropriate use of domestic flights in his Department and bodies under the aegis of the Department.","asker":"1468","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1639,"content":"<p>My Department has a dedicated Policy on all matters relating to official travel by staff of the Department and its Offices, including air travel.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term residential care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.<\/p><p>  All participants within the NHSS contribute up to 80% of their income (40% if part of a couple) and 7.5% per annum of the value of their assets (3.75% if part of a couple). The first &euro;36,000 (&euro;72,000 if part of a couple) is excluded from assessment.<\/p><p>  Assets assessed include cash assets as well as non-cash assets such as the principal private residence, other property and land, including farmland.<\/p><p>  For the purposes of financial assessment, income includes:- Earnings, including income from farming or business activities- Pension income- Social welfare benefits\/allowances- Rental income- Income from holding an office or directorship- Income from fees, commissions, dividends or interest<\/p><p>  Transferred assets and income, defined as assets or income transferred to another person up to five years before a person's application to the scheme, are also assessed.<\/p><p>  The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the three-year cap, which is intended to protect the value of a principal private residence.<\/p><p>  Last year, the Department of Health introduced the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment) Act 2021, which became operational in October 2021. This introduced a three-year cap on contributions from family farm and business assets, provided that a family successor is appointed to run the asset for at least 6 years. The Act also extended the three-year cap to the proceeds of sale of a principal residence, which means that, from the fourth year in care onwards and provided the house was sold while the person is in care, a nursing home resident may sell their principal private residence without incurring additional costs.<\/p><p>In addition, the Government has made a policy change to the NHSS to remove a disincentive for participants in the Scheme to rent out their principal residence after they have entered long term residential care. The rate of assessment on rental income from the principal residence will be reduced from 80% to 40%. This will be reviewed after six months of operation, with the potential for further amendment after that point. This policy change addresses the commitments made under Housing For All Action 19.8.<\/p><p>  The change was made through Committee-Stage amendment to the Regulation of Providers of Building Works and Building Control (Amendment) Bill 2022. The Bill was approved by the Oireachtas on 30th June and signed into law by President Higgins in July. It is expected that the necessary administrative and operational changes will soon be in place and the amendment will become fully operational shortly thereafter.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that the NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:  - Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person  - Bed and board  - Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living  - Laundry service - A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home. In determining the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.  <\/p><p>  Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, such as social programmes, newspapers or hairdressing.

This new strategy aims to change the way in which day case, scheduled procedures, surgeries, scans and outpatient services can be better arranged to ensure greater capacity in the future and help to address waiting lists. The development of additional capacity will be provided through dedicated, standalone Elective Hospitals in Cork, Galway and Dublin. The Government decision is very clear on this.  No other locations are under active consideration at this time as these are our immediate priorities.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the locations chosen will allow for new facilities of a size and scale to implement a national elective care programme that will tackle waiting lists on a national basis. This means that the new facilities will be designed to maximise their capacity and in doing so will operate to cover as wide a catchment area as possible, extending beyond existing and future health areas including the mid-west.<\/p>  <p>The locations were also chosen in line with good practice which suggests that, in order to maximise economies of scale, dedicated, standalone elective centres should be &ldquo;as big as is reasonably possible&rdquo; to meet identified demand while providing appropriate population coverage. Locating the new facilities in Cork, Dublin and Galway will enable the provision of a national service, while aiming to maximise the coverage of the ECCs as far as is reasonably possible. A central point of introducing these new facilities is not that they will only benefit the subset of the population that sit within their direct catchment but rather that the introduction of this new delivery capability into the Public Healthcare System will benefit the whole population, including those who do not fall within the immediate geographical catchment. It is envisaged that the Cork and Galway facilities combined will cater for up to 350,000 patients\/procedures annually.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has made clear that progressing the elective hospital route is the way to go and we are taking all steps to fast track this proposal within the current requirements of the Public Spending Code.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100103#WRFF01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Infectious Diseases","counter":1835,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100103#WRFF01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1836,"qnumday":683,"qnumall":"[49845\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100103#WRFF01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the consideration that would be given by his Department and the HSE to screening for vancomycin resistant enterococci in respect of all hospital patients on admission (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1523","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1837,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100103#WRFF01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":1838,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100103#WRFF01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1839,"qnumday":684,"qnumall":"[49846\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100103#WRFF01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 129 of 21 September 2022, if the families of residents whose files were sent to a legal firm (details supplied) were informed of same; if other residents were illegally restrained; if other residents were discharged from this residential setting if it was found that they had been illegally restrained; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1840,"content":"<p>As the issues raised by the Deputy relate to the management of the delivery of services, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100103#WRFF01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff","counter":1841,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100103#WRFF02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1842,"qnumday":685,"qnumall":"[49848\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100103#WRFF02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the steps that he is taking to ensure vacancies are filled at and additional resources are provided to the Health Service Executive Human Resources National Shared Service in order that the pension increases long due to retired health care workers will be processed on a priority basis and without further delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1843,"content":"<p>As this is an operational matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100103#WRFF02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":1844,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100103#WRFF02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1845,"qnumday":686,"qnumall":"[49849\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022101100103#WRFF02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he intends to create a chief health and social care professionals officer in his Department; his views on same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1846,"content":"<p>My Department considers that health and social care professionals have important expertise which can support its policy work in a number of areas.

A transition period of three years for vessels over 18m targeting sprat was allowed to enable adjustment for these vessels, as the sprat fishery is concentrated inside the six nautical mile zone. <\/p><p>A Policy Directive was issued by that Minister to the independent Licensing Authority to give effect to these measures. The Policy Directive directed the Licensing Authority to insert a condition to this effect into the licences of affected vessels. <\/p><p>A Judicial Review to the High Court was taken by two applicant fishermen challenging the validity of the Policy. On 6th October 2020, the Judge held in summary that the High Court&rsquo;s final order should be, among other matters, a declaration that Policy Directive 1 of 2019 was made in breach of fair procedures and is void and\/or of no legal effect. The breach of fair procedures as referenced above related to a failure with obligations to consult with the applicants in accordance with, and to the extent required by, the consultation process and in particular by failing to consult with them a second time once a preferred option had been identified. A stay on the order was refused by the High Court on 10th December 2020. <\/p><p>I appealed the decision of the High Court to the Court of Appeal. I also sought a stay on the order of the High Court. The Court of Appeal reinstated the Ministerial Policy Directive on 19th March 2021, when the Court was persuaded that the balance of justice leaned in favour of the State and granted a stay on the order of the High Court up until the hearing of the substantive appeal in June. Following a full hearing by the Court of Appeal on 22nd June 2021, the Court decided to temporarily extend the Policy Directive excluding large vessels from trawling in inshore waters within 6 miles of the coast, save for a restricted sprat fishery. <\/p><p>On September 23rd, 2021, the Court of Appeal refused my application to further continue the stay. This refusal means that the decision of the High Court stands and the Policy Directive is no longer valid, meaning vessels over 18 metres in length overall have resumed trawling in the waters inside 6 nautical miles. These vessels also no longer require an authorisation to fish for sprat inside 6 nautical miles. <\/p><p>The Court of Appeal issued an unapproved judgment on 19th July last and the Department is at present considering the implications of the that unapproved judgment in consultation with its legal advisors.
