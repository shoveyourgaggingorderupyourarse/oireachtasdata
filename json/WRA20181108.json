Yemen has experienced over three years of armed conflict which has been the driving force in a devastating, protracted humanitarian crisis. The UN reports that 17.8 million people are currently food insecure, including 8.4 million severely so &ndash; 24% more than in 2017. Critical public services in education, water and sanitation are increasingly limited, and the public healthcare system has collapsed. The UN&rsquo;s Humanitarian Coordinator in Yemen, Lise Grande, has warned that as many as 13 million civilians are at risk if the fighting continues. Ireland joins our EU partners in urging all parties to cooperate in order to achieve a political resolution, respect international humanitarian law, and ensure unrestricted humanitarian access and the free flow of commercial goods.   However, it is crucial that we also push for a resolution of the conflict which is the ultimate cause of the suffering of so many civilians. This has been one of my consistent messages to all parties to the conflict. Officers from my Department consistently convey the Government&rsquo;s strong concerns to the Saudi, United Arab Emirates and Iranian Embassies in Dublin. And I myself met with the Saudi Ambassador last month and stressed the importance that Ireland puts on this issue.   Ireland and its EU partners are in agreement on the need to continue our strong support for the efforts of the UN Special Envoy, Mr. Martin Griffiths, to re-start negotiations so as to bring about a political resolution of the conflict. I welcome the US statements last month in favour of a cessation of hostilities, and I believe that this should act as an impetus for the resumption of negotiations. The UN Special Envoy is working to bring the parties together for a new round of peace talks which may take place as early as later this month. Alarmingly, however, on the ground recent days have seen an escalation in fighting, particularly around the critical port of Hodeidah, which is the entry point for an estimated 70% of goods imported into Yemen. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is doing what we can to address the devastating humanitarian situation and try and help alleviate the suffering of the Yemeni people. Since 2015, Ireland has provided almost &euro;16.5 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen. This includes a contribution of &euro;4 million made to the UN Yemen Humanitarian Fund this year, which provides assistance in the areas of education, logistics, food security, nutrition and health. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland also provides humanitarian support to Yemen through our contributions to EU funds. Since the beginning of the conflict in 2015, the EU has contributed a total of &euro;438.2 million to Yemen, which includes humanitarian, development, stabilisation and resilience support.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is using our leverage in other multilateral fora to focus on the situation in Yemen. At the Human Rights Council in September 2017 Ireland was part of a core group of countries which ensured the establishment of a Group of Eminent Experts on Yemen to investigate alleged violations of human rights and contraventions of international humanitarian law by all parties to the conflict. In September of this year, Ireland worked to ensure the extension of the mandate of the Group of Eminent Experts for another year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800045#WRC01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference","counter":74,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800045#WRC01800"},{"type":"question","counter":75,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[46312\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800045#WRC01900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on the recent British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":76,"content":"<p>A meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC) took place in Dublin on 2 November.

Following on from the most recent meeting of the BIIGC, in London on 25 July, last week&rsquo;s meeting provided the opportunity to continue our discussions on legacy issues, security co-operation, East-West matters, and political stability in Northern Ireland.    At the meeting, we reaffirmed our commitment to implementing the framework established in the 2014 Stormont House Agreement to comprehensively address the legacy of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s past, taking account of the UK Government&rsquo;s public consultation on establishing the legacy institutions. <\/p>  <p>  On security-cooperation, both Governments recalled the commitments made in the 2015 Fresh Start Agreement to ending paramilitarism and welcomed the first report of the Independent Reporting Commission (IRC) established under that Agreement.  In considering the findings and recommendations contained in the report, the Conference noted in particular the IRC&rsquo;s view that the full operation of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement is essential to ending paramilitarism and achieving community transformation. <\/p>  <p>  The Conference discussed a joint paper by Irish and British officials which outlined a number of possible models to maintain and strengthen the high level of bilateral co-operation between the UK and Ireland post-Brexit.  Both Governments agreed that these new structures for systemic bilateral co-operation should demonstrate the strength and depth of the relationship, provide opportunities for ministers and officials to continue to engage with each other, and provide an overall architecture for cooperation that is both meaningful and sustainable in the future.  As announced following the Conference, this model would include top level summits involving Heads of Government and senior ministers and would alternate between Ireland and the UK.  These summits would be supported by close bilateral work by ministers.  Officials on both sides have been asked to turn these ideas into a detailed practical plan of work with a view to presenting a fully worked through proposal for future East-West cooperation for consideration at the next meeting of the Conference.<\/p>  <p>  The Conference provided both Governments the opportunity to reaffirm our strong support for the Good Friday and subsequent Agreements.  It was recognised that the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement have been essential for the progress made in Northern Ireland over the past two decades and that they remain the indispensable framework for the political process in Northern Ireland.  Both Governments reiterated their shared commitment to securing the operation of the devolved power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly and the consequent resumption of meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council at the earliest opportunity. <\/p>  <p>  It was agreed that the BIIGC would reconvene in spring 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800045#WRC02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":77,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800045#WRC02100"},{"type":"question","counter":78,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[46313\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800045#WRC02200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on a deal agreed between Myanmar and Bangladesh to start repatriating Rohingya refugees; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":79,"content":"<p>In the months since military security operations began in Rakhine State, Myanmar in August 2017, approximately 720,000 refugees, mostly Rohingya, have fled to Bangladesh. The people and government of Bangladesh have demonstrated extraordinary generosity in receiving such a large influx of refugees.  I remain very concerned at the ongoing situation in Myanmar and the plight of these refugees who are living in extremely precarious conditions in overcrowded refugee camps.  Ireland remains unwavering in its wish to see conditions that will enable the voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable return of these Rohingya refugees to their places of origin in Myanmar in compliance with international human rights norms and the principle of non-refoulement.    I note that the signing of Memoranda of Understanding on the repatriation of the Rohingya between Myanmar and Bangladesh and between Myanmar and the UNDP and UNHCR are important first steps on this path of return. I hope that they will be followed by constructive dialogue between international partners and the government of Myanmar, while also allowing the voices of the refugee community to play a key role in determining their future.<\/p>  <p>  However, I do not believe that current conditions on the ground in Myanmar are conducive to allow for the voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable repatriation of members of the Rohingya community. <\/p>  <p>  In that regard, recent reports of an arrangement between Myanmar and Bangladesh for the return of up to 5,000 refugees in the near future are of concern.

Recently we have seen the establishment of firms in Ireland using Blockchain technology or offering Blockchain solutions to the financial services sector and other sectors.<\/p>  <p>  As part of their Fintech Action Plan, published in March of this year, the European Commission announced that they are working on a comprehensive strategy for distributed ledger technology and Blockchain addressing all sectors of the economy.<\/p>  <p>  From the beginning of IFS2020, the 2015 Government Strategy for the development of the international financial services sector, we recognised the increasing opportunities for Fintech and have had a number of target measures to support the development and growth of Fintech.  Blockchain would be a sub-set of Fintech.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2016, Enterprise Ireland has provided dedicated seed-funding for enterprises in the Fintech sector, through its Competitive Start Fund, to stimulate greater activity in enabling technology. The 2018 Fintech CSF was opened in June 2018 to early stage companies active in Fintech and Deep Tech (including Blockchain, Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence\/Machine Learning, Data Intelligence, Cloud, AR\/VR, and Quantum Computing). <\/p>  <p>  The international financial services strategy from 2015 (IFS2020) is approaching the end of its lifetime and Government approval has been secured to begin work on a successor strategy for IFS. My Department is currently engaging with the public and key private sector stakeholders in the IFS industry to start the process of drafting a future strategy for international financial services in Ireland, and a public consultation has recently been completed. The role of Blockchain, and many other innovations and initiatives, will be considered in the context of this work.<\/p>  <p>  While the Government has a significant role to play in providing support for technological adoption, the implementation of innovation solutions such as Blockchain will be industry-driven.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800045#WRC04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fiscal Policy","counter":99,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800045#WRC04300"},{"type":"question","counter":100,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[46343\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800045#WRC04400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the gross and net fiscal space for each year up to 2023 if the expenditure benchmark and the medium term objective is met accounting for contributions to the rainy day fund, pre-committed expenditure and the non-indexation of tax system irrespective of the economy's position on the business cycle; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":101,"content":"<p>As I have previously outlined, the concept of &lsquo;fiscal space&rsquo; is no longer an appropriate one.

This included a public consultation whereby the introduction of Tier 3 AHBs as a new investment class for credit unions was supported by the sector, as was the mechanism for facilitating such investments via a regulated entity. <\/p>  <p>  The new Investment Regulations came into effect on 1 March 2018. Since this date, credit unions are permitted to provide funding to Tier 3 AHBs for the provision of social housing via a regulated entity. The maximum permitted investment amount per credit union is 50% of a credit union's regulatory reserves where a credit union has total assets of at least &euro;100 million and 25% of a credit union's regulatory reserves for all other credit unions. These limits may facilitate a combined sector investment in Tier 3 AHBs of close to &euro;700 million.

The<i>Action Plan for Jobs 2018 <\/i>contains a commitment to develop a high level National Digital Strategy, to provide a coherent vision across sectorial policies to position Ireland to maximise economic and societal benefits from digitalisation. <\/p><p>A range of actions are in place across the education and training system to support the acquisition of enhanced digital skills and to increase the use of digital technologies in teaching and learning. These build on actions on digital skills set out in the National Skills Strategy 2025.<\/p><p>In 2015, my Department published the <i>Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020 <\/i>which includes a range of relevant actions that will support the development of digital skills both directly through specific curriculum content and through technology enhanced learning across the curriculum. <\/p><p>Within the Higher Education sector, a number of actions are included to implement the <i>Roadmap for Enhancement in a Digital World 2015-2017<\/i>aimed at supporting the development and embedding of digital capacity in teaching and learning activities and developing consistent digital experiences for learners.<\/p><p>There are considerable changes occurring within the Further Education Sector (FET) to improve the existing capacity in the area of digital inclusion and the provision of digital skills in FET. The <i>Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) in Further Education and Training 2016 &ndash; 2019 Strategy<\/i>will build on existing capacity and good practice in TEL to expand access to and continuously improve and innovate FET provision.  <\/p><p>A range of programmes are provided within ETBs for individuals who wish to develop their digital literacy. Basic ICT tuition is integrated within adult literacy and numeracy provision. Opportunities for basic skills provision is offered through a variety of providers via a broad range of ETB FET provision delivered in adult education centres, community education settings and training centres. Delivery of these programmes is designed to meet the needs of participants'  personal and career goals and are offered on a full and part-time basis. These courses are supported through the funding provided to the Adult Literacy Programme, Bridging &amp;amp; Foundation Training, Local Training Initiatives, Community Education, Youthreach and the BTEI (Back to Education Initiative).  Some of these programmes combine transversal skills such as literacy, numeracy, digital skills, communications and teamworking with specific occupational skills. <\/p><p>My Department also recently launched a new policy framework for employee development, <i>'Skills to Advance'<\/i>, which was developed by SOLAS in consultation with key partners.  This new approach will enable targeted support for vulnerable groups in the Irish workforce as it has a particular focus on employees those who have lower skills levels and who need more opportunities to advance in their working lives and careers, to sustain their employment and to avoid displacement or to avail of emerging job opportunities. The policy sets a target of having over 40,000 workers, whose skills level is below Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), engaged in state supported skills development by 2021. It should be noted that while the NFQ is not a digital literacy scale but a qualifications framework, I am committed to addressing digital literacy issues amongst those whose highest level of qualification is below Level 5, including through achieving certification for their learning. Participation by employees in relevant courses will be provided free of charge. <\/p><p>This new initiative is also a significant part of our national efforts to implement the European Commission's Upskilling Pathways Recommendation: New Opportunities for Adults, as almost half of those with less than an upper secondary qualification are in employment. My Department has been working with partners on the implementation of the recommendation &ndash; which aims to help adults with less than upper second level education acquire a minimum level of literacy, numeracy and digital skills. My Department has established a multi&ndash;agency steering group to identify the priority cohorts and appropriate measures to implement the recommendation.  This informed my Department's recent response to a request from the Commission for information regarding arrangements in Ireland on upskilling pathways interventions. The response presented the overall context for Upskilling Pathways in Ireland, including key background information that the Commission would find useful, as well as information on existing and planned provision.

The judgment in the 2015 Supreme Court case of H v. H [2015] IESC 7 has confirmed that Irish law does not recognise the validity of a divorce lawfully granted prior to 2 October 1986 in a country where neither party to the marriage was domiciled at the date of institution of the divorce proceedings but where one party was resident on that date. <\/p>  <p>  The Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act 1986 sets out the circumstances in which a divorce granted in a jurisdiction outside of Ireland on or after 2 October 1986 will be recognised.  Under section 5 of the 1986 Act, a divorce shall be recognised in Ireland if it was granted in the country where either spouse was domiciled at the date of the institution of the divorce proceedings. <\/p>  <p>  The recognition in Ireland of a divorce granted in another EU Member State on or after 1 March 2001 is governed by EU Council Regulation 2201\/2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility (also known as the Brussels II bis or the Brussels IIa Regulation).  This Regulation provides for EU judicial co-operation and recognition and enforcement of judgments in cross-border matrimonial matters.  <\/p>  <p>  Under the Regulation, divorces granted in all EU States, with the exception of Denmark, are entitled to recognition if granted in accordance with jurisdictional criteria specified in the Regulation.  Habitual residence is the key governing criterion for recognition.  The Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act 1986 no longer applies to the recognition of divorces covered by the Regulation.<\/p>  <p>  Where there is an issue as to whether a foreign divorce is entitled to recognition, section 29 of the Family Law Act 1995 allows a person to apply to court for a declaration as to marital status, including a declaration as to whether a foreign divorce is entitled to recognition in the State.  <\/p>  <p>  While I have no plans at present for amendment of the legislation on recognition of foreign divorces, the matter is being kept under review.  In this regard, it should be noted that in June 2016, the European Commission published its proposal for a recast of the Brussels IIa Regulation.  Ireland has opted in to the proposed Regulation and discussions on the proposed Regulation are ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  Matters relating to eligibility for widow&rsquo;s or widower&rsquo;s pensions are governed by the Social Welfare Acts, which fall under the remit of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800047#WRE07000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Deportation Orders Re-examination","counter":263,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800047#WRE07100"},{"type":"question","counter":264,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[46411\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800047#WRE07200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if a decision to deport in the case of persons (details supplied) will be reviewed; if their case will be re-examined with a view to awarding leave to remain; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":265,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person concerned is the subject of a Deportation Order made on 15 September 2017.  <\/p>  <p>  As previously advised it is open to the person concerned to submit further representations requesting that the Deportation Order be revoked, pursuant to Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).

The EGFSN is an independent body, comprised of business representatives, education providers, trade unions and Government bodies. The EGFSN plays a key role in identifying future skills needs of enterprises and advising Government on those needs to enhance Irish competitiveness. <\/p><p>Over the last 21 years, the EGFSN has assessed skills availability across a wide range of sectors. In recent years, these studies have included sectors such as the marine economy; freight, transport, logistics and distribution; biopharma and hospitality.

In 2013 the EGFSN published the study <i>Addressing Future Demand for High-Level ICT Skills<\/i>. This study included a demand forecast for ICT skills over the period 2013-2018. The findings and recommendations of this report were essential inputs into the development of the ICT Skills Action Plan 2014-2018.

This system is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA migrants to fill skills shortages. The objective is balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish\/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and the shortage is a genuine one. The employment permits system is managed by the operation of the Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations List and the Ineligible Categories List. The rationale underpinning the inclusion or omission from the occupation lists is informed by EGFSN and the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU) in Solas and is augmented by a consultation process that includes calls for submissions.

Each Plan has set out actions aimed at driving enhancements in productivity, competitiveness, innovation, the development and attraction of high quality talent, regional development, and trade diversification. The implementation of these actions is monitored on a quarterly basis for each year of release.<\/p><p>The 2018 Action Plan for Jobs contains specific actions targeted at removing barriers to the labour market for women. This includes the development of the Affordable Childcare Scheme and the previously mentioned identification of policy issues for cohorts with low participation rates, both of which are due to be completed by end of 2018. <\/p><p>Pathways to Work 2016-2020  The two main objectives of this strategy are:<\/p><p>To continue and consolidate the progress made to date with an initial focus on working with unemployed jobseekers, in particular those who are long-term unemployed.<\/p><p>To extend the approach of activation to other people who, although not classified as unemployed jobseekers, have the potential and the desire to play a more active role in the labour force.<\/p><p>Pathways to Work contains a number of actions relevant to facilitating participation for several cohorts, including females. These actions have been monitored with progress reports published quarterly since its release. <\/p><p>The National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020  The National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020 provides the policy framework on which the Government&rsquo;s agenda and priorities in relation to the advancement of equality for women over the next four years are set out.  The Strategy outlines a number of actions around female labour market activation and addressing barriers to employment for women.<\/p><p>Future Jobs Initiative  The Future Jobs initiative, which is being developed by my Department jointly with the Department of An Taoiseach, and which is expected to be launched in early 2019, will aim to drive Ireland's development over the coming years as a resilient, innovative, and globally connected economy, capable of coping with technological and other transformational changes ahead.  Future Jobs will place a strong focus on raising labour market participation levels, particularly for women. <\/p><p>Active Population and Activity Rates of Females Aged 15 and Over, 2017<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Category<\/th><th><div>Females Aged 15+<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Total Active Population (000&rsquo;s)<\/td><td><div>1055.2<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Participation Rate (Ireland)<\/td><td><div>55.7%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>EU Average Participation Rate<\/td><td><div>51.8%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Highest Rate in EU (Sweden)<\/td><td><div>62.1%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Lowest Rate in EU (Italy)<\/td><td><div>40.9%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><i>Source: Eurostat, EU Labour Force Survey<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800048#WRF04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Competitiveness","counter":309,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800048#WRF04400"},{"type":"question","counter":310,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[46384\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800048#WRF04500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she is satisfied with Ireland&rsquo;s rankings in the 2018 global competitiveness report published by the World Economic Forum on 17 October 2018.","asker":"1229","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":311,"content":"<p>Improving our competitiveness and ensuring that Ireland is an attractive location to do business remains a key economic priority for this Government. We continue to monitor Ireland's competitiveness and analyse the factors that are crucial to attracting further investments in the country.<\/p>  <p>The 2018 World Economic Forum&rsquo;s Global Competitiveness Index Report ranks Ireland 23rd most competitive economy out of 140 countries, maintaining its global competitiveness position from last year. We continue to be the 8th most competitive economy in the euro area and the 11th   most competitive economy in the European Union.<\/p>  <p>Ireland performs well in labour market (7th), business dynamism (10th), Skills (15th) and institutions (17th  ). Ireland is also ranked in the top 15 in relation to female participation in labour force, cost of starting a business, attitudes toward entrepreneurial risk and growth of innovative companies. Furthermore, Ireland scores 99.4 out of 100 in terms of macroeconomic environment.<\/p>  <p>  Our positive competitiveness performance is not only reflected in the World Economic Forum&rsquo;s global competitiveness ranking but is also evident in our strong economic growth and trade performance, increased employment and falling unemployment. However, there is no room for complacency.  <\/p>  <p>The ranking is also a reminder of the intense global competition we face for exports and inward investment. Areas for focus, are evident in relation to Infrastructure (34th), Financial system (37th) and ICT adoption (44th).  The Government is strongly committed to addressing current infrastructure deficiencies as underlined by the substantial increase in capital investment under the National Planning Framework (NFP) alongside the ten- year National Development Plan (NDP). The &euro;300m long-term Future Growth Loan Scheme   announced in Budget 2019 will improve the availability of funding by providing businesses the opportunity to borrow for up to ten years to support capital investment.  Budget 2019 also allocated additional funding for my Department to boost business productivity, e.g. doubling of the Retail Online Pilot Scheme to &euro;1.25m and awarding an additional &euro;2.75m to Enterprise Ireland for its SME Regional Innovation and Technology Clusters Programme.  <\/p>  <p>  Global uncertainty and Brexit has underlined the importance of building competitive advantage and generating an uplift in enterprise export competitiveness to secure sustainable jobs and growth. Ensuring enterprise stays at the forefront of innovative activity is vital to deepening the resilience of our enterprise base and necessary for success in global markets, which for a small open economy like Ireland, is necessary for creating sustainable growth. Building the foundations of future growth means we must further enhance the competitiveness of our business environment. We must continue to invest in our infrastructure and talent base and harness the benefits from trade and the Single Market.<\/p>  <p>  My officials and the National Competitiveness Council will establish what actions we can take to further improve our competitiveness, particularly in the areas where we are lagging competitors. The NCC will issue recommendations in its forthcoming 2018 Competitiveness Challenge report.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Future Jobs Initiative - which is being led by my Department and the Department of An Taoiseach and which will be published in early 2019, will have a strong focus on improving productivity in the economy and its competitiveness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800048#WRF04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Personal Injuries Commission","counter":312,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800048#WRF04700"},{"type":"question","counter":313,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[46385\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800048#WRF04800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"her views on the most recent Personal Injuries Commission report and the recommendation to establish a judicial council and for the Minister for Justice and Equality to formally request that the council review the award guidelines; and the estimated impact this will have on the Book of Quantum.","asker":"1229","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":314,"content":"<p>I was pleased to submit the Second and Final Report of the Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) to Government on the 18th September 2018.

It is the commonest cause of tick-borne infection in Europe.  Lyme neuroborreliosis was made statutorily notifiable in Ireland by the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Regulations 2011 (S.I. no 452 of 2011).  <\/p><p>Testing and treatment for Lyme borreliosis is widely available in Ireland in all major hospitals.  Lyme borelliosis is diagnosed by medical history and a physical examination which may be carried out by a General Practitioner.  Lyme disease may be treated by infectious disease specialists (of which there are 12 nationally) or by general internal medicine available in all acute hospitals.  Medical training programmes at undergraduate or postgraduate level in Ireland provides specialist training in infectious diseases, including Lyme disease.<\/p><p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE is responsible for the surveillance of notifiable infectious diseases such as Lyme disease.  The Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) of the HPSC established a Lyme Borreliosis Subcommittee, the aim of which is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention with a view to minimising the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland. <\/p><p>The Subcommittee will shortly be meeting to consider its final report to the SAC.  During the report&rsquo;s preparation, the HPSC learned that the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK was undertaking a systematic review of Lyme disease which resulted in the NICE Lyme disease guidelines.  These guidelines are based on the most exhaustive systematic review yet undertaken of the evidence around Lyme disease and focused on producing recommendations based on best available evidence relating to diagnosis, management and public awareness of Lyme disease.  <\/p><p>The HPSC delayed the final production of the Subcommittee report to ensure that the findings of these guidelines could be considered for inclusion into the final report.  The report is in the final stages of preparation and it is planned to circulate the report to members of the Lyme Subcommittee with a view to having a final sign-off meeting of the Subcommittee in November, at which point it will be sent for consideration to the SAC.  At this juncture, it would be inappropriate to consider making changes to the testing, treatment and\/or management of the condition until this deliberative process has been completed.  It is envisaged that, once published, these guidelines will provide further assistance to General Practitioners.<\/p><p>The HPSC also provides extensive information on Lyme disease diagnosis, treatment and how to avoid tick bites on its website (<i>www.hpsc.ie<\/i>).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800049#WRG03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances Provision","counter":377,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800049#WRG03800"},{"type":"question","counter":378,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[46202\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800049#WRG03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if modern glucose monitoring systems involving readings of sensors attached to patients will be made available to senior citizens suffering from diabetes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1360","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":379,"content":"<p>Under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, the HSE has statutory responsibility for the administration of the community drug schemes; therefore, the matter has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800049#WRG04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff Data","counter":380,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800049#WRG04100"},{"type":"question","counter":381,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[46207\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800049#WRG04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of vacancies unfilled or filled on a temporary basis respectively in hospitals (details supplied) in counties Cavan and Monaghan; and the details of each by category.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":382,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to you directly as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800049#WRG04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":383,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800049#WRG04400"},{"type":"question","counter":384,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[46208\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800049#WRG04500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount of funding issued to an organisation for services in respect of a person (details supplied); the period involved; the attendance record of the person; the amount of funding paid to an organisation in County Kilkenny in respect of another person; the period involved; the attendance record of the person; the reason a sustainable long-term care plan was not put in place; the reason the family has had no support services for the past 11 years; and if a long-term plan with funding will be put in place by the HSE in agreement with the children's parent.","asker":"1248","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":385,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period, was &euro;5,020. Following closure of the scheme in February 2013, no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place. This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.<\/p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services.

Principal amongst these was the new site classification system for forestry, called the &ldquo;Land Types for Afforestation&rdquo; document which has been implemented since 2016. This approach examines the suitability of sites for afforestation based on scientific work centred on the scoring of vegetation as an indicator of soil fertility.  <\/p>  <p> The introduction of the &ldquo;Land Types for Afforestation&rdquo;   document has resulted in some previously &lsquo;poor&rsquo; Grant &amp;amp; Premium Category (GPC) 1 land now being classified as &lsquo;Unsuitable Land&rsquo;.  Therefore, there is less GPC 1 land being planted as a result of the new classification, 1.6% in 2016 and 0.8% in both 2017 and so far in 2018. However, the new procedure has also led to some previously &lsquo;good&rsquo; GPC 1 land being planted as GPC 3 resulting in higher premiums for the land owner than would have been the case had the previous classification system been in place. It is difficult for the Department to quantify exactly how much more land has been planted as a result of the higher rates on offer in this scenario as approvals under the current regime, e.g. GPC 3, contain no reference to what the classification would have been under the previous regime, e.g. GPC 1.<\/p>  <p>  My Department's overall approach to increasing forest cover is to continue to offer a generous suite of grants and annual premiums across all planting categories to incentivise landowners to convert part of their land to forestry.

It\u00a0also\u00a0has implications for how individuals, households, communities, businesses, and schools live, work and learn.\u00a0\u00a0    As a means of promoting wider societal action on climate, the Government established a National Dialogue on Climate Action in 2017. The primary purpose of the Dialogue is to ensure an inclusive process of engagement and consensus building across society towards enabling the transformation to a low carbon and climate-resilient future. To do this, the Dialogue will seek to create awareness, engagement and motivation to act (locally, regionally and nationally) in relation to the challenges presented by climate change and to establish, on a long term basis, appropriate networks for people to meet periodically to consider evidence-based inputs on the economic, social, behavioural, environmental and public aspects of climate and energy policy.<\/p>  <p>  A range of initiatives are already taking place under the National Dialogue on Climate Action, including a series of regional gatherings to consider the issues facing Ireland in addressing climate change and identify the different actions that individuals, local communities and the public sector can take.

On the basis of this data, a 25% reduction in fossil fuel use could theoretically result in a reduction in emissions of 9.3 Mt CO2eq. <\/p><p>The 2009 Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) 406\/2009\/EC established binding annual greenhouse gas emissions targets for EU Member States for the period 2013 to 2020. These targets concern emissions from most sectors not included in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), such as transport, buildings, agriculture and waste. For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005. In the period 2021 to 2030, Ireland must reduce its non-ETS emissions by 30% relative to 2005 levels of emissions by 2030. This is where we must now focus our efforts to ensure that, at the absolute very least, we meet our 2030 target.<\/p><p>Ireland's National Mitigation Plan (NMP), published in 2017, sets out the sectorial policy measures required in order to manage Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions at a level appropriate for making progress towards our long-term national transition objective, as well as taking into account our EU and international obligations. Although this first Plan does not provide a complete roadmap to achieve our national transition objective to 2050, it begins the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades. <\/p><p>Building on the National Mitigation Plan, the publication in February of the National Development Plan reaffirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to transitioning Ireland to a low carbon, climate resilient economy and society. Reflecting the strong commitment of Government on this issue, almost &euro;22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. This means that well over &euro;1 in &euro;5 spent under the National Development Plan (NDP) will be on climate action and this capital investment will enable us to deliver a significant reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions over the period to 2030.<\/p><p>Further building on these Government initiatives to date,\u00a0l will shortly seek Government approval to prepare an all of government plan which will set out the actions which must be taken in every government department and body. The central ambition of this plan will be to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change.I will work with colleagues across Government to develop new initiatives across electricity, transport, heat, as well as a range of other sectors. The new plan will have a strong focus on implementation, including actions with clear timelines and steps to needed to achieve each action, assigning clear lines of responsibility for delivery. The new plan will also be informed by successful approaches in other countries, where such approaches could be adapted for implementation in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800052#WRK07300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":631,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800053#WRL00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Transport Policy","counter":630,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800053#WRL00200"},{"type":"question","counter":631,"qnumday":230,"qnumall":"[46155\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800053#WRL00300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of the Castletownbere transportation plan; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1262","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":632,"content":"<p>I understand that the Castletownbere Transportation Study is being prepared by Cork County Council and statutory responsibility for the study does not come within the remit of my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800053#WRL00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Safety","counter":633,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800053#WRL00500"},{"type":"question","counter":634,"qnumday":231,"qnumall":"[46189\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800053#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will request TII to deal with traffic hazards on the N4 route at the Cootehall and Croghan junction between Carrick-on-Shannon and Boyle; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1342","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":635,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.\u00a0 Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015, the planning, design and\u00a0operation of individual roads\u00a0is a matter for the relevant road authority\u00a0in relation to\u00a0local and regional roads, or for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII)\u00a0in conjunction with the local authorities concerned, in relation to national roads.\u00a0\u00a0 This also includes the provision of potential safety improvement works on national roads.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Noting the above position, I have referred the question to TII for a direct reply to you.\u00a0\u00a0Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800053#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Services Provision","counter":636,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800053#WRL00800"},{"type":"question","counter":637,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[46200\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800053#WRL00900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he has conducted an analysis on improving the train schedule by increasing the number of trains and the possibility of more direct trains from County Laois at train stations in Portlaoise and Ballybrophy in view of the fact that the commuting numbers have increased in recent years with no added services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1232","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":638,"content":"<p>The issue raised is a matter for the National Transport Authority (NTA) in conjunction with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply.

These policy developments are set out in the Pathways to Work\u00a0Action\u00a0Plan for Jobless Households which I published on 25 September 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Development of the  Plan fulfils a commitment in the Programme for Government and in the overall Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy. It also responds to concerns about the level of household joblessness raised in Country-Specific Recommendations to Ireland by the EU. <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Action Plan for Jobless Households is an example of one of the many measures that Government is implementing, with a view to assisting people and families to become work ready and gain sustainable employment. The Plan aims to extend activation services to people who are not working, but are not defined as unemployed by traditional measures. It focuses in particular on improving employment rates of households with children - both the traditional\u00a0'nuclear' family and the lone parent \u00a0family. Specific steps have also been taken to promote engagement with the employment services for groups such as lone parents and people with disabilities. The Plan proposes a number of approaches in support of increased participation by currently inactive groups. The main points include:<\/p>  <p>  - Continued implementation of\u00a0reforms to lone parents' welfare payments, which introduced (partial) labour-market conditionality for those whose youngest children are aged 7\u00a0or more.<\/p>  <p>  - Reforms to remove\u00a0\u00a0disincentives to labour market participation associated with housing supports for welfare recipients. <\/p>  <p>  - Taking steps to support\u00a0increased labour force participation among recipients of disability payments. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - Introducing a package of\u00a0financial reforms to welfare schemes to support working families, as they\u00a0make\u00a0the transition to employment.<\/p>  <p>  - Exploring the possibility of\u00a0a family-focused approach to employment services for couples with children\u00a0where neither member of the couple is working.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0A number of specific measures are being taken on foot of the Plan since its publication. <\/p>  <p>  - In relation to housing supports, the roll-out of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) was finalised during 2017. Almost 18,000 additional households transitioned to the new payment during 2017, bringing the total number to over 30,000.<\/p>  <p>  - The earnings of people with families, when transitioning from welfare to employment, will be  improved further by measures announced in the 2019 Budget. These include\u00a0increases to\u00a0the minimum wage, increased earnings thresholds on the Working Family Payment,\u00a0increases to the\u00a0income\u00a0disregard for lone parents\u00a0and increases to the qualified child allowance.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to disability supports, the national consultation process for \"early engagement\" and for reconfiguration of qualifying age for Domiciliary Care Allowance and Disability Allowance payments was conducted in July and is currently being considered for decision on next steps.\u00a0 A number of actions\u00a0in the Make Work Pay Report, specific to my Department,\u00a0have already been implemented, including: <\/p>  <p>  - Ensuring people with a long-term disability payment who have moved off the payment to\u00a0employment, retain their Free Travel Pass for a period of five years;<\/p>  <p>  - A \"fast-track\" reinstatement of Disability allowance, or Invalidity Pension for people where employment does not work out;<\/p>  <p>  - The\u00a0launch of a\u00a0new, easy-to-use \"benefit to work calculator\", to calculate the net benefit and financial implication of work. <\/p>  <p>  A preliminary approach to promoting access to the labour market for the adult dependents of jobseeker claimants focusing on jobless households is being piloted during 2018, with the project being initiated at the end of June in two pilot locations, Clondalkin and Dundalk. The Pilot focussed on trying to engage the adult dependant, educating them in relation to the supports and programmes that are available locally and free of cost to them. In addition the pilot aimed to inform the adult dependent that a dedicated case officer is available to them to assist them in availing of education supports and programmes. There will also be a continued focus on continuing to engage with the main claimant in the household through case managed activation supports.\u00a0 The findings of these initial pilots will inform the roll-out of additional projects in a further 8 locations across the country. These pilots are at an early stage of implementation and it is expected that pilots will be in place in all 10 divisions within the next four to six weeks. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor performance against reform actions and milestones outlined in the Action Plan\u00a0for Jobless Households. The Plan will be reviewed in 2020, in\u00a0line with a planned review of the Pathways to Work strategy.\u00a0 Implementation of the policy measures outlined in the Action Plan for Jobless Households should see the level of joblessness fall more rapidly than is already anticipated over the next few years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800054#WRM01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Occupational Injuries Benefit Applications","counter":716,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800054#WRM01700"},{"type":"question","counter":717,"qnumday":262,"qnumall":"[46150\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800054#WRM01800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of an application by a person (details supplied) for an occupational injury benefit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1237","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":718,"content":"<p>The Occupational Injury Benefit claim for the person concerned was disallowed.<\/p><p>The reason for this decision is based on the statement from\u00a0the person concerned, advising that he\u00a0first noticed\u00a0his\u00a0incapacity\u00a0before Christmas 2017.

It is, however, important to note that there will always be some people who do not get paid in any given week. This is due to issues such as\u00a0delays in receipt of claims and certificates, incorrectly completed certificates, human error, inconsistencies between the information submitted and the information already on file, the existence of another welfare payment for the main claimant or their dependants on the claim, all of which can lead to payments being suspended or delayed.

This model was designed to provide quicker access to payments for customers and also to greatly reduce the manual processing work involved in administering IB claims.\u00a0 Unfortunately, although the majority of customers continued to receive payments, there were a number of unanticipated difficulties and some IB customers&rsquo; payments were adversely affected with delays and missed payments.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The Department would like to sincerely apologise for the difficulties and frustration experienced by customers who did not receive the correct IB payment or who experienced delays in their payments. The Department has been working hard over the past few weeks, and is continuing to work, to resolve any outstanding issues\u00a0- allocating additional staff to IB claim work and developing a number of IT modifications to identify and rectify payment issues. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800054#WRM02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Illness Benefit Applications","counter":728,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800054#WRM02900"},{"type":"question","counter":729,"qnumday":266,"qnumall":"[46194\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800054#WRM03000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when a decision will be made on an application by a person (details supplied) for an illness benefit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1234","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":730,"content":"<p>The Illness Benefit claim for the person concerned is both certified and paid up\u00a0to 7th November 2018. <\/p><p>If the customer remains ill and unfit for work, a further medical certificate should be submitted to the Department as soon as possible in order for further payments to issue.\u00a0<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800054#WRM03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory)","counter":731,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800054#WRM03200"},{"type":"question","counter":732,"qnumday":267,"qnumall":"[46201\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800054#WRM03300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when changes will be made to introduce a home caring credit; when eligible recipients will be contacted; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1323","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":733,"content":"<p>On 23 January last, the Government\u00a0agreed to\u00a0allow pensioners, born on or after the 1st September 1946, affected by the 2012 changes in rate bands, to have their state pension (contributory)\u00a0entitlement calculated under\u00a0an interim\u00a0&ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA).\u00a0\u00a0The changes also\u00a0provide for\u00a0up to 20 years of home caring periods in the calculation of that entitlement,\u00a0for those who took time out of the workplace for parenting children under age 12, or\u00a0individuals who needed increased levels of care.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>The changes apply to those who reached pension age on or after 1 September 2012\u00a0 who were awarded less than maximum rate, on post Budget 2012 rate bands.\u00a0 The changes do not apply to anyone already entitled to\u00a0maximum rate state pension (contributory). <\/p>  <p>  Currently there are\u00a0approximately 79,000 pensioners in this category and my Department is now in the process of issuing Information Letters to\u00a0them.<\/p>  <p>  Work on examination of the social insurance records of the pensioners concerned commenced in September.\u00a0As social insurance records are\u00a0unique to\u00a0individual pensioners, this manual examination phase is expected to continue\u00a0to the end of the year.\u00a0To date, over\u00a0sixty\u00a0temporary staff members have been recruited\u00a0to work on this\u00a0phase.\u00a0 Further\u00a0recruitment will take place in January\u00a0 2019 when the first pension reviews are expected to get under way and it is anticipated that the first review outcomes will be notified to pensioners during Quarter 1 2019.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Payment of increases, where awarded, will be made immediately after an individual's review is completed.

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation for each property determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.<\/p>  <p>  The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Valuation Acts 2001-2015 and the making of valuations for rating purposes is his sole prerogative.  The statute does not accord the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government any function in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Legislative provision is made for the refund of rates paid on vacant commercial properties in certain circumstances.  The Local Government Act 1946 provides that where a property is unoccupied on the date of the making of the rate, the owner becomes liable for rates. However, the owner is entitled to a refund if the property is vacant for specified purposes, these being if the premises are unoccupied for the purpose of additions, alterations or repairs; where the owner is bona fide unable to obtain a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent; and where the premises are vacant pending redevelopment. The collection of rates and the determination of eligibility for a refund in this context are matters for each individual local authority. <\/p>  <p>  The Local Government Act 1946 provided that the owner was entitled to a 100% refund in most local authority areas.  Separate legislation governed refunds in the cities of Dublin, Limerick and Cork, where the same criteria for refunds applied but only 50% of the rates paid were refundable. <\/p>  <p>  With effect from 1 June 2014, when the relevant provision commenced, the Local Government Reform Act 2014 gives discretion to the elected members of individual local authorities to vary the level of rates refunds that apply in individual local electoral areas within the authority&rsquo;s administrative area. The Local Government (Financial and Audit Procedures) Regulations 2014 provide that the decision to alter the rate of refund should be taken at the annual budget meeting and that the rate of refund decided in respect of the relevant local electoral area shall apply to eligible persons for the year to which the budget relates. The absence of a decision to vary the refund means that the existing legislative provisions regarding the rate of refunds apply (either 100% or 50% as set out above).

As part of that process,  I am determined that cost rental homes become a major part of our rental landscape in the future, making a sustainable impact on housing affordability, national competitiveness, and the attractiveness of our main urban centres, as places to live as well as work. <\/p>  <p>  Cost rental makes up a very important element of housing systems in other cities but is a relatively new concept in Ireland. Therefore, in order to progress cost rental in Ireland, two cost rental pilot projects are being delivered on sites at Emmet Road, Inchicore, and at Enniskerry Road, Dundrum. The Emmet Road site can accommodate some 330 cost rental homes and the project is being delivered by Dublin City Council working with my Department. The Enniskerry Road site will deliver 50 cost rental homes and that project is a joint venture between two Approved Housing Bodies working with Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and the Housing Agency.<\/p>  <p>  Cost rental will initially be managed on an administrative basis and my Department is preparing a draft administrative cost rental scheme in collaboration with the Housing Agency and the local authorities involved in the pilot project. My Department is also leveraging the expertise and advisory services of the European Investment Bank.  The invaluable learning from these pathfinder projects will inform further cost rental projects to be rolled out across other suitable sites. In this regard, it is open to local authorities to pursue cost rental on appropriate sites and I would encourage them to examine this option. The National Development Finance Agency is assisting local authorities in this appraisal.  <\/p>  <p>  In order to support local authorities further to prepare their sites for affordable housing, including cost rental, the Government recently committed, under Budget 2019 to provide &euro;310 million under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) over the period 2019 to 2021. The funding is available for key facilitating infrastructure, on local authority sites, to support the provision of affordable homes to purchase or rent.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that local authorities identify the most appropriate development options for each of their sites, taking account of all of the available funding streams. For example, the site at Ballymastone, comprising approximately 36 hectares in local authority ownership, will be opened up for residential development as a result of the &euro;14.16 million funding awarded under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF). This LIHAF project, the Donabate distributor road, is due for completion in mid-2019.<\/p>  <p>Fingal County Council is proposing a mixed-tenure development for the area, with the capacity to accommodate approximately 1,200 homes. In this regard, the Council commenced the procurement process, via a competitive dialogue procedure, on 12 October. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Poolbeg site, in May 2016, the Government designated Poolbeg West as a Strategic Development Zone (SDZ) because of its potential to deliver a large proportion of the extra homes needed in the centre of Dublin. My Department is committed to working with the City Council and the receiver of the SDZ in order to secure additional social and affordable housing from this site over and above Part V obligations as laid out in the adopted planning scheme and I understand that the receiver is engaging with Dublin City Council on the development of the site. There is currently an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in relation to the Poolbeg SDZ planning scheme and the progress of development of the site will be dependent significantly on the nature and timing of the decision of the Board.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the new Land Development Agency (LDA) will contribute significantly to the delivery of affordable housing. All of the State land developed by the LDA will include 40% social and affordable homes to purchase or rent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800055#WRN05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Data","counter":825,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800055#WRN05300"},{"type":"question","counter":826,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[46344\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800055#WRN05400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of loan approvals for house purchases in each year since 1996; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":827,"content":"<p>My Department has published statistics on loan approvals for house purchases from 1970 to the end of 2016.

In guidance to Returning Officers, my Department has suggested that consideration should be given to providing suitable ramps in the case of polling stations that cannot be reached without negotiating steps;<\/p>  <p>- The requirement on Returning Officers to put in place arrangements to facilitate the marking and placing in the ballot box of ballot papers by wheelchair users. In guidance to Returning Officers, my Department has suggested the provision at each polling station of an appropriately located table and chair to facilitate this requirement;<\/p>  <p>- The requirement on Returning Officers to ensure, where practicable, that the place appointed for the counting of votes is accessible to wheelchair users. <\/p>  <p>  If an elector anticipates difficulty in gaining access to his or her polling station, he or she may apply in writing to the Returning Officer for authorisation to vote at another polling station in the same constituency. Furthermore, a person with a physical disability or illness which prevents him or her from going to the polling station can vote by post if he or she applies to be included in the postal voters list which is drawn up each year as part of the register of electors. A person residing in a hospital, nursing home or similar institution who has a physical disability or illness which prevents them from going to the polling station, can vote at the hospital or nursing home if they apply to be included in the special voters list which is drawn up each year as part of the register of electors. In order to be entered on the postal or special voters list, a person must apply to the appropriate local authority by 25 November each year. After that date, an application for inclusion on the supplement to the postal or special voters list may be made.<\/p>  <p>  Currently there are a number of options available to assist voters with a visual impairment, or who are otherwise so physically incapacitated or are unable to read or write to such an extent that they are unable to vote without assistance. They may avail of companion voting or they may seek the assistance of the Presiding Officer. In addition, in the referendum last May, my Department provided ballot paper templates for use by vision impaired voters for the first time. These are devices that can be attached to ballot papers to enable vision impaired voters to vote in secret. Having being introduced in May for the first time, the use of the ballot paper templates was continued in the recent presidential election and referendum.<\/p>  <p>  Other measures in place to assist such voters include the requirement to have on display at the polling station a large print version of the ballot paper and the inclusion of candidates' photographs and party emblems on the ballot paper.<\/p>  <p>   While comprehensive arrangements are in place to assist participation in the electoral process by individuals with physical disabilities, nonetheless my Department continues to seek to improve these arrangements and to have regard to the special needs of such persons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800055#WRN05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1265"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Approved Housing Bodies","counter":831,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800055#WRN05900"},{"type":"question","counter":832,"qnumday":302,"qnumall":"[46401\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018110800055#WRN06000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the status of the EUROSTAT classification of approved housing bodies as on balance sheet; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":833,"content":"<p>In April,\u00a0the Minister for\u00a0Finance published the Draft\u00a0Stability Programme Update (SPU) for 2018.
