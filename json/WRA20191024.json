to immediately address the problem of rapidly rising insurance premiums.\u00a0 Instead, a broad series of initiatives are required to address this problem.<\/p>  <p>  Consequently, the Government has brought forward a number of pieces of legislation, arising from recommendations of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.\u00a0 These include the following:<\/p>  <p>  - The Judicial Council Act 2019, which was enacted in July.\u00a0 This is a key piece of legislation in the context of insurance reform.\u00a0 It provides for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee, which will introduce new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum, following the formal establishment of the Judicial Council.\u00a0 It is now matter for the Judiciary to put in place the Judicial Council and to operationalise the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee;<\/p>  <p>  - The Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018, which has established the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank.\u00a0 This will increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance. \u00a0The CBI is due to make its first report by the end of 2019, and will also make recommendations to me regarding potentially expanding its scope to include employer and public liability insurance;<\/p>  <p>  - The Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019, which makes important reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, by strengthening its powers around compliance with its procedures; and,<\/p>  <p>  - Amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to align the timeframes by which claims should be notified to businesses with GDPR time limits on the keeping of CCTV footage to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected.\u00a0 These were introduced through the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the enquiry into having an Irish public body provide insurance for the business in question, even on a temporary basis, I do not believe that this would provide a solution to those businesses impacted. \u00a0Indeed, such an approach could actually decrease competition in the Irish insurance market, with insurers potentially deciding to cease insuring certain types of risks if there is a view that the State will insure these risks instead, particularly for lines of business which are considered to be unprofitable.\u00a0 This could in turn lead to a lack of choice for those seeking cover which could ultimately mean that the cost of insurance becomes even more expensive than it is now.\u00a0 Also, there is no reason to believe that the State would be any better at managing risks than private insurance companies, and as a result there potentially would be a large financial exposure to the State if significant losses were incurred.\u00a0 Finally, any State insurance scheme would be required to comply with the same prudential rules as private companies, thereby meaning that the cost of any insurance would still have to reflect the risk involved.\u00a0 In view of these factors, I am not convinced that a State-backed insurance scheme would be a panacea with regard to the cost or availability of insurance, either for small businesses or other categories of consumers.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I believe that this makes it more important that the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country are brought more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions.\u00a0 The establishment of the Judicial Council in the coming months is very important in this regard.\u00a0 This is why I allocated &euro;1 million in Budget 2020 to allow for this.\u00a0 While the Government cannot interfere in the judiciary&rsquo;s deliberations, I would expect that they will recognise the importance of this issue and prioritise its establishment accordingly and take account of the Personal Injuries Commission&rsquo;s findings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102400057#WRC03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"VAT Rate Application","counter":152,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102400057#WRC03800"},{"type":"question","counter":153,"qnumday":60,"qnumall":"[43922\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102400057#WRC03900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to change the VAT rate on food supplements as previously reported;

Shortly after the introduction of VAT, Revenue allowed the zero rate to be applied to certain food supplement products (vitamins, minerals and fish oils). This concessionary approach expanded as the market developed over the years and resulted in the zero rating by Revenue of further similar products, including products other than vitamins, minerals and fish oils. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has acknowledged that the scope of its concessionary approach broadened progressively over time to the point that it had become increasingly difficult to maintain an effective distinction between food supplement products that could benefit from the zero rate and those that were standard rated. Revenue acknowledges that this concessionary approach was unsatisfactory and led to diverging and inconsistent practices. There were continuous efforts by elements in the industry to expand its scope to include products that should be standard rated, including products claiming to enhance male fertility, promote hair growth, boost tanning, avoid a hangover and reduce stress.<\/p>  <p>  Following complaints from the Irish Health Trade Association (IHTA), Revenue conducted a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplement products, including getting an expert report on the definition of food for the purposes of the VAT Consolidation Act. The expert prepared a detailed, scientific report that concluded that food supplement products are not conventional food. Based on the expert report and its own legal analysis, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable. Following the review, Revenue engaged with my Department concerning policy options that might be considered in the context of Finance Bill 2018. The relevant legislation was not changed in Finance Bill 2018 and therefore Revenue issued new guidance in December 2018 which removed the concessionary zero rating of various food supplement products with effect from 1 March 2019. The removal of the concession will only apply on a prospective basis and will not be applied retrospectively by Revenue.<\/p>  <p>  Following representation from Deputies and from the industry, I wrote to Revenue outlining my plans to examine the policy and legislative options for the taxation of food supplement products in the context of Finance Bill 2019. Revenue responded by delaying the withdrawal of its concessionary zero rating of the food supplement products concerned. This allowed time for my Department to carry out a public consultation on the taxation of food supplement products. <\/p>  <p>  The public consultation ran from 18 April to 24 May 2019 and sought input from a wide range of interested parties, including from health and nutrition experts, the Minister for Health and the Health Products Regulatory Authority (&lsquo;HPRA&rsquo;). In total, 121 submissions were received. This included submissions from individuals, businesses, lobby groups and a political party. My officials also met with representatives from industry on several occasions in 2018 and 2019. The results of the public consultation in 2019 were included in the Tax Strategy Group paper on VAT published on my Department's website. The options set out in the TSG paper included maintaining the standard rate of VAT or introducing a reduced rate of VAT. <\/p>  <p>  I have decided to apply the reduced rate of VAT to all food supplement products.\u00a0 This means that from 1 January 2020, food supplement products which are currently liable at the standard rate of VAT of 23% would become liable to the reduced rate of VAT of 13.5%, while those currently concessionally zero rated will also become liable to the reduced rate rather than the standard rate.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It is important to clarify that foods for specific groups such as infant follow-on formulae and infant foods, foods for special medical purposes and specially formulated foods (e.g. total diet replacement for weight control) will continue to be zero rated as they are well established and defined categories of food that are essential for vulnerable groups of the population. Fortified foods, such as yoghurts and cereals fortified with vitamins and minerals, will also continue to be zero rated as they are food.<\/p>  <p>  Folic acid, vitamin and mineral human oral products which are licenced or authorised as medicines by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (&lsquo;HPRA&rsquo;) will continue to be zero rated under a different VAT provision for human oral medicines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102400057#WRC04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":155,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102400057#WRC04100"},{"type":"question","counter":156,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[43931\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102400057#WRC04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated cost of increasing the home carer&rsquo;s tax credit by &euro;100, &euro;200, &euro;300, &euro;400, &euro;500 and &euro;600, respectively.","asker":"1231","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":157,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the cost of increasing the Home Carer Tax Credit by the amounts requested by the Deputy are set out in the following table.

During this transition period, Union law shall be applicable to and in the United Kingdom. This means that, from a customs standpoint, there will be no checks during this period. <\/p>  <p>  It is only after the UK has left the EU that formal negotiations can commence on the future EU-UK economic relationship, based on the broad terms outlined in the Political Declaration. The Political Declaration contains the shared ambition to have a Future Trade Agreement with zero tariffs and quotas between the EU and the UK. Given that these negotiations have yet to commence, it would not be appropriate to comment on the nature of future checks that may be required. It is important to note however, that it is still the case that the UK is leaving the EU and this will bring change. It is important that Ireland is ready for that change, both for our citizens and out business, and our work to prepare for all scenarios surrounding the UK&rsquo;s exit continues.<\/p>  <p>  In planning for Brexit, Revenue had determined that in an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU, to include a transition period and the implementation of a Free Trade Agreement between the EU and UK, an additional 600 Revenue staff would be required. This was based on the introduction of\u00a0 customs formalities for East-West trade between Ireland and the UK. This recruitment was accelerated in preparation for a potential No Deal exit on 31 October. This requirement for an additional 600 staff remains Revenue&rsquo;s best estimate of the resources that will be required in the context of the current proposed Brexit deal to facilitate and support legitimate trade.<\/p>  <p>  In a Brexit context, the efficient flow of trade through our ports and airports is a key priority for the Government and various government departments and agencies have undertaken and continue to undertake significant preparations to facilitate this post-Brexit. During 2018, Revenue chaired an Inter-Departmental group which was established to consider the adequacy of port and airport infrastructure and facilities, post-Brexit. The group included representatives from Revenue; the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine (DAFM); the Department of Health; the HSE&rsquo;s Environmental Health Service (EHS); the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport (DTTS); the OPW; the Department of Justice; and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I am advised that the group considered the physical infrastructure requirements for both the &lsquo;Central Case&rsquo; and the &lsquo;no-deal&rsquo; scenarios to facilitate and support the movement of legitimate trade. This included the requirements of Revenue; DAFM; and the HSE&rsquo;s EHS; to carry out any necessary customs interventions and Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) checks at ports and airports as a result of Brexit.\u00a0 The group identified that infrastructure was required at Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort and Dublin Airport and agreed proposals on the nature and scale of new or extended facilities that would be required. The Office of Public Works (OPW) are responsible for the delivery of the necessary infrastructure. Temporary facilities are in place for 31 October 2019 in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

This included, at Box 4, an assessment of the macroeconomic outlook that would apply in the event of an agreed exit by the UK at end October. <\/p>  <p>  The Withdrawal Agreement endorsed by the European Council, will now require ratification by the European Parliament and the British Parliament. Pending ratification of the deal, it is not possible to say if the outlook will be different to that set out in Budget 2020. <\/p>  <p>  If the Withdrawal Agreement is ratified, the UK will enter a transition period until at least the end of 2020. In this situation the outlook would be broadly similar to that set out in Table 4 (Box 4) in the Economic and Fiscal Outlook. This shows that, in the event of an agreed exit, GDP growth is forecast to be 3.1 per cent in 2020, with employment growth projected at 1.7 per cent next year and the unemployment rate expected to be 5.1 per cent. <\/p>  <p>  Until there is greater clarity on the post-transition relationship there is likely to be continued uncertainty, particularly with respect to private sector investment. There are a range of possible future relationships, ranging from a free trade agreement (of which there could be many forms), or a trading relationship under World Trade Organisation (WTO) frameworks. The impact of these have been modelled and estimated earlier this year in joint research by the Department of Finance and ESRI. Over the medium-term (i.e. 5 years) the level of GDP would be of the order of between 1.9 and 3.3 per cent lower, compared to a situation where the UK remains in the EU. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor developments with respect to the ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, and the future relationship with the UK, and will update the macroeconomic and fiscal projections to take account of any developments in the Spring. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102400058#WRD02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Central Bank of Ireland Investigations","counter":194,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102400058#WRD02100"},{"type":"question","counter":195,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[44157\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102400058#WRD02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Central Bank has officially commenced an investigation into whether dual pricing by the insurance industry complies with the consumer protection code and the law;

As set out in this table, before taking account of certain Brexit related costs of &euro;1.2 billion and timing related cash costs of &euro;169 million, the overall increase in core voted expenditure on public services and infrastructure in 2020 is estimated at &euro;3,371 million. After taking account of discretionary revenue measures of over &euro;0.4 billion, this results in a net budgetary package of over &euro;2.9 billion.\u00a0 This compares to the projected budgetary package of &euro;2.8 billion set out in the Summer Economic Statement. <\/p>  <p>  The Brexit related expenditure of &euro;1.2 billion is made up of:<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;650 million to support the sectors identified as most affected by Brexit;\u00a0Agriculture, Enterprise and Tourism, and to help stabilise the worst affected regions;<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;365 million in Social Protection expenditure on the Live Register and Related schemes;<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;45 million for Labour market activation supports; and<\/p>  <p>  - a further amount of &euro;160 million, relative to the Revised Estimates Volume 2019, to ensure that the staff, facilities and infrastructure are in place at Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort and Dublin Airport to allow for the necessary compliance checks to be carried out by the regulatory agencies.<\/p>  <p>  As the risk of a disorderly Brexit increased, preparations for essential compliance checks by our regulatory agencies that would be required in the event of a disorderly Brexit were accelerated, with recruitment of additional staff and development of facilities and infrastructure. Consequently, as outlined in Table 1 on page 24 of Expenditure Report 2020, &euro;51 million of the estimated costs, primarily related to staff required to carry out compliance checks at the ports and airport, are included in the departmental Budget Estimates for 2020. The allocation of the balance of funding in relation to facilities and infrastructure for compliance checks will be assessed taking into account the up to date Brexit position, including the expected form of the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union and future relationship. <\/p>  <p>  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the sectoral expenditure of &euro;650 million will be released in multiple tranches. Adopting a multi-tranche approach to expenditure management of required Brexit policy is prudent as it helps to facilitate responses to a wide range of possible Brexit impacts, which may take time to fully materialise.<\/p>  <p>  The additional funding for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection would also be made available in the event of a no-deal Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  As part of normal budgetary processes the allocation of these additional funds would either be provided in the allocations set out in the Revised Estimates Volume; included as Further Revised Estimates; or allocated via Supplementary Estimates, as may be appropriate in each case. <\/p>  <p>  Of course, mitigating the effects of Brexit has been a feature not just of Budget 2020, but over the last three years as well.

An allocation of &euro;1.76 billion has been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for 2019. I am also pleased to have secured an overall increase of &euro;122 million to increase An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's budget to an unprecedented &euro;1.882 billion for next year. Very significant capital investment is also being made, including investment of &euro;342 million in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is primarily responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Furthermore, decisions in relation to the provision and allocation of Garda equipment and resources, including ICT resources and the networking of Garda stations, are matters for the Garda Commissioner in light of availability of resources and identified operational demands.  As Minister, I have no direct role in the matter.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that broadband networks and services are used to connect stations to the Garda network for official purposes. All of the connections to the Garda stations are managed in the telecommunications branch of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure the speed of the network connection meets the requirements of the particular location.<\/p>  <p>  There are 565 Garda stations in the State.

HIQA is an independent authority established to drive high-quality and safe care for health and social care services in Ireland. HIQA&rsquo;s mandate extends across a range of public, private and voluntary sector services. Reporting to the Minister for Health and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, HIQA&rsquo;s role is to develop standards, inspect and review health and social care services and support informed decisions on how services are delivered.<\/p>  <p>  HIQA operates under the Health Act 2007, which sets out the functions which the Authority is to carry out. HIQA has responsibility for setting standards for healthcare services, and monitoring compliance with those standards. It also regulates facilities providing care for the elderly and those with disabilities, and\u00a0has a role with regard to inspecting some of the social care services which are accessed by children\u00a0to determine if they are meeting the relevant National Standards.\u00a0 In addition, it undertakes functions in relation to Health Information and Health Technology Assessment. <\/p>  <p>  Section 9 of the Act sets out the grounds under which HIQA may undertake an investigation into a particular service, or may be requested to undertake such an investigation by the Minister for Health. <\/p>  <p>  The Act provides HIQA with the power to set standards for the healthcare services delivered by the HSE, and then to undertake monitoring programmes to assess compliance with these standards. In this regard, HIQA published the National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare in 2012; they represent the overarching standard which public health services are expected to meet. Flowing from these themes, HIQA have also developed standards for particular services, e.g. National Standards for the prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections in acute healthcare services. HIQA has in turn conducted a thematic inspection programme against these standards since 2012, which has resulted in the publication of over 300 reports of inspection visits to date. In addition, HIQA has also undertaken thematic inspection programmes in relation to nutrition and hydration in acute hospitals, and in relation to medication safety. <\/p>  <p>  In such cases, HIQA typically undertakes both announced and unannounced inspections of healthcare facilities in order to ascertain the degree of adherence to expected standards. A report of the inspection visit will subsequently be published on HIQA&rsquo;s website, and frequently attracts media attention. In cases where remedial action is required, depending on the severity of the risk identified, HIQA may draw the matter to the attention of hospital management during the inspection and request an immediate response, or in less severe cases, will raise the issue in writing. In either case, an appropriate management response would be expected. <\/p>  <p>  Further standards also continue to be developed i.e. most recently the National Standards for Safer Better Maternity Services and National Standards for the Conduct of Review of Patient Safety Incidents.<\/p>  <p>  The Patient Safety Licensing Bill, in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy, will see HIQA become the licensing authority for all hospitals and certain designated activities. The Bill will, for the first time, introduce a licensing requirement for all hospitals, public and private, and certain designated high risk activities in the community.\u00a0It\u00a0was approved by Government in December 2017 and underwent pre-legislative scrutiny at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health\u00a0on 13\u00a0June 2018.<\/p>  <p>  HIQA will be the licensing body, with statutory powers to require hospitals to undertake improvements and the authority to remove a licence from a service which is failing to meet required standards.<\/p>  <p>  In advance of a formal licensing regime for public and private hospitals it is proposed that the Patient Safety Bill will bring the private\/independent healthcare sector within the remit of the Health Act 2007. The proposed bill will extend HIQA&rsquo;s powers to set and monitor standards, and undertake investigations, where necessary, to the private acute hospital sector. The Patient Safety Bill underwent Pre-Legislative Scrutiny at the Oireachtas Health Committee on 26 September 2018.\u00a0 Officials of my Department and the OPC are continuing to progress this legislation.\u00a0 It is expected that the Patient Safety Bill will be brought to Cabinet next month.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0It should also\u00a0be noted that HIQA is now responsible for the regulation of medical exposure to ionising radiation. This follows\u00a0my signing of the\u00a0new Statutory Instrument 256\/2018 on 9th January last governing the regulation of medical exposures to ionising radiation.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  HIQA\u00a0was designated to take on the responsibilities of the &ldquo;Competent Authority&rdquo; for Medical Ionizing Radiation, as required by European Directive 2013\/59\/Euratom. These functions formerly resided with the HSE, however the transfer of responsibility was required in order to ensure Ireland complied\u00a0with the European regulations. Such a move was also recommended by the International Atomic Agency in its review of Irish regulatory practice in this area. <\/p>  <p>  I have set out above the current responsibilities of HIQA, and the additional roles it is\u00a0expected to acquire in the coming period. However, I\u00a0can also assure the Deputy that HIQA's role and remit will continue to be kept\u00a0under review by my Department.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102400062#WRH01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Data","counter":469,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102400062#WRH01900"},{"type":"question","counter":470,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[43933\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102400062#WRH02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of occupational therapists employed in the south Kildare NDT team; if additional personnel will be employed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":471,"qnumday":175,"qnumall":"[43934\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102400062#WRH02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of speech and language therapists employed in the south Kildare NDT team; if additional personnel will be employed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":472,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[43935\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102400062#WRH02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of psychologists employed in the south Kildare NDT team; if additional personnel will be employed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":473,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 174 to 176, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

The Plan targets a 30% increase in production derived from onshore close containment\u00a0recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). Considerable international developmental effort is being put into land based RAS systems. A number of technological challenges need to be overcome to make RAS economically viable. <\/p>  <p>  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara funded a 2015 study by the Irish Salmon Growers Association &lsquo;Potential for Land Based Salmon Growout in Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS) in Ireland&rsquo;. The report describes in detail all technical aspects of RAS production and system design and operations. It also covers important biological aspects of land based salmon production. <\/p>  <p>  As part of my Department&rsquo;s &euro;240 million European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme, an aquaculture Knowledge Gateway Scheme is being implemented by BIM.\u00a0 In close collaboration with aquaculture enterprises and researchers, the Scheme aims to develop knowledge, innovation and technology in the aquaculture sector to ensure its sustainable development. An important part of the focus of the Scheme will be the applied research and development on RAS identified in the National Strategic Plan. This may take the form of applied research undertaken by BIM on behalf of the sector or initiatives from industry operators or research institutions. Universities and Institutes of Technology can avail of 100% grants up to a value of &euro;500,000 under the Knowledge Gateway Scheme to conduct research, studies and trials into RAS technology, while aquaculture enterprises can receive grants of 50% with a value of up to &euro;200,000. <\/p>  <p>  To further incentivise RAS developments, I made 50% grants up to value of &euro;1 million available to aquaculture enterprises under the EMFF Sustainable Aquaculture Scheme for capital investment in commercial RAS developments.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In 2019, BIM is continuing its research into Recirculating Aquaculture Multitrophic Pond Systems (RAMPS), which has been underway since 2016, funded through a number of EMFF grants under the Knowledge Gateway Scheme.\u00a0 RAMPS is a novel production method developed by BIM. The system involves utilising cutaway peatlands and poor agricultural land for freshwater fish production.

The Bill also provides an opportunity to update the definition of the SOLAS Convention in primary legislation, which will enable Ireland to make the necessary statutory instruments to give\u00a0effect to the latest amendments to the Convention. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, under Port State Control, foreign ships in national ports are inspected to verify that the condition of the ship and its equipment complies with the requirements of international conventions (including the SOLAS Convention) and that the ship is manned and operated in compliance with those conventions.<\/p>  <p>  Port State Control inspections are carried out by the Marine Survey Office (MSO) of my Department while Flag State activities are undertaken by both the MSO and by authorised Recognised Organisations on their behalf.<\/p>  <p>  As regards the transposition of the\u00a0named EU Directives, I can confirm that Directive 2013\/53\/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 November 2013 on recreational craft and personal watercraft (or the \"EU Recreational Craft Directive\") was transposed into Irish law through S.I.

together.<\/p><p>The total annual cost of providing income-assessed subsidies for children between the ages of 3 and 15 years in receipt of the National Childcare Scheme is estimated at &euro;95.9m.<\/p><p>The costs are arrived at by:<\/p><p>- establishing the number of families with children under 15 years by income bracket (data supplied by CSO) and<\/p><p>- profiling these families by reference to the age of their children and<\/p><p>- estimating the proportion of children in each income bracket and age range using centre-based care and <\/p><p>- calculating estimated subsidy rates based on income levels and age profile and<\/p><p>- applying estimates of the average hours used by age group for term time and non-term time and<\/p><p>- Limiting the dataset to the relevant cohort identified by the Deputy.<\/p><p>The scheme&rsquo;s cost model is based on key assumptions around behaviours and rates of growth, with certain metrics extrapolated from available data. As such, all estimates remain heavily caveated insofar as the scheme represents a considerable departure from existing schemes and this renders estimates inherently challenging to predict. It is particularly difficult to estimate the behavioural changes that will come by creating drastic increases in the level of subsidy available.<\/p><p>With regard to the analyses set out below relating to increases to subsidy rates, it should be noted that substantial increases in childcare capacity would be required to meet the likely demand created by increasing the total subsidy payment, particularly at the higher end. <\/p><p>The existing maximum subsidy rates for a 1-3 year old is &euro;4.35 per hour.

AIM is a child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child and the preschool service. <\/p><p>Under Level 7 of AIM, preschool providers, in partnership with parents, can apply for additional capitation to fund extra support in the preschool room or to enable the reduction of the adult-to-child ratio. Where additional capitation is given to fund extra support in the preschool room, the preschool manager is responsible for recruiting a member of staff to take on this role.<\/p><p>The Better Start Early Years Specialist Service within Pobal administers AIM Level 7 on behalf of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. Where there is a delay in recruitment of staff to provide AIM Level 7 support, service providers must complete the &lsquo;Notification of Change&rsquo; form and submit this to Pobal.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Pobal has advised that data is available for the 2018\/19 and 2019\/20 (to date) preschool years on services which have been approved for AIM Level 7 support to support a child or children to access preschool, but who have informed Pobal that they have been unable to recruit suitable staff. Pobal has advised that the total number of preschool services who have notified them that they have been unable to recruit suitable staff to provide AIM Level 7 support is seven over the two years (six in 2018-19 and one to date in 2019-20).<\/p><p>It is important to note that in the small number of instances where a level 7 support is not available, the child and service provider will still be able to avail of supports under Levels 1,2,3,4,5 and 6 of AIM.\u00a0<\/p><p>Children are entitled to two years&rsquo; of free preschool under the ECCE programme. Where a child has availed of AIM Level 7 in their first year of preschool, the preschool provider can submit a second year extension request for the child to avail of AIM Level 7 support in their second year of preschool.\u00a0<\/p><p>Pobal data on Level 7 supports is broken down as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>-<\/th>       <th>2018\/2019<\/th>       <th>2019\/2020 (as of 18th October 2019)<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total AIM   Level 7 applications approved (including second year   extensions)<\/td>       <td>3,924<\/td>       <td>3,464<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total AIM Level   7 applications approved (including second year   extensions) where the preschool   service has notified Pobal it is   unable to recruit suitable staff<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>Recruitment of staff has been a significant challenge to many services in recent years. Other than poor terms and conditions which impact retention, this is believed to be mostly due to the major expansion that has occurred in the sector which included a doubling of investment and a doubling of the number of early learning and care and school age childcare places. <\/p><p>The Pobal Sector Profile data is showing\u00a0 that, now that capacity has been doubled, the growth rates are levelling off although we expect that the further budgetary increase for 2020 will continue to support\u00a0further growth in capacity. Turnover of staff has reduced by approx. 3.5% over the last two years. <\/p><p>A number of factors\u00a0should begin to see the recruitment difficulties being experienced lessening over time. First 5:\u00a0A Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families (2019-2028),\u00a0was published in November 2018.\u00a0\u00a0First 5\u00a0identifies over 150 actions across the domains that impact on young children&rsquo;s lives, including ambitious and far reaching actions related to the Early Learning and Care (ELC) sector. First 5\u00a0commits to at least doubling investment in ELC by 2028 and a key vehicle to ensure that such significant additional investment delivers for children, families and the State will be a new Funding Model.<\/p><p>The intention with the new Funding Model is to design mechanisms to deliver additional funding to ELC and School Age Childcare providers to ensure greater levels of affordability, quality and inclusion in their services.\u00a0 It is planned that the new Funding Model will operate in addition to the major funding streams for the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) universal preschool programme and the National Childcare Scheme, when it comes into operation later this year.<\/p><p>The new Funding Model will be a key vehicle to achieve the vision of ELC services that are equipped to provide high-quality, graduate-led services for children, affordability to parents and sustainability for providers. ELC services that operate in the context of disadvantage will also receive extra support to provide additional services to families.<\/p><p>Alongside the new Funding Model, work has also begun on a Workforce Development Plan (WDP), which will ensure appropriate levels of Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School Age Childcare (SAC) staff at all levels in the sector. The Workforce Development Plan will aim to help to address recruitment\u00a0\u00a0difficulties by establishing role profiles, career pathways, qualifications requirements and associated policy mechanisms. The Workforce Development Plan will set out plans to raise the profile of careers in Early Learning and Care\u00a0 and School Age Childcare, establishing a career framework and leadership development opportunities and work towards a more gender-balanced and diverse workforce.<\/p><p>The Workforce Development Plan will be carried out in two stages. The first stage will involve preparation of a core report that sets out a high-level vision for the Early Learning and Care (ELC)\u00a0 and School Age Childcare (SAC) workforce for the period 2020-2028 and a pathway for achieving the commitments set out in First 5:\u00a0A Whole-of-Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families (2019-2028),\u00a0in relation to development of the ELC and SAC workforce. It will include qualification requirements for different roles in the sector, including ELC, SAC, and childminders. This stage is expected to conclude by mid- 2020. The second stage of the Workforce Development Plan will involve completion of implementation plans by working groups to be specified in Stage 1. Stage two of the plan is expected to be completed by mid-2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102400066#WRM01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Living Wage","counter":740,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102400066#WRM01400"},{"type":"question","counter":741,"qnumday":272,"qnumall":"[43951\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102400066#WRM01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the estimated cost of providing the living wage of &euro;12.30 to every member of staff in her Department and agencies under her aegis.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":742,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, any adjustments to the salaries of public and civil servants are set out in the Public Service Stability Agreement (PSSA) 2018-2020.<\/p><p>A suggested living wage of &euro;12.30 per hour would equate to an annual salary of &euro;23,747, based on a standard civil service net working week of 37 hours.

These Regulations transpose the EU Birds Directive and the EU Habitats Directive into national law, and provide for protection of certain habitats and species across the European Union, giving a framework for specific measures to be taken to target areas of concern in each Member State. The main instruments provided for are the designation of Special Protection Areas (SPA), aimed at the protection of threatened species of birds, and Special Areas of Conservation (SAC), aimed at protecting other animal species and habitats. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is also responsible for developing and publishing Ireland's National Biodiversity Action Plan. To further the implementation of the Plan, and to mainstream biodiversity within national policy, an interdepartmental Biodiversity Working Group\u00a0was established in 2012, drawn from 18 Government Departments and Agencies. Members have responsibilities for sectors where activities can have a direct impact on biodiversity or where there are opportunities for changes in the management of environmental resources that can support biodiversity policy formation. These sectors include strategic and land use planning, agriculture and forestry, marine and freshwater fisheries, the management and monitoring of water and environmental quality, and the provision of transport and energy infrastructure. In addition, there are Government Departments or Agencies with responsibility for sectors where there are opportunities for synergies between biodiversity protection and community development, education or health.<\/p>  <p>  The National Biodiversity Data Centre (NBDC) is the name given to a programme established by the Heritage Council in 2006. It addresses the need identified by the Council that data on Ireland&rsquo;s biodiversity be collected recorded and fully accessible to the public. The programme has been operated under two publically tendered contracts entered into between the Council and Compass Informatics - a private company. The team working on biodiversity data collection are employees of Compass Informatics a wholly owned subsidiary of Tracsis plc. The Heritage Council is currently finalising a contract extension with Compass Informatics to collect biodiversity data into 2020. Concurrently, a review is being undertaken by the Council. This is examining the governance, operating and financial models underpinning this important work. The outcome of that review will inform the next request for tender. Like all public contracts, this work is subject to public procurement rules. The Heritage Council&rsquo;s contract with Compass Informatics has been very important in the collection of biodiversity data for public policymaking and decision making.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102400069#WRP04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Parks Projects","counter":987,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102400069#WRP04500"},{"type":"question","counter":988,"qnumday":360,"qnumall":"[43927\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102400069#WRP04600","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"her plans with respect to the creation of a Liffey valley national park; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":989,"content":"<p>The National Parks\u00a0and Wildlife Service\u00a0of\u00a0my Department manages an extensive conservation and recreational property portfolio\u00a0of\u00a0some 87,000 hectares. Our 6\u00a0National Parks\u00a0account for circa 65,000 hectares with another almost 22,000 hectares\u00a0of\u00a0nature reserves and other heritage sites. The\u00a0existing\u00a0National Parks\u00a0are managed from a conservation perspective, and attract in excess\u00a0of 4 million visitors annually.<\/p>  <p>  Given\u00a0the\u00a0resources available for capital investment within our\u00a0National Parks\u00a0and Nature Reserves, I am ever mindful\u00a0of the\u00a0need to focus on\u00a0the\u00a0core responsibilities relating to\u00a0the\u00a0management\u00a0of the\u00a0existing\u00a0Parks\u00a0and Reserves lands and have no plans at present to\u00a0increase the number of National Parks\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0country.<\/p>  <p>  However, as part\u00a0of\u00a0my Department&rsquo;s continuing commitment and contribution to protecting our heritage and improving our tourism and recreation product, we have been exploring ways to optimise\u00a0the\u00a0sustainable potential\u00a0of\u00a0heritage sites under our control in a way that is compatible with conservation objectives.<\/p>  <p>  In this context, it should be noted that in late 2016 my Department negotiated\u00a0the\u00a0extension\u00a0of\u00a0Wicklow Mountains\u00a0National Park\u00a0by purchasing almost 4,900 acres\u00a0of\u00a0Dublin Uplands at Glenasmole in 2016 at a cost\u00a0of\u00a0&euro;800,000.\u00a0The\u00a0purchase underpins\u00a0the\u00a0Government&rsquo;s on-going commitment to\u00a0the preservation\u00a0of\u00a0our natural heritage for future generations\u00a0of\u00a0citizens and visitors alike to enjoy.<\/p>  <p>  In 2017 the entire Wild Nephin area was consolidated into the ownership of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. This creates a State &ndash; Owned wilderness project of over 11,000 hectares and aims to provide increased nature conservation benefits and biodiversity as well as \u00a0enhanced recreational and social benefits through the &lsquo;re-wilding&rsquo; of the forest which adjoins the National Park. Thanks to the acquisition, we will be returning the area to a natural wilderness state.<\/p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, launched a strategic partnership in 2017 with a view to growing tourism revenues in\u00a0the\u00a0rural areas where\u00a0the parks\u00a0are located and\u00a0increasing\u00a0Ireland&rsquo;s appeal as a recreation destination.\u00a0 One of the outputs from the partnership with F&aacute;ilte was &ldquo;Experiencing the Wild Heart of Ireland&rdquo;; an interpretative masterplan for the development of our National Parks and Reserves, which was published last year and sets out a road map for investment at these important nature conservation, public amenity and tourism sites and underpins the objectives of Project 2040.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The investment in our National Parks will create memorable and meaningful experiences of Ireland&rsquo;s landscapes, wildlife and culture. This will be done though sensitive design and the development of authentic experiences, providing better access to nature and an increased understanding of society&rsquo;s conservation responsibilities, as well as supporting significant investment in recreational facilities including upgrading and development of the trails network,increased visitor facilities and improved signage and branding. These will be designed and delivered with a strong emphasis on conservation and allow us protect and preserve our most fragile environments and investing in our culture, language &amp;amp; heritage provide a well-being benefit for all.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, a provision of some &euro;5million in funding, for 32 individual projects across the network of NPWS sites, was announced earlier this year as part of the Rural Regeneration Development Fund.  So while I have no plans to expand the Park network at present, my Department is actively ensuring the preservation, protection and presentation of the assets we already own.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102400069#WRP04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Feabhs&uacute; C&eacute;ibheanna","counter":990,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102400069#WRP04800"},{"type":"question","counter":991,"qnumday":361,"qnumall":"[44006\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102400069#WRP04900","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"c&eacute;n dul chun cinn at&aacute; d&eacute;anta maidir le hathfhorbairt na c&eacute; in Inis O&iacute;rr; c&eacute;n staid ag a bhfuil an togra seo faoi l&aacute;thair; c&eacute;n uair a bhfuil s&uacute;il aici go mbeifear in ann tairiscint&iacute; a lorg don togra; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&iacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1312","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":992,"content":"<p>Mar is eol don Teachta, t&aacute; forbairt Ch&eacute; Inis O&iacute;rr san &aacute;ireamh\u00a0ar liosta na dtogra&iacute; at&aacute;\u00a0le forbairt faoi\u00a0Thionscadail &Eacute;ire 2040.<\/p>  <p>  T&aacute; oifigigh mo Roinne agus Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe ag obair i dtreo leagan cr&iacute;ochn&uacute;il den ch&aacute;s gn&oacute; i leith an togra a fhorbairt faoi r&eacute;ir th&eacute;arma&iacute; an Ch&oacute;d Chaiteachais Phoibl&iacute; faoi l&aacute;thair.\u00a0\u00a0T&aacute;thar ag\u00a0s&uacute;il go mbeidh cr&iacute;och leis an bpr&oacute;iseas sin go luath.\u00a0\u00a0Agus an c&aacute;s gn&oacute;\u00a0a bheith faofa,\u00a0is &iacute; an c&eacute;ad c&eacute;im eile sa phr&oacute;iseas n&aacute; tairiscint&iacute; a lorg don obair.\u00a0 Beidh gach c&eacute;im d'fhorbairt na c&eacute; seo\u00a0le meas i gcomhth&eacute;acs an tsol&aacute;thair airgid at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il do mo Roinn agus faoi r&eacute;ir na bhfor&aacute;lacha at&aacute; san &aacute;ireamh i gC&oacute;d Caiteachais Phoibl&iacute; an Rialtais.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102400069#WRP05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1314"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Deontais faoi &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta","counter":993,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102400069#WRP05100"},{"type":"question","counter":994,"qnumday":362,"qnumall":"[44012\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102400069#WRP05200","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"c&eacute;ard iad na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; a fuair airgead &oacute; &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta le ceithre bliana anuas as an gciste a chuireann s&iacute; ar f&aacute;il do Chomharchumainn agus d&rsquo;Eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; Pobalbhunaithe; c&eacute; mh&eacute;ad a fuair gach eagra&iacute;ocht gach bliain; c&eacute;n uair a mbeidh a fhios acu c&eacute;n deontas a bheidh ar f&aacute;il do 2020; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&iacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1312","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":995,"content":"<p>Mar go bhfuil\u00a0r&eacute;imse leathan faisn&eacute;ise\u00a0iarrtha ag an Teachta, tuigfidh s&eacute; nach f&eacute;idir\u00a0&iacute; a chur le ch&eacute;ile laistigh den amsc&aacute;la at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il.
