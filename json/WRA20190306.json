My Department is also continuing to work with stakeholders to further develop policy in this regard at post-primary level.<\/p>  <p>  Following the April 2018 announcement of the establishment of 42 new schools from 2019 to 2022, my Department has developed a new Online Patronage Process System, which provides objective information and allows parents to express their preferences in relation to the patronage and language of instruction, i.e. Irish or English, of these new schools.   Parental preferences, as well as other considerations such as the extent of diversity of provision in an area (including Irish-medium provision), are key to the decision-making process.<\/p>  <p>  This has resulted in patronage of three of the 13 primary schools to be established in 2019 being awarded to An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta as Irish-medium Gaelscoileanna in the Booterstown_Blackrock; Drumcondra_Marino_Dublin 1; and Maynooth school planning areas.<\/p>  <p>  The scope for expansion of existing Irish-medium schools that are located near to the other 10 areas will also be assessed and my Department will be engaging with An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta in respect of same.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, a new post-primary Gaelchol&aacute;iste will be established in Maynooth in September 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has been in communication with Gaeloideachas and other stakeholders in relation to the development of Aonaid, most recently at a meeting on December 13th 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The 20 year Strategy also includes a commitment to assessing the demand for increased provision for Irish-medium schools as part of the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity Process.  In this regard, an opportunity is available to English-medium schools seeking to make a transition to Irish-medium provision, in line with the expressed wishes of parents and the local school community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600043#WRB00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":9,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600043#WRB00350"},{"type":"question","counter":10,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[10858\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600043#WRB00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when a new school (details supplied) in County Donegal will move to build stage; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":11,"content":"<p>The brief for the major building project for the school to which the Deputy refers is to provide a new 3 storey 24 classroom school with ancillary accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  This project at an advanced stage of architectural planning Stage 2b (Detailed Design), which includes the application for statutory approvals and the preparation of tender documents.

Legal advice provided to that Department also indicated that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.<\/p><p>Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement the remaining sections of the EPSEN Act have not recently been conducted. The level of additional expenditure required would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis. Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who might currently qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. <\/p><p>In 2018 my Department invested over &euro;1.75 Billion in this area - 1\/5 of my Department's budget and up 42% since 2011, at which point &euro;1.24 Billion was invested.

The Department of Education and Skills Inspectorate's advice is that the majority of schools are now using some form of individual education planning for children with special needs.

My Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland are involved in an energy efficient retrofit pilot scheme for schools since 2017.

The longer-term outcome of the pilot will be to create an accurate and scalable model for energy efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland.

On the 9th September, a large force of Katangese Gendarmerie surrounded them and early on the morning of the 13th September \"A\" Company came under attack. From the 13th to the 17th September they endured almost continuous attack. They were taken into captivity on the 17th September and remained in captivity until finally released on the 25th October 1961.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with Defence Forces regulations the award of medals for bravery is time bound. These may not be awarded in any case unless a recommendation is made through the usual channels to the Chief of Staff, not later than two years in the case of the Military Medal for Gallantry, and not later than four years in the case of the Distinguished Service Medal, after the performance of the act in respect of which the recommendation is made. Such awards are made on the recommendation of a Military Board appointed by the Chief of Staff for the purpose of examining and reporting on every recommendation for an award.  <\/p>  <p>  The issue of the award of medals to the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion was comprehensively addressed in 1965. A properly constituted Medals Board considered the various cases presented and made a decision that no medals would be awarded. The Chief of Staff of the day considered the decision of the Board and was satisfied with the findings. Subsequently at that time, the question was raised again in a letter to a newly appointed Chief of Staff. He forwarded the letter to the original Medals Board and asked that they reconvene and review their decision. The Board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings.  <\/p>  <p>  Over the past number of years various representations have been received in my Department outlining the courage and bravery of \"A\" Company. All representations have been considered and responded to acknowledging their valiant actions while under siege in Jadotville.   <\/p>  <p>  A review was conducted in 2004 by military officers for the purpose of a broader examination of the Jadotville case. This Board recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion be given recognition. In this context, a number of measures have taken place to honour and to commemorate the events at Jadotville and the very significant contribution of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and of the 35th Battalion, as a whole, to the UN Peace Support Mission in the Congo.<\/p>  <p>  Recognition of their contribution over the years include: <\/p>  <p>  A. A presentation of scrolls to \"A\" Company in 2006. <\/p>  <p>  B. Portraits of Lt Col McNamee (35th Battalion Commander) and Comdt Quinlan (Company Commander &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company) were commissioned in 2006. <\/p>  <p>  C. In July of 2010 the 50th anniversary of the first deployment to the Congo was commemorated in a highly publicised and well attended event in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. <\/p>  <p>  D. A nominal roll of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, printed in copper, was affixed to the monument in Costume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th Anniversary of the Jadotville affair in September 2011. <\/p>  <p>  E. On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, I decided to issue a Unit Citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company. This was the first time a Unit Citation was awarded within the Defence Forces and I was delighted to be able to formally recognise the brave actions of these men.  <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, on 13th June 2017, the Government decided, as an exceptional step, to award a medal known as &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Jadotville Medal&rdquo; to each member of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and to the family representatives of deceased members to give full and due recognition in honour of their courageous actions at the Siege of Jadotville.  This medal presentation ceremony took place on 2nd December 2017 in Custume Barracks, Athlone.  This location is considered the spiritual home of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and it is from here that &ldquo;A&rdquo; company assembled in advance of their fateful deployment to the Congo.   <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the events and happenings to date properly honour the collective bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo;

Specific activities included advertisements on social media platforms, print ads, press releases and attendance at relevant promotional events, as well as participation by the Director of the Passport Service in over 25 interviews on regional radio stations. <\/p><p>- In Q4 2018 the service was expanded to include online renewal of children&rsquo;s passports, a passport card for children and a wider cohort of adults eligible to renew online.\u00a0 This expanded service means that all Irish citizens can now renew their passports online 24\/7 from anywhere in the world. My Department ran a three week public information campaign\u00a0including advertisements on social media platforms, print ads and radio ads. The success of this campaign has led to a significant increase in online renewal applications in Q1 2019.  <\/p><p>- The direct costs of online and social media advertising to raise public awareness in this regard are set out in Table 1 below.  <\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s Campaign for Election to the UN Security Council <\/p><p>- On July 2nd2018, the Taoiseach and I publicly launched Ireland&rsquo;s campaign to secure a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in June 2020 for the 2021-2022 term. Ireland&rsquo;s campaign is premised on three themes: Empathy, Partnership and Independence. To coincide with this launch, my Department used social media platforms to promote public awareness of Ireland&rsquo;s campaign online and the direct costs incurred in this regard are set out in Table 1 below.<\/p><p>Government Brexit Update and &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo; <\/p><p>-The Government Brexit Update email service and the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready public information campaign have formed part of the Government&rsquo;s overall strategy to keep citizens fully informed and up-to date on the implications and challenges of Brexit. <\/p><p>- The Update is issuing on a regular basis via a commercial provider (MailChimp) and provides information on latest developments in the ongoing Brexit negotiations, on the latest available research publications and on engagement at Government level. It also highlights the range of business supports that are available through the various Government Departments and State agencies. <\/p><p>- My Department also coordinated a Government-wide &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready Campaign&rsquo; which I and Ministers Humphreys and Creed launched together on 20 September.\u00a0 This campaign updated citizens, communities and businesses about Brexit preparedness and support measures that are available as well as on public workshop events that were held over successive weeks throughout October and the last two weeks in November. A programme of awareness raising via online and social media platforms also took place.\u00a0 Costs incurred in this regard are set out in Table 1 below. <\/p><p>Other Projects <\/p><p>-My Department has also engaged in social media promotion of certain other initiatives and projects that relate to Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy activities.

This has been reflected in a number of concrete measures and commitments to date, such as the EIB&rsquo;s support for the Government&rsquo;s Brexit Loan Scheme.\u00a0 In its Contingency Action Plan of 13 November 2018, the European Commission confirmed that it would support Ireland in finding solutions addressing the specific challenges of Irish businesses.<\/p>  <p>  In November 2017, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation met with EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager  to discuss, amongst other issues, the impact of Brexit on Irish businesses. Since November 2017, the Department of Business Enterprise and Innovation has been working closely with the Commission and DG Competition since November 2017 through the Irish\/EU Technical Working Group on State Aid. The objective of the Group is to scope and design schemes to support enterprises impacted by Brexit in line with State Aid rules. <\/p>  <p>  On 24 January 2019, Minister Humphreys met with Commissioner Vestager. The meeting focused on the severe challenges that Irish businesses will face when the UK leaves the EU and the need for appropriate and timely State supports.

Should issues arise that require an approach that does not fit within the existing rules, this will be raised as part of the Group discussions. The Commissioner emphasised that the Commission stands ready to act urgently in mitigation against the impacts of Brexit on Irish firms.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Minister Creed held a bilateral meeting with Commissioner Hogan (DG Agriculture and Rural Development) on 28 January to discuss the potential impact of a no deal Brexit on the Irish agrifood and fisheries sectors. Minister Creed stressed the need to deploy market response measures, including exceptional aid, under the CAP to provide necessary supports to Ireland's agrifood sectors. Commissioner Hogan reiterated the EU&rsquo;s readiness to respond and support Ireland and in particular, challenges facing Irish farmers and the agrifood sector, given our specific exposure to the UK market. Commissioner Hogan and Minister Creed agreed to remain in close contact as the situation develops and more clarity emerges about the nature of the UK&rsquo;s departure.<\/p>  <p>  This is an ongoing process, and the Government will continue to carefully examine what supports can be provided to assist businesses, particularly in a no deal scenario.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600046#WRE04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":202,"content":"<p>Question No. 81 answered with Question No. 74.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Overseas Development Aid","counter":203,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600046#WRE04200"},{"type":"question","counter":204,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[11236\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600046#WRE04300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his plans to recognise the rights of thousands of volunteers who help deliver programmes (details supplied) on the ground; his plans to ensure equality monitoring of Irish Aid volunteers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":205,"content":"<p>\u00a0In the\u00a0Government's new development\u00a0cooperation policy 'A Better World' launched by the Taoiseach last week, we have committed to increase our engagement with Irish people and organisations involved in all aspects of our development cooperation, including Irish volunteers in developing countries and those who have returned to\u00a0Ireland. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland's policy on overseas volunteering is set out in the Volunteering Initiative, which promotes skills-based, sustainable volunteering overseas, working in partnership with third parties.

This is in the context of ensuring that the children with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support.<\/p><p>The Circulars note that educational planning is an essential element of a whole-school approach to meeting pupils&rsquo; needs. <\/p><p>Guidelines for schools on educational planning and monitoring of outcomes through the Student Support File, are contained in the Guidelines for Primary and Post primary Schools: Supporting Children and Young People with Special Educational Needs in Mainstream Schools.<\/p><p>All schools are therefore encouraged to use Education Plans or Student Support plans for children who are receiving additional teaching or care in schools. <\/p><p>Whereas there is not currently a statutory requirement for schools to provide a particular form of Individual Education Plan, it is evident that the majority of schools do use some form of education planning to plan and record the support that they provide for pupils with special educational needs. This is considered to be both beneficial for schools and children and is regarded as best practice.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The ongoing provision of planning will represent a continuation of the good practice that is occurring in the majority of schools.<\/p><p>With regard to the implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004, I\u00a0can advise that a\u00a0number of sections of the \u00a0EPSEN) Act have been commenced. The commenced provisions include those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those providing for an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.<\/p><p>The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced. \u00a0<\/p><p>The NCSE\u00a0estimated, in its implementation Plan which was developed in 2006,\u00a0that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act. <\/p><p>The view of the Department of Education and Skills was that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. Legal advice provided to that Department also indicated that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.<\/p><p>The Government\u00a0is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. <\/p><p>In 2018 my\u00a0Department invested over\u00a0&euro;1.75 Billion\u00a0in this area - 1\/5 of my Department's budget and up 42% since 2011, at which point &euro;1.24 Billion was invested.\u00a0This increased investment has allowed the Government to increase the number of:<\/p><p>SNAs by 42%, from 10,575 in\u00a02011 to 15,000 at present.<\/p><p>Special classes by 160%\u00a0to\u00a0over 1,450 at present, compared to 548 special classes in 2011.<\/p><p>Special education teachers\u00a0by 37%,\u00a0from 9,740 in 2011, to over\u00a013,400 at present.<\/p><p>Under the Programme for a Partnership Government,\u00a0I have\u00a0committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress\u00a0aspects of\u00a0the Act on a non-statutory basis. <\/p><p>A range of consultations with Education Partners and Stakeholders took place in relation to the development of the new model for allocating special education teachers over the course of 2017. The new model was introduced for all schools from September 2017. <\/p><p>Further consultations\u00a0took place with education partners and stakeholders in the context of the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and will continue in relation to the implementation of recommendations contained in this report.<\/p><p>Consultations also took place in relation to providing power\u00a0to the National Council for Special Educational need to\u00a0designate a school place for a person with special educational needs,\u00a0which is now\u00a0provided for\u00a0in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018.<\/p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has also\u00a0published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.<\/p><p>It is therefore intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice. Full consultation will also take place with stakeholders before adjustments are made. <\/p><p>I can assure you that this Government will continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support and I\u00a0am confident that ongoing investment and reform will continue to see improvements made in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600047#WRF01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":246,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600047#WRF01400"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[11006\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600047#WRF01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if knowledge of the conditional and future tenses in the German language is required for the junior certificate exam.","asker":"1266","askee":"1290"},{"type":"question","counter":248,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[11007\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600047#WRF01600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the genitive and dative cases and genitive and accusative prepositions in the German language are required for the junior certificate exam.","asker":"1266","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":249,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 97 together.<\/p><p>While neither the genitive and dative cases nor genitive and accusative prepositions are directly targeted for assessment in the Junior Certificate Examination the integrated nature of the German language requires a receptive knowledge of same.<\/p><p>The examination is divided into three sections: for the first two sections i.e. the Listening Comprehension and the Reading Comprehension a receptive knowledge of these cases and prepositions is helpful though not essential as candidates are asked to extract meaning from the audio\/reading text.

This publication 'Responding to Critical Incidents: NEPS Guidelines and Resource Materials for Schools' also outlines how schools can plan for crises. The guidelines refer to preventive approaches that schools can adopt in creating a safe and supportive environment. <\/p>  <p>  The publication provides practical step-by-step guidelines for teachers and principals on how to respond when a tragedy occurs. It offers support to schools at a potentially overwhelming time. <\/p>  <p>  The guidelines focus upon alerting schools to planning processes, structures and actions which will better allow them to cope with a traumatic incidents such as suicide or suspected suicide, murder, accidental death including road traffic accidents and drowning, and death through illness of members of the school community. In relation to suicide, advice is also given on prevention and positive mental health stratagems and approaches. <\/p>  <p>  The Guidelines are kept under constant review and a third edition was circulated by NEPS to schools in 2016. Training in critical incident planning is part of the service provided by NEPS to schools and is a focus of my Department&rsquo;s Action Plan for Education 2016-19 for post-primary schools.<\/p>  <p>  NEPS psychologists will also, at the specific invitation of school authorities, attend at schools immediately following such incidents to offer direct advice and assistance to school staff in managing the situation. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's specific questions in this regard, critical incidents are by their nature situations so named by schools themselves &ndash; traumatic events which have the potential to\u00a0overwhelm the normal operation of the school.\u00a0 Depending upon the nature, severity or context of an event, schools may\u00a0telephone NEPS\u00a0for advice and support\u00a0as to how they should proceed in relation to a particular event. \u00a0In many situations this advice and support is adequate to equip schools to respond appropriately, without further support required from NEPS.\u00a0 In other situations, as is set out above, school authorities may request the attendance of NEPS psychologists on-site to provide support, advice and assistance in the delivery of the response.

where the school, in their contact with NEPS, request the presence of NEPS personnel on-site to advise and assist,<\/p>  <p>Level 3   &ndash; events which have NEPS personnel on-site but are of a magnitude that involves a broader community response from other support services such as the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  Until NEPS gathered data on the number and extent of critical incidents from its eight regions which while including an incident count and level did not include element which allowed disaggregation by school and county. <\/p>  <p>In the academic year 2017\/18 however NEPS changed its data gathering methodology and the data the Deputy requested is therefore\u00a0available for this academic year only and I can inform the Deputy that some 66  \u00a0critical incidents were recorded for counties Tipperary, Cork, Laois and Offaly in the period,\u00a040 at level 1,\u00a0 22 at level 2 and\u00a0four at level 3.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this is of assistance to the Deputy in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600047#WRF04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":278,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600047#WRF04800"},{"type":"question","counter":279,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[11197\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600047#WRF04900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the cost of the use of prefabricated units in primary and post-primary schools in counties Tipperary, Cork, Laois and Offaly since 2011;

As the largest private sector employer in the country (90% Irish-owned) that supports jobs in every city, town and village in the country I understand the importance of the retail sector. <\/p>  <p>  It is clear the retail sector is undergoing an exciting but also challenging transformation as the digital economy provides a different retail experience for consumers across Ireland and beyond. Digitalisation has increased the scope for competition in the retail sector, as reflected in the growth in online shopping and changing consumer preferences in terms of how people are shopping in town centres.\u00a0 Sustaining physical retail outlets requires adaptation: many retailers now offer multiple sales channels to sell their goods, from physical stores, to social media, mobile apps and websites. <\/p>  <p>  Towns are places not only to live in, but to work in, do business in and invest in. The Retail Consultation Forum and my Department produced 'A Framework for Town Centre Renewal' in 2017 to help towns and villages across Ireland with a step by step plan for town centre renewal, which brings together all the key stakeholders in the town to work collaboratively to enhance their local town or village. At a collaborative level, Town groups can work together to improve footfall and customer experience in town centres through various measures such as enhancing accessibility, public spaces, and tackling vacant property. For detailed advice, Town groups can engage with recommendations set out in the Framework. <\/p>  <p>  The Framework also serves as a support document for towns and villages applying for funding streams under Project 2040 including; the &euro;2 billion Urban Regeneration and Development Fund and the &euro;1 billion Rural Regeneration and Development Fund which can be leveraged to support the regeneration and viability of town centres. <\/p>  <p>  All businesses, regardless of size or sector, in today&rsquo;s competitive environment must ensure to build their online capability in order for them to expand their market reach nationally and internationally and enhance their competitiveness. Retailers are now operating through an omni-channel approach where their physical and online stores complement each other.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Last September, I introduced a\u00a0new pilot Online Retail Scheme administered by Enterprise Ireland, with a total fund of &euro;1.25m. I announced\u00a0eleven successful applicants from Call 1 on the\u00a01st March 2019 in Skibbereen, Co.Cork. A second call will issue later this year. The pilot Online Retail Scheme\u00a0supports retail businesses of 20 employees or more who are ready to strategically grow their online capability. Eligible expenditure under the Scheme includes activities such as\u00a0research, strategy development, implementation and training. In recognition of the strong role the retail sector plays in supporting regional development and vibrant communities, at least 50% of the total number of grants awarded under the Scheme will be\u00a0prioritised for retail SMEs with their headquarters outside of county Dublin, subject to applications meeting the minimum standards required. <\/p>  <p>  Retailers can also engage with the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) as the first-stop-shop front line service assisting in delivering business growth and jobs for the small &amp;amp; micro-enterprise sector. The LEOs are the first port of call for anyone who wishes to start or expand a business, in terms of advice, training, sign posting to other support providers and, in certain circumstances, grant support. <\/p>  <p>  The LEOs nationwide actively promote the Trading Online Voucher Scheme (TOVS) on behalf of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. The TOVS offers matched financial assistance of up to &euro;2,500, along with\u00a0training and advice, to micro\u00a0companies (10\u00a0or less employees)\u00a0who want to establish an online presence for the first time, or who wish to expand a basic existing website to incorporate a more substantive online trading capacity.<\/p>  <p>  Since the start of the scheme in July 2014 to date over 5,000\u00a0micro companies have availed of the TOVS including 1,103 LEO client companies. <\/p>  <p>  The LEOs also offer a wide range of short training programmes to support their clients in building their online presence and to compete in the online marketplace. These programmes are focused on different elements which aim at maximising outputs from investment in online trading such as: <\/p>  <p>  - Marketing, focused mainly on\u00a0development of an online\/mobile\u00a0marketing strategy<\/p>  <p>  - Social Media, with\u00a0the\u00a0majority of programmes focused on educating the client base on\u00a0how to use the different social media\u00a0platforms to support their business<\/p>  <p>  - eCommerce Sales Strategy,\u00a0including how to convert website\u00a0 visits into sales<\/p>  <p>  - Search Engine Optimisation, including web analytics and video optimization for web.<\/p>  <p>  As Chair of the Retail Consultation Forum, I will continue to engage with the retail sector in relation to opportunities and challenges arising in relation to digitalisation in the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600049#WRH02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Children's Research Programme","counter":388,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600049#WRH02900"},{"type":"question","counter":389,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[11022\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600049#WRH03000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if the planned children&rsquo;s research and innovation centre at the new national children&rsquo;s hospital will be partly funded by her Department or agencies under her remit; if so, the expected amount; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1327","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":390,"content":"<p>The future Children&rsquo;s Research and Innovation Centre (CRIC) is the planned new facility for paediatric research and innovation that will be located on the St James&rsquo;s campus.

As we approach the withdrawal date, I am urging all businesses to prepare, make all necessary decisions, and complete all required administrative actions. <\/p><p>My Department and its agencies have been consistently advising businesses and their representative bodies that it is crucial that they check their supply chains for vulnerabilities to Brexit impacts, contact\u00a0their UK suppliers, service providers, logistics companies, wholesalers or distributors, to seek assurances about the continuity of the goods and services\u00a0they rely on to do business, and assess whether it makes business sense to find an alternative supplier in the EU.\u00a0<\/p><p>Extensive work has been ongoing in my Department and across Government to help businesses prepare for all Brexit eventualities and to raise awareness about supply chain implications as well as all of the other potential Brexit impacts.

As part of awareness-raising activities, EI continues to roll out regional Brexit Advisory clinics. To date, these clinics have been held in Letterkenny, Tralee, Portlaoise, Claremorris, Cootehill, Charleville, Dublin, Galway, Dundalk, Waterford and Limerick. Further events are planned in Galway, Cork, Letterkenny and Dublin ahead of the withdrawal date. <\/p><p>EI has also been running a PrepareforBrexit communications campaign, featuring the Brexit SME Scorecard and the PrepareforBrexit.ie website, which offers information on the likely impacts of Brexit on Irish businesses and how these impacts might be mitigated. The Brexit SME Scorecard is an interactive online platform that can be used by all Irish businesses to self-assess their exposure to Brexit. EI has also made available a Be Prepared Grant which offers up to &euro;5,000 for exporting client companies to conduct further research and use external expertise to develop a Brexit Action Plan. <\/p><p>Funding to the Local Enterprise Offices has been increased by 22% and they, along with InterTradeIreland, are offering a range of Brexit focused supports to companies, including those engaged in cross-border trade with Northern Ireland.

This week, I launched the Brexit: Implementation Voucher, which offers up to &euro;5,625 to businesses to implement critical changes identified in their Brexit planning phase.<\/p><p>The LEOs offer Brexit supports to micro and small businesses through the 31 LEOs nationwide. These include a &ldquo;Technical Assistance for Micro-enterprises&rdquo; grant, designed to support qualifying businesses to diversify into new markets, enabling companies to explore and develop new market opportunities. This is accompanied by tailored mentoring to address Brexit-related business challenges, and targeted training on specific Brexit challenges.<\/p><p>After the withdrawal date, businesses that continue to buy goods from the UK will be classed as importers. This has the potential to cause further disruption to supply chains. Businesses are encouraged to contact Revenue to understand the changes that may affect them once the UK leaves the EU. Businesses are also urged to contact their suppliers and service providers to seek assurances about the continuity of the supply of their goods and services post Brexit.<\/p><p>Where standards and conformity assessment are areas of potential concern, businesses are encouraged to contact the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI), which provides support and guidance to Irish businesses and industry to mitigate Brexit effects on standards and certification.

This enhanced direct and rapid access will improve clinical outcomes for the sickest children and young people.<\/p>  <p>  The helipad at the new children's hospital has been designed in close consultation with the National Ambulance Service Aeromedical Liaison Service who are responsible for providing helicopter services to hospitals. The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) also consulted with the Irish Aviation Authority and the Air Corps who are the primary provider of paediatric helicopter services to the National Ambulance Service.  At the time of application the Air Corps confirmed to the NPHDB that they are capable of providing night time landings. <\/p>  <p>  The NPHDB has also advised that, when reviewing the alternatives with the Irish Aviation Authority and the Air Corps, they recommended against a ground helipad due to the constrained flight paths and obstacle clearance. Use of elevated landing sites on the roof of hospitals is widespread in the UK and Europe and many of the recently completed paediatric hospitals have elevated helipads. <\/p>  <p>  The Air Corps is the primary provider of paediatric helicopter services to the National Ambulance Service. Air Corps helicopters comprising Augusta Westland AW139 can land on a raised landing site or the roof of a building which is designed and certified for such operations.  The Irish Coast Guard provides reserve support to the National Ambulance Service, when required, through its Sikorsky S92 search and rescue fleet primarily for search and rescue missions. The Sikorsky S92 helicopters are not licensed to land on helipads and, for access to the St. James's Campus, will land in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham from which patients will be transferred in an ambulance by road, as is current practice. <\/p>  <p>  The majority of patient transfers to the three Dublin children&rsquo;s hospitals are completed by road. In any major emergency rescue in a rural area, a Sikorsky Helicopter will bring the patient to the nearest regional hospital for stabilisation resulting in an appropriately planned transfer to the new children&rsquo;s hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600050#WRJ03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service","counter":467,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600050#WRJ04200"},{"type":"question","counter":468,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[11066\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600050#WRJ04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason there are still only two ambulance controls in Dublin city; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1440","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":469,"qnumday":183,"qnumall":"[11067\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600050#WRJ04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to expand the number of ambulance controls in Dublin city.","asker":"1440","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":470,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 and 183 together.<\/p>  <p>  I have no plans to expand the number of ambulance control centres in Dublin.  <\/p>  <p>  Currently, we have two separate ambulance control centres in Dublin;  the Dublin Fire Brigade (DFB) control room in Townsend Street and the HSE National Emergency Operations Centre in Tallaght.

This measure, if adopted, will significantly mitigate the risk to our hauliers of accessing the UK market and using the landbridge. <\/p>  <p>  I am very concerned at the potential for serious disruption at UK ports, in particular Dover, and also in Calais. This may make the use of the landbridge at least in the short term commercially unviable for some operators. <\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0 updated cabinet on 15 January 2019 on the capacity on direct shipping routes to EU continental ports as a potential alternative to the landbridge. Based on consultations by my Department with the main shipping companies, I am advised that the market is sufficiently responsive to respond to the demands of Brexit. I have asked\u00a0the Irish Maritime Development Office and\u00a0my\u00a0officials to\u00a0continue to keep this matter under review. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish Maritime Development Office (the &ldquo;IMDO&rdquo;) carried out a study for the Department concerning the implications of Brexit on the use of the UK landbridge. The study, published last year, found that 3 million tonnes of merchandise trade with the EU moves between Ireland and the EU continent via the UK landbridge. The IMDO estimates that this equates to approximately 150,000 Heavy Goods Vehicles each year and the total value of our trade using the landbridge was estimated to be &euro;21 billion.\u00a0 This route is a strategically important route to market for many Irish importers\u00a0and\u00a0exporters\u00a0and certain sectors of the economy may be adversely affected, mainly those that trade in time sensitive goods, e.g. Agrifood and seafood. <\/p>  <p>  The Landbridge Project Group, chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and including officials from my own Department, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Agriculture, Food\u00a0and\u00a0the Marine, and others has been working closely with the European Commission\u00a0and\u00a0other affected Member States (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark\u00a0and\u00a0Sweden) with a view to preparing EU ports to facilitate the transit of EU products through the UK once it becomes a third country through the use of EU rules on internal transit as set out under the Union&rsquo;s Custom Code.\u00a0 The EU has agreed that the UK may join the Common Transit Convention upon its departure from the EU\u00a0on 29 March 2019, and a number of formal steps were taken to allow this to happen on 4 December 2018 which will enable the use of the EU&rsquo;s internal transit procedure. The Landbridge Project Group has also visited France and the Netherlands, and will visit Calais on 6 March. <\/p>  <p>  I have also met my UK counterpart, Secretary of State for Transport Chris Grayling and have set out the importance of continued transport connectivity between Ireland and the UK, highlighting the importance of the UK landbridge for Ireland as a route to European markets, and the need for Irish trade to move efficiently through ports. I also met France&rsquo;s Transport Minister Borne on Brexit matters including the landbridge, in November, and France&rsquo;s Minister of Europe and Foreign Affairs, Jean Yves Le Drian on 19 February. <\/p>  <p>  Businesses must however prepare for Brexit and examine their supply chains. The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Heather Humphreys TD, on 4 March urged businesses to make sure that they are ready to avail of the customs transit procedure for moving goods through the UK landbridge post-Brexit. The transit procedure allows goods to pass across customs borders with all duties and other charges suspended until arrival at their destination. In order to avail of the Transit procedure, businesses will need to have a Revenue-approved comprehensive financial guarantee in place. This comprehensive guarantee is required as financial security to cover all potential and actual customs debts such as customs and taxes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600054#WRN02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":722,"qnumday":274,"qnumall":"[11181\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600054#WRN02400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the way in which he plans to ensure there is no disruption to supply chains both east-west and North-South in the event of a hard or no-deal Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":723,"content":"<p>A number of key supply chain risks have significantly reduced as a result of contingency measures proposed by the European Commission. The proposed measures were due to interventions by a number of Member States including Ireland. While these measures are temporary in nature, they will, if adopted, ensure the immediate continued access for our road hauliers to the UK market and also for direct flights to and from the UK, including for air freight. However, significant challenges remain and disruption cannot be fully avoided in all areas.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to North\u00a0- South, the Government is not planning for a hard border and the EU is fully supportive of this position.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to east-west supply chains, the continued use of the landbridge as a key route connecting Ireland with the continent is a crucial concern given the level of imports and exports that are transported via this route, with 16% of the HGV traffic between Ireland and GB estimated to constitute landbridge traffic. The total value of our trade using the landbridge has been estimated to be approximately &euro;21 billion. Goods using the landbridge include many time-sensitive or perishable goods, and are transported by truck on Roll-on \/ Roll-Off shipping services to and through the UK.\u00a0 Dublin and Rosslare ports handle almost all of this traffic.<\/p>  <p>  In a no-deal scenario, the ease with which these movements of goods currently take place will no longer be guaranteed. Additional customs, agriculture and health controls will be required at EU ports that trade with the UK.\u00a0 In the case of the landbridge route, the ports of Dublin, Rosslare, Holyhead and the Dover-Calais link are of paramount concern. \u00a0\u00a0In Ireland, the OPW, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Health and the Revenue Commissioners are already preparing by developing the necessary plans within Dublin and Rosslare Ports to allow for these controls. I am aware that similar preparations are ongoing in Calais.<\/p>  <p>  Some trade currently using the landbridge route may, depending on the nature of the product, switch to the direct routes to the continent. For others, some delays at UK and other EU ports may not be such as to constitute a significant deterrent to the continued use of the landbridge. However, the use of the landbridge for some other products that are perishable or very time sensitive may become unviable and may also not be viable on the longer direct maritime links.<\/p>  <p>  I updated cabinet on 15 January 2019 on the capacity on direct shipping routes to EU continental ports.\u00a0 In doing so, I set out the importance of the UK landbridge as a critical route for Irish trade and the importance of alternative direct shipping routes should traffic on the landbridge become disrupted as a result of Brexit. My view then was that sufficient capacity on the direct shipping routes to continental EU ports was available to meet the demands of Brexit and that the market was sufficiently flexible to cater for any increase in demand.<\/p>  <p>  This understanding of the likely response of shipping companies to Brexit-related challenges was tested in a series of meetings with senior representatives of shipping companies, including both immediately before and after I briefed Government.\u00a0\u00a0 While I remain of this view and I re-iterated it at Cabinet yesterday, I have asked that the IMDO and my Department continue to keep this under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600054#WRN02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Improvement Schemes","counter":724,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600054#WRN02600"},{"type":"question","counter":725,"qnumday":275,"qnumall":"[11192\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600054#WRN02700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the details and timing of proposed works on the N11 southbound at Kilmacanogue, including but not limited to the creation of a third lane; the physical separation between lanes and the development of a greenway at the southern cross roundabout; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1436","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":726,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.\u00a0 Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015, the planning, design and\u00a0improvement of individual national\u00a0roads\u00a0is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII)\u00a0in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Noting the above position, I have referred the question to TII for a direct reply.\u00a0\u00a0Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600054#WRN02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Licensing Exchange Agreements","counter":727,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600054#WRN02900"},{"type":"question","counter":728,"qnumday":276,"qnumall":"[11194\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600054#WRN03000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if a person who holds an EU driver licence and then swaps this licence for an Irish driver licence is treated as a new licence; and if not, if the date of issuance of the Irish licence reflects the original licence.","asker":"1250","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":729,"content":"<p>This is a matter for the Road Safety Authority.

The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks. These are considered by insurance companies on a case by case basis.<\/p><p>?Insurance Ireland operates a free insurance information service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance. All calls regarding refusal to quote, or quotations that are so excessive as to be in effect a refusal, should be directed to Insurance Ireland by phone at (01) 676 1820, by email at<i>declined@insuranceireland<\/i>.eu or by post at 5 Harbourmaster Place, IFSC, Dublin 1 quoting the Declined Cases Agreement.<\/p><p>I note that the question refers to persons\u00a0who have swapped licences, presumably from overseas, for Irish licences.\u00a0Such circumstances only arise when individuals change residence and presumably therefore the level of risk to which they are exposed while driving would also change in those circumstances, with consequences for insurance premia.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600054#WRN03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","counter":734,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600054#WRN03600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Adoption Legislation","counter":733,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600054#WRN03500"},{"type":"question","counter":734,"qnumday":278,"qnumall":"[11015\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600054#WRN03600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the status of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":735,"content":"<p>The Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 has passed Second Stage in the Seanad.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As I am sure the Deputy is aware, the Bill seeks to respect the rights to identity and privacy, which sometimes conflict with one another.

I envisage a maximum amount of SSF funding of &euro;50,000 per affordable home and on this basis, at least 6,200 affordable homes could be facilitated. <\/p><p>On 11 December 2018, I issued approval in principle for ten infrastructure projects across five local authority areas, in Dublin and Cork, under the first call for proposals. The first tranche of funding of &euro;43 million will enable delivery of 1,400 affordable homes on local authority lands. I expect infrastructure works on these projects to begin as soon as possible in 2019 and delivery of affordable homes from 2020 onwards. Details of the projects are set out in Table 1. <\/p><p>There are five further projects under active consideration by my Department, with the potential to facilitate the delivery of an additional 230 affordable homes. Details of these sites are set out in Table 2. <\/p><p>All local authorities have been requested to carry out economic assessments of the requirement for affordable housing in their areas and the viability to deliver such affordable housing from their sites. As part of the process my Department hosted a workshop for local authorities on 8th November 2018, \u00a0to discuss these issues. A second call for proposals under the\u00a0SSF will be made shortly. The scope of that call will be influenced by the information received from local authorities, as part of the aforementioned assessments.<\/p><p>An important factor in the allocation of funding under the SSF is the capacity to translate that funding into a discount on the affordable homes. In addition, local authorities must consider the market price of similar homes on sale locally in the  private market and the level of discount on market price envisaged, which will be required under the Affordable Purchase Scheme terms. The objective is to maximise the benefits from public money by funding the best value for money proposals possible. My Department continues to engage pro-actively with local authorities regarding these\u00a0issues and meets with local authorities, individually and collectively, in a range of different formations, on a regular basis, in relation to their housing programmes.\u00a0In the coming weeks, officials from my Department will be meeting with\u00a0the local authorities\u00a0who received approval under\u00a0the first call in relation to the development of these sites. \u00a0<\/p><p>Table 1: List of (ten) proposals that have received approval in principle<table><tr><th>Local Authority<\/th><th>Project\/Location<\/th><th>Total Provisional Cost of Proposal<br \/><br \/>(100%)<br \/><br \/>&euro;<\/th><th>Provisional   Exchequer Grant Amount (89%)<br \/><br \/>&euro;<\/th><th>Provisional Local Authority Contribution<br \/><br \/>(11%)<br \/><br \/>&euro;<\/th><th>Type of Infrastructure proposed<\/th><th>Affordable \u00a0<br \/><br \/>Housing Potential<\/th><th>Total (Social &amp;amp;

This represents a new approach to creativity and cultural policy and therefore requires a sustained ongoing communications programme.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0am also advised that in 2018\u00a0the Culture Ireland Unit engaged Mr. Nik Quaife on a 1 year contract for the provision of services including a communications strategy for its GB18 programme, to celebrate and renew Ireland&rsquo;s cultural relationship with Britain.\u00a0\u00a0Expenditure of\u00a0&euro;51,400 was incurred in respect of these services.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also engaged D&rsquo;Arcy Marketing and Big O on 2018 at a cost of &euro;17,466 and &euro;6,125 respectively to promote awareness of the 2018 European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO) campaign for the recruitment of Irish language translators to the institutions of the European Union.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above, further expenditure of &euro;5,535 has been incurred to date in 2019 by the Creative Ireland Programme and &euro;2,446\u00a0by the Culture Ireland unit in respect of social media costs.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Value for money is always an important consideration for my Department when\u00a0assessing\u00a0expenditure of this nature.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600056#WRP01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Urban Development","counter":854,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600056#WRP01700"},{"type":"question","counter":855,"qnumday":323,"qnumall":"[11154\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600056#WRP01800","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 228 of 13 February 2019, the details of the review of the various actions concluded under the Government's policy on architecture 2009-2015; the actions that have been completed; the status of actions 1 to 29 in action on architecture 2002-2005; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1305","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":856,"content":"<p>The Government Policy on Architecture (GPA) 2009-2015 was the subject of three periodic reports which are published on my Department&rsquo;s website. The policy was also reviewed by way of presentation and discussion at two conferences, in July 2017 and March 2018. These conferences reviewed the policy actions with specific emphasis on reuse of urban buildings and places. <\/p>  <p>  The GPA 2009-2015 was designed to be implemented via three strands: actions led by the Department; an open call for expressions of interest to carry out 20 priority actions; and support to enable stakeholders to carry out other actions in the policy. <\/p>  <p>  Each year until 2016, calls for applications for direct grant aid were issued and projects, publications and events were supported. The implementation of many actions was adjusted from the initial design in order to address current priorities better, while other actions provided a springboard for initiatives by third parties. The outputs are set out in the three reports on the policy implementation, mentioned above.<\/p>  <p>  The implementation of Action on Architecture 2002-2005 coincided with the restructuring of departments following the general election of 2002, when the responsibilities of the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, which had published the policy, were divided among a number of departments. A number of actions were carried out by key stakeholders and those which were not completed were carried forward into\u00a0the following policy. <\/p>  <p>  One of the notable successes of the 2002-2005 policy was the establishment of the Irish Architecture Foundation. This remains a key partner in promoting public engagement with architecture, including by excellent initiatives such as Open House and Architects in Schools. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600056#WRP01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Architectural Heritage","counter":857,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600056#WRP02000"},{"type":"question","counter":858,"qnumday":324,"qnumall":"[11240\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600056#WRP02100","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if Ireland is a signatory and is bound by the charter for the conservation of historic towns and urban areas, Washington Charter 1987; and if Ireland complies with the principals and objectives contained within.","asker":"1305","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":859,"content":"<p>The 1987 Washington Charter is not an agreement between State parties and there is therefore no mechanism for State\u00a0ratification, signature or\u00a0accession\u00a0to it.<\/p><p>Conservation theory and practice is continually evolving and Ireland is guided by the most up to date principles and objectives of international best practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019030600056#WRP02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"}]
