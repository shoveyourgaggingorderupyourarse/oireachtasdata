My sincere thanks to our friends in the Convention Centre for facilitating our attendance here today and for all their hard work, with Oireachtas officials, in the preparation for this important event.  Thanks to all concerned for a job very well done.<\/p><p>The last three months have been unprecedented in the memories of all of us here.  We have seen an unrelenting and capricious enemy visiting our homes, towns, cities and communities, with devasting consequences.  Many lives have been lost.  We continue to remember all those personally impacted by the cruel touch of Covid-19.<\/p><p>Our lives have been put on hold for weeks.  While many of us are hampered in what we can do, who we can see, where we can go, many others have taken up the challenge to assist their communities in healthcare and medical provision and the maintenance of vital food and energy supplies.<\/p><p>We Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann can be proud that we have done our small part by continuing to meet in challenging circumstances.  I warmly thank all Members and staff for their work in this regard, and I particularly acknowledge the work of the D&aacute;il Business Committee, the members of which have worked in a spirit of collegiality to schedule the taking of important business in Leinster House over the past weeks.  I also compliment the members of the Covid Committee on their ongoing, important work programme.<\/p><p>I pay tribute to the Taoiseach and members of the Government for their service and hard work in facing the Covid 19 crisis.  They have worked closely and diligently with the many dedicated experts who have become household names and I think we should be grateful to all concerned for the openness and engagement we have seen in each step of this exhausting process.  I acknowledge those members of the Government who are no longer members of this House but who have honourably continued in their roles by rolling up their sleeves in the national interest.<\/p><p>However, it is now exactly 20 weeks since the people spoke in the general election.  While all reasonable people will appreciate the exceptional circumstances facing all political parties and groups since that date, the people who spoke on 8 February now expect leadership from us all as Members of this Thirty-third D&aacute;il.  While it is true that the people spoke in many different and competing voices, the onus is on us sitting here today, honoured to be placed here as representatives of our communities, to find a solution to the current impasse.  I will not pre-empt the business to be taken shortly, but I urge all present to continue to work in the broader interest of a nation which is still suffering and is in need of both ongoing political leadership and the flickering signs of a more hopeful future for our damaged economy and for our caring, but challenged society.<\/p><p>Hopefully we are entering better times in the coming weeks.  We must remain cautious and vigilant.  We must also seek to address the damage done to us by this virus in the past few months.  Now, more than ever, is a time for this Chamber to continue to be relevant and engaged with those who put us here.  I strongly urge speedy progress in the formation of a strong and lasting Government.<\/p><p><b><\/b>I refer to the work of our Houses of the Oireachtas Services team, led by the Clerk of the D&aacute;il, Mr. Peter Finnegan, and in particular I mention Mr. Charles Hearne and Mrs. Breda Burke from the Service, who invested an inordinate amount of time and effort in making this event happen.

Rachaidh m&eacute; gan mhoill chuig obair th&aacute;bhactach an lae.  Tairgim:<\/p> <blockquote> \tGo n-ainmneoidh D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann an Teachta Miche&aacute;l Martin chun a cheaptha ag an Uachtar&aacute;n mar Thaoiseach. <\/blockquote>  <p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann nominate Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin for appointment by the President to be Taoiseach. <\/blockquote>  <p>&quot;Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.&quot;  When the great playwright, William Shakespeare, composed these lines some 400 years ago, I imagine he never envisaged the 160 Deputies of the 33rd D&aacute;il taking his advice quite so much to heart, but here we are.<\/p><p>It will soon be five months since each one of us was given a mandate to serve as a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  When we first met on 20 February, the unprecedented diversity of this D&aacute;il meant that we were unable to elect a Taoiseach.  Soon afterwards, our country began and continues to feel the impact of a global pandemic of a scale and magnitude that has not been seen for over 100 years.  These have been difficult months, during which every part of our society has experienced an unprecedented strain.  The priority has, quite rightly, been on trying to bring the pandemic under control and to limit its impact.  Exceptional efforts have also been undertaken to make sure that we have continued to have a functioning Government and Parliament.  However, the constitutional and political imperative to form a new Government after a general election has always remained.<\/p><p>The Fianna F&aacute;il Party has worked within its mandate to engage with others, first on core principles and then on the much harder work of agreeing a detailed programme for Government.<\/p> <p>We have also engaged with a range of non-party Deputies.  The resultant programme for Government sets out a clear roadmap for recovery and renewal in our country.  It commits to an investment-led recovery and urgent, proactive action.  On housing, health, education, the historic challenge of tackling climate change, and many other areas, it is a comprehensive plan that, without doubt, involves compromise, but at its very core it is true to the democratic mandates we all received on 8 February last.  Without question, there have been trying and testing days in recent months but, as always, a hard beginning maketh a good ending.  And so it followed yesterday that the memberships of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party voted overwhelmingly and unequivocally to ratify the programme for Government.  It is now my very great honour to begin our work together by proposing that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann nominate Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin for appointment by Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann to the office of Taoiseach.<\/p> <p> If one looks through the record of the D&aacute;il, one will find that the debate and nomination of Taoiseach has often been full of angry, partisan speeches.  The debate in 1959 when Se&aacute;n Lemass, our most transformative Taoiseach, was nominated was just such an occasion.  In the midst of all, however, Deputy No&euml;l Browne showed a very different and positive side of politics.  Without in any way minimising the differences he had with Lemass on policy, Browne said that if one looked back on his ministerial record, one \"must give credit to the man\".  That is the case today.  When one looks at the record of Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, one must give credit to the man.  By every fair measure he has used his time in high office to deliver vital and sustained progress for the people.  He was, without question, a reforming and progressive Minister for Education and Science.  He created the first ever programme of support for children with autism and support for special needs in mainstream education.  He created the National Educational Psychological Service, the core of the DEIS programme for disadvantaged schools, and many other initiatives.  The rapid expansion of multidenominational schools and Gaelscoileanna was begun by him and he implemented the only reform to the primary school curriculum in the past 50 years.  In fact, in every part of our education system, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin has left both a lasting and a positive legacy.<\/p> <p> As Minister for Health and Children, he faced down many challenges to deliver policies that have, according to every independent study, saved tens of thousands of lives.  As Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, he continued his radical work in developing the research capacity of our country and reorientating inward investment towards industries that could compete and thrive in the new economy.  These are the very sectors that have survived and supported public finances in the face of, first, a global recession and then a global pandemic.  At the Department of Foreign Affairs, he led successful negotiations both in Europe and with all parties in Northern Ireland.  Internationally, he pushed forward Ireland's work on nuclear non-proliferation and placed Ireland at the centre of the push for action on humanitarian issues such as the Gaza blockade.<\/p> <p> For those who see politics only from a cynical or competitive perspective, nothing will ever persuade them, but so be it.  As Theodore Roosevelt reminds us, it is not the critic who counts.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin has a proud record of valiantly delivering for the people of this free Republic.  Many of the loudest and most angry voices, who fill our debates with attacks on the right of the majority in this democratically elected Parliament to form a Government, will no doubt once again make partisan and perhaps personal comments, but we will not be deterred.  The programme for Government agreed by Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party is a positive programme of change.<\/p> <p>It is a progressive programme of change.  It is a proactive programme of change.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin has the record, talent and tenacity we need to lead this new Government and to serve all the people of our country with distinction in the office of Taoiseach.

During his political career, Miche&aacute;l has time and again shown himself to be a determined and brave representative of the people.  He has shown great strength and resilience and has already built a record of serving the people of which anyone would be proud.  It has unfortunately been too often the case that no space has been given in politics to acknowledge the strengths of those one disagrees with.  The aggressive abuse we see every day from the keyboard warriors must never be allowed to become a dominant voice in a free democracy.<\/p>  <p>  The Government that is to be formed today will rest on the legitimacy of the democratic support of a majority of those given a mandate to serve in this House.  I am proud to use my mandate to support a progressive and ambitious programme of recovery and renewal for our country, and for this to be led for the next two and a half years by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  As I have said here before, he has demonstrated in every role he has held willingness to work with others who share the same goals and to be inclusive in developing policy, and he has shown real urgency delivering on it.  Because of his work, more children were given the opportunity to secure an education which has transformed their lives.  Because of his work, more people were able to access vital treatment, and many lived healthier and longer lives.  Because of his work, new industries have developed and Ireland has developed scientific expertise, which we have relied on heavily during this terrible pandemic.  I have no doubt that, in the office of Taoiseach, he will display the same qualities of leadership and work in the spirit of a democratic republican tradition which has been central to the progress in our country over the past century.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700007#E00300","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speech","time":1593251400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Tuigim go bhfuil ainmni&uacute;ch&aacute;n eile le d&eacute;anamh ag an Teachta Pearse Doherty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700007#E00400","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1593251400,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCeann Comhairle.

I am doing so because Teachta&iacute; here deserve a choice, the choice the people had in February's general election, between change and more of the same.  We know what Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael will do in office; we have only to look at their track record in housing and health and at how they failed to give workers and families a break.  Every time, ordinary workers and families were left behind.  Instead of moving forward, we will be led backwards but we can do things differently provided the right choices are made.  Today, the D&aacute;il has a choice.  It can elect a leader who will be a champion for change or it can elect more of the same.  I am nominating Deputy McDonald because I want change.  I want a Government that breaks from the failures of the past, serves the needs of workers and families and puts ordinary people's interests first and vested interests last.  A Government of Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael will deliver the very opposite.  That type of Government is about trying to delay change but &mdash; let me say this very clearly &mdash; change cannot be stopped by Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael because the people will make sure of that.  No one in this D&aacute;il can lead a Government for change other than Teachta McDonald.  She has the vision, empathy and courage to spearhead a changed Ireland in which the corridors of power serve the needs of the people, not the privileges or the priorities of the privileged.

The results of this year's general election show clearly there is a movement for change that has called time on the political <i>status quo<\/i>.  The political forces that have converged in recent weeks and months to cobble together an agreement on Government formation will claim they are doing so in the national interest.<\/p><p>Let me be very clear.  These political forces are acting not in the national interest but in their own political and electoral interests.  Fianna F&aacute;il is running scared of an electorate that has rejected its self-serving politics, which all too often has run with the hare and hunted with the hound.  Fine Gael is doing everything in its power to reject the political change for which the people voted in February.  The Green Party is repeating the same mistake it made 13 years ago, selling out the struggle for social and economic equality for ministerial roles and a few crumbs from the coalition table.  I remind the party of the proverb, &quot;fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me&quot;.<\/p><p>Make no mistake about it, change is coming.  This coalition of inequality may delay change but it will not stop it.  Deputy Mary Lou McDonald gives voice to those who have been marginalised and who have never had a seat at the decision-making table.  She articulates the views of workers and families the length and breadth of this country.  I truly mean the length and breadth of this country, from my county of Galway in the west of Ireland to the city of Dublin, and from the proud cities of Derry and Belfast to rebel Cork.<\/p><p>N&iacute;or dhearmadar an phobail ariamh agus m&aacute; ghlactar inniu le hainmni&uacute;ch&aacute;n an Teachta McDonald mar Thaoiseach, beidh duine misni&uacute;il, ionraic, cro&iacute;&uacute;il ina cheannaire againn a mbeidh s&eacute; de mhisneach aici todhcha&iacute; n&iacute;os fearr a th&oacute;g&aacute;il don t&iacute;r seo.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700008#F00200","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1593252000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Cloisfimid anois &oacute;n Teachta McDonald.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700008#F00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1593252000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank my colleagues, na Teachta&iacute; Pearse Doherty and Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, for nominating me for the office of An Taoiseach.  It is, of course, a huge honour to be elected to that highest of offices and it seems today that the honour will fall to Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  I wish him well in that.<\/p><p>February was the month of an election of change, when in unprecedented numbers people voted for fairness, progress and a new direction in Irish politics.  Sinn F&eacute;in won more votes than any other party and, undeniably, this was a mandate for Sinn F&eacute;in to enter into government and a mandate for a Government for change.  Faced with the prospect of losing their grip on power, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have circled the wagons.  They excluded Sinn F&eacute;in and the voices of more than 500,000 people from Government formation talks. Chaith daoine v&oacute;ta ar son athraithe.

For the political establishment, it is their way or no way.  I have to tell those people they will no longer get it all their own way; that day is over.<\/p><p>The inescapable truth is that the future belongs to those of us who believe in change.  The measure and mettle of the Irish people is reflected in how they have handled the Covid-19 pandemic.  It is evident in the daily acts of kindness, the spirit of community and the commitment to the belief that none of us is safe unless all of us are safe.  The Covid-19 crisis has not dampened the desire; if anything it has strengthened it.  People have had time to reflect on their lives and what really matters.  Many people now realise the price of having Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael together in government is too high.<\/p><p>The people were very clear in the election and they told us what the foundation of a good life means to them.  <\/p> <p>They said it was affordable housing, healthcare when they need it, childcare that does not break the bank, a fair economy that delivers for workers where one can retire with dignity at the age of 65 with a State pension, and a greener, cleaner Ireland built on climate justice and social justice too.  The people also told us in large numbers that Irish unity matters.  <\/p> <p> This was not a protest vote.  It was a vote driven by kindness, goodwill and compassion and one rooted in common sense, yet those very issues, which dominated the election, are the issues that have been dodged in the programme for Government.  As Leader of Sinn F&eacute;in, let me set out our stall.  Ordinary people will not shoulder the burden of this economic crisis.  They will not be told to stand at the back of the queue while the banks and the vulture capitalists have their fill.  They will not go down the black hole of slash and burn austerity again.  We will champion investment, stimulus and policies that grow our economy and strengthen our society.  We will stand up for those families who work so hard to make a good life for themselves but see their efforts cancelled out because of a sky-high cost of living and a failure to invest in public services.  We will give those who go unheard by Government - people living with disabilities, carers, young people and our senior citizens - a voice.  We will work to transform all of Ireland for the better because fairness, equality, decency and real solutions are the issues that matter to families and workers and they are the issues that will shape Sinn F&eacute;in's determination to deliver what will be the most effective Opposition ever seen in this State.<\/p> <p> No longer is a better, fairer, united Ireland the dream of the idealistic few.  It is now the achievable goal of the many.  It is an ambition shared by people from all walks of life.  Change pulses through the veins of our nation, fuelled by positivity, hope, solidarity and the promise of a better tomorrow.  Those of us who believe in change are resolute.  We are determined and together.  It is the parties of the political establishment, hunkered behind their high walls, with their jaded ideas desperately clutching to yesterday, that are out of step.  The people of Ireland are entitled to a future that is the measure of their hopes and ambition.<\/p> <p> To those who believe in change, to all those who voted for change, to those who refuse to let go of change, d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d a chaith a v&oacute;ta ar son athr&uacute;, imp&iacute;m oraibh gan thabhairt suas.  N&aacute; caill cro&iacute;.  Our time is coming because change cannot be stopped.  To every person we met on the election trail who confided in us their hardships and deepest fears, who inspired us with their bright optimism and hope for the future, who entrusted us with the task of standing up for them, we are here because of you and for you.

I will speak at greater length when the D&aacute;il reconvenes later but I want to briefly make three points.  The first is that this is an historic occasion.  I believe Civil War politics ended a long time ago in our country but, today, Civil War politics ends in our Parliament.  Two great parties, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, are coming together with another great party, the Green Party, to offer what this country needs - a stable Government for the betterment of our country and our world.  I look forward to the privilege of serving in government with those two parties, as does my party.<\/p>  <p>  For my own party, Fine Gael, this is an opportunity.  A third term in government, three consecutive terms, is something we have never been able to do before.  This is a chance to protect what has been achieved and secured over the past nine years.  It is also a second chance, an opportunity to get right some of the things we did not get right in the years gone by.  I am up for that challenge.  It is a Government with a real democratic mandate.  The three parties combined won more than 51% of the vote in the general election in February.<\/p> <p>Some people may think that 24.5% is a majority.  Some people may think 3% or 1% is a majority.  It is not.  A majority is more than 50% and these three parties have that majority.  They won it in the previous election and have a very strong mandate to govern and to serve over the next five years.<\/p> <p> I will make one last point.  In the course of the debate over the next few hours we are going to hear a lot of rhetoric and spin about change, as though the press officers and the spin doctors have told Members to say \"change\" as many times as they can in their speeches and to keep saying \"change\" when they record their videos for social media.  We all know what change means for Sinn F&eacute;in.  For Sinn F&eacute;in, change means Sinn F&eacute;in Ministers in ministerial offices and Sinn F&eacute;in Ministers in the back seats of ministerial cars.  They are willing to go into power with Fianna F&aacute;il.  They are willing to go into power with Fine Gael.  They are probably willing to get into power with both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  That is what change means to Sinn F&eacute;in, but of course when the Green Party does that, it is a betrayal.  What a load of spin and nonsense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700009#G00300","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1593252600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>An Comhaontas Glas will be supporting the nomination of Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin for Taoiseach today.  The Irish people may well ask why it has taken us almost five months to get to this point.  We should first reassure them that for most of that period we stepped back collectively as a Parliament to support the caretaker Government in the management of the unique health crisis that we faced.  I would like to pay tribute to the outgoing Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, his Ministers, the public servants and above all the Irish people for the way we have done that.  We have shown our strength as a country, as terrible as the loss has been - the loss of life and the loss of so many different kinds.  We see the virus continue to flare in the rest of the world and we have to prepare for its return here, but as a country we have come together and taken a lot of the steps needed to minimise the terrible loss.<\/p>  <p>  We now have a critical job to do as a Parliament to help our country in the next phase of managing this crisis, the economic recovery.  The loss of economic activity has been beyond compare.  I believe that Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin is perfectly qualified to lead the Government in trying to take on that task.  I believe that because of his experience as Minister in a range of different Departments, including Foreign Affairs, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Education and Science and others as set out in some of the earlier speeches.  I know from direct experience that he is calm in a crisis.  He is good-humoured and the value of social justice is at his very core.  As a man, he is forward-looking.  Any time I have heard him speak over the years he has been thinking ahead, not closed to new ideas and new ways of doing things.  That qualifies him for the difficult task that he and the rest of the incoming Government face.<\/p>  <p>  I believe we have a good plan to address this huge challenge.  The programme for Government may not include everything one might want.  It is subject to criticism and it will certainly be subject to change.  The real test will be in its delivery rather than its writing.  However, it provides a good plan and an immediate stimulus.  We will get down to work the first thing on Monday morning.  We have to start preparing a plan to get people's jobs back straight away.  We will borrow for that on our good name internationally and we will continue borrowing to invest in the future for our people and our country.  We must invest first and foremost in homes for our people: homes that are bright, warm and affordable; homes that allow people to walk to school, the shops or work; homes that give people the secure knowledge that they can raise families.  That is what we have to build for our people.  That is the message from our election.  We also have to build up our public health system.  We must build on the good work that has been done, particularly in recent months.  We must be clever, efficient, flexible and fast in delivering services for our people.  This is about public health.  Our health is guaranteed when everyone else's health and security is provided for.<\/p>  <p>  It is a programme for Government which will invest in climate action, because that is what we need to do as a people.<\/p> <p>It is what the world needs to do because our security will be absolutely ruined if the natural world is rent apart, which is the course we are currently set upon.  We have to use everything we can to prevent that happening.  It is action stations time if we are to avoid it and play our part in trying to avoid it.  Here at home, we must work to restore nature and our local environment.  We are connected to nature, not separate from it, just as we are connected to one another.<\/p> <p> To achieve change, we have to invest in a completely new energy system.  That is where the new economic opportunity will lie and where we will be able to invest and create jobs.  It is how we will create a secure economic future, because we will be relying on our own resources.  That ambition goes back to the core founding principles of this State of managing our own resources for the benefit of our wealth and security into the future.  The energy system we are going to create in this low-carbon world will do exactly that.  It will mean changing completely how we run our agricultural system, forestry and fisheries.  How we look after our land will be central to meeting the challenge we face, and that will create an opportunity for young Irish families to play the front-line role in their own homes in protecting nature.  That is something the next Government will have to set us upon.<\/p> <p> More than anything else, the challenge we face needs a new economy.  It will be a circular economy that is hyper-efficient and very productive and that uses new digital systems in really clever and innovative ways, which are ethically founded around our owning the data they generate.  This a constitutional, democratic Republic, not a corporation, and it is the people who are sovereign.  If we can create an economy that is ethically based on that principle, then we will thrive.  It must be innovative, as I said, but more than anything else, it has to recognise that there is a change coming in economics, that the old thinking that the market knows and it is all about the money and economic growth is outdated.  Increasingly, economics is changing.  The new doughnut economics is about looking at both social protection and environmental protection as core measures of success and about measuring success in terms of the quality of our lives, our well-being and health, including our mental health.  Let that be the test and the measure of progress for this Government as it sets out on its course.<\/p> <p> We are at a time of change in the world.  It is a difficult time, when technology is changing so fast that it is hard to keep up.  It is a time when the global order seems to be torn apart, where the great power blocs of old are again threatening each other.  It is a time of uncertainty to our east and to our west, where the political system is full of division and derision, which is something we seek to avoid.  We have an opportunity as a Parliament and as a country to provide, we hope, a small beacon of light in these dark and difficult times.  We do that when we stand up for the smaller nations of this world.  We do that when we stand up for the rights of those in Palestine.  We do that when we stand up in the United Nations, where we helped to negotiate the sustainable development goals.  We do that when we reflect the same principles at home by being welcoming to all visitors and showing that this is a safe country of refuge and one where we do not tolerate discrimination or racism of any kind.  We can, in these difficult times, be an island that tries to show a bit of integrity.  We are not perfect and we all know it, but we are not the worst country in the world and it is our duty to stand up and provide the best political system we can for our people and, if we can, provide a light in the world in these dark and difficult times.  That sounds a bit big, bold and ambitious but why should we not, as we try to form a new Government, set ourselves a big task?<\/p> <p> I thank the two parties who have negotiated with us and who have done so a fair and honest way.  We look forward to working with them as best we can.  We look forward to working with the Opposition.  We do not believe in a politics of division and we will start by co-operating in every way we can, being as open as we can in government, trying to answer every question in as truthful a way as possible and engaging with the Opposition.  Let us use our committee system in a constructive way.  The outgoing D&aacute;il showed a lot of real strengths.  Its minority made it difficult for the governing party to govern but we should keep some of the good things that happened during that time, such as the collaboration we saw in committees like the Sl&aacute;intecare committee and the climate committee.  I could go on.  Let us keep that engagement and work collectively for our people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700010#H00200","speaker":"1465","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1593253800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>The Labour Party will oppose both nominees for Taoiseach before the House today.  The nomination of Deputy McDonald comes before this House without, unfortunately, a scintilla of evidence of a rational, thought-out programme for Government that could seek to attract the votes of a majority in this House.  Sinn F&eacute;in is simply going through the motions of appearing to be interested in government.  The truth is that today's nomination is not backed up by a real attempt to negotiate a programme for Government.  Sinn F&eacute;in's election manifesto was like a giveaway from \"The Late Late Show\", with something for everyone in the audience.  However, bills must be paid and the books must be balanced.  Politicians treat taxpayers with contempt when they tell them they can have everything for nothing in a utopian world.  I accept Sinn F&eacute;in got a mandate from the public, and I respect that, but with a mandate comes serious responsibility, including a responsibility to seek to govern with others with an agreed policy framework.  That has never existed in the case of Sinn F&eacute;in, which yearns for opposition.  That is why the nomination of Deputy McDonald is unworthy of support today.  For the record, nobody has a monopoly on political change.<\/p>  <p>  The nomination of Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin as Taoiseach comes on the back of an agreed programme for Government between Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party.  The programme for Government has proposals that are to be welcomed and we, in the Labour Party, very much welcome some of them.  The sad reality, however, is that this is a lost opportunity to transform our country and society, particularly given the Covid crisis.  Parts of the document are being trumpeted as game-changers when they are not.  Let us be honest; the financials behind this programme for Government are comical, so comical that they were not put down on paper and do not exist in reality.<\/p>  <p>  Over and over, the programme lacks ambition.  We heard at length in recent weeks about the hours and hours of torturous negotiations to set a target of a 7% annual reduction in carbon emissions.  The Green Party claimed this as a victory, despite the truth being that it was the minimum required to meet our obligations under the Paris Agreement on climate change.  I should know because I signed that agreement on behalf of the State.  The saddest indictment of the outgoing Government is how little has been achieved in setting about meeting out commitments in the intervening four years.  The programme for Government promises much.  However, without timelines and costings, many of the proposals will be kicked further and further down the road, that is, if Deputy Ryan allows any more roads to be built.<\/p>  <p>  Most disappointingly though, there is little evidence in the programme for Government of any concerns for workers' rights, equality of opportunity or access to education and training to change.  This is deeply worrying to the Labour Party.  In January 2020, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin said that Fianna F&aacute;il was the party of the working classes.  How can a party that claims to be of the working classes not seek to improve the lot of workers?  The Deputy's claim is demonstrably void in this document.  There is no radical thinking on workers' rights and no meaningful plan to introduce the living wage or extend free health care to all.  There is no radical plan to provide homes at an affordable price point for ordinary workers or affordable childcare so that parents do not have to make the choice between staying out of the workplace for a prolonged period or paying a second mortgage in childcare fees.  When Fianna F&aacute;il claims to be of the working class it is simply a smokescreen.  Nothing in this pick and mix programme for Government will completely transform the lives of ordinary working people.  We know from their previous Government alliance that Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party have no problem taking away from the most vulnerable in our workforce.  Who can ever forget that in its dying days that Government cut the minimum wage by &euro;1?<\/p>  <p>  We are about to enter another financial disaster.  I say loudly and clearly to everybody in this House, particularly the new Government that is about to be formed, that low-paid workers cannot and should not suffer as a result of the decisions that will be taken in the coming years.<\/p> <p>Fine Gael just does not get industrial relations and is completely inept with them.  We need only look at its latest stint in government when transport workers, teachers and our nurses, who saved this country in the past months, were on strike.  We all know the outgoing Taoiseach loves his films.  In the 2016 general election, Deputy Leo Varadkar said that Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin was a good debater and an even better deceiver, that he could not be trusted and that his record as a Minister was a disaster.  Sorry for pointing that out.  The then Minister for Health compared the Fianna F&aacute;il leader with Arnold Schwarzenegger in \"Total Recall\" with alternative memories planted in his brain and created a fairytale about his record in the Departments of Health and Foreign Affairs.  Here we are four years later and it would seem the outgoing Taoiseach has had his memory absolutely wiped in the pursuit of office, and has constructed his own fairytale today.  I believe he must have taken some tips from Matt Damon when he was here during the lockdown as Leo, our current Taoiseach, has woken up, akin to Jason Bourne, with no actual memory of what he said about Fianna F&aacute;il or Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin four years ago, or indeed numerous times over the past ten years.<\/p> <p> We have been here with the Green Party before too.  On 6 May 2016, the leader of the Green Party announced that he would not vote for the election of the Taoiseach, then Enda Kenny, and would not aim for government, stating, \"I said we would not join the Government because we come from a left-of-centre perspective and we did not see that reflected in the document.\"  Four years on, I can tell Deputy Ryan that I come from a left-of-centre party and it is certainly not reflected in the current programme for Government which he has so eagerly signed up to.  Having said that, the Labour Party genuinely wishes the Green Party well.  It shares many of our party's goals and ideals and I look forward to seeing it implement them as part of this Government.<\/p> <p> A Government will be formed this evening and we in the Labour Party sincerely wish it the best.  I personally wish Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin the best as the Taoiseach-elect.  I wish him well and I wish this future Government well.  I also want to put it on notice that the Labour Party will hold it to account.<\/p> <p> The Irish public, in the middle of the Covid experience, is a different public with different priorities and emotions compared with those of a few months ago.  They want and deserve a new social contract.  Covid has acted as a disruptor across all political and economic thought, and the new Government would do well to remember that from the get-go.<\/p> <p> The Labour Party will hold this Government to account based on the following principles.  A cleaner future for all depends first and foremost on building a fairer future for all, for those who work, for those who are looking for work and for those who cannot work.  The opportunities presented by the crisis must not be allowed to pass.  We had a taste of telemedicine and free general practitioner care.  Most of all, the people have a had a glimpse of a single tier health system, where private hospitals were taken over by the State.  We know that real change can happen in how healthcare, childcare and other services are now delivered in Ireland.  The provision of a sustainable, affordable roof over the heads of all families and individuals will be the key measure upon which we judge this Government.<\/p> <p> This is a momentous week and an historic occasion.  The memberships of both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have voted overwhelmingly to enter government today.  Both Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin and I are former students of the great history department of University College Cork, and neither of us could ever have envisaged this occurring today, but it has.  There is one final step to be taken by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, which is a full and final merger of the two parties because, let us face it, there is now not a scintilla of difference left between the two parties.  We are finally on the cusp of an historic realignment of Irish politics.<\/p> <p>I welcome an alignment on a traditional left-right divide and one the Labour Party would cherish.  I assure everyone that in the coming weeks, months and years, we in the Labour Party will not be found wanting when it comes to standing up and advocating on behalf of the people of Ireland.  It is not just a new Government that is being formed today, it is also a new dawn in Irish politics for each and every one of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700012#K00100","speaker":"1610","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1593254400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>This is truly an historic day, not least because we are convened in this modern building, that is D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for today, to vote on the election of a Taoiseach.  While this is an historical occasion, there is nothing normal about it.  We know the election of a Taoiseach is not just about electing an individual, it is also about a programme for Government and the beliefs, ideologies, passions and views that deliver for those of us honoured to have been elected.<\/p>  <p>  Across this House, we hold different beliefs and views.  We are a reflection of the choices made by the more than 2.2 million people who turned out on 8 February for the general election.  Despite some of the political commentary since, often by people who have never knocked on a single door, let alone thousands of doors, the majority of the doors that I and my party colleagues knocked on could not have been clearer: they simply did not want more of the same.  This is a changing Ireland and a broken record has to change too.<\/p>  <p>  I and my party, and everyone else here today, therefore, have to ask ourselves what it is we want to see happen in Ireland over the next five years.  Is this programme for Government the prescription needed to ensure a fair society that is underpinned by good public services and to ensure a strong economy that is rebuilt and works for all, and are the measures included sufficient to tackle the urgent climate challenges of this pivotal decade?  Not to be clich&eacute;d, but democracy matters.  How many times have we heard a politician say that the only poll that matters is the poll on election day?  Well, we had that poll on 8 February and we all knocked on doors the length and breadth of the country.  We heard the same message over and over, that there was a desire for fundamental change.  Indeed, that message was acknowledged by the Taoiseach when he said that he intended to lead his party into opposition.<\/p>  <p>  It was not about protest.  This was a very determined message.  Covid-19 has intervened in all our lives since the election, with tragic consequences for some who have lost their lives.  We again remember them and sympathise with their families, and we remember those who worked - and work - on the front lines and again say \"Thank you\".  If anything, the Covid-19 crisis has amplified many of the issues where there are chronic failures, in housing, health, childcare, disability services and so many more.<\/p>  <p>  We in the Social Democrats have been criticised from various sides regarding our decision not to participate in this coalition.  However, we can and we will robustly defend our position.  We were not given a mandate to deliver more of the same and we were not given a mandate to make up the numbers.  We put ourselves in front of the electorate based on a social democratic manifesto, which is about delivering a new approach, including much-improved public services that are available to all, and a more equal and just society.  Then the Covid-19 crisis hit and further exposed the significant weaknesses in our society and economy, and if any more underlining were required, it further underlined our belief that a social democratic approach to public policy is the best way to create the type of Ireland desired by the people we spoke to at their doors.<\/p>  <p>  While it is fair to say that details of all our general election manifestos are not valid today because of Covid-19, what is valid is the general approach to how we are governed and the underpinning ideologies.  One approach intervenes to ensure the State delivers public services to all and a floor below which no one is permitted to fall.<\/p>  <p>The opposite approach relies heavily on the market to deliver public services and at the same time, that market determines workers' income levels and a less equal society is delivered.  That is why, when it came to coalition negotiations, we focused on the economic foundations underpinning the framework document and the subsequent programme for Government.  Many of the promises made in the 2016 programme for Government were not delivered and that document was written by many of the same protagonists responsible for today's programme.  That is why the financial underpinning is important.<\/p> <p> There is shame in the growing rates of homelessness, including thousands of children, and a health service where hundreds of thousands of men, women and children are on waiting lists for treatment, with emergency rooms that are full of sick people on trolleys who are being cared for by exhausted medics.  These outcomes were not accidents but are the products of policy.  Policy is about ideology and that is why the message on so many doorsteps during the election was about change.  \"Ideology\" is not a dirty word but that is how it was perceived by the last Government, particularly around the critical issue of housing.  How could ideas and ideals underpinning decisions that affect all of our lives be considered as such?<\/p> <p> Social democracy is about collectivism and universalism.  People pay taxes and get the services that they pay for.  While markets exist for trading goods and services, public services are public goods.  Health, education and childcare are examples of services that should be publicly provided to a high standard and accessible to all.<\/p> <p> As we said during the election, one never gets all that one wants when one is negotiating a programme for Government but the very least that one should ensure is that the front and back of the train are not pulling in opposite directions, ideologically speaking.  The economic and societal recovery from the Covid-19 crisis must be fair and there must be a constructive rebuilding.  In doing that, it must also address the challenges of key areas where crises predated Covid.  More of the same will not achieve that.<\/p> <p> The right to free collective bargaining in the workplace, for example, is not a part of the programme for Government, yet is an essential part of delivering fairer incomes.  Without it, there will be high levels of low income and poverty and the public purse will be called upon to subsidise low pay.  It is not just a question of namechecking in the programme for Government.  I acknowledge there are things in this programme that are good, progressive and should be supported.  Those things must be delivered and holding the Government to account will be a means of ensuring that.<\/p> <p> Ultimately, the question my party colleagues and I had to satisfy ourselves of the answer to was whether, in five years' time, we could honestly knock on doors in an Ireland that continues to have a crisis in housing and homelessness, a two-tier health service, an entire generation locked out of ordinary life choices like access to an affordable home, secure employment and childcare that will not bankrupt them, and where the work-life balance is such that it negatively impacts on their quality of lives.  Could we look people in the eye and say that we had presided over a programme for Government that we believed was ideologically the wrong approach or was simply never economically sound to begin with?<\/p> <p> The Social Democrats will continue to work, as we did in the last D&aacute;il, to be constructive and practical but not afraid to ask the hard questions and hold the Government to account.  We will support the Government in every measure that we believe will deliver a social democratic solution to problems and will be forceful in rejecting any measures that are regressive or seek to impose an uneven recovery or austerity on ordinary households as we emerge from this Covid crisis.<\/p> <p> The acceptance by Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party of the programme for Government is an indication of the outcome of the vote that will be taken shortly.  I fully expect that Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin will be elected Taoiseach and while it is not the Government that we want, on a personal level I congratulate the Deputy in advance because there will not be an opportunity for me to do so afterwards.<\/p> <p>Those of us in politics understand what it takes, both personally and professionally, to sustain a decades-long career, to lead a party and eventually end up in the office of Taoiseach.  We recognise that this is a momentous day for Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin and his family, and we wish him and his family plenty of joy on this occasion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700014#M00200","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1593255000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies Barry and Paul Murphy.  People Before Profit will not be supporting the nomination of Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin for Taoiseach.  That has got nothing to do with him personally.  It has to do with our understanding of what people voted for in the general election of 8 February.  The Taoiseach derides the use of the word \"change\" by some of us.  If it was just used for its own sake, he might have a point.  However, there was a clear, unequivocal sentiment among the majority of people who voted in the general election to break the cycle of two-party rule by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, which have controlled the machinery of Government for more than 100 years.  That was the majority sentiment in the election and we believe that the return to power of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael facilitated by the Green Party represents a betrayal and abandonment of that sentiment and demand for change.  It is not just about the political parties.  People wanted to break the cycle of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael for very specific reasons.  The policies and politics of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael produced the worst housing crisis in the history of the State, an absolutely disastrous situation in our public health system and an utter failure to tackle the climate emergency that is hurtling towards us.  They failed to give a fair deal for working people in terms of security of pay and employment or a manageable cost of living with things like affordable childcare and bills.<\/p>  <p>  This programme for Government has done nothing to address any of those issues.  It is a rehash and reheating of the same failed policies that led to those problems in the first place.  The housing policy is, in effect, the same one we have pursued for the past five years.  It recommits to the Land Development Agency, which is a vehicle for the privatisation of public land, the very reason we have a housing crisis in the first place.  Incredibly, on the issue of health, when more than ever we need a single-tier, properly resourced national health system, this programme for Government actually commits to going back to private healthcare and the two-tier system.  On climate, the commitments are so vague and aspirational they can be pushed back to the end of the decade and can still potentially allow liquid natural gas terminals to be built to import liquid natural gas off the south west of the country.  When it comes to workers, there is nothing but vague commitments to a living wage some time, undefined.  There is no plan for a national childcare system that will make affordable childcare available to everybody.<\/p>  <p>  Most of all, there is nothing for workers.  Our guest of honour today in the convention centre is Jane Crowe, the shop steward for Debenhams, who has led an heroic battle for 2,000 workers who were dumped on the scrapheap by a cynical company using the Covid-19 crisis as the pretext to dump those who had served them loyally for decades.  The three parties now entering government have not said a word or made any commitment to address the plight of those workers over the last three months.  When they could have intervened, they washed their hands and that does not bode well for how this Government is going to prioritise supporting workers.<\/p> <p>We make no apologies in saying we are going to continue the fight for change.  We believe the only way to fight for change on housing and health, for a decent standard of living and support for working people and for addressing the climate emergency is by having a left Government.  Furthermore, we make no apologies for our commitment to people power.  The Debenhams workers outside are doing more for workers' rights than any of the three parties which are entering Government.  Change has not come from shoddy political deals but from movements outside Parliament - the movements for marriage equality, repeal of the eighth amendment, getting rid of water charges and affordable childcare.  Our commitment is to fight for that kind of change as that is what people voted for on 8 February.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700016#O00200","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1593255300,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Will there be a youth revolt in the lifetime of this D&aacute;il?

The vote for change may not have been sufficiently decisive this time, but no such argument can be made about the votes cast by young people.  Young people did not vote for a Government led by conservative parties and they most certainly did not vote for a party which won the votes of fewer than one in seven voters under the age of 25 years.  As news of our vote breaks from this Convention Centre, will young people look at their phones, shake their heads and think, \"This is not my Taoiseach\"?   More than any reason, young people voted for change because of the way the housing crisis impacts their lives.  They now have a powerful new reason to raise their voices, namely, mass youth unemployment.  More than half of those aged between 15 and 24 are unemployed.  The Government will fail to tackle this issue at its peril.  Through the years, mass emigration of young people served as a vital safety valve for Irish capitalism.  Emigration did not just happen but was actively encouraged by conservative Governments.  To where will the youth emigrate now?  If anything, rather than leave, young people will be coming back home.

Aer Lingus workers will want to know what the Government intends to do about a company which has its wage bill subsidised by the State but which simultaneously declares war on its workers.  Some 300,000 public sector workers will want to know whether the Government will honour in October the commitments made on pay.  Last but not least, more than 1 million workers will want to see a plan for jobs and will insist that the Government deliver for them and their families.

It will be a hated Government.  Remember what issues dominated the election, namely, healthcare, housing and the pension age.  Since the election, a pandemic has shown us the weakness of our public health system and the possibility of incorporating in it the private system.  Instead of a commitment to build a one-tier quality national health service, the programme for Government contained a positive reference to maintaining private healthcare, a continuation of two-tier health care with better healthcare for the better-off and worse healthcare for the rest.<\/p>  <p>  On housing, the programme continues the reliance on the private sector.  It is a continuation of Rebuilding Ireland.

It is a last ditch attempt by the political establishment to hang on to power.  In 2007, before the last crisis, the combined vote of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael was almost 70%.  As this crisis opens, it is less than 45%.  There is an enormous space in Irish politics for the building of a mass socialist movement.

It has shown us endless examples of people loving and caring for others, from those who were active on the front line to those who stayed at home to help prevent the spread of the virus.  I acknowledge the Trojan work done by the outgoing Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, his Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, and the entire Government, together with the National Public Health Emergency Team.  We express our gratitude and appreciation for the excellent leadership provided and the unflinching resolve to keep us as safe as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The people of Tipperary have given me the privilege of representing them in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for 33 consecutive years.  Since 1987, I have seen many Governments.  I have seen the great triumph of the Good Friday Agreement, the terrible fall into austerity and the grim climb out of bankruptcy.  I have observed political drama, party infighting, revolts, crises, nerve-jangling moments and political despair.  I have watched the ebb and flow and changing fortunes of political parties.  I thought I had seen it all but, on 14 April, with the announcement of an eventful new departure, agreement between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to form an equal partnership, we witnessed two of the greatest rival political parties putting their differences aside to find common working ground for the good of the country.  Both parties deserve credit for that initiative.  That agreement recognises a new reality, a new chapter and a new dawn.  This political alliance should not come as a surprise to anyone.  The shift in political opinion and a decline in support for the twin pillars in Irish politics, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, has been gradual and progressive.  The loosening of their vice-like grip on support and fading loyalty has led to this marriage.  The singular monopoly days are long over and future glory days will have to be shared.  Both parties have taken the correct option to embrace the will of the people and work together.  Party supporters on both sides will worry whether they have married into the wrong family.  I believe time will prove that they are an ideal match with common policies.<\/p>  <p>  The public's approach and attitude to politics has changed and evolved in recent years.<\/p> <p>It has developed to the extent that, on election day, voters made a fragmented choice which nevertheless gave a variety of options in respect of the formation of a Government.  Through the ballot box, the people have advised this D&aacute;il to choose a new partnership.  This expectation has been driven in particular by young voters who want to live in the present not the past.  They want to look to the future, not to look back.<\/p> <p> Today is a time when history is just that and we focus on the future.  When the results from the three parties were announced last night there were various reactions.  Some were jubilant, some were disappointed, some were relieved, and many, like me, were happy to see that the members of Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party had acted in the national interest.  This is the start of a big adventure for the Green Party.  I hope it has the temperament and resilience to stay the distance. Together, these three parties can give the Irish people the strength and stability of a Government at a critical time.  It has seldom been needed more.  We face a rocky road to recovery.  Now there is consolation in knowing that decisions can and will be made, legislation can and will be passed and some of the uncertainty of recent months can and will be put to rest.  The road is hard but we are strong.  <\/p> <p> For my part, I share the interests of the people of rural Ireland.  I share their passions, pastimes, traditions and way of life.  As a Member of this D&aacute;il, I will work to ensure these unique values and principles will be protected.  Since election day, I have consistently highlighted the need for a stable, strong Government at a time of great peril for our economy and country.  In line with that sentiment and my conversations with Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, I have decided to make my contribution to stability by supporting his nomination for Taoiseach and also supporting the appointment of Ministers to a new Government.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin has the credentials to be an excellent Taoiseach and leader of our country.  I wish him well and I know he will lead in a spirit of consensus and collaboration.  To use the words of Deputy Martin&rsquo;s fellow Corkman, Tom McSweeney, \"fair sailing\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700017#P00400","speaker":"1609","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1593255900,"counter":38,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach.  I offer my deepest sympathy to the family, friends and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the recent tragic death of Detective Garda Colm Horkan.  I also pay tribute to all the front-line staff who have done so much for this country in recent months during the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  It is 140 days today since the general election took place.  This has been a record length of time without a Government, during which Ireland and the world have changed completely.  Since the election on 8 February, the country has been operating with a caretaker Government, which has done an exceptional job in managing this unprecedented health crisis.  I compliment the outgoing Taoiseach, his Ministers and all involved.  <\/p>  <p>  Covid-19 has wreaked havoc on our society and economy.  We have many challenges in the weeks and months ahead to get people back to work and the economy back on track as soon as possible.  In recent weeks, I have repeatedly raised my concerns for small and medium enterprises, SMEs, especially those in the tourism and hospitality sector.  Businesses need short-term and direct financial support as well as longer term access to low-cost capital.  Getting these small businesses back up and running is the key to getting our economy back on track.  The SME sector employs almost 1 million people and the hospitality sector employs almost 260,000 people, of whom 27,000 of these are employed in Galway alone.  The SME sector is the backbone of the economy and requires cash grants rather than loans to help businesses reopen and deal with reduced capacity and additional requirements to meet social distancing rules.  I have met many business owners in recent months who want to protect staff and customers in every way possible to prevent the spread of Covid-19.  However, they cannot do this without Government support.  Tourism and hospitality will be the slowest sectors to recover.  A well thought-out rescue plan must be delivered by the incoming Government in the coming weeks.  Galway, like many other cities across Ireland, suffered a great deal during this pandemic.  The loss of the Galway International Arts Festival and the Galway Races and the cancellation of Galway 2020 European Capital of Culture events will result in lost revenue of tens of millions of euro in this year alone.  <\/p>  <p>  As I stated in the D&aacute;il Chamber two weeks ago, when the banking crisis hit in 2009 the Government of the time bailed out banks to the tune of more than &euro;100 billion at huge cost to taxpayers.  The current crisis is even greater.  It is time to support small businesses to help keep them viable and trading in the medium to long term.  At the end of the day, there will be a return on this investment through employment, tax and VAT returns, thus resulting in a stronger economy to the benefit of everyone.  <\/p>  <p>  The need to extend the Offences Against the State Act and renew the mandate of the Special Criminal Court makes the election of a Government today a vital necessity.  <\/p>  <p>  We are also still in the Brexit transition period and a final agreement on the future relationship between Britain and the European Union has yet to be agreed.  As the UK&rsquo;s biggest trading partner, Ireland has most at stake if things go wrong.  We must, therefore, have a strong Government in place during this critical negotiating period.<\/p>  <p>  When the D&aacute;il met on 20 February I voted for Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin as Taoiseach and it is my intention to do so again today.  We need a Government to address the many challenges that face the nation over the coming months.  Major challenges will face the incoming Government in many areas, including funding for childcare, health and the disability sector, and the reform of business insurance.  I will seek vital support for the SME sector.  Parents are also anxious that children will return to school in September.  The availability of affordable housing and home care for the elderly remain vital concerns for many people.  The crisis facing agriculture, particularly in the dairy and beef industry, must also be addressed by the incoming Government.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue of concern is the major roads infrastructure projects, which include the N6 Galway city ring road, and uncertainty created by the Green Party regarding funding for vital projects.  It is crucial that the roads programme and other major infrastructure projects are given clarity as a matter of urgency by the incoming Government.<\/p>  <p>  I will be a constructive Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann but I will also hold the incoming Government to account.  I am prepared to support good policy and legislation but only where they are in the best interests of the Irish people.  <\/p>  <p>  On this historic day, with the end of Civil War politics, I congratulate Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin on his nomination for Taoiseach.  This is a great honour for him and his family and I wish him and the incoming Government the best in the months and years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700018#Q00200","speaker":"1576"},{"type":"speech","time":1593255900,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I call on Deputy Mattie McGrath who will be sharing time with three other speakers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700018#Q00300","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1593255900,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Yes, I am sharing time with Deputies Michael Collins, Michael Healy-Rae and Danny Healy-Rae.<\/p>  <p>  Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an gCeann Comhairle agus le Cl&eacute;ireach na D&aacute;la, Peter Finnegan, and all of his team for their organisation today.  I also thank the Ceann Comhairle for his stewardship during the interregnum since the election when we did not have a real Government in place.<\/p>  <p>  On 8 February, 140 days ago, I was privileged to be elected by the people of Tipperary.  While I accept that the general election did not produce a clear and decisive result, I do not believe a Government made up of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party will offer much in the way of progress for my constituents in County Tipperary and, indeed, everyone in Ireland.  Since the election, I have made myself available, as have other Deputies in the Rural Independent Group, to meet Deputies from Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Sinn F&eacute;in.  Sinn F&eacute;in was not serious in continuing those negotiations and did not show any real intent of forming a Government. <\/p>  <p>  I am worried about the proposals before us.  I suggested on the day I was elected in Tipperary that we should have a national Government.  Arising from the Covid crisis, we had a kind of national Government with a consensus agreement under which we all worked together.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  We could have had a national Government because we had every reason to have one but we did not have one.<\/p>  <p>  For the past four years, I have opposed the Fine Gael Government supported by Fianna F&aacute;il under the confidence and supply agreement because of the way it treated the families of rural Ireland and working people - na daoine beaga, &oacute;ga agus aosta.  Fine Gael did not get it and showed no empathy with ordinary people.  We also had the way people were treated by the banks, insurance companies and sectors across the board.  Unfortunately, I do not have faith in the programme for Government.  It has been published with no costings whatever and with not a shilling or euro accounted for.  I am also very concerned about the 101 commissions, reports, investigations and reviews that are to be set up.  These will all cost money.  I detest all of the quangos that we have set up, yet we are now about to set up many more of them.<\/p>  <p>  My independent colleagues and I made ourselves available to meet and discuss how we could make an input into creating greater fairness for rural Ireland but we were not given an opportunity or asked to do so.  Two and a half weeks ago, three of the party leaders, the Taoiseach and Deputies Miche&aacute;l Martin and Eamon Ryan, promised they would meet us immediately after the programme for Government was agreed but that did not happen.  That is their choice.<\/p> <p> I understand the primary function of the D&aacute;il is to elect the Taoiseach and a Government and that is set to happen today.  I hope it does, because the country needs a Government.  I wish an Teachta Martin as Taoiseach-elect, his wife, Mary, and his clann go l&eacute;ir, and the Ministers he will appoint the very best for the future.<\/p> <p> I will also outline today, a Chathaoirligh, that I will be constructive in opposition.  I will support issues that are good for the country and for the people, but as I have said, I will not support the attack on families, on the elderly, on rural Ireland, and on SMEs.  I will not undermine workers.  Working people deserve to be paid a decent wage.  Above all, our elderly have been left behind and have been punished right though the Covid-19 crisis.  Over-66s did not get a ha'penny.  They were forgotten about, and God help us we know what happened in the nursing homes.  They way those people and their families were treated was unbelievable.<\/p> <p> I look forward to representing the people of Tipperary to the best of my ability, and to support what is good and oppose what is not.  I am worried about a Green Party Minister with responsibility for transport.  I am worried about roads projects, such as a ring road for Tipperary town and a bypass and relief road for Thurles, Carrick-on-Suir and Clonmel.  I am worried about these necessary programmes for rural Ireland, so I will hold the Government to account.  While I wish everyone in the Government well on a personal basis, I will be constructive in opposition<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700018#Q00400","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1593256500,"counter":42,"content":"<p>Today the majority of the D&aacute;il will vote for Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin as Taoiseach of our country.

The joining together of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael in the formation of a Government, which I said for many years would happen as there is simply no difference between each party, has come to pass, and now they are joined at the hip for years to come and maybe forever.<\/p>  <p>  Today, I make a clear decision for the people I represent and this was in full consultation with the people throughout west Cork.  While everyone I spoke to saw the urgency with which a Government needed to be formed, they pleaded with me, having looked at the programme for Government, because the constituency I represent, Cork South-West, is once again going to suffer even more, if this is possible, than it already has.<\/p>  <p>  The one request I had in any negotiations, and there were a few in recent months, was a cast-iron written guarantee that the future of Bantry General Hospital accident and emergency department would be safeguarded in the lifetime of this Government.  While the safeguarding of other hospitals throughout the country is embedded in the programme for Government, and while I congratulate the Deputies from these areas for having delivered for their constituencies, it showed that west Cork and Bantry General Hospital were not on the agenda.  I made a promise to the people of west Cork that if any incoming Government would not show support for Bantry General Hospital, I would not support it, and this promise I will keep.<\/p>  <p>  The measures of this Government will be measured, in my view, if we see no senior Ministry for fisheries.  It is time the politicians stood up.  The time of treating fishermen and fisherwomen of this country as second-class citizens is over.  It is time that a vision is shown for agriculture so that people can survive on the family farm and not be forced to stand outside the meat factory gates for their right to survive.  Again, our tourism sector is going through a serious crisis, and today a senior Ministry is a must.  West Cork has been a forgotten constituency.  Promises for bypasses for Innishannon and Bandon have lain idle for years.  The promised extension to St. Brogan's College has lain idle.  It has been just promises after promises.  The security of Bantry General Hospital now lies as a promise, as does the beginning of work at Clonakilty Community Hospital.<\/p>  <p>  In the next five years in the D&aacute;il I promise I will be a strong voice of opposition for the people of Cork South-West.

He is 15 years of age and I want each and every Member of this D&aacute;il, the new Minister for Health, and the new Taoiseach, Miche&aacute;l Martin, to remember this case.

I want to think of the present generation and of the pressures that are on them.  We are promised a farmers' rural environment protection scheme, REPS.  We are promised a retirement scheme.  There are no costing of these whatsoever.  Kerry is the tourism capital of the world.  I want the businesses there to be supported.<\/p>  <p>  I will say finally to the new incoming Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, that I have known him personally for more than 30 years.

That is one of the reasons I cannot vote for him today.  Shannon LNG was providing its own funding and had spent up to &euro;70 million already.

Based on the programme, people will be worse off at the end of the Government's tenure.  It is a Government of inaction on the issues hurting our people most, namely, housing, health, climate, equality and discrimination, the issues that matter for people.

The Green Party is also betraying those who voted for radical, serious action on climate change.  Much has been made of the commitment to a yearly 7% reduction in carbon emissions, but achieving that has been pushed back to the period 2025 to 2030, which is after the incoming Government will have left office.

For today, I will lend my vote to Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin in the interests of forming what is the only viable option for government right now, and I will play a constructive role in holding that Government to account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700020#S00500","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1593257100,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I concur with the previous speaker.  The constituency I represent needs a Government to deal with the issues we face.  Just a couple of weeks ago, the Minister for Health told the House that greater and better use has to be made of Ennis hospital and other tier-two hospitals throughout the mid-west to avoid a catastrophe next winter at University Hospital Limerick.  Shannon Airport and Shannon Development, which were founded to drive economic development throughout the mid-west, are not in a good place.  Shannon Airport is on its knees.  Shannon heritage sites, the legacy of Shannon Development, are closed, and some of them are not even scheduled to open this year.  Those sites are not the heritage of those of us from the mid-west.  They are the heritage of every Deputy in the House and everybody he or she represents in the House.

That spirit is as important today as it ever has been, and it is the spirit I intend to work within.  There were many things said during this debate and I thank all for their contributions.  Those contributions should normally be replied to, but I think it is more important right now to move forward.  There is no question as to what our most urgent work is.  We are meeting away from our permanent Chamber because of a historic pandemic which has struck Ireland and the rest of the world.  As of today, 2,278 people on this island have lost their lives.  Many thousands more fought a long struggle to recover.  There is no community, no part of our country, that has escaped untouched.<\/p>  <p>  In the past three and a half months, enormous progress has been made in controlling the spread of the virus and treating those who have become sick.  For this and much more, we owe an enormous debt of gratitude to staff working in our health system, in other front-line roles and within our public services.  As part of this, I acknowledge the work of the outgoing Government, especially the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, and the outgoing Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, for their leadership.  While there is no doubt that we have achieved progress since March, the struggle against the virus is not over.  We must continue to contain its spread, we must be ready to tackle any new wave and we must move forward rapidly to secure a recovery to benefit all our people.  As we meet here, there are nearly 9,000 of our people wholly or partly relying on special pandemic payments.  This is the fastest-moving recession ever to hit our country.  To overcome it, we must act with urgency and ambition.  There are restrictions which will remain in place for some time and no one can say today when we will return to something close to normality.  However, there is much more that we can and must do to help our society and our economy to recover.  Starting today, this work will be at the very centre of everything the new Government will do.<\/p>  <p>  At the same time, we know there are other great challenges we faced before the pandemic and which remain to be overcome.  Too many of our people cannot find a decent and affordable place to live.  Waiting times for urgent treatments are far too long.  Our communities, our families and our young people need support to be able to thrive in a rapidly changing, modern economy.  We must tackle the existential crisis posed by climate change.  Recovery and renewal are the themes which underpin everything in the programme for Government that has been agreed between Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party and ratified by our members with overwhelming majorities.  When three parties come from very different traditions, we do not and could not be expected to agree on everything.  However, we have been able to agree on core democratic principles and a balanced and comprehensive programme.  We are conscious of the fact that we must work hard to build trust with each other and with the people we have a duty and privilege to serve.<\/p>  <p>  To be elected to serve as Taoiseach of a free republic is one of the greatest honours anyone can receive.  I thank the Deputies of my party for their support, those of Fine Gael and the Green Party and those Independent Deputies who voted for me.  Most of all, I thank my family and my community.  Without them, I could have achieved nothing.  My wife, Mary, has been a pillar of support and a partner for me since our days in college.  Our children have tolerated my many absences over the years.  As they have grown, studied and experienced the world, they have not just supported me but have given Mary and me the benefit of their views of the Ireland they have grown up with.  I was blessed to be born into the home which my late parents created for me and my brothers and sisters in the heart of the close-knit, working-class community which I have the enormous privilege of representing in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Every day, my parents showed us the importance of supporting each other, of tough but fair competition and of the spirit of community.  From my late father we learned not just of the great sporting achievements he saw but of the characters and values of the heroes who were and remain immortal to us.  We learned the importance of persistence, of optimism and of always understanding that Cork will soon win anther double.<\/p>  <p>  Most of all, we learned of the struggles of the members of our country's great founding generation and of their republicanism.  It was a republicanism which always sought to evolve and to respond to the needs of today and the future.  They were warm, generous, visionary and brave, not just physically but, far more importantly, in their willingness to question themselves and embrace change.  It is this republicanism, a tradition which does not wear and never has worn a party label, to which we all owe so much.  It is the reason that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is the only parliament established in the aftermath of the First Word War which has been democratic for the entire century since.  This week 100 years ago, the First D&aacute;il was obliged to leave its normal Chamber to be able to meet in full session.  The minutes of that sitting show that in the face of dramatic events and repression, the Members of the D&aacute;il continued their work of building Irish democracy.  They voted to establish independent courts, reviewed and questioned the work of every Department, and looked at ways of funding housing in Dublin.  They set themselves the challenge of not just talking about the problems of our country but developing solutions.  Our country has shown time and time again that we can overcome the toughest of challenges and we will do so again.  It is in this spirit of deep belief in the role of democratic government, with a commitment to delivering the recovery and renewal embodied in our programme and the determination to work tirelessly to serve the people, that I proudly accept the House's nomination.

I also propose to nominate Deputy Dara Calleary as Minister of State in the Department of the Taoiseach as Government Chief Whip.  In the coming week, I will propose further Deputies to serve as Ministers of State and will outline a series of special responsibilities to be assigned to them.  These will be focused on delivering specific priorities.<\/p><p>The Government which I am nominating will be committed to working together in a new way and with both urgency and ambition.  There is no time for quietly settling in.  Each Minister has a substantial role to play not just in delivering the commitments for his or her Department but also in the Government&rsquo;s collective work.  The challenges we must overcome are both immediate and, in many cases, long-standing.  They can only be met and overcome if we work together across our responsibilities.  There is no question but that our first priority will be continuing the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic and moving decisively to recover from its devastating social, economic and cultural impact.  We will immediately begin the work of preparing an investment-led jobs and recovery initiative, which will be brought to the D&aacute;il for approval next month.  This will be a whole-of-government initiative about more than just the enormous task of getting our people back to work.<\/p> <p>I, together with Deputies Leo Varadkar and Eamon Ryan, will lead this process through a special Cabinet committee which will begin its work in the coming days.  The Cabinet committee will have a wider membership.  The economic elements of the initiative will directly act to help businesses which continue to struggle and move forward with sustainable initiatives to save and create good jobs in every part of our country.<\/p> <p> No one yet fully understands what the lasting impacts of the pandemic will be but we know for sure that these impacts spread deeply in every aspect of our families and communities.  We must help schoolchildren so that they do not fall permanently behind.  We must help people to cope with the personal impact of stress and anxiety.  We must do everything possible to quickly recognise and decisively respond to groups and communities which show new and unexpected impacts from the pandemic.  We have to continue to implement safe and proportionate actions to limit the virus.  The shaping of a fair and inclusive recovery will be our absolute priority from today and until this work is done.<\/p> <p> We have also committed to an ambitious and urgent programme which will define our work from today onwards and in the coming years.  Ireland can achieve very little without a strong and dynamic economy.  To have a strong and dynamic economy we must continue to transform it.  We must have sustainable investment in good public services and in preparing the workers and businesses of today and the future for technological change, and we must play our part in tackling the existential crisis of climate change.  In support of our programme to meet these economic challenges, we will restructure key elements of Government.  The Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform will be led by separate Cabinet Ministers.  Together the Ministers will lead action on a wide range of strategies for investment, reform and making sure that Ireland plays a leading role in shaping fundamental economic policies under discussion within the European Union and internationally.<\/p> <p> Deputy Leo Varadkar will lead the restructured Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with its urgent agenda.  The transfer of trade to the Department reflects the fact that the next few years will be unique with regard to the number and importance of the trade issues which will be decided.  This requires an integrated approach.  Equally, it is a statement by the new Government that Ireland believes that international trade is essential for helping countries to prosper.  It has been central to our progress in the past half century and it will continue to be central to our progress in the years ahead.<\/p> <p> All three parties in this new Government believe that climate change is a defining challenge not just of this generation but of human history.  The programme we have agreed puts action on climate change into the work of every part of Government.  We must not just overcome this challenge but we must turn it into a new opportunity.  We must build an Ireland with a sustainable economy, an Ireland which protects and restores its wonderful natural diversity and which does not leave communities behind in this great transition.  Deputy Eamon Ryan will lead this work with a major new portfolio.  In addition to climate change and the natural environment, he will oversee other specific areas which are an essential part of the wider climate change agenda.  This includes transport as well as communication networks.<\/p> <p> Deputy Hildegarde Naughton will be the Minister covering international and road transport and logistics.<\/p> <p> Agriculture, food and the marine will remain a priority, both as central to rural society and as a major economic pillar.  I reject the false idea that one can either support agriculture or care for the environment.  Farmers are the great custodians of our countryside.  We owe it to them to work with them to ensure decent incomes and a sustainable future for them and our rural communities as a whole.  Senator Pippa Hackett will be appointed as a Minister of State in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p> <p> This new Government is determined that Ireland will be a constructive and effective member of the European Union and the international community.  In the many struggles under way in our world, there is no doubt where we stand.  We stand for strong international co-operation.  We stand for humanitarian principles.  We stand for a Europe which is stronger and has the ability to fulfil the great challenges that we face.  We stand with those who share our belief in free democracy and strong, rules-based international organisations.  Deputy Simon Coveney will serve as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Defence.  He will do so in a challenging period during which we will carry the additional responsibility of membership of the Security Council of the United Nations.<\/p> <p> Our international standing rests on many things, but nothing is more important than the tradition of peacekeeping which our Defence Forces have built over six decades.  &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann has served and protected our country with great honour and distinction.  Eighty-six of its personnel have given their lives showing the world the values of our country.  The new Government is committed to renewing our commitment to &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann.  Deputy Coveney will ensure that its voice is heard, not just here but in shaping the humanitarian policies which its members will continue to serve.<\/p> <p> We are also committed to completing the work of reforming policing and ensuring that communities are safe.  The Good Friday Agreement remains the defining blueprint for our island's future and a vindication of democratic politics.  The new Government will move forward quickly to try to fulfil the vision set out in the agreement.  We will work closely with the democratic institutions in Northern Ireland.  I will establish within the Department of the Taoiseach a new shared island unit which will begin a renewed push to use the potential of the agreement to deliver sustained progress for all communities.  We will do everything to seek the full implementation of the agreements made by the United Kingdom with the European Union concerning Brexit.  Helping businesses and communities to prosper in spite of the impact of Brexit is an urgent and ongoing task for us.<\/p> <p> This Government will work to deliver early and sustained action on housing.  We are determined to restore hope to people that they will be able to find a place to buy or rent.  There are no easy answers.  Action and investment are required across a wide range of measures.  We are also committed to delivering a public health service which will care for people faster and to the highest standards.  We will focus not just on long-term changes but also on immediate action on the most urgent issues.  As we have all seen in recent months, we have a great national resource in the skills and professionalism of those who work in our health service.  I have no doubt that we can achieve sustained progress on long-standing problems.<\/p> <p> The single most important decision in delivering progress for modern Ireland involved a decisive move towards expanding educational opportunity.  The new Government is committed to delivering further progress on education and is implementing the most significant modern reform in the structure of how Government oversees this area.  The higher education sector will form the core of a new, separate Government Department and will be combined with other science and innovation functions, including the area of science funding.  This sector is going through a major transformation and needs clarity and engagement from Government.  Equally, we need to do more to acknowledge and build on the incredible base of scientific research which has developed in the past two decades and has played a central role in our economy and ability to respond to the pandemic.<\/p> <p> The Department of Education will implement a series of measures to make education more inclusive and to complete important reforms.  Educational welfare functions and school completion services will be returned to that Department.<\/p> <p> We will expand the work of the current Department of Children and Youth Affairs in a number of important ways.  The vital task of improving child protection services and expanding childcare provision will be accelerated.  Co-ordination of disability-related issues will be handled by a senior Minister for the first time.<\/p> <p> One of the greatest developments in our recent history has been how we are becoming a more diverse society.  History teaches us that in the long term, one has to work hard to achieve a successfully integrated society which respects the culture of all.  Cabinet-level responsibility for integration demonstrates our commitment to undertaking this work.<\/p> <p> Today would normally be the most colourful and joyful day of the year on the streets of Dublin.  Pride is a reminder of just how far we can come in a generation through valuing equality, incorporating it in our laws and changing how we behave towards others.<\/p> <p>Equality will have a strong voice in this new Government.<\/p> <p> A free, independent and professional media is vital for our democracy.  We have set out our commitment to helping not just our public service media, but our professional media as a whole to be able to have a sustainable future.  Deputy Catherine Martin will lead our work on this as a matter of urgency.  She will also lead the critical work of helping to restart and strengthen key elements of what makes us unique as a nation &ndash; our arts, teanga n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta, sports and tourism.  Beidh an Teachta Martin freagrach as an Roinn sin agus tabharfar suntasacht nua sa Rialtas d&rsquo;fheidhmni&uacute; an str&aacute;it&eacute;is fad-t&eacute;armach do &uacute;s&aacute;id an teanga agus spreagadh eolais.<\/p> <p> At this moment more than ever, we have been reminded of the central role the State must play in supporting people at key moments of their lives and providing them with security, including during their retirement.  The social vision of the new Government includes giving a new impetus to community development.  This is a major reconfiguration of central elements of how Government is structured and it will be accompanied by a new approach to how Government works.  Ministers and their officials will work more closely together in a series of Cabinet committees which will be established.  The challenges our country is facing cannot be placed within the walls of individual Departments.  They cut across Government and we must work across normal boundaries to overcome these challenges, including decisive and rapid action on recovery; immediate and ongoing work to address the central challenges of housing, health, education, Brexit and climate change; and a positive and outward-looking engagement with Europe and the international community.  These are the principles which will underpin our work.  Our country has achieved many incredible things in the past and I have no doubt we can and will do so again. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700025#DD00800","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1593260400,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I take it the arrangements set out by the Government Chief Whip are acceptable to the House.

We found a new way of doing things, without sacrificing any of the things that really matter.  Let this symbolise the mission of this new Government, putting aside the divisions of the past to find new ways of doing things, a new approach that is in the best interests of our country and a break with the past for the dream of a better future.<\/p>  <p>  I offer my sincere congratulations to Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin on his election as Taoiseach.  This is a special day for him, his family and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and a day that will be celebrated my many people, not least by the banks of the lovely Lee.  I especially want to mention one person, Deputy Martin's wife, Mary, who has been alongside him for all his political career, through the worst and the best of times.  Today is her day as much as it is the Taoiseach's, and I hope she and her family enjoy it.<\/p>  <p>  The unique circumstances of today's meeting in the D&aacute;il mean that, unfortunately, there is not the usual gathering of family, friends and supporters, but they are here in spirit for this occasion.  I offer my warm words of congratulations not simply because my party, Fine Gael, supported this election.  It is right that we wish a new Taoiseach well when he or she starts out, whatever his or her political persuasion, because when a new Taoiseach does well, our country does well too.  Today is not a day for rancour or point-scoring but one to mark a new beginning.  <\/p>  <p>  When I first became a Teachta D&aacute;la back in 2007, I was my party's spokesperson for a Department called Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and I enjoyed many robust exchanges with the Minister of the day.  These exchanges continued over the years across the different positions we held and in recent years that was twice a week during Leaders' Questions.  From today, we will be working together in Government.  We are very different people but we have some crucial things in common.  One of them is a determination to do what we can to better the lives of the people of our country.  I look forward to working together with the Taoiseach in partnership over the next five years. <\/p>  <p>  I also congratulate the incoming Minister for Climate Action, Communications Networks and Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan and the Green Party on their return to Government.  What an extraordinary comeback.  Like the Taoiseach, in 2011, Deputy Ryan became the leader of a party that was on its knees.  It had no Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la, little public support and questions were being asked about its future.  Today, the Green Party is helping to shape our future for the better and I know from the negotiations that this is definitely a party that knows how to play senior hurling.  During the debate on ratifying the programme for Government, I was impressed by the passion, vision and determination of the members of the Green Party.  The intensity of its internal debate reflected a seriousness about the issues and did credit to everyone on all sides.  I congratulate the new Ministers on their appointment and look forward to working with the Green Party to deliver real and lasting change for the benefit of our country and our world.  <\/p>  <p>  For my own party, this is an historic day as we enter our third consecutive Government, something we are doing for the first time.  On a personal level, it is of course tinged with real sadness to see so many friends and colleagues leave office.  When we met before travelling over to the Convention Centre, we numbered just seven.  It seemed like the room was empty.  I know the Fine Gael Ministers appointed today will serve our country to the very best of their ability, working to build a better future in the best traditions of our party.  I also pay tribute to those who are no longer Ministers and served our country faithfully and courageously over the past few years.  I also pay tribute to their staff.  People often forget that behind every politician and Minister, there are advisers and support staff, many of whom will be made redundant in the next few days.  I am honoured to be appointed the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and I look forward to taking up a new role with new responsibilities.  Today is not, however, a day for celebration for Fine Gael, far from it.  We are doing what is right for the country but it comes at a cost.  <\/p>  <p>  Ag obair in &eacute;ineacht le Fianna F&aacute;il agus an P&aacute;irt&iacute; Glas beidh muid in an ann t&eacute;arnamh geilleagrach &aacute;r dt&iacute;re a sti&uacute;radh, poist agus rath&uacute;nas a thabhairt ar ais, dul i ngleic le tortha&iacute; na paind&eacute;ime agus gn&iacute;omh&uacute; ar athr&uacute; aer&aacute;ide at&aacute; riachtanach chun &aacute;r dt&iacute;r agus &aacute;r bpl&aacute;in&eacute;ad a chaomhn&uacute;.  Our country has been through a terrible emergency in which many people have lost their lives and more have had to live with illness and fear of illness.  Jobs have been lost, businesses destroyed and our economy upended.  Across the world, countries have been badly affected by Covid-19 and are being affected by the consequences of climate breakdown.  This Government will take the transformative action required to rebuild what has been swept away, repair what has been damaged and renew what has been lost.  The mission of this new Government is, therefore, a simple one.  We seek to be a Government of action that will deliver the kind of change that people demanded in the last election, a change not defined by one party but rather by the policies, priorities and actions we take as a new Government.<\/p>  <p>  We seek to be a Government of enterprise, creating jobs and preparing for the jobs and workplaces of the future, driving our economic recovery and improving quality of life for all our people.  We seek to be a Government of engagement, engaging with our citizens and countries around the world, at the heart of the European Union and offering leadership in the United Nations.  Our parties have very different histories and temperaments but we are united by a determination to help Ireland to recover and thrive.  We have respect for each other's policies, beliefs and values and we will work through any differences that arise for the greater good.  <\/p>  <p>  This Government must hit the ground running, starting today.  We must get places reopened and people back to work and repair what has been damaged.  Next month, we will unveil the July stimulus to kick-start our economy.  Its recovery fund will be targeted to increase domestic demand and employment and deliver balanced regional growth.  I believe we have the opportunity to drive strategic change through our small and medium enterprises, accelerate job creation, decarbonise the economy, ensure Ireland is at the forefront of the digital future and bring about a more equal economy for all.<\/p> <p>In autumn, around budget time, we will produce our national economic plan, a far-reaching and long-term vision to restore full employment.  It will show how to secure public finances in a world that must live with Covid-19.  The plan will also drive our efforts to decarbonise the economy and prepare for the next phases of technological transformation.  We do not have any time to waste and must act now.<\/p> <p> Over recent months, when things were at their worst, we saw our country and its people at their best.  We have faced severe challenges but today is a day of new beginnings and therefore is a day of hope for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700027#FF00300","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1593261000,"counter":74,"content":"<p>It is a great honour to be a part of the acting out of our Constitution here today.  Appointing a Taoiseach and being a part of the Cabinet appointed by him is the greatest honour in our democratic, constitutional Republic, and we seek to live up to that as best we can.<\/p>  <p>  The Cabinet has a pivotal role in the Irish Constitution and political decision-making.  We operate a system with collective Cabinet responsibility which also brings collective Cabinet authority.  I may be wrong, but I understand that the traditional position is that the Cabinet does not vote \"Yes\" or \"No\" on issues.  An issue that comes to the Cabinet has had a lot of work done on it in advance and three things can happen, namely, it can be accepted, it can be amended, or the Cabinet can decide to revert back to it again so that the issue is resolved.  That system gives us great strength.  That sense of common, collective ability in the Cabinet to come to a conclusion, while sometimes difficult, leads to good decision-making.  The Green Party commits to working with the other two parties in a trusting way to make things work on behalf of our people, particularly because we are in such a difficult time.  We are in the midst of a crisis that we have not seen before.<\/p>  <p>  To consider how to approach that crisis, I will briefly look back on the history of the State because there are lessons from the past that this Government, Cabinet, Ministers of State and the wider Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad can try to apply as they engage in the process that will unfold in the next four or five years.  We should look to some of our past successes, including the strategic decisions that were made in the early part of the past decade when we decided to invest in Science Foundation Ireland and research, and became a country that is good in industries such as digital technologies and medical devices, and that focused on new, advanced technologies.  That was a strategic decision made by politicians at the time, implemented by public servants and lived out in the daily lives of hundreds of thousands of Irish people who took part in the transformation that saw our economy and society become remarkably successful in advanced manufacturing, advanced services and technology.  We should keep on that path.  In fact, we should double down to try to become even better in those areas by asking what the new technological changes and investments will be.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the Departments that have now been set up are aimed at innovation and connecting our academic and business communities, our civil society and the Government.  That will be pivotal to the success of this country.  We must be willing to take risks, make mistakes and fail because that is the only way we will succeed.  We will learn lessons from the things that do not work and we can multiply and roll out the things that do work.  We must be open to, and invest in, innovation in our education systems.  We must invest in a State that is willing to be enterprising and take risks, that will not hammer a public servant who makes a creative decision that goes wrong because we can learn from that mistake.<\/p>  <p>  Another example of how to get out of a crisis dates back to the late 1980s.  We had gone through a long and deep recession at that time.  The history books will give various versions of what happened and credit for the emergence from that recession is sometimes given to cultural events, such as the Irish football team beating England in the 1988 European Championships and Mary Robinson calling people to dance.  Various things lifted our spirits.  I think that central to the recovery of that time was a social partnership that went right down to community level.  It was a result of the work of the National Economic and Social Council and others, including politicians of the time, investing in community development and leadership.  Investing in communities was seen as a way of helping to eradicate poverty, and community leaders were built up.  It was not all the work of the State.  The State facilitated communities to come out of bad times, and it worked.  We were good at that.  We were seen as one of the best examples in Europe of how the LEADER programme and community enterprise schemes could work.  I set up a small business through a community enterprise learning scheme with the help of Mr. Tommy Simpson in Cabra.  He helped me up in the first days of getting a business going.  That community approach really worked and I think that, in every Department of the Government, we should be looking to put a focus on community and encouraging a bottom up recovery.  The State should not do everything for people but should facilitate community groups to thrive.  We lost some of that orientation during the past decade and it is time to bring it back at scale and everywhere.<\/p>  <p>  Another lesson we can learn happened before my time.  How does a country change strategic direction?  I believe we can see an example in the period of T.K. Whitaker and Se&aacute;n Lemass, both public servants and politicians.  They, and others, turned Ireland from a closed economy to an open one.  That brought a lot of our success.  That change came because there was broad political agreement at the time, following crises of the 1950s that included mass emigration, unemployment and widespread poverty.  There was an agreement that the country had to change.  In that agreement, which lasted 20 or 30 years, we were able to make strategic decisions that helped us to change our path and become a country that is open to the world.  There was collective agreement around investment in education, joining the European Union and being good at foreign direct investment.  It took 20 or 30 years for the rewards of that consistency to come through but it worked for the country and we need the same today.<\/p>  <p>  We need agreement that we are going to move from an unsustainable to a sustainable model of the economy, that we are going to go green.  We can do so with confidence because most parties in this House agree with that proposal.  Parties of the left and right, or whatever their position, and Independents agree.  They realise that Irish people think that we are going to be good at making the necessary changes and it is time to do so.  We are well placed to make that strategic change.<\/p>  <p>  Europe is also making changes with the Green New Deal.  That is the direction the new economy is moving in and, therefore, it is the way that innovation is going.  More than anything else, we know that it will not work if it is not community first and from the bottom up.  We need community energy and agreement on how we build houses, run public transport, provide safe routes to schools and other things that help us build communities as well as cutting out the carbon in our society.  We should create a local environment that is healthy in every way.<\/p>  <p>  We will set about this task with pride on this weekend when, in non-Covid-19 times, the Pride parade would have passed along the quays outside this building, as people from Dublin know.  Pride is an incredible occasion that gives one pride in this country.  We should be a Government that adopts that as our approach.  We must welcome diversity, be open and creative.  We seek to do whatever we can to get this country out of a deep recession using lessons from the past but facing the future in a way that will serve our country with pride.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700028#GG00200","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1593261000,"counter":75,"content":"<p>I extend my good wishes to An Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  I have no doubt that this is a proud day for him, his people and his community.  I also extend good wishes to all those who have now been appointed to ministerial offices because this is a cause for celebration for all of them.<\/p> <p>In February last, we presented a manifesto for change to the people and we asked them to give us a chance to deliver that change, to lead.  The people by way of response gave us a record mandate to enter government.  That was not to be on this occasion but, nonetheless, we have witnessed a realignment of Irish politics.  Sinn F&eacute;in, for the first time, will now lead the Opposition and Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have formally come together.  The widespread expectation that a change election would be followed by the formation of a new Government that could deliver the new politics that people are crying out for was not to be.  The century-old impulse to grab power, to maintain the old political order, to push back against the instinct and energy for change so powerfully demonstrated at the ballot box, drew Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael together.  The truth is they have coalesced and colluded in frustrating the voice of change.  A Cheann Comhairle, excluding the representatives of more than half a million citizens is nothing to be proud of in my book.  I do not think it is something any democrat should boast about.  Indeed, succeeding in stalling or stopping necessary change is really no success at all.  It is the mark of narrow, failed politics of the past.<\/p> <p> That narrow kind of thinking is reflected in the unambitious programme for Government.  This will be a Government of more of the same.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael in government is no historical departure.  However, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael forced into a loveless embrace by the hopeful vote of the people; that now is the historical point of departure for their Government.  Some have described this as the end of so-called Civil War politics.  The reality is that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael today have precious little to do with anything that was at issue in that tragic conflict.  The words of Liam Mellows, a patriot himself executed by the Free State, in his speech against the Treaty, ring very true today: \"Men will hold power, and men who get into positions and hold power will desire to remain undisturbed and will not want to be removed.\"  For decades, the issue between Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il was supposedly, mar dhea, about Civil War issues.  In reality, the ancient quarrel between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael has long since descended into a race for power and privilege in this State.  Forgotten, abandoned in all of this were those who suffered most from the partition of our country, the people of the Six Counties.  Forgotten and abandoned was any plan to achieve full democracy, self-determination and unity for Ireland; and so, the great national project of reunification is not included in the programme for Government.  There is not a whisper from this Government, while the conversation about constitutional change happens all across our island.  This is especially concerning during the age of Brexit, when the imperative to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all of its parts has never been greater.  A united Ireland is the very best idea for the future of our country.  It is essential to the prosperity of all our people because growing our economy requires an all-Ireland approach.  Protecting our health services requires an all-Ireland approach.  Getting ahead of Covid-19, protecting public health and protecting our people's health requires an all-Ireland approach.  No Government, not least an incoming Government, in this period should ignore the imperative of unity.  It should be planning for change and reunification and for that referendum on Irish unity as per the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p> A Cheann Comhairle, the society shaped by the old establishment divides us between the haves and the have-nots, the insiders and the outsiders, the entitled and the rest.  That is why Government after Government has presided over a housing crisis.  It is an indictment of successive Governments that housing is so unaffordable for so many.  It is also why our health system is broken, crippled by hospital overcrowding, a never-ending trolley crisis and record-breaking treatment waiting lists.  It is also why the principle of fairness is breached daily in every aspect of Irish life.  The Ireland of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael is a place where 65 year olds cannot retire in dignity with their State pension.  It is one where working parents cannot afford childcare, where educational disadvantage is all too prevalent, where citizens living with disabilities and their carers are forgotten, and where those with mental health challenges are left to fend for themselves.  None of this is accidental.  All of this is the consequence of bad politics.  It is why Governments come and go but nothing really changes.  Irish politics is broken and the way of fixing it is by heeding the people's demand for change.  The people know this and they have said in record numbers that the time for change is now, and people are ready for a fresh start.  Those who drafted the programme for Government, I feel, must live in a different reality from the rest of us.  The crises in housing and healthcare dominated the election and both have deepened during the Covid crisis.  On top of that, many families are now facing what has been described as a tsunami of debt, as insurance companies were allowed to continue their rip-off, as banks charged interest to 80,000 families who had to take a mortgage break.<\/p> <p> People need homes that they can afford.  I call on the Taoiseach and the new Government to build the affordable homes and make sure they are actually affordable in the real world.  People need to be able to see a doctor when they are sick, so the Government must invest in public hospitals and our public system and end the privatisation agenda.  What is proposed in the Government's plan, far from tackling these challenges, will only deepen our problems.  The issues that mattered most to ordinary people in the course of the election are dodged or fudged.  However, the Government has managed to include tax breaks for those at the top in its programme.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il from the get-go have copped out on delivering common-sense solutions for workers and families.  The brief enlightenment in which we saw a turn to more progressive decisions during the Covid-19 emergency has been extinguished by the programme for Government.  For Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, fairness can only ever be a temporary thing, a reaction rather than a principle of good government.<\/p> <p>Because of its lack of ambition, this is a Government already on borrowed time.  Workers and families know that they deserve so much better.  It is that belief that will drive Sinn F&eacute;in's determination to deliver effective Opposition.  We have the policies, a Cheann Comhairle.  We have the team.  Deputy Doherty has the plan to shape a fair economy, Deputy O'Reilly that for a national health service.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin has the plan to make housing affordable.  We are happy to share those plans with the Government and if it is serious about tackling these issues, it will work with those plans.  I am very proud to lead our team of 37 Deputies, a team committed to realising a changed Ireland, a fair Ireland and a united Ireland.  We will stand up for all of those who voted for change.  We will work hard for them and it is in their name that we will hold the Government to account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700028#GG00300","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1593261600,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  I want to congratulate formally the Taoiseach on his appointment.  It is an extremely special day, particularly for his wife, Mary, his children and wider family, and definitely his community.  During his contribution earlier I could feel from the emotion in his voice how important his community is.  I am sure he is looking forward to getting back among them in the coming days and I wish him well, sincerely.<\/p> <p>The Taoiseach brings huge experience to the role given the length of time he has spent in different ministries.  I am someone who very much admires the legislation he introduced in 2004 on the smoking ban.  It changed a great deal of health and social issues in Ireland, it changed thinking and was very formative and ahead of its time.  More of that thinking would be really appreciated in these difficult times.  The Taoiseach also has a special interest in education.  He, like myself and unlike his predecessor, comes from a public school background.  Indeed, I think that we are in a minority as his predecessor, the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in, the leader of People Before Profit, and the leader of RISE all come from private schools.  I am glad that the Taoiseach comes from the public school side.  It is to be hoped it will bring an increased interest in education.  That there are two Cabinet Ministers also shows a determination for the area, which I very much welcome.<\/p> <p> I wish to acknowledge the outgoing Taoiseach and current T&aacute;naiste whom I look forward to working with.  He is someone I have worked quite closely with in the past.  I have not often agreed with him, although I have on some occasions, but he is someone who has always been very direct and straight and easy to deal with.  I wish him well in the challenges ahead of him.  I wish all the new Ministers the best of luck in their portfolios, many of which I know very well and some that I, and my colleagues, do not.  I can assure them we will get to know them very well in the coming months and years.<\/p> <p> While Covid has caused this country extraordinary pain and suffering, politically it creates opportunities because it has been a disrupter, and I am asking the Taoiseach to use it.  In health, why limit free GP care to under 12 years?  Why not just introduce universal care?  On Sl&aacute;intecare, we need public beds quickly.  We need to build hospitals, but in the interim, let us nationalise one of the private hospitals.  We should radically introduce profound changes in education across primary and third level, something in which the Taoiseach has a profound interest.  Why not fast-forward some of the ambitions around climate change that are labour intensive, pushing shovel-ready projects and employment.  For jobs, stimulus must concentrate on key areas such as tourism.  I have said before that this programme for Government is weak on workers' rights.  I ask clearly, as it now comes under the T&aacute;naiste's area of responsibility, that an immediate priority of the Government be an appeal to the Supreme Court of the recent decision on sectoral employment orders that protect tens of thousands of ordinary low-paid workers in many areas and sectors in this country.  If it is necessary to introduce emergency legislation, let us do that.  We will make it easier for the Government.  My colleague, Deputy Nash, who inspired these orders through legislation, has already written a Bill.  I ask the Government to please look at it.<\/p> <p> There is speculation that the Taoiseach will appoint 20 Ministers of State.  This would be his first mistake.  I was a member of a Government during very difficult times when 15 Ministers of State were appointed.  That was plenty.  There were no ministerial advisers either.  Taxpayers of Ireland would not appreciate such lavish and indulgent behaviour at this difficult time.  I am sure that when the Taoiseach reflects, he will agree.  The Taoiseach is rotating with the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Finance is rotating with the Minister for Public Expenditure, and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad is rotating too, but in addition the Attorney General will rotate.  That is not good practice.  To have an Attorney General rotate in the middle of a term of office because of political preference is not right and will not lead to good, consistent interpretation of legislation for the needs of Government or the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I brought in rent freezes, which others said were unconstitutional, yet all of a sudden during the Covid crisis, they were constitutional and were introduced.  We need consistency.<\/p> <p> I have many questions around Departments but one is glaring.  We have a new Government.  I congratulate everyone and congratulate the Green Party in particular for being part of it.  However, nowhere is there a mention of a Minster with responsibility for the environment.  Who has the responsibilities for environment and planning?  Who is responsible for all the wider areas of environment outside of climate change?  Who, in particular, is responsible for the Environmental Protection Agency and all other planning reform?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700029#HH00200","speaker":"1610","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1593262200,"counter":79,"content":"<p>It feels almost as though a wartime Government has just been assembled.  We meet here because 1,700 people have lost their lives as a result of a virus that has hit our country.  That should remind us all of our collective endeavour to beat this virus and return the country to some level of normality.  Politics can be a harsh business, it can be quite personal at times, and in that environment the country needs to see politics working better.  That is why it is disappointing to hear words such as \"betrayal\" and even \"hatred\" mentioned earlier today.  My party tries not to trade in hatred or division but to oppose the elements of what Government does that we feel are wrong and support what it does that we feel is right.<\/p>  <p>  I want the minds of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to turn to the words of Thomas Johnson who, just over 100 years ago, wrote in the Democratic Programme of the First D&aacute;il in 1919: \"It shall be the first duty of the Government of the Republic to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the children, to secure that no child shall suffer hunger or cold from lack of food, clothing, or shelter\".  We are in Dublin's north inner city.  The great thing that has liberated those who have been disadvantaged in this country has been education, but what has enslaved them has been inequality and drugs.  This Government proposes two citizens' assemblies, one on education and one on drugs.  I and my party say that if the Government is genuine about radically overhauling the education system, if it is going to treat the 17.9% of Irish adults who are functionally illiterate as a scandal and realise the 30% of children who leave disadvantaged schools have basic reading problems, if it is to understand the difference between one three year old and another is a 66% differential in their oral language capacity, and if it wants to tackle all those issues in its education citizens' assembly, then we will work with the Government and support it because we believe that education is the great liberator.  However, what has enslaved working-class communities is the drug issue, which goes right across the land.  It is the issue of addiction and the criminalisation of those in addition.  Let us treat the drugs crisis as a health issue and use the resources of the State to tackle the drug gangs and not those who suffer from what they do.<\/p>  <p>  We will disagree on tax, the role of the State and its size, and on many other things, but if the Government's endeavour is to eradicate educational disadvantage and illiteracy, and to have a radical change in drug policy, then it will get agreement from the Labour Party on those areas.  It is not about talking about betrayal or about hatred, it is about making politics work for people.  There is so much that can be achieved in these Houses of the Oireachtas if we put aside the pre-written scripts and actually do something for the people who sent us here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700030#JJ00300","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speech","time":1593262200,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Taoiseach.  The idea of the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, will take a bit of getting used to, but on a personal note I wish him well.<\/p> <p>He has waited for this for a long time.  There is no doubt that today must be a very proud day for him and his family.  I also congratulate the Cabinet Ministers who have been appointed today.  <br\/><br\/>The election of a three-party coalition Government is taking place in what are the most inauspicious of circumstances.  As a result of Covid-19, the country is going through a devastating period in which, tragically, 1,736 people have lost their lives, hundreds of thousands of people have lost their livelihoods and countless lives have been changed forever.  Worldwide, we must remind ourselves that we are still in the midst of a deadly pandemic.  Here in Ireland, we must recognise that it remains a real and ever-present danger.  <br\/><br\/>I thank our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Tony Holohan, and all of those working on the front line, in particular, in the health area, but also across retail and other essential services.  These people have done exceptional work over recent months and continue to do that work on behalf of us all.  I also acknowledge members of the public who have adhered magnificently to the advice, despite many having lost loved ones or their jobs and making so many huge sacrifices over recent months.  <br\/><br\/>Today, we must recognise that in February&rsquo;s election the electorate roundly rejected the kind of politics provided by the outgoing Government of Fine Gael supported by Fianna F&aacute;il.  Rarely before had people been so exercised by and so conversant with Government policy and the harmful negative effects much of it was having on their quality of life and that of their families.  People had enough of the high cost of living and the difficulty in accessing those public services which are so essential to living a decent life.  On top of that, there is a raft of other charges and costs, such as insurance, energy costs and mortgage interest, which the Government had failed to control.  All of this was happening in the context of 25% of the workforce being on low pay and an increasingly precarious and insecure world of work.<br\/><br\/>The cruel irony is that the very people who created those problems are today back in power.  During the election, the most common response on the doorsteps to the question of who people would be voting for was, &quot;Not Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael anyway&quot;.  When the votes were counted those once large parties, the Civil War parties, mustered just 43% of the vote between them.  People voted predominantly for a different kind of politics.  They voted for a new approach and a different value system or ideology.  The general election result strongly signified the desire of the Irish people for a fundamental shift towards a more equal, fair and inclusive society.  <br\/><br\/>In mid-April, as the pandemic had taken hold, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael agreed a framework document.  It contained many worthy aspirations and in an apparent candid admission of mistakes made, they made a remarkable statement.  They said: <\/p><blockquote>\tWe know that there is no going back to the old way of doing things.  Radical actions have been taken to protect as many people as possible, and new ways of doing things have been found in a time of crisis.  The importance of the well resourced, properly functioning and responsive State has never been clearer. <\/blockquote> <p>For a moment, we thought that lessons had been learned, the penny had finally dropped and there was a realisation that a strong State is critical to the well-being of a society and to people&rsquo;s lives.  When the pandemic struck the frailties of our State were all too graphically exposed in an under-resourced public health service with nowhere near enough staff or hospital beds; our arm&rsquo;s length privatised model of social care; the prevalence of low-paid, low-hours work with limited rights and protections; our disjointed, underfunded, mainly for-profit childcare services; high rents and lack of security for many tenants; overcrowded and overpriced housing; inhumane conditions in direct provision; and so many other weaknesses.  <br\/><br\/>In responding to Covid-19, the Government moved to socialise many of these essential public services because that was the only way we would survive.  Initially, it seemed as if the Government was serious about radical change.  However, very soon it became clear that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael fully intended going back to the old ways of doing things as soon as Covid had been brought under control.  People had voted for permanent change and a genuine social contract where people pay taxes according to their means and, in return, have access to universal public services and where Government works for the common good.  That was never the Fine Gael way, however.  It is a party which operates on the basis that the market is king and that if one cannot afford to pay for the essential services that are available as of right in most other European countries, it is tough luck and one does not get access to those services.  That is one of the reasons that, when Fine Gael approached the Social Democrats with a view to coalition, we knew it was not going to change its spots.  It was clear that while Fine Gael talked the talk of inclusion and public services, there was no financial underpinning to the aspirations.  So it is with the programme for Government.  There is continued reliance on developers for the elusive affordable housing that we have been promised so often.  We will have another 18 months of free rein and poor planning standards with strategic housing developments.  Sl&aacute;intecare is supposedly to be accelerated but without any budget until at least 2022.  The diversion of funding from the public healthcare system through the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, will continue.  There is no indication of a public model of childcare and no reform of corporation tax or other taxes, and on it goes.<br\/><br\/>The lack of any real funding commitment to change runs right through the programme for Government.  It is clear that following the immediate crisis, the intention is to get back to business as usual.  Key questions about the size and duration of the stimulus package needed and the extent of the borrowing required are kicked down the road.<br\/><br\/>Fianna F&aacute;il, on the other hand, had choices about where it would go.  It knew very well that the market-led politics of Fine Gael, which it supported for the past four years, had done the country and both parties much damage.  However, when it had an opportunity to make a break with the past, shift to the left and lead a genuine social democratic Government that people had voted for, it eschewed that opportunity and instead locked itself into Fine Gael.  That is an utterly retrograde step for the country.  <br\/><br\/>I genuinely hope the Green Party is successful in furthering the climate change and biodiversity agenda but I have to express concern about that being possible to achieve within the prevailing agenda of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  The lack of any commitment to a reduction in carbon emissions in the context of the national herd is reflective of just that challenge.  <br\/><br\/>For our part, the expanded Social Democrats group will play a constructive and positive role in this D&aacute;il.  We will fight unapologetically for a fair society based on high quality universal public services and for the kind of politics which challenges the many vested interests in Irish society and hold us back so much.  We will provide strong opposition in order to hold the Government to account and we will work tirelessly to further the ideals of social democracy in order to create the kind of society we believe will serve the best interests of all of the Irish people.

I am confident that Fianna F&aacute;il will look after the developers and the builders and I am confident that the Green Party will act as a mudguard for both of them.

Brian Dobson on RT&Eacute; asked whether we might put the label \"centre-left\" on this Government.  If he is watching, the answer is \"No\", we might not put the label \"centre-left\" on this Government, because if one puts together the two right-wing parties that have ruled this country in the interest of the rich for almost a century, if one adds the Green Party, which signed up to a neo-liberal programme for Government, and then one throws in some of the most right-wing Independent Deputies in this D&aacute;il, what one gets is not a centre-left Government.  What one gets, very clearly, is a right-wing Government.<\/p>  <p>  I want to use my speech to appeal to the left-wing green activists who put up an impressive fight against this coalition to leave the Green Party.  The fact that the deal passed does not change one single fact and the truth they spoke about the programme for Government.  It is still a programme for austerity.  It is still a programme that will worsen the housing crisis.  It is still a programme that gives a tax cuts to the very highest earners with one hand while preparing for eco-austerity taxes for working-class people with the other.  <\/p>  <p>  The point has been made that this Government brings to the fore a left-right divide in Irish politics.  The question to green activists is which side of that divide do they want to be on?  Entering into government with Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael ends any possibility that ever existed of the Green Party being a vehicle for the radical change that we need.  It will be wiped out at the next general election.  More importantly, those young people, the people mobilising on the streets demanding system change, not climate change, will not be attracted to a party that is managing the capitalist system.  We need their involvement in social movements that will drive change.  We will need to work together to build movements for climate, housing and social justice, because even with a right-wing Government in power, we can win victories.  We need also to build a broad party of the anti-capitalist and eco-socialist left.  Left activists who leave the Green Party could play a crucial role in that.  There should be a space in that party for all who share a commitment to people power movements to drive change, for all who oppose environmental destruction, austerity and oppression and for all who rule out coalition with the establishment parties.  Leave the Green Party.  Join with the left in fighting against this right-wing Government.  Do not be a mudguard for it.

I do not often agree with Deputy Varadkar but I think he is right on this one and the official end of Civil War politics is a significant moment.<\/p>  <p>  Irish capitalism has had two key parties down the decades.  For almost 100 years now, there has not been a single Government that has not been led by one or other of those parties or their direct predecessors.  When Fianna F&aacute;il lost popularity, Fine Gael could fill the breach.  When Fine Gael dropped the ball, Fianna F&aacute;il could step in and save the day.  That strategy has run its course.  It is a game that can no longer be played.  I suspect that the more far-sighted strategists of capital may pay more attention now to courting Sinn F&eacute;in in an attempt to make it a safe alternative if and when this Government's time is done.  Before the last general election, IBEC's Danny McCoy said the business community absolutely could work with Sinn F&eacute;in.  Johnny Ronan, no less, described Sinn F&eacute;in's investment policies as sensible stuff.  Sinn F&eacute;in received a big vote from working people in February, a vote for real change, but, of course, one cannot deliver for working people while keeping IBEC and the Johnny Ronans of this world onside.  If there is a charm offensive from big business on that front, Sinn F&eacute;in should not succumb to it.  <\/p>  <p>  For our part, we will promote the politics of class in this D&aacute;il.

We will approach the July stimulus and the new economic plan in October from the point of view of vigorously promoting those interests.  On green issues, we will oppose attempts to make working people pay for the environmental crisis, as shown by increases in the carbon tax, while advocating for environmentally-friendly policies that benefit ordinary people, such as free public transport.  We will seek to expose the profit system as being the central danger to the environment in the world today.

I wish the incoming Government the very best of luck in what will be a very challenging time for our country over the coming years.  The programme for Government is ambitious, and while I do not agree with everything in it, I will support it as long as it means our country is on the road to recovery.  In recent D&aacute;il terms, my constituency of Louth and east Meath has been neglected at ministerial level.  As a result, we have lost out on valuable resources and supports.  As an Independent Deputy, I will always put my constituency of Louth and east Meath first and fight to ensure we receive our fair share of resources.<\/p>  <p>  I wish the incoming Minister for Health the very best of luck in his new role.  My commitment to the restoration of full services to Louth County Hospital will continue in this D&aacute;il.  Unless the Minister can give me his full support in returning services to Louth County Hospital, I cannot guarantee my ongoing support for the Government.  I gave this commitment to the people of Louth and east Meath during my time in the House and I intend to keep up this fight.  To this end I look forward to working with the incoming Minister to ensure that Louth hospital will be supported in terms of both resources and services during this D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  Our country has suffered greatly in recent months as a result of the Covid-19 crisis.  Everybody has been affected in some form or another.  Many have lost loved ones or their livelihood or face a very uncertain future.  Every sector has been badly affected, none more so than that of tourism.  Coming from the north east, I know more than most the importance of tourism to the local economy and the livelihood of local people.  I congratulate the incoming Minister with responsibility for tourism and look forward to working with her as we try to rebuild the tourism sector.  Areas of great natural beauty such as the Cooley peninsula and the Boyne Valley rely heavily on tourism, and we must ensure we support businesses in order for them to open again.  Such businesses employ thousands of people, not only directly but also indirectly.  They are vital to their local areas and must be supported.<\/p>  <p>  I take the opportunity to highlight the importance of sport to this country.  We have seen during the lockdown how important sport is.  In this regard, I want to work closely with the incoming Minister with responsibility for sport to ensure the level of supports required to bring back the sporting organisations.  As chairman of Louth GAA, I know personally how important the GAA is to local communities.  The extent of voluntary work carried out by members of local GAA clubs needs to be acknowledged and praised.  We in Louth GAA are fighting hard to get our own county grounds in Dundalk, and all the clubs and their members are putting their shoulders to the wheel to bring this dream to a reality.  I make no apologies for stating I look forward to working with the incoming Government and the GAA to ensure that this badly needed stadium is completed.<\/p>  <p>  Coming from the Border area, I understand the devastating effect that Brexit will have if we do not put in place the measures necessary to deal with it.  There are still so many unanswered questions.  I am deeply concerned that the effects could be disastrous for Border towns such as my town of Dundalk.  I am also very concerned about the lack of clarity on many issues, such as the information available to businesses.  We still do not have a roadmap.  We have constantly been told there will be no hard border, no issues for cross-Border workers and no checks at the Border.  The people of the Border counties - Louth, Monaghan, Cavan, Leitrim and Donegal - need answers now so they can prepare properly for Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  I again wish the incoming Government the very best of luck in this D&aacute;il term.  I have supported it today, and voted for Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin as Taoiseach, because I believe that the country needs a strong and stable Government at this crucial time.  The country does not need another election, just a stable Government.  My support, however, is not unconditional.  I will vote against the Government if I do not agree with it.  The people of Louth and east Meath elected me as an Independent Deputy.  I will support the Government when I believe that it is doing what is right but, equally, will vote against it if I consider that the right thing to do.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I congratulate the new Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, and all his Cabinet colleagues.  I look forward to both working with them and holding them to account throughout the lifetime of this D&aacute;il.  I commend the outgoing Government on its work in the face of Covid-19.  The then Taoiseach, the then Minister for Health, Dr. Tony Holohan, all the front-line staff and everybody else involved made a team effort and the golden word was \"communication\".  If the new Government communicates to the people in the same way that was done for the past three or four months, it will have a good chance of going the whole way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700033#MM00200","speaker":"1600"},{"type":"speech","time":1593264000,"counter":89,"content":"<p>Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, ba mhaith liom mo chomhghairdeas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Taoiseach nua, an Teachta Miche&aacute;l Martin.

The role they have been given is a massive opportunity for them, but if it is used properly, it will also be a massive opportunity for the country.  My advice to them is not to be passengers on the bus they are on.  They should drive their Departments in the direction they need to go.  Nevertheless, I am amazed that, from what I can work out from the list of Ministers, there will be no Minister from counties Donegal to Clare on the west coast of Ireland.  It is quite clear that the centre of gravity of both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael is moving eastward all the time.  There was a saying when I was growing up: the west is awake.  It is clear the west is not awake in either Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael at the moment.<\/p>  <p>  People have said this is an historic day, but the parties that have ruled Ireland since the foundation of the State are still ruling the State.  What we are witnessing today is the creation of a Government that nobody wanted.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party did not want this Government.  We in Aont&uacute; have been saying since January that if one votes for Fianna F&aacute;il, one will get Fine Gael, and we were hammered by those in Fianna F&aacute;il for saying so, but we were right.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin has become Taoiseach, but at the cost of deleting the core principles of Fianna F&aacute;il's founding fathers, of Irish unity and economic justice.  Many of the thousands of people within Fianna F&aacute;il who voted against this will see it for what it is, namely, a swap of power for principle.  It is also noteworthy that this building, in which Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin was elected Taoiseach today, was bailed out by the National Asset Management Agency as a result of decisions made by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin's previous Cabinet.  The big wheel keeps on turning in this country.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland finds itself again on the verge of a very significant crisis.  The programme for Government is completely oblivious to the economic tidal wave currently hitting this country.  The State is likely to have a budget deficit of &euro;30 billion this year, yet that mountainous debt, which casts a radical shadow over everything the incoming Government will do over the next five years, has hardly been mentioned in this Chamber.  Not only does the programme for Government, the founding document of this Administration, not deal with that fact, but it hardly recognises its existence.<\/p>  <p>  When we in Aont&uacute; sat down with Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to test whether they were really about change in this proposed Government, it became blindingly clear to us that only vague generalities about finance would be discussed.  It also became clear to us that signing up to the programme for Government would be akin to signing a blank cheque.  It also struck us how promises made before the general election by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Deputies throughout the country have disappeared like snow off a ditch from the programme for Government.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael candidates just five months ago made serious promises on housing, health, fair income for farmers, protection for workers and regional development and, in my constituency, the undergrounding of a North-South interconnector and the Navan to Dublin railway line.  These promises are impossible to find within this programme for Government.  As one political cynic said, it is not about what one does in election campaigns anyway.<\/p>  <p>  I have heard Fianna F&aacute;il representatives being questioned about the lack of Fianna F&aacute;il influence in the programme for Government but I disagree.  Fianna F&aacute;il's fingerprints are all over it.  The proposed coalition Government has pledged to establish no fewer than three citizens' assemblies, two working groups, four committees, at least four task forces, an expert group, at least two councils, two forums, seven commissions and at least 73 reviews.  This is the hallmark of a can-kicking Government.  It is a manifesto for indecision.  We, the people of Ireland, are better than this.  The will, the skills and the passion of the people of Ireland are better than this.<\/p>  <p>The best of this nation has burned most brightly in the most difficult times, from the United Irishmen right up to 1916.  If we were able to remove the largest empire the world had ever seen from this country 100 years ago, we in this generation can build a prosperous, united, fair Ireland based on liberty, equality and fraternity, but it is clear this will not be done by a political class built on career politics and personal ambition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700033#MM00300","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1593264600,"counter":91,"content":"<p>We will move on to the rural Independents, beginning with Deputy Mattie McGrath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700034#NN00200","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1593264600,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies Michael Healy-Rae and Richard O&rsquo;Donoghue.<\/p>  <p>  From the outset, my colleagues and I in the Rural Independent Group made ourselves available for talks with all parties to try to form a Government.  We met Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Sinn F&eacute;in but sadly there was no follow-up.  I said at the outset that the wish of the electorate was for change and that its wish should be respected, but Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael refused to engage with Sinn F&eacute;in.  Sinn F&eacute;in failed to come back with an alternative despite promises of further meetings, partly with our group.  I consulted my constituents widely in recent days on this Government and noted there were other opportunities and possibilities.  A national Government could have been formed.  We had the perfect scenario with Covid and the co-operation that existed in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The focus in the document on urban centres and the uneven focus on agricultural development are crazy.  Consider the number of Ministers we now have from Dublin and Cork.  From Cork and Dublin, and out as far as Greystones, I believe I counted ten.  What about the rest of Ireland?  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n mentioned the stretch from Donegal to Clare but he can continue right down to Limerick and from there to Tipperary on the N24 and indeed down to Waterford, Contae Phort L&aacute;irge in the south east.  The south east has been abandoned.  The east has not been; it is all about Dublin and there is nothing about the country.  I am very disappointed in the Taoiseach over that: so rural Ireland does not need development because it is the right thing to do.  I refer to the fact that the Government wants to give us crumbs and put some little things out to us because it wants everything in Dublin. <\/p>  <p>  Rural affairs is now mixed up with social protection.  That is a crazy scenario.  It tells us how little the Government thinks of rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The position on disabilities is even worse because responsibility has been transferred to the Department responsible for children.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin was Minister for Health and Children.  I remind him that disabilities are not confined to children.  Unfortunately, they go from the cradle to the grave.  It is a shocking indictment of the Taoiseach's judgment.<\/p>  <p>  During the Covid-19 pandemic, we have seen the great advantages of living in rural Ireland.  The Taoiseach drives through it every day going to Dublin.  Maybe he did not see it in the past 12 weeks.  We experienced a wonderful rejuvenation by our people, not by the Government.  All we need is our fair share of Government supports.  I feel that the programme for Government will not deliver for rural Ireland.  As Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n implied, there are 102 actions, or inactions, and talking shops &ndash; in other words, fudges.<\/p>  <p>  I worry about some other points in the programme.  Incidentally, I do not believe they were in the document that went to Fianna F&aacute;il.  The Taoiseach said today he is delighted to be the Prime Minister of a free nation, yet he is going to have an exclusion zone around places where abortions are carried out.  Where is the freedom there?  Where are the freedom to protest and the freedom of speech?<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach states he is going to deal with legislation on hate crime.  Who is going to decide what hate crime is?  What elite group?  Where is the free Ireland in this regard?  We have not been free since we kowtowed to Europe and the banks.  The banks are our masters along with our European masters and those further afield.  This all happened when Fianna F&aacute;il joined up with ALDE in Europe.  It sold its soul and everything else with it.  We have the result of it here today.<\/p>  <p>  On the last occasion, we spent six weeks engaging in the negotiations on the programme Government.  This time, we had no consultation.  I accept the Government parties did not need us but they may need us yet.<\/p>  <p>  I wish all the Ministers well in their roles but I am concerned about agriculture.  One of the Ministries includes culture, the arts, media, tourism, sport and the Gaeltacht and I am sure whatever you are having yourself when the pubs open on Monday.  My God, such a portfolio.  Who has it only a Deputy from An Comhaontas Glas?  It covers greyhound racing, coursing and indeed horse racing, huge industries that are important to my county.  Deputy Catherine Martin and others have expressed a wish to see the demise of these sports.  These are sports but they are also industries in rural Ireland that are of the people and run by the people.  I say \"Hands off\" because the people will not tolerate this.  We have lost enough.<\/p>  <p>  I wish the Taoiseach and Ministers well in their roles but I am very concerned about the programme for Government.  There is no costing for any action.  It is a matter of kicking the can down the road and saying, \"Live horse and you will get grass.\"  The people are not eejits.  They are very smart and intelligent-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700034#NN00300","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1593264600,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I have to call the next speaker.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700034#NN00400","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1593264600,"counter":94,"content":"<p>A free country, how are you, Taoiseach Martin, when you are going to bring in legislation on hate speech for an elite group and challenge the right of people to protest peacefully to save lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700034#NN00500","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1593264600,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I congratulate all the Ministers.

I know her late Dad, Denis, is looking down privately today, and rightly so.  I wish her nothing but success in her role.  I remind her, starting today, that many of the schools in my county are in danger of losing teachers or are desperately trying to hold on to them.  I remind her of Gaelscoil Mhic Easmainn, schools in Glenbeigh, Aghatubrid and the Black Valley, and other schools like them around County Kerry and the rest of the country.  There is a massive job of work to be done.  With regard to SUSI grants, the whole system will have to be overhauled to make education more accessible and affordable.  That is desperately important.<\/p>  <p>  Why has rural affairs been lumped in with social protection?  I have every confidence in Deputy Heather Humphreys, whom I know is excellent, but I just do not agree with treating rural affairs in this way.  I do not believe it is right.<\/p>  <p>  I challenge the Green Party and ask it to prove me wrong.  The people of rural Ireland are afraid of the Green Party and of what its policies are going to cost and they are afraid they will be adversely affected.  I ask the party to prove me wrong, if it can.  I do not want it to attack our family farms or live exports.  I do not want it to make it impossible for family farms to keep going.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the outgoing Ministers who are no longer Ministers in the new Government.  I sincerely look forward to working with the new Ministers.<\/p>  <p>  I ask Deputy Catherine Martin, in particular, to consider the VAT rate in the tourism sector, which is desperately trying to get back up on its feet.  She should remember County Kerry is the tourism capital not of Ireland but of the world.<\/p>  <p>  I congratulate the new Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  I ask him not to forget the name of the young man I named here earlier today.  I ask the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, to remember Ronan Foley, Dungeel, Killorglin, who has a 90-degree curve in his spine and who is in agony as we speak.  He has been waiting for 20 months for an operation that he should have had within four months.  I say respectfully to the new Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, that if he can start off by looking into that case and trying to get the young man his operation, I will be forever indebted to him.<\/p>  <p>  I am not a negative person.  On a day like today, I wish the Government and each of its Ministers success.  I will do my job diligently in opposition, keeping each and every one of the Ministers and their Departments on their toes in the best and most workperson-like way possible for the betterment of the people of Kerry and the rest of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700034#NN00600","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1593264600,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the work of the outgoing Taoiseach and the former Minister for Health during the pandemic.

We met Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Green Party and Sinn F&eacute;in but the only parties that wanted to talk about government were Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party, even though they limited the amount of talk with us.

There was a reward offered for Sinn F&eacute;in after four weeks for information on where the party was with its mandate.

I and my colleagues in Independents 4 Change have since that time consistently asked for a change.  We asked the Government to declare a housing emergency almost five years ago and we asked it to look at public health.  We asked the Government to declare a climate emergency and speak in an honest and open fashion to the people of Ireland, as that is what they have asked of us.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies today have spoken about messages from the electorate and the people are ahead of us in almost everything.  They were ahead of us in demanding change in Galway with respect to an integrated public transport system and 24,000 people asked, at the very least, for a feasibility study for a light rail project.  The people are ahead of us in their demands for public health but the theme has been that they do not want spin.  The language should mean something.<\/p>  <p>  Since that time, the housing crisis has deepened and the health crisis has worsened.  The Covid-19 crisis, if it has done nothing else, exposed how badly we had run down our public health service.  In March, when we first began to speak about the Covid-19 crisis, I read aloud some of a letter that we had all received from F&oacute;rsa pointing out that prior to Covid-19 an emergency had existed in our primary care services.<\/p>  <p>  We will agree with the new Cabinet on some matters and not on others but let us make language mean something.  When we look at mental health, as a mark of the Government's bona fides, it should immediately establish an independent review panel.  It sat previously for two three-year periods and it was extremely successful.  It should be re-established immediately as a matter of urgency.  As a mark of the Government's bona fides in tackling domestic violence, it should immediately roll out a sufficient number of refuges for women so they can have a safe place to go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700035#OO00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1593265200,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Thank you, Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020062700035#OO00300","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1593265200,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I have five minutes.

There is mention of a public health system but there is also a commitment to private medicine.  There is mention of climate change but the document fails to acknowledge we will fail to meet our progressive targets; we will fail abysmally to meet them in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Eamon Ryan spoke about an ethical basis of doing business and I suggest the Government begins with a discussion on the ethics of where battery materials for electric vehicles come from.  Where does cobalt come from?  It would be a good start to an ethical discussion.

The Minister comes from a fairly peaty area and there is an effort to block farmers from farming areas like that.  The Minister will need to put the foot in straight away.  I know him well as I have worked with him through the years.  I wish him the best of luck in that.<\/p>  <p>  We must also ensure the beef and sheep sectors are looked after.

It is his job to have equality in all parts of the country, ensure regional development takes place and see that people are treated equally no matter where they are.  There are 1.2 million people in the area I have marked in red, which is the same as the number of people in the city of Dublin, which has eight senior Ministers.

The problem is that we have been promised it time and again, Government after Government, yet it does not happen.  The most recent report from the Northern and Western Regional Assembly shows the economic gap between the regions, with lower levels of <i>per capita<\/i>investment in health infrastructure, third level education infrastructure, local, regional and national roads infrastructure, high-value job creation, and research and development in the Northern and Western Regional Assembly area.  A balance of development allows the regions to play to their strengths but it is very difficult for that to happen if there are no voices around the Cabinet table representing those regions that have slipped behind.  Geography matters; that is the reality.  We might like to say it does not matter but it does.  Ministers represent the national interest but a specific interest in and passion for the region they represent really matters.  I said I would loan my vote for today and I will not walk back from that commitment but the Ministers appointed today have a huge responsibility, individually and collectively, to ensure the economic gap is closed.  They can do that both in their own Ministries and by co-ordinated Government action.
