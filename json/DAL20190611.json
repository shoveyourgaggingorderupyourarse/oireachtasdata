We will miss them greatly in terms of the D&aacute;il.<\/p><p>In 1990 the then Minister, Mary Harney, introduced a ban on smoky coal within Dublin city and the Dublin region.  This had a radical and beneficial impact on public health and the environment.  It saved many lives and improved the quality of health of many others.  This was followed by extending the ban to other cities and across the country but not in all locations.<\/p><p>It took courage at the time to do that and it took some foresight.  Thirty years later it is incomprehensible that the last two Fine Gael-led Governments have failed to introduce a nationwide ban on smoky coal despite numerous promises to do so.  An Environmental Protection Agency report on air quality, which is published in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>today following a freedom of information request by Jack Horgan-Jones, reveals the degrees to which towns that are not covered by the smoky coal ban are above World Health Organization air quality guidelines on a continuous basis.  That is at many locations across the country.  Enniscorthy has the highest observed concentrations of this pollutant among all monitoring stations in Ireland.  We can look at Longford town, Roscommon and other areas and see a similar situation.  The pollutants PM<sub>2.5<\/sub>and PM<sub>10<\/sub>are 20% higher there than in Dublin and Cork.  This begs the question of why the lives, health and quality of health of people living in Longford or Enniscorthy are less important to the Government than those living elsewhere.<\/p><p>Professor John Sodeau from UCC has stated in dramatic - probably melodramatic - terms that Enniscorthy risks becoming the New Delhi of Ireland.  He warns that the public health and climate change consequences for those areas not covered by a ban on smoky coal are very severe.  He also refers to air particulate pollution that attacks every cell in the body and carries carcinogens, heavy metals, and acids.  This pollution and harmful material is not just confined to those towns.  It spreads across the country and moves about.  Professor Sodeau makes the central point that air pollution is inseparable from climate change.  Up to 1,500 lives are lost annually as a result of diseases linked to this particular air pollution.  I ask the Taoiseach to read the accounts in<i>The Irish Times<\/i>today of Paula Freeman, an athlete from Enniscorthy, and Breda Flood, a 33 year old GAA activist from Gorey, who cannot watch sport outside during the winter period.  We have had promises from previous Ministers, including Phil Hogan and Deputies Kelly and Naughten on this.  Recently, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, delayed introducing this nationwide ban, 30 years after the first one was introduced.  I ask the Taoiseach why there is such inertia, indecisiveness, lack of courage and conviction in such a vital public health matter, and why the lives and health of people living in those towns without a smoky coal ban are less important to the Government than those that were covered a long time ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100003#A00400","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560258300,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and I join him in congratulating Deputies Clare Daly, Fitzgerald, Wallace and Kelleher on their election to the European Parliament.  I understand that they will continue to be Members of this House until 2 July, but all of us would like to be associated in extending our congratulations to them as they move to a bigger House and new roles.<\/p>  <p>  It is very much Government policy and a Government priority to improve the air quality in our cities, towns and rural areas.  We want to do so not just because of health, because we know that poor air quality has a very severe impact on people, children in particular, with respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema, asthma, but also as part of our climate action agenda.  We can improve air quality in two major ways.  The first is restricting or banning the sale of smoky fossil fuels, and the second is reversing some of the errors made in the past in encouraging people to buy diesel cars, which we now know are very bad for air quality because of nitrous oxide and sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides, SOx and NOx.  The Deputy will be aware that though the then Minister, Mary Harney, did a very good thing for the people of Dublin in banning smoky coal, a subsequent Government did a wrong thing by encouraging people to buy diesel cars, which we now know are very bad for air quality and have damaged the health of our children.<\/p>  <p>  The difficulty we are running into is that a number of coal firms have indicated that they intend to challenge the introduction of a nationwide smoky coal ban, which is Government policy.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, has received advice from the Attorney General on this.  He is determined to reduce the levels of harmful particulate emissions from residential heating and is working to finalise a legally robust plan which will improve air quality, particularly in our cities and towns.  Banning the use of smoky coal would have a positive impact on public health, especially in urban areas, but a number of coal companies have indicated that if the Government attempts to extend the smoky coal ban, they will challenge the new ban as well as the existing ban that applies in Dublin.  If that challenge were successful, not only would we fail to go forward, we may even end up going backwards.  These companies have indicated that they would challenge the ban on the grounds that we should also ban other fossil fuels, such as wood and peat, which they claim do as much harm in terms of air pollution as smoky coal.  We have to give this proper consideration.  We do not want to end up voting for the law of unintended consequences whereby we extend the ban but the ban in Dublin gets reversed.  We also need to bear in mind the possibility that peat and wood do the same level of damage to our air quality and that we would therefore have to apply the same policy principles to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100004#B00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1560258600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I find that response pathetic and incredibly weak.

This Government should have taken them on without any hesitation.<\/p>  <p>  We are down to the last 20%.  It is shocking when one reads the accounts of people's daily lives in the towns where the ban on smoky coals does not apply.  The comparisons between those areas of the country and those areas where the ban has been in place for a long time are significant.  Health is being damaged as a result, but the Taoiseach is saying that he must give it due consideration.  In 2013, the then Minister, Phil Hogan, stated that he wanted to see a ban on smoky coal throughout the country within the next three years.

It is a week in which we acknowledge and recognise the tens of thousands of carers throughout the State for the contribution that they make to people's lives, to families and to communities.  We can safely say that they are everyday heroes without whom many people would not enjoy a decent or normal life.  We can all agree that they are to be commended on their efforts and work.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, it is with much regret to learn as we did recently that the HSE has effectively suspended the allocation of home help hours to new applicants.  It has applied this suspension at a time when more than 6,000 people are waiting for access to home care supports.  The Taoiseach knows as well as I do the impact this will have on older people, people in need of care and people with disabilities and their carers, as well as their wider communities.  The Taoiseach also knows it will place further pressure on hospitals by compounding the problem of delayed discharges.<\/p><p>The HSE says it has taken this action to balance the budget for 2019 but curtailing home help hours is a false economy.  Directly employed home help, in particular, represents exceptional value for money.  It allows older people to remain in their homes or to be safely discharged from hospital.  If patients do not have enough home help hours, they are forced to remain in hospital at a substantial cost to the HSE or their families are forced to pay privately for home care support.  Neither of these options represents value for money.  Both of them end up costing more in the long run.  We consistently hear from patients in hospitals who cannot be discharged because of a lack of home care supports.  There are people who want to go home, and who could and should be going home, but adequate supports are not in place.  Despite a budget increase of &euro;10 million for this year, the number of hours being provided is simply not enough.  I could say \"we told you so\" because Sinn F&eacute;in warned that the allocation would be inadequate.  We argued for an extra allocation of &euro;40 million in respect of home care packages to make adequate provision, but the Government chose not to listen.  I would like the Taoiseach to commit to looking at whether funding can be found in the HSE budget to fund additional home help hours that can ease budgetary pressures elsewhere.  I ask him to do that quickly because it would be money very well spent and it would save the HSE money in the long run.  At a time when there is rightly a focus on budgetary practices, we need to focus on things that work and on real and prudent public spending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100005#C03000","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560259200,"counter":42,"content":"<p>This is national carer's week.  I want to join my voice to those of the Deputy and others in this House who have paid tribute to carers, who do enormous work for their families and others.  The Government and society place enormous value on the work of those who care for people in their own homes and in other homes.  Those are not just words; in the last couple of years the Government has made some substantial changes to improve the supports that exist for carers.  The carer's support grant, which had been cut, has been fully restored and is being paid at the moment.  Indeed, there is no means test for that.  Over the course of the last three budgets, we have increased carer's allowance and carer's benefit by &euro;15 a week.  The means test for carer's allowance is considered to be one of the fairest and most generous in the developed world.  Last year, we extended free GP care to people in receipt of carer's allowance and carer's benefit because we believe carers need to be cared for too.  Now they can attend their doctors without having to pay consultation fees.  There has been an increase in provision for respite.  Approximately 12 new respite houses are being opened across the country to provide more respite for people.  This allows carers to take a break, which is important for their physical and mental health.  I reiterate that there has not been any cut in funding for home support and home care.  In 2018, the total budget was &euro;418 million and 15.7 million home support hours, including intensive home care packages, were provided.  Almost &euro;30 million extra has been provided in this year's budget, which allows us to increase the number of home help hours being provided from 17.5 million to 18.5 million.  An additional 1 million hours are being provided this year.  This is quite a substantial increase.  As is always the case when it comes to health and social care, however, there is no limit to demand.  We have to manage within our means.

This month two new reports on what is happening to our globe were published.  Ice is melting in the Arctic at six times the rate that was previously thought according to a report from the University of Edinburgh, which was published in early June.  The global plant survey from the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew shows that plant life is becoming extinct five times faster than was thought to be the case.  In northern India as I speak, poor people who have no shelter or access to water are dropping dead in the worst heatwave the country has ever experienced, with 40&deg;C heat recorded in Delhi and 51&deg;C recorded in other parts of northern India.  I ask the Taoiseach to engage with us in a serious conversation about what the hell his Government is doing in response to climate change.  I heard him on television, following the green wave in the recent election, saying that he gets it and understands it but I ask him to give us evidence of that.  In the past week, since the results of the election were announced, I discovered that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment has slapped a money message on the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018 that we have painstakingly tried to rescue from the hostage position in which it has been held by this Government.  There are also money messages on Sinn F&eacute;in's Microgeneration Support Scheme Bill 2017 and the Green Party's Waste Reduction Bill 2017.<\/p><p>These money messages seriously need to be questioned because they involve small amounts - beer money, really - compared with what the Government is willing to spend on defending Donald Trump or on a botched tendering process for broadband.  Some &euro;26 million was spent on tendering for broadband and at least &euro;10 million was spent on the Trump visit.  The Government is using tiny amounts as an excuse to block serious Bills, which would send a message to the fossil fuel and plastic industries and tell them that the game is up and that they will have to start paying for the damage they are doing to the planet.  The State seems to be fond of slapping taxes on little people whether in the form of water taxes, increased carbon taxes, or increased property tax.  Why the hell is the same attitude not taken to the global corporations that irresponsibly continue to dig up and burn fossil fuels and to develop the plastics industry which is destroying our oceans and their ecology?  Everybody else pays for it while they do not, yet they continue to make vast profits.  Rather than attacking my Bill in a sentence again, is the Taoiseach seriously saying that it is worth blocking these measures to pay some kind of lip service to industry while holding back this country's progress towards being a leader in dealing with climate chaos?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100007#E01900","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560260100,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

It wants sensible climate action that reduces greenhouse gas emissions but which does not cost us our jobs, make us poorer, or make us less secure.  The difficulty we have with the legislation the Deputy is putting forward is that it will not reduce greenhouse gas emissions at all.  We all know and acknowledge that we will need to continue using natural gas for decades to come.  Some 30% of our energy mix is now renewable and, with major effort, we can get to 70% by 2030.  We will, however, still need to use natural gas as part of our energy mix for decades to come.  Homes and businesses around the country will still use natural gas as part of their energy mix.  The question arises, if we will still have to use natural gas, a proposal which any reasonable person or climate scientist will accept, should we use our own or should we use natural gas imported from shale sands in North America, from the Middle East or from Russia?

There is a growing regional imbalance between Dublin and rural Ireland.  Over the decades Dublin has received enormous investment with more than &euro;750 million on the port tunnel, &euro;728 million on the red and green Luas lines, &euro;368 million on the Luas cross city, and upwards of &euro;3 billion to be spent on metro north.  I could go on and bore the House with more figures relating to past and future investment in the capital.  I know the Taoiseach will say that much of that investment is of benefit to the country as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  I do not want the Taoiseach to come back with the usual story that the Government invested &euro;300 million on the N17-N18 Gort to Tuam motorway, as if that alone should satisfy us for another few decades.  The people of the west deserved that investment.<\/p>  <p>  On a recent visit to Galway, the Taoiseach visited Connacht Rugby's facilities at the Sportsground on College Road.  Connacht Rugby has been very successful in recent years, reaching new heights, including winning the Pro 12 title in 2016.  It has just completed a great season earning it a place at the top level of European club rugby.  It is unique in a sporting context in the west in that it actively goes out the length and breadth of the province to help develop the game in local communities and schools.  It is now embarking on a very ambitious project, costing &euro;34 million, to build a state-of-the-art facility not just for Galway but for the west.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach personally has seen the facilities of Connacht Rugby, as has Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il.  He knows they are not suitable for the calibre of team Connacht Rugby has become.  The CEO of Connacht Rugby, Willie Ruane, and the head of operations, Karl Boyle, have done excellent work in bringing the project through the planning process to where it is now ready to proceed without delay.<\/p>  <p>  The only issue now is with funding.  Connacht Rugby has applied for &euro;20 million from the large-scale sports infrastructure fund.  I again stress that the project is not for Galway but for the west, which we rightly deserve.  No major investment has gone into sporting facilities in the west on a scale of funding elsewhere.<\/p><p>Croke Park received &euro;103 million and Aviva Stadium got &euro;191 million.  Other grounds, such as P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh, Thomond Park, Semple Stadium, the Gaelic Grounds in Limerick, and Irish Independent Park in Cork, also received funding.<\/p> <p> There is another very worthwhile development at Oranmore-Maree GAA club, which is embarking on an ambitious &euro;4 million project.

The kind of investment we have seen in Croke Park and the Aviva Stadium in Dublin, and which we saw at Thomond Park, Limerick, and P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh, Cork, has not happened in Galway or the west.  Funding for major sports infrastructure in the west, including Galway, is long overdue.  I acknowledge the Deputy has a real interest in this issue, as do the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, Deputy Naughton and others.

It seeks to ensure that there are regular three-year reviews into the effectiveness of the long-term illness scheme in order that changes, upgrades and additions can be made to ensure the scheme is always fit for purpose.<\/p><p>Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 allows for the provision without charge of drugs, medicines or medical or surgical appliances to persons suffering from a precise disease or disability of a permanent or long-term nature.  These drugs, medicines or medical or surgical appliances are then provided without charge to the patient under a community health scheme known as the long-term illness scheme.  The scheme means that people who are diagnosed with specified long-term disease or disability can get a range of medicines from their community pharmacy without cost.<\/p><p>The long-term illness scheme has been a great success since its establishment.  It aids thousands of people throughout the State.  However, the scheme has not been updated in decades.  This means there are many different disabilities, ailments and illnesses that we now know more about and that are long-term or lifelong but which are not covered by the scheme.  It is important that the scheme be monitored and reviewed on a consistent basis to determine whether it is fit for purpose and delivering for those who need it.<\/p><p>The absence of any review has caused severe difficulty and distress to many of those affected.  They believe the Government does not care about them or want to review the effectiveness of the long-term illness scheme.<\/p><p>The Bill amends the Health Act 1970 to ensure the effectiveness of the provision without charge of drugs, medicines or medical or surgical appliances to persons suffering from a precise disease or disability of a permanent or long-term nature through a review every three years.  A regular three-year review into the effectiveness of the long-term illness scheme would ensure that changes upgrades and additions could be made to the scheme to ensure it is always fit for purpose and that it always delivers for those with long-term illnesses.<\/p><p>Several Members raised the issue of the scheme not being updated in almost 50 years in April during statements on fibromyalgia.  Many have raised the matter in Topical Issues debates and in other forms.  I hope they will engage with and support this Bill so that we can secure the changes to the long-term illness scheme that are so long overdue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100017#P01100","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1560265500,"counter":202,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100017#P01200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1560265500,"counter":203,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100017#P01300","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1560265500,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1560265500,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100017#P01500","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1560265500,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100017#P01600","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1560265500,"counter":207,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Cuba: Referral to Select Committee","time":1560265500,"counter":208,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100017#P01800"},{"type":"speech","time":1560265500,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the proposal that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the terms of the Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Cuba, of the other part, signed at Brussels, Belgium, on 12th December, 2016, a copy of which was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 31st May, 2019, be referred to the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence, in accordance with Standing Order 84A(3)(<i>b<\/i>), which, not later than 25th June, 2019, shall send a message to the D&aacute;il in the manner prescribed in Standing Order 90, and Standing Order 89(2) shall accordingly apply.&quot;<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100017#P01900","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1560265500,"counter":210,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"\u00c1bhair Shaincheisteanna Tr\u00e1th\u00fala - Topical Issue Matters","time":1560265500,"counter":211,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100017#P02100"},{"type":"speech","time":1560265500,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 29A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Gino Kenny - to discuss the confiscation of cannabidiol, CBD, products by customs officials;

While technology company leaders were present, I did not have specific bilateral meetings with them.<\/p>  <p>  I was asked a question on contacts with Facebook representatives.  I have not had any contact with the chief operating officer, Ms Sheryl Sandberg, since an exchange of letters following our brief meeting in Davos in January.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke with Prime Minister Ardern about the Christchurch call and what practical steps we can take to try to prevent the spread of terrorist content online.

We have seen many challenges over the past 12 months with beef and the future of the beef industry, and there are comments coming from the European Union about decoupling payments or reducing cattle numbers.  It is vitally important that the Taoiseach discusses CAP at every opportunity he has at European level.

I do not know whether we can get a bit more time on it, but there we are.<\/p>  <p>  On the discussions about CAP with France, we have formed a very positive working relationship with the French Government historically on this issue over many years.  The important thing is to avoid a return to the zero-sum approach to the European Union's budget, which always leads to unreasonable demands for cuts to agriculture and rural development.   This is especially acute in the context of Brexit.  Will the Taoiseach explain if he has backed off his support for the letter issued earlier this year by some governments which rejected the idea of additional revenues for the Union?<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the informal session the Taoiseach had, it is disappointing that he continues to support the Spitzenkandidat system for party political reasons.  We need a European Commission President who will be a clear and focused leader and who will address the problems with communications in Europe generally that are evident at the moment.  It is surprising that Ireland is so enthusiastically backing someone who has no record to indicate that they have these skills.  Anyone looking at the record of the past seven years will know that the President of the European Central Bank, ECB, is a most critical appointment and has made far more of an impact in delivering recovery than our self-regarding Government is willing to admit.  We should be clear that it would be against the interests of Ireland, and indeed Europe as a whole, if there was any attempt to return to the failed orthodoxies of the pre-Draghi era.  This is a decision which is, in my view, more important than the multi-annual budget, and countries such as Ireland, which were damaged by the policies Mario Draghi eventually abandoned, need to speak up and oppose the attempt to bring back policies which could undermine both the euro and the European Union.  Is it the Taoiseach's intention to say anything on the topic of the appointment to the ECB?  The Taoiseach should also be aware that there will be a major backlash if there is any attempt to put a person associated with the far right in either of the other two jobs being discussed.  The politics of Orb&aacute;n, Salvini, and others cannot be allowed to destroy the independent institutions of the European Union, and we need a far more robust approach to the politics these individuals are pursuing across the Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100018#Q00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1560266100,"counter":225,"content":"<p>As Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin has said, this is an eclectic grouping.  My question is about the Taoiseach's intended meetings for the next six months.  I regard the next six months as being potentially crucial ones for Ireland's foreign policy.  There will be a new British Prime Minister, who could be and most likely will be a harder Brexiteer than the current one.  As a result, there is a very strong view that a hard Brexit is more likely and we, particularly our businesses, have to up our preparations for that.  The European Union is also gearing up for a series of major cyclical changes, including the election of a new Commission President and a new Council President, and the next few months will be critical in this.  We are also preparing ourselves for the next round of the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, which will be pivotal in areas like CAP, our demand for a change in structural funding in areas like housing, and for co-ordinated pan-European action on climate.  Despite the visit of President Trump, we still have real fears about the trading impact of this nation and Europe generally with the European Union.  In that context, I am interested in where the Taoiseach intends to visit and who he intends to talk to internationally in the next six months, especially during the holiday period when he might have more time to have impactful one-to-one meetings.  He gave a list of meetings, including meetings in Brussels and Luxembourg and British-Irish Council and European Council meetings, all of which are important but all of which are routine.

The stance adopted by the Scottish Government on fishing and fishing rights around Rockall is, frankly, bewildering.  Scotland wishes to remain within the European Union, and that position has been well articulated and mandated democratically.  Scotland is part of the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, and therefore I cannot understand, in either diplomatic or economic terms, the stance taken by the Scottish Government.  This matter requires immediate and high-level attention because, as others have said, the matter of Brexit now looms and the prospect of a hard Brexit looms ever greater with the prospect of a hard Brexiteer Prime Minister in 10 Downing Street.  This scenario threatens the livelihoods of fishing families directly in the here and now, raises the hackles, and raises real concerns as to what Brexit might look like and how it might play out.  Scotland is considered an ally on the matter of Brexit, and both fishing communities and people beyond them are saying that if this is the stance adopted by an ally, heaven help us if we are to consider a stance that might be adopted by those who are not an ally of Ireland.

There are different views across the European Union.  Some countries believe that we should reduce that budget, invest in other areas and tackle other problems, while some believe it is well-functioning EU programme and one that we need to protect.  We are very much in the latter camp and are building alliances with like-minded countries - not just France, but also many Mediterranean and central eastern European countries which benefit a lot from CAP.  The best way to ensure the CAP budget is protected is by having a very strong environmental and climate action component to it.  Often the best way to succeed in a budgetary negotiation is to have two objectives rather than one, and marrying the need to protect the incomes of farmers and rural development with environmental action and climate action is our best chance to protect the budget for CAP.  That means greening CAP.  It means more investment in green schemes like the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, for example.  Some 60,000 farmers are participating in that already, but there could be a lot more.  It means funding for diversification and incentivising farmers financially to move into areas of agriculture that are better in terms of climate change and which help promote biodiversity.

The broader question facing us will be the budget to be spent by the Union and the financial framework for the next five to six years.  The Brexit situation looms large and we do not know who is going to win the Conservative Party's leadership battle and become the next Prime Minister, but it could have a particular bearing on the financial outlook, given that Britain leaving the EU has financial implications for the overall EU budget and, particularly from an Irish perspective, on the CAP.  Unsurprisingly, Commissioner Hogan has already indicated that there will be a reduction in the CAP budget.  It is important that the Taoiseach indicate that the Government is consistent in supporting an increase in the overall EU budget as being in Ireland's best interests in terms of our sectoral needs, agriculture and rural Ireland in particular.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach is correct in saying that it is a more fragmented European Parliament.  It is obvious that, at European rather than Irish level, various groups will negotiate a package and a compromise on the key positions.  That said, will it still be the EPP's position, for example, to rely on leaders like Orb&aacute;n to support its candidates and give it with the strength that it enjoys in the European Parliament?<\/p>  <p>  On a broader level, the European Union has been under threat for some time.  Luckily, the European elections turned out reasonably well in some countries.  In others like France, there are still some alarm bells ringing in terms of the far right making progress.  There must be much less tolerance of the far right's approach to many issues.  Democrats need to stand up for the fundamental values that have informed the European Union from the outset, in particular free speech, independent judiciaries and independent and free media, in order that people can speak out without fear or favour.  Where regimes within the EU are suppressing free speech in the media and undermining the independence of the judiciary, the EU must take a much stronger stance in response to those countries.  Such behaviour is incompatible with continued membership of the Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100019#R01800","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1560266700,"counter":246,"content":"<p>Concerns around the budgetary position post Brexit will have been raised even more loudly by those who saw the statement in the weekend's edition of <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>by Boris Johnson, potentially the British Prime Minister, that he would withhold the &pound;39 billion in outstanding British contributions to the EU budget for 2019 and 2020 unless the EU agreed what he called more favourable terms in Brexit.  There are deep concerns, particularly regarding CAP, about the sustainability of the budgetary forecasts.  Some might accuse Boris Johnson of simple bombast.  That might prove to be the case but given that he is certainly one of the runners for the Prime Minister's position, this is a matter that we must take most seriously.<\/p><p>President Macron responded to this assertion - rather, a source close to him responded to Reuters - by saying that withholding Britain's contribution to the EU budget would amount to a sovereign debt default.  President Macron has a habit of upping the ante in the debate with Britain.

As others have done, I congratulate the four Deputies who have been elected to the European Parliament and I wish them well.  It is to be welcomed that the expected swing to the far right did not materialise.  It seems that we now have a fragmented and diverse sector.  This will be challenging.  I have no doubt that the political system will rise to the occasion in the interests of the citizens of Europe.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to speak about the United Kingdom and Brexit.  We are in despair as we watch developments in UK politics at this time.  The Conservative Party leadership race is particularly depressing.  Now that we know the positions of a number of the contenders, it is especially depressing that many of the candidates seem to have no interest in, or feel for, Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland.  I suspect that Anglo-Irish relations will be particularly difficult in the months ahead.  I think the Taoiseach will need all his diplomatic skills to deal with that.  The Rockall fisheries dispute is now on the agenda as well.  It is a sign of things to come.  I would say that the leadership race in the Conservative Party is especially depressing.<\/p>  <p>  When the Taoiseach spoke in his previous contribution about last month's European Council meeting, he outlined his position on several important and central posts that need to be filled.  Does he think it would be worthwhile to pursue Jean-Claude Juncker's suggestion that there should be gender balance in the filling of these positions?  I think we need to give serious consideration to the suggestion.  Although the wheeling and dealing is fascinating, I would say it is a little unseemly.  I suppose that is democracy in action.  Will the ultimate decision be taken by the European Parliament or by the European Council?  It looks like the ALDE group, to which Fianna F&aacute;il is affiliated, will have a central role in the make-up of the European Parliament.  It will be very interesting to watch.  I hope the best people fill the positions in due course.  If we get a new President of the European Commission, we will have to appoint Commissioners and Ireland will have to appoint a European Commissioner.  Has the Taoiseach given any thought to that yet?  What qualities does he think our newly appointed Commissioner should have?

On this occasion, I do not mind answering the question the Taoiseach has asked.  I could give a fuller answer in respect of all the positions.  The Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats candidate for the position of President of the European Commission, Frans Timmermans, is an exemplary candidate.  He understands Ireland very well.  He has had a long involvement with this country.  I have been involved with him over many years in various Ministries.  He understands Ireland and is very supportive of Ireland.  He would be an excellent choice for us.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to mention another important position that is coming up.  The Taoiseach has said that the position of President of the ECB is not part of the general brokering.  I have a great deal of experience in this area.  I know the Taoiseach was not a great fan of the Economic Management Council during the period for which it existed.  When we started to tackle the worst economic crisis this State has met in many generations, it was very important to have a tight-knit group of people grappling with these issues.  The transition from Jean-Claude Trichet to Mario Draghi was critical and essential not only for our economic survival but also for the survival of the eurozone.  It is important that whoever replaces Mr. Draghi is of the same mindset as him.  When he said the ECB would do \"whatever it takes\" to preserve the euro, he meant that every ounce of strength in the bank and in the economies of Europe would be deployed to that end.  It was a pivotal moment in the preservation of the eurozone.  I do not want to have an auction of candidates, but I must mention that Mr. Jens Weidmann, who is being touted as a candidate, opposed all of that.  He did not believe it was the role of the President of the ECB, or the ECB itself, to preserve the eurozone.  He continues to argue this extraordinary point of view on the basis that the role of the ECB is simply to maintain a low inflation rate within the eurozone countries.  I say these things because this is very important.  Many good candidates could fill the other positions, but the mindset of the President of the ECB will be critical.  Will the Taoiseach comment on this issue?  I am sure he is well briefed on it.  I would be very happy to discuss it with him.  I am sure Deputy Noonan will have briefed the Taoiseach separately about the pivotal position of the ECB at critical junctures in our economic travails.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100020#S00300","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1560267300,"counter":250,"content":"<p>We will take three or four minutes from the third batch of questions to hear the Taoiseach's response to the questions that have just been asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100020#S00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1560267300,"counter":251,"content":"<p>As Deputy Howlin probably picked up from my remarks on the previous group of questions, my assessment of the characteristics of the new President of the ECB is very similar to the Deputy's assessment.

It is still necessary at this point in time.  I would like the next President of the ECB to be somebody of a similar mindset who would continue to adopt similar policies to those of Mr. Draghi.  It is useful that the position of chief economist of the ECB is now held by an Irish person in the shape of Philip Lane.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin asked about revenue raising on two occasions.

We are willing to increase the percentage as long as the programmes we support continue to be well funded.  We are willing to pay more into the budget as long as important programmes like the Common Agricultural Policy, Erasmus, Horizon and INTERREG are protected.  We do not want to end up paying more into a budget only to see the programmes we find most valuable being cut back.<\/p>  <p>  I was asked about the package for the four top jobs.  It is anticipated that three or four of the major parties will come together to create a majority in the European Parliament.  It has to be an absolute majority.  We will have an absolute majority that does not require the support of parties like Fidesz that have been suspended.  I am very conscious that the V4 nations - Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic - tend to stick together at European Council level.  Even though their Governments are in different groups - liberal, centre-right and socialist - they tend to stick together.  Often, the dynamic is not just one of political groups as there can be regional groups too.  They will stick together on these issues.  It will be necessary for the European Council to vote by qualified majority on some positions.<\/p>  <p>  Like everyone in this House, I am a little concerned about political developments in London at present.  Theresa May was not a bad negotiator.  She had a good team.  I believe they got the best deal they could have got, given the limited leverage that a country leaving the EU has.  It took two years to negotiate the withdrawal agreement.  It is not perfect.  It is a finely balanced compromise.  Everyone had to give and take.  Sadly, the House of Commons failed to ratify that agreement.  I am a little concerned that some people in London seem to think the failure of the House of Commons to ratify the agreement automatically means they will get a better agreement.  That is a terrible political miscalculation.  I hope it is not the one that is being made across the water.  They made some miscalculations along the way.  After the UK decided to leave the EU, they initially thought that Ireland would somehow fall into line and leave too.  We did not leave and we are not leaving.  Some of them thought that when push came to shove, Ireland would be abandoned and EU unity would break.<\/p><p>They were wrong about that.  I hope they are not making a further political miscalculation, which is to think that the House of Commons, having failed to ratify the deal, will somehow get a better deal.  That is to really misunderstand how the European Union works.<\/p> <p> In terms of the wider future of Europe debate, we have had a detailed public consultation, led by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy McEntee, with meetings held all over the country and a lot of people engaging.

I question the political will of this Government to deliver reform.  The Taoiseach has expressed strong views on proposals for reform and that is all very well and good but given reform of the Upper House has been a matter of debate, contemplation and reflection for decades now, we must ask if it is going to happen.  If the answer to that question is \"Yes\", then I ask the Taoiseach to tell us when but if the answer is \"No\", the political system should simply own up to that.  The Government should state that clearly and we should stop having conversations about something that the Government has no intention to deliver.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100021#T01300","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1560267900,"counter":267,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach should take the honest position and admit that he has no interest in pursuing Seanad reform within the context and parameters of the Manning report and the work of Senator McDowell, who feels that he has been hung out to dry by the Government's, and Fine Gael's, approach to this issue.  The honest thing to do would be to say that the Government is not committed and has no interest in pursuing this.  The people of Ireland voted to retain the Seanad; Fine Gael wanted to abolish it.  The alternative to abolishing the Upper House was clearly to reform it and a template was provided for same.  Seanad reform is in the programme for Government but it is there in name only.  There is no deeply held commitment.  The Taoiseach is against reform and if he was honest, he would say so.  He should abandon the commitment and take it out of the programme for Government so that we are all clear on the matter.  He should stop wasting people's time.<\/p>  <p>  The core lesson of the plebiscite on the Seanad, when Fine Gael sought to abolish it, and recent plebiscites on mayoralties is that people want significantly more information about how major political changes will operate in practice before making a decision.  Just as Opposition parties predicted, there was a public backlash against the reasonable idea, which I supported, of directly elected mayors.  Nowhere near enough information was provided on the practical details of what was being proposed.  I pointed this out to the Taoiseach two or three months before the plebiscite.  It sums up the hyper-partisan nature of this Government that the Minister responsible has stated repeatedly that his failure is the fault of the Opposition.  His objective seems to have been to squeeze out a win rather than obtain wide legitimacy.  We could look to London as an example.  When London held a similar vote to create a unified mayoralty, detailed implementing legislation and budgets were prepared and 72% of the people voted in favour.  The obvious lesson of this reform proposal, as with the Seanad proposal, is that we need a return to the past practice of preparing detailed White Papers, legislation and budgets before seeking public support for changes.  What has been going on here in recent times is bread and circuses - produce a nice-sounding idea for a bit of reform to keep them going until the autumn, with no detailed work put into it.  <\/p>  <p>  Earlier the Cabinet apparently discussed the extension of the presidential franchise.  I ask the Taoiseach to give us a commitment that he will publish not just a general proposal but a full implementation schedule, legislation and a budget before seeking approval for that proposal.  That is what people need and deserve.  A referendum on that proposal should be held separately from local, general or European elections because it is serious enough to merit that.  The Government is going to the people for a decision and should treat that with the respect it deserves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100021#T01400","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1560267900,"counter":268,"content":"<p>Our intention is to hold the referendum on extending the presidential franchise to Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland and around the world later this year, most likely concurrent with the four by-elections, the writ for which must be moved within six months of the vacancies arising.

From the data collated on the scheme to date, the home loan has proven to be more successful than initially anticipated.  The Housing Agency, which provides a central support service to assess loan applications, has confirmed that up to the end of May 2019, 4,193 applications have been assessed, of which 2,153, or 51%, have been recommended for approval.  The latest information available from local authorities indicates that\u00a0823 loans, totalling some &euro;139.9 million, had\u00a0been drawn down at the end of March 2019.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As a result of this very significant\u00a0level of activity, the scheme requires a further tranche of funds to be borrowed by the Housing Finance Agency\u00a0in order to enable its continuation.  My Department is currently in discussions with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance with regard to this amount, which I anticipate will be finalised very soon.  When these discussions are concluded, I will be in a position to make an announcement on the matter.\u00a0 Ahead of such an announcement, the operation of the scheme is not affected.  The scheme remains open and all local authorities have been advised to continue to receive and process applications up to and including the issuing of loans.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The delivery of affordable housing remains a key priority for the Government.  To support the delivery of 6,200 affordable homes, &euro;310 million is being made available under the serviced sites fund from 2019 to 2021, to facilitate the delivery of infrastructure on local authority sites.  Last December, &euro;43 million was approved under the fund for ten infrastructure projects in Dublin and Cork, which will deliver 1,400 affordable homes.  Under the second serviced sites fund call, 30 submissions have been received from 15 local authorities.  These are currently being assessed and I expect to issue approvals under this second call in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  The serviced sites fund will also play an important role in making cost rental projects as affordable as possible.  Two pathfinder pilot projects are currently being progressed in order to facilitate the development of the cost rental model.  These pilot projects\u00a0are at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, and at St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate, Inchicore,\u00a0both of which\u00a0will inform further the development of a cost rental\u00a0model for the Irish context.<\/p>  <p>  The Enniskerry Road project comprises 155 homes, 50 of which will be cost rental.  Funding of &euro;4.5 million under the serviced sites fund\u00a0is being made available to this project and construction is due to commence later this month, with completion of the homes scheduled for 2021.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate project is estimated to have the potential to accommodate more than 470 social and cost rental homes in a high quality development.  Dublin City Council has appointed a dedicated project manager and a project team to move this development forward and\u00a0professional advisers\u00a0have also been appointed to develop an urban design framework plan for the site.  This is a key project and my Department is currently working closely with the council with a view to accelerating the delivery of much needed cost rental homes and community facilities in the area.<\/p>  <p>  The price of individual homes, or the reductions on market rents, to be delivered\u00a0with the support of the serviced sites fund will be determined on a project-by-project basis.  Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which was commenced last June, provides for a discount of up to 40% on the market value\u00a0of affordable homes for purchase, with the discount being held as an equity stake by the local authority until it is repaid by the household or captured on resale.<\/p>  <p>  These new schemes\u00a0are set in the context of moderating\u00a0growth in house prices and rental levels in the market and will complement other\u00a0key Government\u00a0affordability initiatives.\u00a0 These include the Rebuilding Ireland\u00a0home loan, which I referred to earlier, and the help-to-buy scheme, under which some 11,500 applications, to a value of some &euro;169 million, have been approved.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, approximately 2,350 affordable homes will be delivered on mainly publicly owned lands supported through the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, while 5,600 further homes will benefit from a LIHAF-related cost reduction, some of which are already coming to market.  The work of the Land Development Agency will also be of crucial importance in terms of delivering more affordable housing.  The initial portfolio of sites to which the agency has access will have the potential, over the short to medium term, to deliver 3,000 affordable homes in line with the Government policy of achieving 30% affordable housing on State lands generally.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Taken together, programmes are in place under which nearly 18,000 affordable homes or homes with a LIHAF-related reduction will be delivered, with over 12,200 households also supported through the\u00a0Rebuilding Ireland home loan or the help-to-buy scheme.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100022#U07700","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1560268500,"counter":349,"content":"<p>For the record, both of my priority questions have been grouped and they are on two very different things.<\/p><p>The Minister has been able to get away with an omnibus answer, covering everything and not dealing with any specifics of the questions asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100022#U07800","speaker":"1228","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560269100,"counter":351,"content":"<p>The Deputy is getting the opportunity-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100023#V00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1560269100,"counter":352,"content":"<p>For the purpose of priority questions into the future, I respectfully say by way of feedback-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100023#V00300","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1560269100,"counter":353,"content":"<p>We will have a look at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100023#V00400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1560269100,"counter":354,"content":"<p>-----if you understand the point I am making-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100023#V00500","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1560269100,"counter":355,"content":"<p>Okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100023#V00600","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1560269100,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I would rather if the Minister came here today and said he does not know what is happening.

The Minister has said here repeatedly that all loans will be honoured.  The experience of many people in many different local authorities is the opposite of what the Minister has stated.  Kildare County Council has been returning applications indicating it cannot go to the final stage of the loan, the drawdown, because it does not have its allocation for this year.

The circular issued to local authorities in March, informing them that they could continue to process and approve loans, and that those loans could be drawn down.  That came as a result of my commitment to the Oireachtas and the public that any loan approved would be honoured.  At the previous meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government the Deputy said some local authorities were not doing that.  He referenced his own local authority.  Since then, it has been contacted about that.  I thank him for bringing that to my attention.<\/p>  <p>  Some interesting things are now happening on the serviced sites fund because of the work we have been able to do in the past year or so.  As the Deputy knows, we commenced Part V last year.  We have the regulations on the scheme, which we all discussed at the committee, approved in March.  The first call was in June last year and it was approved in December.  There are ten projects in Dublin and Cork comprising 1,400 homes with &euro;43 million of Exchequer funding.  For example, in the Ballymun site a two-bedroom home is &euro;150,000 after the discount that would be held as an equity stake by the local authority, and in Ballyfermot a three-bedroom home is &euro;240,000, which is very welcome.<\/p>  <p>  Significant work is happening on cost rental.  We have officially engaged the European Investment bank, EIB, to act as an adviser on how we can achieve cost rental that works at the entry level.  The National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, has also done financial modelling on this.  I have engaged with one of the housing bodies on this site to ensure the entry-level rents we are discussing are below market levels.  The key thing about cost rental is that while it might start off at 15% to 25% below market value, over time that increases to up to 40% below market value.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100023#V03900","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1560269100,"counter":389,"content":"<p>Cost rental needs to be affordable based on the tenants' income.  Comparing entry-level rent with market rent is not the right metric.  That is why we use a metric such as the ESRI's 30% of net disposable income.  The problem is that the rent for the homes on Enniskerry Road will be &euro;1,200 per month, meaning a household will need a net disposable income of &euro;4,000, which is considerably above the income of many households required for this.  In real terms - St. Michael's estate in Inchicore is a good example of this - we need entry-level rents of between &euro;700 and &euro;900 a month to meet the need of those whose household income is between &euro;40,000 and &euro;70,000.<\/p><p>That is what is done in other cities.  They construct the finances in a different way than what is proposed for Enniskerry Road.  I urge the Minister to re-examine this.

The agreement states the bank will provide advisory services.

When one looks at the rental information we have and the rent index produced by the Residential Tenancies Board, it is crazy that in many parts, particularly the capital city but also in Cork, someone's rent might be more expensive than a mortgage.  That is why we brought through, as quickly as we could, the recent rent Bill to moderate rents even further and to extend rent pressure zones.  It is also why we have other initiatives to help people to put together a deposit for a home and help people to buy, including the Rebuilding Ireland home loan.

In 2018, I published updated Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments Guidelines for Planning Authorities under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  The guidelines propose one possible format for shared accommodation or co-living units comprising two to six bedrooms, including en suites, those bedrooms being larger than standard bedroom sizes, with a common shared area for living and kitchen facilities, which would have a maximum occupancy of eight people.  While the guidelines do acknowledge that other formats may be proposed for consideration by individual planning authorities in certain circumstances, the articulated format is a strong guide to what is expected from this emerging sector.<\/p><p>In assessing proposals, planning authorities are required to ensure that sufficient communal amenities are provided in accordance with the specified standards and that the scale of the development is appropriate to the location and buildings involved.  They must also be cognisant of the specific role that the development of the shared accommodation sector should play in the wider urban apartment market.<\/p><p>It is important to note the guidelines were the subject of more than five weeks of public consultation, following the issuing of draft guidelines on 18 December 2017.  Neither the Deputy nor her party availed of the opportunity to make a submission as part of this consultation.  The guidelines were finalised on 9 March 2018 and were broadly welcomed by the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, with the institute's president commenting that the &quot;new guidelines respond to our changing demographics and create four specific types of apartments which will allow for better housing mix: Build to Rent, Shared Living, Owner Occupier and Student Accommodation&quot;.  Furthermore, he stated the new approach should:<\/p><blockquote>see the sector innovate to respond to the changing market.  Two thirds of new households in Ireland over the past twenty years consist of one or two people, yet we are not building enough apartments to cater for this new demographic.  At present there are 2.5 times as many one- and two-person households as there are homes to suit them.<\/blockquote><p>While I am satisfied that the guidelines, as issued, are robust, given the relatively new nature of this form of accommodation, my Department will monitor the emerging shared accommodation sector and may issue further additional technical updates, as appropriate, to ensure the appropriate development of this form of accommodation.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100024#W00800","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1560269700,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I am not going to spend too much time dealing with the fact that it is clear most people do not want to live in a dog box, which is what the Minister is proposing, but I ask him to comment on yesterday's revelations by Mel Reynolds, the architect and housing analyst.  He made the excellent point that there are some people in Dublin getting very excited about co-living, namely, the developers.  It just stands to reason that if one owns land that is lying vacant right now, one will apply to build co-living units, just like the student accommodation that is flying up all around Dublin and other cities.  Many people thought there was a tax incentive for this but there is not.  It just makes perfect sense: yield equals value for developers.<\/p>  <p>  Under the co-living arrangement the Minister is talking about, five co-living bedrooms can fit in a site the same size as a typical two-bedroom apartment.

The Deputy and her party did not participate in the public consultation that was held at the time.  According to the logic of the article published yesterday and to which the Deputy referred, which is that allowing for more units on a site will drive up the cost of that site, one would build only one unit of accommodation per site regardless of the size of the site or demand in the area.  Therefore, the logic behind the article is essentially flawed.<\/p>  <p>  What we are trying to do is cater to a very small part of the market.  The demand is small but there is still demand.  If over the next 12 months, 1% of new builds in this country provide for co-living, it will take between 200 and 250 people.  That will free up potentially 100 to 125 apartments in the same area.  That is how we provide choice.  That is how we make sure the various needs in society can be met.  At present, people do not have choice.  That is the real crisis we are trying to address.  We are not trying to replace the traditional apartment; nothing like it.  We are trying to add an additional layer to what is being built because there is a demand for it.

He might inform his party's housing spokesperson of the same logic because he does not seem to understand this.  Other members of his party also do not understand it, but I am glad Deputy Stanley does.  That is certainly progress.<\/p>  <p>  There are no projects awaiting approval for two or three years.  Projects go through many different stages, which I will explain to the Deputy in a moment, and we have made a lot of changes to that process.  We have all come across projects in the past that were, for whatever reason, in the system for two, three, four and even five years in some cases, but no one can say to me there is an application sitting in our Department that has been awaiting approval for two or three years.  That is certainly not the case.  On many occasions colleagues have brought forward examples to the Minister and to me, and when we have checked them out, we have found there are different stories behind them, so I am conscious that very often local information might not match national information.  We have brought about a whole new scheme to make this very clear to everyone.  We can all track this so we know exactly the progress made on a project.<\/p>  <p>  Social housing projects funded by our Department, like all publicly funded construction projects, must comply with the Government's capital works management framework, the objectives of which are to ensure cost certainty, value for money and financial accountability.  There are nine stages in the framework, which our Department has streamlined to just four for social housing construction projects.<\/p>  <p>  Important steps have already been put in place to improve the timelines involved in the advancement of new social housing capital construction projects.  A timeline of 59 weeks is now in place from the bringing forward of an initial proposal to the placing of the construction contract and starting on site, encompassing the full design, planning and procurement processes.  This compares favourably with private sector construction projects.  I am not aware of any project, private or public, that from inception has been on site and under construction in 59 weeks.  In some cases we come slightly under the timeline but, on average, in the private sector and the public sector, 59 or 60 weeks is regarded as best practice.  Sometimes we get there in 50 weeks, which is worth doing.<\/p>  <p>  The 59-week period includes the time required for our Department to assess and approve projects.

He referred to a timeline of 59 weeks, but this is not happening before 59 weeks in many cases.  Schemes such as those in Portarlington and Conniberry Way in Portlaoise are all very welcome and all necessary, and I know the Department has taken some steps in this regard, but the process is still very slow and very costly.  Since about 2002 or 2003 there has been a requirement, introduced by the Department, that all houses must be architecturally designed.  I can tell the Minister of State that the design has not improved.  The requirement has led to high maintenance costs because of very bad decisions that look good on paper but are not practical.  There are homes that were built in the years following the introduction of this requirement - I can take the Minister of State to them some day he is in County Laois - that finished up being very expensive to heat because of poor decision-making on the part of architects, so there are practical problems there.  The four separate stages, as well as the number of steps within each of those four stages, drag out the process.  The Part 8 process, whereby planning is passed at local level and the councillors are involved, is not the issue, in my experience.  The councillors in general will move quickly with this.  I have raised this with the Minister and the Minister of State in the past.  What we need is a generic design.  There is no reason we cannot have one.  We often talk here about the number of houses that were built in the 1930s, 1950s and 1970s.  I am not arguing with either the Minister or the Minister of State for a return to those designs because, obviously, we want modern designs, but there are good templates there.  We should not be starting with a blank canvas with each scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100027#Z00800","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1560271500,"counter":438,"content":"<p>I wish to be very clear that our Department has no interest in unnecessarily prolonging the time involved in these proposals other than to comply with the Government-wide rules for capital project oversight.

I can confirm to Deputy Stanley that the parts of the process involving approval from our Department represent a very small amount of the time allocated and do not delay projects unnecessarily.  I wish to be very clear on that.  He mentioned two projects in Laois.  They were not referred to in his initial question.  If he had mentioned them in the original question, I would have brought the relevant information with me and analysed it.  I am happy to look at the two projects with him.  As I said, there is generally a story behind a case when we look at it.  Looking back over all the projects that are there, we are now able to reach our timelines.  There are some historical projects that for various reasons might take a little longer.

Any houses we have been involved in funding and opening in recent years under Rebuilding Ireland are of a high-quality design and build and are very efficient to run.

They could be used in Donegal, Cavan or anywhere else.  The houses are being built to a high standard, but I am telling the Minister of State, on behalf of council officials throughout the State to whom I have spoken, that the Department is scrutinising all the minutiae, every little detail, and drawings are being sent back and forward between local authorities and the Department in the Custom House.

I made that point and said I do not want to go back to 1930s or 1970s designs.  We have good models.  I estimate that we need six or seven different house types, including one, two, three and four-bedroom houses.  We need single-storey housing for disabled and elderly people.

Funding for future years will be agreed annually as part of the normal Estimates process, as we discussed earlier today.  The full terms and conditions of the scheme will be finalised over the coming weeks, again in consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>  <p>  This process will take account of the engagement that my Department is having with both Donegal and Mayo county councils.  In this regard, officials from my Department met both local authority teams last week to discuss implementation arrangements for the scheme in both Donegal and Mayo.  The meetings were very productive and further engagement will take place over the coming weeks.  On completion of this work, it is intended to revert to the Government on the matter.<\/p>  <p>  Ahead of that work being completed, I cannot be definitive on the date on which the scheme will open for applications.  However, the aim will be to complete the outstanding work without delay in order to ensure that the scheme can get underway as early as possible in the autumn.<\/p>  <p>  I have a couple of more seconds-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100028#AA01400","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1560272100,"counter":471,"content":"<p>The Deputies never remind me when they are over their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100028#AA01500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1560272100,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I will make a note and remind you in future.

In 2018, I published updated Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments Guidelines for Planning Authorities under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, to respond to the changing housing needs in light of demographics and the dynamics we are seeing in the urban employment market.  An extensive public consultation process took place prior to finalisation of the guidelines during which 63 submissions were made to my Department, all of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  My Department also hosted a consultative workshop prior to finalising the guidelines.  I do not believe the Deputy made any submissions as part of that public consultation, which was very well flagged at the time because it was well publicised when it was first announced.<\/p>  <p>  The updated guidelines set out the policy on the range of apartment types needed to meet the accommodation needs of a variety of household types and sizes.  This includes the introduction of the shared accommodation or co-living format.  This format comprises professionally managed rental accommodation where individual rooms are rented within an overall development that includes access to shared or communal facilities and amenities.  Such developments are only appropriate where responding to an identified urban housing need at particular locations; they are not suitable for families and are not envisaged as an alternative or replacement to the more conventional apartment developments which are provided for elsewhere in those same guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  In assessing proposals for Shared Accommodation, a planning authority must have regard to the need for such a type of accommodation in an area.  Planning authorities must also strike a balance between the need for a particular form of accommodation and the need to avoid a proliferation of shared accommodation development to the detriment of the overall objective of providing quality urban apartment development as a viable long-term housing option.  Furthermore, there is an obligation on the proposer of a shared accommodation scheme to demonstrate to the planning authority that their proposal is based on an actual accommodation need and to provide a satisfactory evidential base in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  I cannot comment on the expected rental price of such developments as this is dependent on both the market generally as well as the location and accommodation specifics of individual projects.  Do they have a gym or a movie room?  I refer to those types of developments.  Developments of this kind are not intended to provide State subsidised housing for individuals or families; they are designed to meet a particular demand which, although limited in scale, exists in the rental market.<\/p>  <p>  While I am satisfied that the guidelines as issued are robust, given that they are relatively new and it is a new form of accommodation for this country, although not in other countries, my Department will monitor the emerging shared accommodation sector and may issue further additional technical updates to this document as appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100029#BB03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1560272700,"counter":516,"content":"<p>This is again confusing and difficult to understand.  I believe Niall Cussen drafted the specific planning policy requirements - Nos. 8 and 9.  The Minister is talking about single shared accommodation of 12 sq. m, which would be smaller than his office, a double or twin accommodation of 18 sq. m - a parking space for a person with a disability is 17 sq. m - and bedrooms of 8 sq. m per person.  He seems to be on a road to the capsule living one would find in Tokyo, Japan, at the rate he is going.  Distinguished economists and students of the housing market such as Mel Reynolds have said that the fundamental reason for this is to enrich developers.  Five co-living bedrooms can fit in a site the same size as a typical two-bedroom apartment.  Is that not the fundamental reason for such development?  There was demand in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, and there is massive demand in my constituency, for houses and apartments, which the Minister is not meeting.  Perhaps only 22,000 units will come on-stream this year, with only 4,000 or 5,000 social housing units.  He is not meeting the demand that exists.

This will be achieved through blended delivery, with over 50,000 homes being delivered through build, acquisition and leasing programmes, and some 88,000 further households being supported through the housing assistance payment, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and other schemes.  A social house building programme is already well under way, with local authorities and approved housing bodies significantly expanding new build output year on year.  We have seen increases of seven or eight times in activity over the past 12 to 18 months.  It is important that we are back building houses and we are committed to that as a Government and under Project 2040, which allocated the funds to increase the social housing stock to 12,000 units annually until 2028.  <\/p>  <p>  At the end of 2018, the housing needs of some 90,500 households were being supported under current-funded programmes.  If all the funding provided for these 90,500 households had been transferred to capital expenditure, to support building or buying homes, it would only have delivered approximately 5,500 homes, leaving no resources available to support the other 85,000 households.  Looking at it another way, it would take almost &euro;20 billion to provide a new-build local authority home for the 90,500 households supported under current-funded programmes at the end of 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Rebuilding Ireland is working well, with annual delivery targets consistently exceeded.  This has been achieved through a blended approach to delivery, the mix of which is evolving year on year, such that in 2021, the final year of Rebuilding Ireland, more households will be supported through build, acquisition and leasing programmes than through HAP and RAS.  <\/p>  <p>  I am confident that the actions, targets and resources available under Rebuilding Ireland provide a strong platform for the continued delivery of high quality, value-for-money social housing supports for those on social housing waiting lists.<\/p>  <p>  As all Members know, if it was possible to build houses immediately and deliver them straight away that would be best, but one cannot.  People need homes today.  When we started Rebuilding Ireland some years ago and focused resources to build new housing, we also had to find homes there and then.  There is a combination of current and capital spending and that blend will change in coming years and rightly so.

Many people are confused about the legality of CBD products.  Even I am confused on what is legal or not legal.<\/p>  <p>  In recent months some shops in the country have been raided, for the want of a better word, by the police and the Customs and Excise.  They have confiscated CBD products such as CBD flower, CBD tea and CBD oil.  This is a great inconvenience for the shop owners because they are not breaking any law.<\/p>  <p>  This stems from the law and in particular, the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.  There is no exception whatsoever for tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, trace amounts.  This is where we run into trouble.  The shop owners are perfectly legitimate and law-abiding.  They are selling products that are perfectly legal but obviously there is a situation whereby the interpretation by some arms of the State, in particular, the Customs and Excise and the police, contravenes that of other arms of the State, namely, the Health Products Regulatory Authority and the Food Safety Authority.  The latter authorities maintain there can be trace amounts of THC in CBD products of up to 0.2%.  That is the background.  Some of these shop owners will possibly face criminal sanction and thus the stakes are serious indeed.<\/p>  <p>  If the police of this State interpreted the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 by the letter of the law, then there are shops not far from here on Grafton Street that are selling CBD products with trace amounts of THC at 0.2%.  If that is the case, then the manager should be questioned by the police.  There is a major contradiction in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Many people use CBD products and find them beneficial for their well-being.  This is putting them in a situation whether they do not know whether they are breaking the law.  This is a mess and I hope the Minister of State at the Department of Health can bring some clarity.<\/p>  <p>  I have a document to hand from the Department of Health.  I understand there are proposed amendments to the 1977 Act to provide for inclusion of trace amounts of THC up to 0.3%.  That would give clarity because there is no clarity whatsoever around this issue at present.  I hope the Minister of State can elaborate on that point.<\/p>  <p>  The problem lies in laws that were written 42 years ago.  They have not been updated to reflect what people are doing at the moment, including CBD shops and CBD derivatives.  There has almost been a boom in production of these products during the past two and a half years.<\/p>  <p>  I hope the Minister of State can give some clarity for the people who are listening.  Many people are looking and listening to this segment in the D&aacute;il tonight to see where they are going, as shop owners and people who use CBD.

Revenue's Customs service has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs intended to be smuggled or illegally imported into the State.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has primary responsibility for the investigation of any offences relating to the smuggling or illegal importation of controlled drugs and sole responsibility for drug law enforcement within Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Tetrahydrocannabinol, which is commonly referred to as THC, is a derivative of cannabis, which is a controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and regulations and orders made thereunder.  This legal framework gives effect in Ireland to the international conventions on narcotic and psychotropic substances and must be enforced by the relevant authorities.<\/p>  <p>  Cannabidiol, which is commonly referred to as CBD, is not a controlled drug following extraction from the cannabis plant, as it is not psychoactive.  However, if CBD products or preparations also contain THC in any quantity, then these are considered controlled drugs.  The legislation currently in operation does not provide for any allowable trace element of THC.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed that it is Revenue policy to treat CBD products that contain any trace elements of THC as controlled drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977.  Thus, they are liable to detention upon their importation and, ultimately, seizure pursuant to sections 33 and 34 of the Customs Act 2015.<\/p><p> Under current legislation, it is possible to apply for a licence for the growing of hemp from seed varieties specified by the European Commission.  These seeds contain a maximum THC level of 0.2% and are deemed eligible for the purposes of Article 1 of EU Regulation No. 1307\/2013.  Revenue has advised that it has been involved in some seizures of CBD containing trace elements of THC in recent months, and relates seizures at the point of importation which can include seizures at ports or airports where the product is intercepted in a passenger's personal luggage; seizures at An Post mail centres where the product is intercepted in parcels addressed to either shops or private individuals; and controlled deliveries of product to shops or individuals in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na following initial interception in a mail centre or otherwise.  The Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, is in the process of establishing a medical cannabis access programme, MCAP, which aims to facilitate access to certain acceptable cannabis products, which have not been authorised as medicines by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA.  The programme will permit cannabis products to be prescribed for three specific medical indications.  It is envisaged that over a period, a variety of medical cannabis products - both THC and CBD with trace elements of THC and manufactured by multiple producers - will be available for use in the MCAP.  Following consultation with relevant State authorities, the Minister may give consideration to the introduction of legislation to accommodate an acceptable trace level of THC in CBD products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100031#DD00800","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560274500,"counter":557,"content":"<p>That does not answer my question.

There is obviously a contradiction in the law, and there is a contradiction in the arms of the law.  The Minister of State is still not answering the question.  The document I have from the Department of Health states: \"It is envisaged that national legislation will be amended in the future to exempt finished products containing trace amounts of THC at levels not greater than 3%.\"  Is the law going to change, or is it not?  Is this going to continue, because it will continue and will get worse because CBD products and cannabis derivatives have become very popular?  People use them and find them beneficial.  The lack of clarity on this issue is making it confusing for shop owners and those who use CBD products.  Is the law in this regard going to be amended?  The World Health Organization, WHO, stated in January that it should be amended.  Even in the European Union, subsidies are given to farmers for hemp under the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.

The Minister of State will be familiar with this but I must articulate my extreme concern at the lack of transparency and honesty in answering clearly whether there is a specific budget for this project and a meaningful timeline for its planning and extension.  The Minister of State will be aware that the development of regional units is an essential part of the national paediatric model.  Substantial funding has been allocated for the national children's hospital.  It will probably cost up to &euro;2 billion, and that involves the completion of Blanchardstown and Tallaght hospitals.<\/p><p>The national model of care for paediatrics involves regional units, Cork being the largest of those and Galway and Limerick the others.  The funding envelope for the Cork project was estimated to be between &euro;34 million and &euro;38 million.  It was approved for preliminary planning in 2015.  There are issues not only in respect of the building, but in the availability of surgical and anaesthetic care.  It is available at the moment but the facility has to be built, otherwise the capacity of Cork to attract and retain sufficient paediatric anaesthetic and surgical cover will erode.  That will have serious implications for the national children's hospital, and, particluraly, for children in the Munster region in particular, because the Cork paediatric facility is essentially a Munster facility.  It performs 5,000 operations at the moment.  The national children's hospital would not be able to take that volume of surgical demand on board.  In addition, the paediatric centre in Cork deals with paediatric neurology, respiratory, cystic fibrosis, endocrinology, diabetes, allergy, and cardiology cases.  It is delivering specialist care as close to home as possible, in line with the national model, in all of those specific areas and it does approximately 5,000 operations per annum.  Crumlin does approximately 22,000 at the moment.<\/p><p>We have received different answers to various questions we have put on this.For example, last March, it was stated that funding had been provided for the detailed planning, and that it was funded up to 2019 for detailed planning and design.  That reply was signed by Jim Curran, the head of estates in the HSE.  Furthermore, on 3 May, I received another reply which stated:<\/p><blockquote>The preliminary scheme design has been completed of the proposed extension to the Cork University Hospital paediatric unit and reviewed by the CUH project team.  Progression to the next stage of developed design and submission of a planning application is subject to the availability of capital funding.  The HSE capital plan for 2019 is currently being finalised and will be submitted to the Minister for consideration.<\/blockquote><p>That differs from the reply that was given to my colleague in March, which suggested that all the funding was provided for the detailed planning and design and that it was fully funded.  I have the letter from 12 March, signed by Jim Curran, which stated that CUH was at stage 1 and was funded up to stage 2b, which is detailed design and planning.  That seems to suggest it was covered for detailed design and planning.  It also stated that a capital submission to the national capital and property steering group was being prepared.  This was back in March.  People who are on the ground working in the hospital are fed up of all the verbosity and meaningless language around this.  They want to know whether this is provided for in the capital plan for 2019, 2020, and 2021, because we know that the memorandum from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to the Government on broadband mentions the need for &euro;343 million for the national children's hospital.  We need straight answers because otherwise, it seems to me that the regions, and the Cork facility in particular, are being neglected.

The model of care explicitly supports the development of the new children's hospital and an integrated national network of paediatric units.  This will strengthen the connections and roles for local and regional paediatric units, including the regional unit in Cork University Hospital, CUH.<\/p> <p> As the Deputy is aware, there are a number of distinct phases within the proposed paediatric developments at CUH.  The HSE has advised the Department that phase 1 of the development has recently been completed and entails an outpatient facility and day-care, including a separate outpatient clinic facility for children in CUH, plus day-care for surgery and facilities for children living with diabetes and cystic fibrosis and their medical and nursing teams.  There is also an attached facility for paediatric medical education.<\/p> <p> Phase 2 of the paediatric development includes 74 inpatient paediatric beds and enhanced facilities for children who have to spend some time at the hospital.  It is currently at the design stage.  Capital funding for phase 2 is provided up to the detailed design and planning stage in 2019.  I understand from the HSE that a capital submission for phase 3 of the development is being prepared to enable the \"shelled\" construction of this phase during the construction of phase 2.

Ballymun has been given what can only be described as a bitter pill to swallow in the recent Irish Business Against Litter, IBAL, report on littering.  Ballymun is not unique when it comes to having litter and illegal dumping problems.  Across the city, illegal dumping and littering have become a major problem, as they have nationally.  The damning report from IBAL does not do justice to the considerable amount of work being done by local residents, community groups, Ballymun TidyTowns and Dublin City Council and its personnel.  In fact, many residents in Ballymun deserve recognition and commendation for the hard work and dedication they have shown in improving their area and the quality of life for the people there.  Communities and residents in many parts of Ballymun have transformed their environment and great credit is due to them.  The IBAL report does not reflect the work being done by such dedicated and conscientious people.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that we have a serious problem with illegal dumping and littering.  It should also be clear that the report identifies a particular area of Ballymun that has long been a bone of contention, that being the shopping centre where the report has stated much of the illegal dumping and littering has taken place.  The vacant shopping centre site is located on Main Street and was once at the heart of Ballymun and its community.  Now, this derelict site is an eyesore that greets people as they drive into or otherwise enter Ballymun.<\/p>  <p>  Since the privatisation of Dublin City Council's bin services, illegal dumping has escalated to the point where, despite the use of private companies, combatting the problem is costing the council substantial amounts of money.  In 2018, Dublin City Council spent &euro;1.16 million cleaning up illegal dumping.  That was on top of the money paid to private companies.  It is unfortunate that so large a sum of money has to be spent in such a manner.  Without the scourge of illegal dumping, that money could have contributed to community projects instead.<\/p>  <p>  We have repeatedly called on Dublin City Council to increase the frequency of street cleaning and road sweeping.  Currently, these functions are at the discretion of a supervisor or inspector, follow a complaint or are carried out where a road or street needs cleaning.  This leads to a lack of consistency.  Clearly, the system is not workable in many areas.  We need to return to a system of consistent weekly cleaning of roads and streets.<\/p><p>The ill-judged decision to remove litter bins from roads, streets, parks and shops has led to increased littering in many areas across the whole city.  When an area has a littering problem, it is disheartening for many people in the community.  People in Ballymun do not want to live like this.  They are as passionate about the environment as anyone else.  The Rediscovery Centre in Ballymun is an example of recycling at its best.  It is also an example of the community's commitment to the betterment of the local area.  The Rediscovery Centre, which is unique in Europe, places Ballymun at the centre of environmental awareness.  Many local schools are actively involved with the centre, which teaches a new generation about the responsibilities and benefits of looking after the local community and the environment.  People need to be educated at an early stage and at an early age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100033#FF01600","speaker":"1303","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560275700,"counter":579,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I agree with him that this problem is caused by a relatively small minority of people whose behaviour does not do justice to the many communities that are making considerable efforts in this regard, as is Dublin City Council.  I represent similar areas that are afflicted in the same way.  It is important that the implications of this survey are taken seriously by those responsible.  As the Deputy has indicated, Dublin City Council has primary responsibility for this issue.  I am responsible for providing the legal framework within which it operates.  To be fair to the council, with which I am familiar, it had a litter plan that ran from 2016 to 2018.  I am sure it is in the course of being renewed.  The council has an active litter warden service and operates a system of fines.  Anyone who examines the statistics will be disappointed to see the rate of payment of fines and the level of success in prosecuting those involved.<\/p><p>I think the Deputy is right when he says that everyone needs to look at the detailed findings in the report.  As he has said, the findings relate to several particular locations and the illegal dumping was not confined to those who do not accept their responsibility to use the collection service.  Some of this is random.  Coffee cups and cans are thrown away carelessly.  As the Deputy has confirmed, there is evidence that some of the litter that was identified was very old, which suggests that areas had not been swept for a long time.  It is important for Dublin City Council to sit down with the community to look at how improvements can be made.<\/p><p>We provide support for awareness campaigns in schools.  We fund the green schools initiative and the anti-graffiti awareness schemes.  Local authorities can apply for funds.  In addition, I have increased the budget for our anti-dumping initiative by 50%, to over &euro;3 million, this year.  Applications from the various local authorities had to be received by the end of April.  I hope the city council, which is aware of the difficulties in a number of parts of the city, has made submissions to tackle this problem.  I am familiar with the street sweeping approach.  The Deputy is correct when he says this happens infrequently.  Nonetheless, the council seeks to respond to individual complaints when it receives requests for street sweeping on the <i>fixyourstreet.ie<\/i>platform.<\/p><p>While the issues raised by the Deputy are disappointing - I can understand his frustration - there is an opportunity for us to develop a multi-agency approach to these matters that involves the community and some of the regional and national enforcement authorities that are seeking to target illegal dumping, in particular, this year.  I am wholly sympathetic to the Deputy's concerns.  I think reports like this can act as a spur to improvements.  The overall picture depicted in this report is one of improvement.  Some areas that have been found wanting in the past have improved their performances significantly by working together.  I hope the same improvements can be achieved in respect of Ballymun.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100034#GG00200","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1560275700,"counter":580,"content":"<p>It is clear that there is pride in the community of Ballymun.  Those who litter or dump illegally strike at the very heart of the community.  There are many reasons for the litter problem in Ballymun.  I have outlined a number of them.  There are many reasons to be proud of Ballymun.  There is a great community spirit and sense of community there.  This report, which is negative about Ballymun, does not reflect on the many positive aspects of the area.  The problem is not insolvable.  It will require actions and determinations from the council working with the community.  When I was a councillor, refuse was collected far more frequently.  A planned timetable was put in place to ensure each area and each street received a refuse collection service on a weekly basis.  The situation across the entire city has deteriorated since we moved away from that approach.  We have stepped backwards from putting bins into parks and in front of shops.  They have been taken away in certain areas because people were dumping large quantities of rubbish in them.  That step backwards has helped to increase the amount of litter and illegal stuff thrown around the place across Ballymun and other areas.  It is clear that the privatisation of the service in Dublin City Council has not worked.  When the city council was in charge, we did not have the problems we have now.  Those problems have escalated since the city council service was privatised.  Dublin City Council is paying extra money on top of that.  The Minister has put in extra money as well.  The private services are there.  The Minister is putting money in.  Dublin City Council and the Minister are making top-up payments.  The situation has deteriorated over the years nonetheless.

Nothing in this report suggests there are deficiencies in the way litter is being collected or bins are being emptied.  The report indicates that people are failing to use the weekly collection facilities.  A small minority of people seem to be systematically dumping in areas where they can get away with it.  That has nothing to do with the efficiency of bin lorries or segregation.  Perhaps it indicates that some people do not understand the system and are not operating it properly.  In a small minority of cases, people are not willing to co-operate.  I agree with the Deputy that the Rediscovery Centre in Ballymun is a fantastic phenomenon.  It emphasises prevention, reuse and recycling, which must be at the heart of our strategy.  There must be an effective collection service that is used by people in an informed way.  We need to see the collectors helping people to use their services more often and in a better and more informed manner.  Dublin City Council is responsible for enforcement and effectiveness in this area.  I think the council should consider these issues as it formulates its litter plan for 2019 and beyond.  To give the council its due, we are seeing improvements in several parts of the city.  This problem is not a universal one.  The city council is not in the corner being pointed at.  It has had many successes as well.  Perhaps it is a question of refocusing on particular areas that have difficulty, such as Ballymun.

I am sure the Minister of State will agree, and certainly the Minister for Justice and Equality who is a solicitor in private life would agree, that we cannot allow this to continue.<br\/><br\/>I have met tens of prison officers over the past few months and have received reports from them that victims of sexual harassment and sexual assault have been bought off and pressurised to accept money instead of going through due process with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It has been alleged to me, and proof provided, that career blocking and spurious transfers have taken place against those who do not play ball and do not row in with the few who pursue and nurture corrupt procedures and systems.  On the misappropriation of State funds: it is alleged a governor channelling funds and materials owned by the State to the governor's favourite sporting clubs, organisations and charities.  Even - listen to this one Minister - having their homes decked out with prison materials from the prison workshop, put in by staff on duty for the Prison Service at the behest of the governor in question.  A store's employee in another prison selling prison uniforms and equipment online when found out was allowed to resign without any recourse to the rigours of the law and without any recovery to the State.  Mess committee and tuck shop profits were flagrantly used for sporting trips abroad, including a significant trip to Savannah and New York, costing tens of thousands of euro, to the benefit of just a few at the expense of many.<br\/><br\/>In terms of illegal surveillance, I have evidence, as does the Government and it is sitting on it, that covert cameras were put in place to monitor prison officers in their workplace who were not implicated in or suspected of any wrongdoing.  Covert listening devices were placed in visiting boxes, listening to solicitors and their clients, betraying the age-old law that we must respect this confidentiality.  Covert cameras were placed in Portlaoise Hospital to monitor prison staff but, of course, also the poor Joe Soaps who went in there to have their medical issues dealt with.  Surveillance of prison staff outside the prison environment: a company, AOC Security Solutions, was paid &euro;28,500 by the State, and that is all we know about, to carry out this work.  It has been alleged to me that it was provided with false identification to get into prison and install equipment to spy on hard-working prison staff, and we are paying for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100034#GG00600","speaker":"1346","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560276300,"counter":585,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising these very serious issues this evening.

I am doing this with the benefit of D&aacute;il privilege because the shutters come down, whether at meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts or the justice committee, in the media or in written and oral parliamentary questions.  Everybody knows what is going on but nobody wants to know.  I want the Government to publish the Gilheaney report.  Because of the mismanagement of this illegal surveillance that went on under the Government's watch, the State is liable to cases being taken by many prison staff who were illegally surveiled, prisoners, solicitors and so on, which could financially expose the State to an awful lot of money.  The Government must get on and publish the report.  Beyond that, I call specifically on the Minister of State to get the Minister to acknowledge my call and to give a response.  We need to establish an independent inspectorate of the Prison Service, at arm's length from the service, with GSOC-style statutory powers.  The Inspector of Prisons does not have the power to insist on documentation, for example, as was the case for the report she recently carried out, whereas a GSOC-style entity would.<\/p>  <p>  Staff of the Prison Service are terrified.  Of the 20 to 30 I have met, some have made protected disclosures but most have not.  Why?  Because there is no confidentiality with protected disclosures.  It goes around that X made a protected disclosure, X is labelled a rat, is intimidated and ostracised, and the system goes on.  We want an independent inspectorate with GSOC-style statutory powers and appropriate resources to give hard-working prison staff the confidence that they can go to a body that is above reproach.  They do not have that now because the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 in that sense does not function within the Prison Service.<\/p>  <p>  Second, under the Commission of Investigations Act 2004, I call on the Government immediately to commence an investigation into corruption in our Prison Service among the chosen few -  I am at pains to point out the vast majority of staff are very hard-working and want to get on with their lives and do the best they can - on issues to do with misappropriation of State funds, examples of which I have given, sexual harassment, intimidation, career blocking and illegal surveillance.  Simply, nothing less will do.  We owe it to the Prison Service and and to hard-working prison staff.  We faced some of our demons in this country in the past in terms of clerical abuse.

It is of course very important that we all take account of this ongoing process in our contributions this evening and refrain from making comments on very specific issues on which the two Governments are working with the parties to seek, in a very short timeframe, fair and workable compromises to secure an agreement to get the devolved institutions and the North-South Ministerial Council operating again.<\/p>  <p>  The absence of these vital institutions of the Good Friday Agreement since the collapse of the Executive in January 2017 is of grave concern to the Government, as it is to the British Government.  As the House is aware, since the Assembly election of March 2017 the Government has, as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement with the British Government, worked through successive phases of talks in a number of different formats to seek to support the political parties in Northern Ireland in reaching an agreement to operate the devolved institutions again.  Unfortunately, earlier phases of talks did not produce the necessary agreement between the parties, and the people of Northern Ireland have had no devolved institutions to represent their interests and to make decisions on issues that are of importance to people&rsquo;s lives and livelihoods across the range of areas of devolved government in Northern Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  While there is no Executive in place, the North-South Ministerial Council also cannot meet and deliver on its vital role under the Good Friday Agreement to oversee and develop North-South co-operation on matters of mutual interest on the island of Ireland.  The challenges raised by the UK decision to exit from the European Union have made the absence of the devolved institutions and the North-South Ministerial Council even more serious, leaving Northern Ireland without a formal voice to represent the interests of all sections of the community there on this most fundamental and difficult issue.  The Government has continually sought to support engagement and a way forward between the political parties in Northern Ireland on the outstanding issues that need to be resolved to get all of the institutions of the agreement working again, as they must.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the successive phases of talks, in July last year, the Government and the UK Government convened again the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference as the institution of the agreement that serves to promote bilateral co-operation on all matters of mutual interest within the competence of both Governments.  The conference has met on three occasions - in July and October last year and again last month - with participation for the Government by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The conference is a valuable setting for the two Governments to discuss supporting political stability in Northern Ireland and other issues within the framework of the Good Friday Agreement including east-west co-operation, security matters, rights and citizenship issues, and legacy issues, and it has been agreed that it will meet again in the coming months.  <\/p>  <p>  Specifically on the issue of dealing with the legacy of the past, I confirm to the House the Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to getting the comprehensive framework provided for under the Stormont House Agreement implemented as soon as possible.  Victims and survivors have waited for far too long already for a system that is fit for purpose and that can meet their legitimate needs and expectations.  The T&aacute;naiste has emphasised to the Secretary of State the urgency of definitively moving ahead to legislating to get the Stormont House bodies established and up and running.  Legislation will also be required in this jurisdiction to provide for co-operation with the legacy bodies.  The drafting of legislative proposals for consideration by the Government and Oireachtas is advancing, led by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  <\/p>  <p>  In April, the talented young journalist Lyra McKee was callously killed as she was going about her work in Derry.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge, on behalf of the Government, the life and career of Lyra McKee, whose life was cut short so brutally and needlessly.  Our thoughts remain with Lyra&rsquo;s partner, Sara Canning, her family and friends, and those who dearly loved her.  Lyra was a brave, bright and brilliant person who exemplified the spirit we need today.<\/p><p>Her ambition to change her society for the better through her career, through telling her story and supporting others to do the same must be the example and the inspiration that political leaders call on in the days ahead in Northern Ireland so that we can collectively implement again the principles and the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p> Unfortunately, we also saw last week the attempted murder of an off-duty PSNI officer in Belfast, with responsibility claimed by a tiny number of people who would seek to drag us back to the violence of the past.  The police investigation into this attempted murder is ongoing and will receive the full support and co-operation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Like the awful killing of Lyra McKee, this attack on the PSNI was an attack on the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement itself which has been endorsed by the people of Ireland, North and South.  Such mindless violence has been repeatedly rejected by the people of this island.  That is why it is so incumbent on all political leaders in Northern Ireland to ensure that the mandate they have been given to operate the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement is implemented in accordance with the principles of partnership, mutual respect and parity of esteem at the core of the agreement.<\/p> <p> The outpouring of public feeling that rightly followed Lyra McKee&rsquo;s death saw a very clear demand from people in Northern Ireland for their political representatives to engage and get the political institutions working again.  On 26 April, to try again to secure a way forward, the Taoiseach and the UK Prime Minister announced a new phase of political talks in Northern Ireland, involving the five main parties, together with the British and Irish Governments.  On 7 May, the T&aacute;naiste and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley, convened these talks in Belfast.  This is a short process, focused on the key issues that are central to restoring the institutions and with the aim of achieving rapid progress.<\/p> <p> During May, a series of working groups were convened to discuss in detail the key issues central to making progress: the programme for government for a new Executive; greater transparency and accountability in the institutions; the reform of the petition of concern; measures to increase the sustainability and stability of the institutions; and issues of rights, language and identity.  The work of these groups was steered through leadership-level round-table discussions, with the participation of the Secretary of State and the T&aacute;naiste on behalf of the two governments.<\/p> <p> There has been constructive engagement by political parties in the process since it commenced and it is clear that all of the parties want to see the institutions of the agreement operating again on a sustainable basis.  There has been broad consensus on some issues, but key issues still remain to be resolved.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland believe that there is a genuine but narrow window of opportunity to reach agreement in the period immediately ahead and that it is essential to continue and intensify talks to this end.<\/p> <p> In a further joint statement on 2 June, the Taoiseach and the UK Prime Minister welcomed the constructive engagement in the process so far and underlined that it is imperative that the parties move without delay to engaging substantively on the shape of a final agreement.  Accordingly, the two governments last week supported an intensification of the talks and there was direct engagement on outstanding issues by the leaders of the five political parties.  The T&aacute;naiste and Secretary of State, Ms Bradley, are intensively engaging on behalf of the two governments in the talks at Stormont again this week and as I speak are encouraging the party leaders to move towards a final agreement.<\/p> <p> People want to see real progress made.  There is no patience for anything except urgent and determined progress and openness to new thinking.  Ultimately, it will be for the parties to rise to the challenge of finding an agreement.  This will be difficult, but the two governments believe that this can and must be achieved in the period immediately ahead to get the devolved, power-sharing Assembly and Executive and the North-South Ministerial Council functioning again.  The Government will continue to do everything in its power, in accordance with its responsibilities as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.  I look forward to hearing the views of colleagues in the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100036#JJ02100","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560277500,"counter":610,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his contribution.  With no disrespect I say it is regrettable that the Taoiseach could not have made it into the House this evening to discuss this important issue with the other party leaders.  We do not often get an opportunity to get even a short debate like this on such an important issue.<\/p>  <p>  That said, everybody who wishes Northern Ireland well wants the current talks to succeed.  Fundamentally the price of failure would be further to undermine decades of progress and leave Northern Ireland exposed during a new period of chaos and uncertainty in London.<\/p>  <p>  The biggest problem in these talks is the extent to which parties appear reluctant to back away from positions they have adopted over time and the reluctance to be seen to have compromised.  The unwillingness to admit error or to reconsider strategies is always at the core of deadlock and, as always, flexibility the only way to break free from the deadlock.<\/p>  <p>  The issues involved are serious and the lack of basic trust between the two main parties which have created this impasse cannot be underestimated.  However, these issues are nothing compared to those which we overcame in the past.  Only if we can return to the way these negotiations were handled in the past will we have a chance of moving forward.<\/p>  <p>  There have been many blockages and suspensions in the past, but this one has been unique in a number of ways.  Most importantly the cause of the deadlock bears no relationship to the fundamental parts of the peace process and the reluctance of the governments to act with either urgency or ambition has been regrettable.  There have been many claims of urgency but little evidence of it having any impact.<\/p>  <p>  Exactly 883 days ago the democratic institutions in Northern Ireland were collapsed because of a heating scheme.  No amount of revisionism and holding up the importance of other issues can take away from the cold hard fact that the people of Northern Ireland have been deprived of a voice on Brexit, on budget cuts, on equality issues and on the future of health and education because of a heating scheme which appears to have lost nowhere near the amount of money first claimed.  Rather than wait for an independent review to gather all evidence, and in light of an electoral opportunity, it was decided that representative institutions were to be sidelined.<\/p>  <p>  For most of the past two and a half years there has been an inexplicable reluctance to show genuine urgency and the issues and political circumstances to be addressed have continually changed.  During most of this time my party&rsquo;s position has been based on the need to convene genuinely inclusive talks which respect the full range of political views in Northern Ireland and which see the governments accept their responsibility to lead the process.  Unfortunately, the decision not to try anything new until after the planned Brexit date of 31 March has meant that we are today at a moment of great uncertainty, with the return of stability or basic commitment to Northern Ireland in London at very best uncertain.<\/p>  <p>  The current talks are very welcome.  It appears that by ending the complete dominance of the talks by the chief antagonists there has at least been space for the dissatisfied majority in Northern Ireland to have its voice heard.  The destructive cycle of bilateral exchanges has thankfully been abandoned and there is an opportunity for new ideas to be tabled and for the largest parties to be challenged.<\/p>  <p>  The issues which are today stated as being the reason for the largest parties failing to agree are absolutely important.  Equality is not something which should be negotiated; it should simply be delivered.<\/p>  <p>  The DUP&rsquo;s reluctance to allow the people of Northern Ireland to have the same rights as are enjoyed by people in every other part of these islands undermines its core position on most other issues.  Equally its use of the petition of concern in order to block equality measures is an absolute abuse of a measure intended to protect minorities against discrimination.<\/p>  <p>  What has poisoned relations on these issues has been the perception that they have stopped being cross-community issues and have started to be presented as party issues.  When Deputy Adams described the equality agenda as &ldquo;the Trojan horse of the republican movement&rdquo; he caused immense damage and so too has been the way in which these issues have been brought in and out of the agenda depending on what suits one party at a particular moment.<\/p><p>The fact that these issues that were irrelevant to the collapse of the institutions are now presented as the only reason for the collapse is widely understood as party tactics rather than a sincere commitment to the issues themselves.<br\/><br\/>On the other hand, the childish and profoundly insulting approach of some within the DUP to cultural and linguistic diversity has caused real damage, which remains in spite of a welcome apology by the DUP leader and, indeed, the strong heritage, particularly of Church of Ireland clergy, mainly Presbyterian academics, in terms of the preservation of the Irish language in an earlier era.  It would mark a major step forward if the largest parties were candidly to admit their roles in the deadlock and to accept that some of their actions have caused real hurt and division.<br\/><br\/>Fundamentally, these talks cannot succeed if the largest parties are motivated by wanting either to claim a win or to avoid admitting to changing anything in their positions.  Last week&rsquo;s so-called intensification of talks lasted 25 minutes and apparently simply heard reasons there would be no flexibility.  We have to break this cycle of entrenched positions and regular breakdowns, and the only way to do this is for those parties to be willing to take a risk on a new approach.  The fact is that a simple restoration of the Assembly and Executive would, even if for a limited period, at a minimum allow the democratic voice of the people to be heard.  Let the Assembly majority have a voice against Brexit, against cutbacks to schools and health services and in favour of equality and diversity.  How could this possibly do anything other than mark a positive development?  It requires other moves before legal measures can be implemented, but the democratic legitimacy behind these policies would be a powerful demonstration of the will to move forward.<br\/><br\/>The contest for leadership of the Tory party and of the British Government is a new obstacle to progress.  With the sole exception of the comments of one candidate, who apparently has little or no chance, the comments of leadership contenders relating to Ireland have been in equal parts superficial and ill informed.  They have yet to address the fact that their policy priority of Brexit has real consequences for this island, consequences that cannot be wished away &ldquo;by closing your eyes, picking up some magic beans and believing in Britain&quot;, as the British Home Secretary put it yesterday.<br\/><br\/>We cannot allow the next few months to be lost because of a London-derived paralysis.  It falls to our Government to insist on genuine urgency in the meetings and on the discussion of alternative strategies and policies, and that parties be obliged to address the scale of public disquiet concerning budget cuts and decisions imposed by British Ministers.  These talks must not be suspended.  They must be kept going and the public must be given honest accounts of what has been considered.  We need an end to the system of duelling briefings from the largest parties, which have been the only sources of information on discussions.<br\/><br\/>It is necessary, unfortunately, to reply to the constant harping which has been heard here from one party seeking to silence others in the D&aacute;il by claiming that we have no right to speak about the North.  Leaving aside the twisted mindset that this involves, we have every right to speak here about these issues.  In the face of incredible provocation, over many years we showed our determination to work for peace and development.  We were not told to butt out when one party here was constantly calling and asking us to intervene.  I do not remember being told to stay quiet when I was co-chairing all-party talks in Northern Ireland and when I was delivering sustained progress in those and other talks.<br\/><br\/>The problem in this House is that, over the past eight years, a habit has developed of talking about the North only when there is a crisis, such as the appalling murder of Lyra McKee, which the Minister of State correctly addressed in his speech.  The issue is not that people should butt out, it is that it falls to everyone here to challenge the right of others to control the debate on Northern Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Enormous damage has been caused by the absence of democratic institutions in Northern Ireland since January 2017.  It is long past time that the people elected to serve in democratic institutions were allowed to get to work.<b><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100037#KK00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560278100,"counter":612,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on these statements on the North in the D&aacute;il.  Far from suggesting anybody should butt out, be quiet or be reticent in our discussion on the North, on the contrary, it is incredibly important that the Oireachtas has ongoing engagement on progress, dilemmas and politics in the North.  I only wish debates on matters in the North were more regular.  I have said before that I await the day when every political party is truly national and stands for democratic election right across the island, including in the Six Counties.<\/p>  <p>  It is true to say we face many immediate challenges, with the chaos in Westminster, an impending Brexit deadline and talks to re-establish the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement in what can only be described as very challenging political circumstances.  There is an onus on all of us in short, medium and longer terms to make political progress and transformation all across the island, including in the North, a core part of our political programme.  There is an onus on all parties and all of us to plan, strategise and build for Irish unity in all its dimensions.  It is incumbent on the Irish Government to lead on these matters.  While the island remains partitioned, Irish citizens in the North nonetheless demand and expect exactly the same respect and rights as their co-citizens living in these parts.<\/p>  <p>  It should make no difference if one lives in Newry or Dundalk, or in Derry or Naas.  People are people and rights are rights.  British citizens in the North are due the same equality and respect as all others, for that is the cornerstone of the Good Friday Agreement.  Whether one is British or Irish, or both, or neither, one is due equal treatment and respect with the equivalence of rights, North and South.  That is hardwired into the agreement.  The vast majority of people, North and South, endorsed the agreement in 1998, and a generation has grown up since then.<\/p>  <p>  Lyra McKee was one of that generation, a generation for whom conflict was in the past and for whom the expectations of inclusion, prosperity and equality are the norm.  Lyra McKee was killed by those who oppose the Good Friday Agreement and offer nothing but injury, death, imprisonment and heartache.  They cannot and must not succeed.  It is the responsibility of us all - Deputies, parties and members of the Government - to realise the potential and promise of the Good Friday Agreement for that new generation.  That work must be above party politics.  It is the people&rsquo;s agreement, the people&rsquo;s peace process, and it is our duty to protect it and deliver on it.<\/p>  <p>  The institutions of the agreement are interlocking and interdependent.  The success of one is dependent on the success of others.  These institutions should be re-established and delivering prosperity, equality and public services for all citizens.  That is beyond doubt.  It is the expressed desire of both Governments and all parties to re-establish the institutions and have them working.<\/p>  <p>  On 2 June, the Taoiseach said in a joint statement made with the British Prime Minister: \"The Secretary of State and the T&aacute;naiste believe that there is a genuine but narrow window of opportunity to reach agreement in the immediate period ahead and that it is essential to continue and intensify talks to this end.\"  The window is indeed narrow.  Last Friday, Ms Theresa May stood down as leader of the Tory party and remains in a caretaker capacity until the election of her successor at the end of July.  The British Government remains in power only with the support of the DUP.  We have the Brexit deadline of 31 October looming on the horizon.  Therefore, the window for reaching agreement is indeed narrow and the political circumstances are considerably complex.  With determination and generosity among all, however, we can succeed.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to reaching agreement and those who have met us in recent weeks and months are aware of that.  Functioning, stable, all-party, inclusive institutions delivering for all in society are the only way forward.<\/p> <p> Most of the issues are already matters of agreement and simply require implementation.  An Irish language Act was agreed 13 years ago at St. Andrews.  I remember it because I was there.  It was an agreement between the British and Irish Governments.  It was explicit and obliged the British Government to, \"introduce an Irish Language Act reflecting on the experience of Wales and Ireland and work with the incoming Executive to enhance and protect the development of the Irish language\".  That was 13 years ago.<\/p> <p> Gaels in the North, after decades of being treated as second-class citizens, rightly expected the British Government to deliver on that promise.  It is both symbolic and practical.  It is required to protect the Irish language, particularly for Gaeilgeoir&iacute;, but it is about much more than that.  This is about identity.  Gaels in the North trusted successive Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Governments to stand over that commitment but it has not been delivered.  The Taoiseach said that Irish citizens in the North would no longer be left behind.  Irish citizens in the North expect the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and all of us to make good on that promise.  The refusal by the British Government, at the behest of a section of unionists, to honour the agreement is a calculated and deliberate put-down to those who value the Irish language and culture and an undermining of the political process.  It provides a cover to those in unionism who opposed, and still oppose, the Good Friday Agreement.  <\/p> <p> Confidence in the political process has been further eroded by the British Government&rsquo;s refusal to put in place the agreed mechanisms to support victims of conflict in their search for truth and justice.  Instead, elements of the British Government are seeking an amnesty for the actions of their forces including the killings in Ballymurphy and on Bloody Sunday.  They continue to refuse to hand over all information relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  <\/p> <p> We now have a system of unequal rights.  Marriage equality is a right enjoyed by Irish citizens in the rest of Ireland and by British citizens in Britain, but is blocked and has been blocked consistently in the North.  The petition of concern was introduced to safeguard the rights of a minority.  It is an essential element of the checks and balances of the Good Friday Agreement but it has been abused to block equality and that is wrong.  <\/p> <p> We cannot waste time reopening agreements already made; this process must be about delivery.  Progress is possible and necessary.  It will be found in implementing existing agreements, respecting the equality of all and recognising that rights for one section of the community do not diminish the rights of others.  Success must be felt by all in society.  This is not about winners and losers, victory or defeat.  It is true to say that we have faced greater challenges in the past and that with generosity and imagination we have found a way forward.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s negotiating team has engaged fully and will move to the next phase with a determination to resolve outstanding issues.  <\/p> <p> The Irish Government is not just a referee or arbitrator in this process.  Members of the Government are signatories, sponsors and the co-equal guarantors of the agreements and the rights of citizens.  It is not a case of determining which rights are upheld or what parts of the agreements are set aside.  In this State we have the protections of the Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  In the North, it is the Good Friday Agreement and the 1998 Act that provide the constitutional protections and status of the North at this time.  It is about securing rights and the implementation of agreements.  That is the basis for re-establishing the institutions.  <\/p> <p> The window of opportunity is narrow.  The chaos in Westminster, the fact that the British Prime Minster is stepping down and the renewal of a deal between the DUP and the Tories make the process of reaching agreement difficult but not impossible.  At the end of this process we must have an agreement that will deliver sustainable institutions, operating to the highest standard and delivering for all.  Failure is not and cannot be an option.  Undermining previous agreements is not an option either and refusing citizens&rsquo; rights can never be an option.  One either honours agreements or does not.  Rights are either safeguarded or denied.  If this phase of the talks cannot resolve outstanding issues, then both Governments must act to make good their commitments; it is as simple as that.  The Government must act to remove the issues of difference and provide the route back to the institutions in line with the Good Friday Agreement and other agreements.  Sinn F&eacute;in will do all in its power to reach an agreement.  All parties and both Governments must do likewise, for that is what we owe the Good Friday Agreement generation and ourselves.  We all must demonstrate that politics works, that agreements made must be honoured and that the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement can and will deliver peace, prosperity and equality for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100038#LL00200","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560278700,"counter":614,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that parties in Northern Ireland are meeting as part of a sincere effort to get the Assembly up and running again.  People in Northern Ireland need political leadership to fill the vacuum on Brexit, but also for day-to-day public administration in health, education, housing, transport and other services.  It is now 866 days since the Assembly last met.  In the same period of time, our own Parliament has overseen a referendum on the eighth amendment and passed legislation to permit abortion.  D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann passed 100 new laws in this period of time, including a crucial law to prepare Ireland for Brexit, the Fossil Fuel Divestment Act, protections to tenants in the rental sector, the creation of technological universities, improved law on domestic violence and so much more.  Stormont, however, has been dormant.  New laws and ministerial decisions in Northern Ireland have not happened, leaving public needs unmet.  It is time for all parties to put aside any and all conditions and to simply get the Assembly up and running again.<\/p>  <p>  Beyond the bread-and-butter issues of good governance, Northern Ireland also needs political leadership on the constitutional issue.  A leading unionist commentator, Mr. Alex Kane, has argued that unionists need to prepare for an inevitable Border poll.  That does not only apply to unionists.  As I said last year, we all need to engage seriously with this possibility.  Underpinning Mr. Kane&rsquo;s logic is the stark reality, as pointed out by Mr. Matthew O&rsquo;Toole, a former Downing Street official, that unionists have not had a majority of the vote in Northern Ireland since 2005.  However, the absence of a unionist majority at European, Assembly or local government level in Northern Ireland does not automatically mean that it has been replaced by a nationalist majority.  As Mr. O&rsquo;Toole argues, a large and growing number of people identify with neither of these labels.  For the first time, people in Northern Ireland are being required to weigh up the benefits of remaining in a changing British Union versus remaining in the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  It is in that context that a Border poll represents a very uncertain prospect for unionists.  Mr. Kane seeks answers to several pertinent questions.  Unlike the Brexit debacle, would an Irish Border poll be preceded by a detailed proposal on what would be the result of a \"Yes\" or \"No\" vote?  Would there be a transition period or financial contributions from the United Kingdom?  Would a vote for a united Ireland revoke and replace the Good Friday Agreement?  What would happen to the National Health Service and other much-loved institutions in Northern Ireland?  We cannot answer all of his questions today but the issues raised show why it is vital that we have much more dialogue and public debate now, rather than on the eve of a Border poll, or, more worryingly, the morning after.  <\/p>  <p>  For some time, I have called for the re-establishment of an all-Ireland forum to discuss what a unitary Irish State might look like.  Any such forum should be constituted in a way that does not imply any consent for Irish unity, but which provides a space in which unionist perspectives can be heard unconditionally.<\/p><p>I agree with Mr. Seamus Mallon that nationalists must aim for reconciliation within Northern Ireland, working with unionists to build what he calls a shared home place.  However, in my view, that shared home space must be for the whole of the island.  Our challenge is to imagine all of Ireland as a shared home space for everyone living here, including the many people from minorities and new communities.<\/p> <p> A 50.1% in favour of or against unity would be decisive.  That is the nature of voting systems.  However, a much larger majority in favour of unity would be greatly desirable, which is why we must prepare and why dialogue and detailed analysis is important now.  One such detailed analysis carried out by the trade union economist Dr. Tom Healy makes an important observation about the standard of living enjoyed in Northern Ireland compared to that in the Republic.  Dr. Healy concludes that there is a rough parity of living standards on the island of Ireland.  I will provide the economic underpinning for that conclusion.  It is an important consideration for anyone who wishes to make the economic case for a united Ireland.  Stronger public services are an important part of the equation that explains how living standards in Northern Ireland are kept at a level similar to those in the Republic.  Northern Ireland has a stronger welfare state than in the Republic in terms of public housing, public transport and, of course, the National Health Service.  This is why we need to be able to guarantee the continued existence of the NHS in Northern Ireland.  That means universal healthcare free of charge at the point of need and based on medical need rather than privileged access to private health insurance.  However, running a parallel system of healthcare on part of the island would be a ludicrous concept in a unitary Irish State.  The only logical response would be the establishment of a universal healthcare system for the whole country.  Sadly, that is far from being achieved, given Fine Gael&rsquo;s reluctance to make serious progress outlined on a cross-party basis in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  However, it is not just the NHS.  All functions of government must be considered.  Northern Ireland has different policies in education, housing, environmental protection, commerce and social welfare, as well as very different military and policing traditions.  Local government in Northern Ireland is not organised on a county basis and we cannot automatically impose that upon people.<\/p> <p> Unifying Ireland is a far more complex undertaking than simply the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from Northern Ireland.  Trying to unify Irish laws and institutions against the resistance of a large unionist minority would be very difficult to put it mildly, and completely unacceptable in my view.  I do not agree with the premise of a question posed by Mr. Alex Kane, who asked whether there will be a mandatory power-sharing provision to protect and promote British and unionist identity.  This question makes the mistake of assuming that everyone in the Republic of Ireland is automatically nationalist in a comparable sense to Northern Ireland.  On the contrary, there have always been \"others\" across Ireland, including socialists, who do not agree with the ideology of ethnic nationalism.  There are many versions of Irish identity and Irish patriotism, including Ireland&rsquo;s Anglo Irish and west British identities.  There is no longer any risk of Northern Ireland being subsumed into a one-dimensional Catholic nationalist Ireland.  Our culture and identity is much more complex and nuanced and now recognised as such.  We should rightly celebrate our age-old institutions and traditions and we should teach all dimensions of Irish history, culture and language in our schools, including Northern Ireland&rsquo;s traditions.<\/p> <p> What should bring us together is a common interest in our island&rsquo;s environment, society and economy.  We are all in this together.  By recognising everyone&rsquo;s fundamental equality, we can be work towards uniting the people.  Why not create an all-island and all-party forum to have this dialogue in a respectful, patient and non-coercive way to build greater understanding between all strands of political thinking on the island?  I do not expect Mrs. Arlene Foster ever to vote for a united Ireland, but I believe we can create an Irish state that honours all traditions on this island.  In an agreed Ireland, our citizens would never belong to one ethnic group or nationality.  We would embrace a new vision of inclusiveness and diversity.  One in nine people living in Northern Ireland and one in eight in Ireland was born elsewhere.  Our island&rsquo;s population is a vibrant mix of people from around the world.  By embracing this diversity and recognising everyone&rsquo;s fundamental equality we can be united as a single people, as are Australians, Canadians and New Zealanders.  We must forge an agreed Ireland which recognises the complexity and diversity of modern society and which acknowledges the role of immigration and emigration in shaping this.  We must evaluate and acknowledge the positive contributions of the deep British influence on Ireland in terms of our way of life, legal system, architecture and, of course, language.  Working together, we can imagine a confident, prosperous island at peace with Britain and secure as part of Europe.  That is an offer we should make to everybody on this island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100039#MM00200","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560279300,"counter":616,"content":"<p>The killing of Lyra McKee in April sent a shockwave across Northern Ireland.  Lyra was one the so-called ceasefire babies, promised a life free from sectarianism and violence.  Instead, since the ceasefires there has been an institutionalisation of sectarianism and what a British Secretary of State termed \"an acceptable level of violence\".  Between 2006 and 2015 there were 1,100 bombings and shootings and 787 paramilitary-style punishment attacks.  Some 160 people have died in the violence since 1998.<\/p>  <p>  The tragic death of Lyra McKee showed something else: it showed that ordinary people - Protestants, Catholics and others - will not tolerate an attempt to drive society back to the conflict of the Troubles.  Protests and vigils initiated by the National Union of Journalists, local trades councils and Lyra's friends and family took place in Derry, Belfast, Omagh, Enniskillen, Strabane, Cookstown, Newry, Dungannon, Dublin, Glasgow, London and elsewhere in the aftermath of her death.  These were very important events for giving expression to the widespread anger and revulsion over her death.  Had the Irish Congress of Trade Unions acted to co-ordinate and develop this movement against sectarianism by calling lunchtime protests, it is likely that we would have seen protests in every major town and city in the North, demanding that there be \"no going back\", which became the slogan of the time.  Unfortunately, that involvement did not happen.<\/p>  <p>  Those who killed Lyra McKee were on the streets carrying guns because the agreement has not brought the promised peace dividend.  Instead, they live in poverty and, in many cases, are exposed to regular harassment by the PSNI.  As Lyra stated, \"We were the Good Friday Agreement generation, destined to never witness the horrors of war but to reap the spoils of peace.  The spoils just never seemed to reach us.\"  Derry in particular has high levels of long-term unemployment and child poverty.  Some 95% of its young people stated that they saw no future for themselves in the city and could not envisage remaining there long term.  This is what allows paramilitary organisations to find their small base of support.  Of course, they offer no way out of poverty, but only increased sectarianism.<\/p><p>The main story of the local and European elections in the North was the rise in support for the Alliance Party and others.  This is a reflection of the desire for a break with the politics of sectarianism.  There is also very clearly huge demand and a desire for social progress in the North.  Lyra was an LGBT activist, an advocate for better mental health and someone who would support the growing demand for abortion rights.  So many people have commented on what is happening in the US, but Northern Ireland is still an episode from <i>The Handmaid's Tale<\/i>.  The Alliance Party, of course, advocates the same type of neoliberal policies that mean poverty for working-class communities, and the party is not a solution.  Alongside the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in, it supported the introduction of Tory welfare reform which has left working-class families about &euro;2,000 worse off each.  At the same time, important jobs in the North are at risk.  Bombardier's global bosses have announced their intention to sell operations in Northern Ireland.  Bombardier accounts for almost 5% of the entire labour force of Northern Ireland and 10% of manufacturing GDP.  The remaining 3,600 jobs are a drastically reduced figure, representing less than half the workforce of the 1990s.  The Socialist Party agrees with the strong motion passed by Unite the Union at its recent conference, which stated:<\/p><blockquote>Our union will do whatever it takes to defend jobs and skills at Bombardier ...  We will continue to raise the idea and fight for the re-nationalisation of this company if that's the only way to protect our members and defend local communities.  We will do whatever it takes to prevent a 'vulture' company swooping in to pick [only what it wants] while leaving the rest to waste.<\/blockquote><p>The trade union movement as a whole must come to the assistance of the Bombardier workers.<br\/><br\/>At the same time, in the public sector in the North, workers are fed up with years of below-inflation pay offers.  The Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance, NIPSA, which is the biggest union in the public sector, has begun an important ballot to reject a derisory 1.25% pay offer and changes to terms and conditions for its members.  These struggles are not only essential to defend working-class people, but they also point to how people can be brought together in common struggle.<br\/><br\/>Of huge assistance in this would be the development of a party that can genuinely unite people across the sectarian divide, including dealing with issues that divide working-class people, in the spirit of solidarity and genuine brotherhood.  The election of a Socialist Party member, Donal O'Cofaigh, as part of Cross-Community Labour Alternative in Enniskillen, was also a breakthrough for this type of anti-sectarian working-class politics, as was the success of other parties and candidates of the left.  Socialist Party members will work with trade unionists and other activists to help ensure that a socialist alternative for working-class people is built to challenge the dead end of sectarianism and capitalism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100040#NN00200","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560279900,"counter":618,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on Northern Ireland and its structures.  This debate arises from the attempt in the past week or two to get the institutions back up and running and the discussions held in Belfast with the various parties to try to do so.  Ultimately, the institutions must be got going again, and the Irish Government will have to be very strong in arguing for their reinstatement.  Ultimately, the flaw in the Good Friday Agreement is that the British are seen as being neutral, when all their recent actions, including the DUP's support of the Government in Westminster, show they are not neutral and never have been neutral.  That is the crux of the problem at all stages in the North as we now see it.  The only way to get around this and defeat it is to get the structures and the assembly back up and running.  Perhaps through the outworkings of that at some stage in the future we will see a future for politics in the Six Counties and a way forward might be shown.  Our Government must be very strong in arguing with the British Government and putting its responsibilities straight on the line.  It is part of the problem.  It must be part of the solution.

The only thing we can do is to ensure that the parties we can influence here are on board to get the institutions going again.  As a House we must be sure that our Government is strong in forcing the British Government to act in this regard.  That is the key to this.  If our Government can force the British Government to face up to its responsibilities, we might see the institutions up and running again and then - unfortunately, a very long way down the road - the causes of the conflict reduced somewhat.  Ultimately, however, the only way we can reduce the cause of the conflict is by getting the British out entirely of the Six Counties.  Then we can deal with the issues as they relate to ourselves and a 32-county Ireland.

He has seen first-hand in recent years the way in which we in our own small way are doing our best to try to ensure that the fallout from Brexit is minimised, whether for our farming community or any other community, whether tourism related or business related, that the lot of the people is protected, and that the negative impact Brexit would have is minimised.

This was achieved by using the political process.  We saw first-hand the way in which at a critical time he was able to get on with people such as the late Ian Paisley.

We speak about the North of Ireland, going back to our ancestors and history, and it should be a full part of our country.  One objective that I share with many others is that we would again be one country under one all-Ireland government.  In the context of Brexit, there are many possibilities that could have adverse effects on our Twenty-six Counties, and it is in that light that so many people are so concerned right around the Republic of Ireland.  For the past six months nobody can understand why cattle are &euro;200 per head dearer in the North of Ireland than they are in the South.  We appreciate when buyers come from the North of Ireland for our cattle because at least it gives us a vital export market.  When we see what factories are doing to farmers, particularly beef farmers around the country, live exports become very important for the farmers in our neck of the woods.  They greatly appreciate buyers, whether they are taking cattle up to the North or across to Great Britain.<\/p>  <p>  The great imponderable matter is what will happen if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union.  We can consider how unfair this would be, as the people in the North of Ireland voted overwhelmingly to stay in the European Union.  Brexit would affect small employers and exporters, as well as those involved in manufacturing.  I have been told by employers in Castleisland, Killarney and mid-Kerry that if there is a hard border with tariffs, there would be severe job losses in parts of Kerry as well as every other part of the country.<\/p>  <p>  We are very grateful for the cross-border directive initiative, which allows us to take patients who would not otherwise be seen here in the South of Ireland to the North.  Patients in Cork and Tralee hospitals were put on waiting lists for a simple cataract procedure and have to wait four to six years to have this done, perhaps losing their sight in the meantime.  I am glad that almost two years ago Deputy Michael Collins and I started using buses to bring people for treatment in the North of Ireland.  We have brought so many people on those buses.  A man who went on the first bus had been waiting for a cataract procedure for six years.  In the early 1960s, his grandfather had that simple procedure done in Tralee general hospital.  People would like to think Ireland has moved on and improved but we have gone backwards as we have to take people who are aged 90, 92 or 94 to the North for treatment.  One man with failing sight went because the doctor would not sign the application to renew his driver's licence.  He had his cataracts removed in Kingsbridge Private Hospital and got his licence a few days later.  These are important issues for people and we are failing in that regard.  It is great that we have the opportunity to restore people's eyesight rather than have them lose it.<\/p>  <p>  There is an 82-year-old man getting his hip done today.  He would have otherwise had to wait in pain for years for the procedure but tomorrow he will go to a hospital in Kerry to recuperate.  It is desperate but there is an opportunity to treat those people who would otherwise be in pain.  It would be disastrous to lose that option and we hope the cross-border initiative, under which people can be reimbursed for the cost of the procedure, will continue.  As we all know, the Health Service Executive has let us down badly and many people are saying it fails people in every regard.  We can see the problems with waiting lists and people on trolleys.  No matter how much money is being pumped into the executive, it is not having the desired effect.  The cross-border initiative is the one good thing about it.<\/p>  <p>  Many of us desire for the Six Counties to be united with the Twenty-six Counties.  We almost had that with the Good Friday Agreement.  If anything should happen leading to a hard border between us and the people in the North of Ireland, it would be a pure disaster.  I appeal to the Minister of State, as part of the Government, to ensure he does everything to prevent Brexit from happening.  People right around the country are so fed up by what is going on and the indecisiveness of those people in England.  They cannot make up their minds as to whether they are coming or going.  If we were in their position, the whole world would laugh because of what is being done.  Their actions are disastrous.  They do not know what they want or how they will achieve it.  They have said they are leaving and not leaving.  They are seeking different conditions.  There are people hopeful of becoming the next British Prime Minister and they are trying to sell the story that the European Union will give them new concessions or a better deal.  They will not get it and the European Union will not change just because there is a new person in the British Prime Minister's seat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100042#PP00200","speaker":"1320"},{"type":"speech","time":1560281100,"counter":622,"content":"<p>I thank colleagues for their contributions.  There was positive engagement across the House in this timely discussion on Northern Ireland.  There was a shared commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and to supporting peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.  That common concern and agreed foundation for all of our engagement on Northern Ireland is hugely important.  In that context, this debate will continue to inform the approach of the Government.  The Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste will continue to work with their counterparts in the British Government and do everything possible to ensure the ongoing process in Stormont has every chance of succeeding in the period immediately ahead.<\/p>  <p>  As I noted in my earlier contribution, the T&aacute;naiste is in Stormont again today, as he has been on numerous days over the past number of weeks, working with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley, to encourage the political parties to reach honourable compromises on the issues that need to be resolved and to get the devolved institutions up and running and delivering again for the people of Northern Ireland, as well as the North-South Ministerial Council to deliver on North-South co-operation as mentioned by all Members.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's commitment to achieving this is absolute and while three key issues remain to be addressed in the ongoing talks, we believe that a resolution between the parties is possible and must be achieved.  This cannot be a drawn-out process.  The demand for a local representative power-sharing devolved government in Northern Ireland is more pressing now than it has ever been previously.  Decisions need to be taken by the new Executive and the issues that need to be dealt with by the Assembly are many, varied and urgent.  There will never be a perfect time for an agreement on the issues in the current process.  They will not be any easier in the future than now and could well be more difficult.<\/p>  <p>  Members referred to the complexities of the issues that need to be addressed.  The current talks are a genuine opportunity to get all of the institutions of the agreement working once again.  I believe this opportunity must be taken.  The Government has always supported and worked for the full implementation of the commitments of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements.  We will continue to offer that support.  That is the basis on which the peace process moves forward with the task of reconciliation for all people on this island.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, the legacy of the Troubles must be addressed in a way that can meet the legitimate needs of victims through the establishment of the comprehensive framework provided for under the Stormont House Agreement in 2014.  The current system is not working for victims and families nor is it supporting the broader societal reconciliation in Northern Ireland.  The Government will keep working with the British Government to get the Stormont House framework established without any further delay.  We see that as a vital part of the peace process.<\/p>  <p>  For the days immediately ahead, the T&aacute;naiste and the Secretary of State will remain intensively engaged on behalf of the two Governments in the talks at Stormont to encourage the party leaders to move towards a final agreement and to get the devolved power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland and the North-South Ministerial Council operating again.  This will not be easy but the two Governments are committed and believe that this can and must be achieved.<\/p>  <p>  Many issues were raised by Members from all sides of the House.  One of the biggest issues we are facing is Brexit.  We cannot allow Brexit to get in the way of ensuring we get the Northern Ireland Assembly up and running again.  There was widespread support for that from all Members who contributed.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Members for their contributions, which I welcome.  I will bring their concerns to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100043#QQ00100","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1560281100,"counter":623,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 7.35 p.m. and resumed at 7.38 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) (Amendment) Bill 2018 [Seanad]: Order for Second Stage","time":1560281100,"counter":624,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100043#QQ00300"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1560281100,"counter":625,"content":"<p><\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1560281100,"counter":626,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That Second Stage be taken now.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100043#QQ00500","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1560281100,"counter":627,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) (Amendment) Bill 2018 [Seanad]: Second Stage","time":1560281100,"counter":628,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100043#QQ00700"},{"type":"speech","time":1560281100,"counter":629,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p><p>I am pleased to bring the Bill before the House.  It will amend the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012, which established Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, the national agency with responsibility for external quality assurance and qualifications across the further and higher education sectors.<\/p><p>The main purpose of this Bill is to further empower QQI as a regulator of quality and to strengthen the agency&rsquo;s role in ensuring high standards across Ireland&rsquo;s education system.<\/p><p>This important legislation will enable QQI to realise its potential, facilitate the introduction of deferred policies and clarify, strengthen and make the operation of existing policies more efficient.  <\/p><p>I would like to highlight seven key provisions, in particular.  The first is the listing of awarding bodies.  This Bill will enable the expansion of the range of awards included in the National Framework of Qualifications, NFQ, by giving QQI explicit authority to list awarding bodies and to include their qualifications in the framework.<\/p><p>Qualifications, such as those awarded by professional and international awarding bodies, are offered by providers in Ireland but are currently unable to access the NFQ.  The Bill addresses this issue by establishing a pathway for awarding bodies and their associated providers to engage with QQI and to have their awards included in the framework while also ensuring that the quality standards of the NFQ are upheld.<\/p> <p> The second key provision is the examination of the bona fides and financial capacity of providers.  As part of strengthening QQI&rsquo;s quality assurance procedures, this Bill will provide a legal basis for QQI to examine the bona fides and financial capacity of the providers with which it engages.  This will enable QQI to assess a provider&rsquo;s capacity and capability to provide programmes of education and training consistent with the quality assurance processes and procedures required by the 2012 Act.  To conduct this assessment, QQI will be further empowered by means of a statutory instrument to establish criteria addressing key issues such as the legal personality, ownership and corporate governance arrangements of providers in addition to examining that adequate financial resources are in place to ensure the viability of these businesses.<\/p> <p> The third key measure to be introduced upon enactment of this Bill is the international education mark, IEM.  The IEM forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s international education strategy which aims to foster and strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a destination of choice for international students.  The IEM will serve as a crucial tool for Ireland&rsquo;s educational providers in underpinning the quality of our educational offerings.  To obtain the IEM, providers will have to demonstrate compliance with key criteria and practices surrounding the protection of enrolled learners, recruitment and admission, information provision, student welfare, cultural awareness, and academic support provisions.  Once in place, only providers authorised to use the IEM will be eligible to recruit international students.  The Bill provides for variants of the IEM to reflect and respond to the demands of different types of educational provision.  At its outset, there will be two initial forms of the IEM, one which will apply to the higher education sector and one for English language education.<\/p> <p> Following its passage through the Seanad, the provisions governing the IEM have been strengthened to reflect concerns emerging during debates relating to the employment terms and conditions of education and teaching staff working in the English language education sector.  Following a number of amendments agreed with Senators, providers who seek authorisation to use the IEM will be subject to additional requirements and oversight.  First is that QQI&rsquo;s powers when assessing a provider&rsquo;s corporate fitness have been broadened to enable checks of compliance with employment law.  This assessment is the first step that a provider must undertake when seeking authorisation to use the IEM.  Second, through the code of practice for the IEM, providers will be required to establish policies and procedures that address specific areas surrounding the employment of their education and teaching staff.  This will include key matters such as recruitment, training and the cessation of employment of staff.<\/p> <p> QQI will be empowered to withdraw the IEM from those providers that are found to be in breach of employment law.  The withdrawal of the IEM is a serious sanction which QQI could impose on providers.  This approach utilises the IEM as a further incentive for providers to comply with their obligations under employment law.  In addition to these measures, in January 2019, I appointed Mr. Patrick King as mediator to work with stakeholders in the English language education sector.  Since his appointment, Mr. King has been engaging with employer and employee representative bodies to seek to secure agreement on a set of minimum employment standards that could be agreed for the sector.  This work has been ongoing with extensive engagement on all sides.<\/p> <p> These discussions have included the potential for a set of appropriate employment standards to take the form of an agreement or order, such as an employment regulation order, under the Industrial Relations Acts, 1946 to 2015.  I wish to inform the House that should this process result in such an agreement or order, it would become part of employment law.  Consequently, compliance with such an agreement or order would also become an automatic requirement of the IEM via the provisions now contained in this Bill without the need for any further legislative action.  I encourage all sides to continue their engagement in the mediation process with the aim of reaching a comprehensive agreement that will benefit this sector in both the short and long term.<\/p> <p> This Bill will also provide for a more robust national scheme for the protection of enrolled learners, PEL.  PEL comes into effect in circumstances where a provider ceases to offer a programme or ceases to trade.  It is intended to ensure that learners who commence a programme can be confident that they will be facilitated in completing that programme, or as a lesser alternative, in receiving a refund of fees paid should such an event occur.  The current arrangements for PEL as required under the 2012 Act have fallen short of their objective and are no longer fit for purpose.  The Bill proposes to replace these existing measures with the establishment of a learner protection fund.  This fund will provide QQI with the necessary resources to manage PEL events.  Should a provider cease to provide a programme, the fund would, where necessary, be used by QQI to fund the teaching out of the original programme where possible, fund the payment of fees for the transfer of an enrolled leaner onto a similar programme of another provider, or where the circumstances dictate, provide for the refund of fees to the learner.  Those providers whose programmes are covered by this fund would be required to pay an annual charge to QQI for PEL.  The fund will be fully resourced by these charges.  The level of the fee is intended to be as affordable as possible to avoid any undue imposition on providers and students while also avoiding any risk transfer to the Exchequer.  The precise detail will be agreed following further consultation with stakeholders.<\/p> <p> The Bill will provide QQI with powers to prosecute the provision or advertising of essay mills and other forms of academic cheating.  Essay mills are services which supply to learners, in whole or in part, assignments that are required to be completed as part of a programme of education and training.  These services are principally advertised online and have been a growing phenomenon in recent years.  These services present a challenge to the academic integrity of those programmes and awards under the remit of QQI.<\/p><p>The creation of offences for the provision and advertisement of these services will serve to prohibit the practice and make these services more difficult to access.<\/p> <p> The next provision relates to awarding powers for institutes of technology.  Currently, all of the institutes of technology, with the exception of the Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, have delegated authority from QQI to make awards from levels 6 to 9 on the NFQ.  In contrast the universities as well as the DIT and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, are designated awarding bodies.  This means that they are self-awarding bodies.  There is, therefore, a legislative difference in the relationship between QQI and the universities and the institutes of technology.  The Bill addresses this legislative difference by providing for amendments to the Regional Technical Colleges Act 1992 to grant award-making powers, with the exception of doctoral awards, to all of the institutes of technology.  This will put them on an equal footing with the designated awarding bodies with which they are expected to establish regional and thematic clusters, as per the goals of the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030.  It will create a single coherent quality assurance and qualifications framework among public higher education institutions.<\/p> <p> The next provisions relate to the use of the title of \"university\".  The Bill contains an amendment to the Universities Act 1997, which establishes a pathway for higher education institutions whose primary source of income does not derive from the Exchequer to access and use the title of \"university\".  This amendment establishes a process whereby such an institution may apply for authorisation to describe itself as a university and provide evidence that it meets the high standards associated with this title.  This process will allow an institution, such as RCSI, to seek the designation \"university\" while ensuring that the existing regulatory and governance framework operating in the higher education sector remains intact.<\/p> <p> Having set out the policy context underpinning the development of the Bill, I turn to the specific provisions.  The Bill comprises 38 sections and is divided into three Parts.  Part 1 comprises sections 1 and 2.  It contains standard provisions on the Short Title and commencement and provides definitions for use in the Act.<\/p> <p> Part 2 comprises sections 3 to 34, inclusive, and amends the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012, which is the principal Act.  Section 3 provides for amendments to section 2 of the principal Act.  It introduces new, and revises existing, definitions within the 2012 Act.<\/p> <p> Section 4 amends the functions of QQI and includes specific statutory functions for the inclusion of awards within the national framework of qualifications and the listing of awarding bodies.<\/p> <p> Section 5 amends section 13 of the principal Act to make listed awarding bodies subject to the requirements of the section.  Section 13 requires that providers facilitate and assist QQI in the performance of its functions insofar as those functions relate to the functions of that provider.<\/p> <p> Section 6 provides for a specific legislative function for QQI to share relevant information with other state bodies, including the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and SOLAS.<\/p> <p> Section 7 amends section 27 of the principal Act to provide for the periodic review and updating by QQI of quality assurance guidelines and for the issuance of different guidelines for different types of programmes including for the new category of listed awarding bodies.<\/p> <p> Section 8 amends section 28 of the principal Act and contains provisions to clarify the scope of quality assurance procedures established by providers having regard to the guidelines issued by QQI.<\/p> <p> Section 9 provides QQI with statutory powers to evaluate the bona fides and financial capacity of providers.<\/p> <p> Section 10 contains provisions to allow QQI to impose certain conditions on an education and training provider whose quality assurance procedures it has approved.<\/p> <p> Sections 11, 13 and 24 provide for QQI to consult with SOLAS when conducting reviews of further education and training providers.  This parallels existing provisions in the 2012 Act for consultation with the HEA in respect of higher education institutions.<\/p> <p> Sections 12 and 18 provide for certain occasions when QQI can withdraw approval of quality assurance procedures and programme validation, respectively, without conducting a review.<\/p> <p> Section 14 amends section 43 of the principal Act to provide a legal basis for the inclusion of awards made by designated awarding bodies, that is to say, the seven universities, DIT and RCSI, in the NFQ.  It further provides for QQI to establish policies and criteria for awards to be included within the framework and for the establishment of different policies and criteria for different awards and different awarding bodies.<\/p> <p> Section 15 provides QQI with powers to prosecute the provision or advertising of essay mills and other forms of academic cheating.<\/p> <p> Section 16 provides necessary amendments to facilitate the extension of the awarding powers of institutes of technology to include awards up to level 9 on the NFQ.  As a result, institutes of technology will be required to apply for QQI validation for doctoral degree level awards only.<\/p> <p> Sections 17 and 35 amend sections 45 and 84, respectively, of the principal Act to provide that QQI validation for all education and training programmes is time limited.<\/p> <p> Sections 19 and 23 authorise QQI to list awarding bodies and include their qualifications in the NFQ.  Section 19 provides for a transitional period of five years to facilitate existing arrangements between certain providers, such as institutes of technology and education and training boards, and awarding bodies other than QQI.<\/p> <p> Section 20 provides a technical clarification to the effect that learners seeking access to recognition of prior learning processes should apply in the first instance to an education and training provider rather than to QQI.<\/p> <p> Section 21 provides for QQI to examine the suitability of a provider's quality assurance procedures in the context of determining a provider's request for delegated authority to make awards.  It also provides for QQI to define a class of programmes for the purposes of delegating authority to enable a more focused approach to delegating authority where it is warranted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061100043#QQ00800","speaker":"1247","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1560282300,"counter":632,"content":"<p>I have to interrupt the Minister of State.
