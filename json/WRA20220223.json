These Regulations allow the CEG tariff to become available for micro-and small-scale generators so that they will receive payment from their electricity supplier for all excess renewable electricity they export to the grid, reflective of the market value. The Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff represents the first phase of a comprehensive enabling framework for micro-and small-scale electricity generators in Ireland,\u00a0including solar PV.  The Micro-generation Support Scheme (MSS), approved by Government\u00a0on 21 December 2021, will provide capital grants for new domestic and small non-domestic installations, including for farmers. Businesses, including farms, who install new larger installations can avail of a Clean Export Premium tariff which will\u00a0provide a fixed tariff for 15 years for electricity exported to the grid. The scheme design will be published shortly and supports will be introduced on a phased basis this\u00a0year.The Climate Action Plan 2021 also commits to the development of a support scheme for small-scale generators, i.e. above 50kW but smaller than those supported by the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS),\u00a0which will be progressed in 2022 and is expected to become available in 2023. This scheme will enable larger businesses, farms and community projects to maximise their participation in the energy transition.<\/p>  <p>  For grid-scale installations, including solar PV,\u00a0supports are available under the RESS, which\u00a0provides a guaranteed fixed price,\u00a0determined through a competitive auction, for a period of up to 16.5 years. The second RESS auction which is due to take place in\u00a02022 includes\u00a0Evaluation Correction Factors\u00a0which provide for a slight competitive advantage for solar PV projects on taking into account system costs of technologies. <\/p>  <p>  Other financial supports available for solar energy projects include tax based incentives for the development of renewable technologies such as the Accelerated Capital Allowances Scheme and the Employment and Investment Incentive as well as improvements for farm enterprises supported by the Department for Agriculture, Food and Marine, under the Pig and Poultry Investment Scheme as part of the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS). <\/p>  <p>  Planning requirements for solar PV installations on agricultural land are\u00a0primarily a matter for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.\u00a0That Minister\u00a0is expected to\u00a0bring forward revised Regulations\u00a0this year to reduce barriers to solar PV adoption.

Under the Climate Action Plan 2021,\u00a0ESBN will commence a similar trial for connections in the 51-200kW range later this year, further reducing barriers to solar PV adoption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300067#WRB03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":45,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[10185\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300067#WRB03300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if the eligibility criteria for the free energy upgrade scheme have changed from houses built before 2006 to houses built before 1993; if so, the number of houses this measure will exclude from this scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":46,"content":"<p>The Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme delivers free energy upgrades for eligible homeowners in low income households who are most at risk of energy poverty.\u00a0 It is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).\u00a0 Since the start of the scheme in 2000, over 143,000 free upgrades have been supported by the scheme.\u00a0 In 2021, the average cost of the energy efficiency measures provided per household had increased to &euro;17,100.

Until the Finance Act 2019 Ireland&rsquo;s vehicle benefit-in-kind regime was unusual in that there was no overall CO2 rationale in the regime, despite a CO2 based vehicle BIK regime being legislated for as far back as 2008 (but never having been commenced). Section 6 of the Finance Act 2019 legislated for a fundamental overhaul of the regime which brought in discount and surcharge rates based on a car&rsquo;s emissions profile, and is due to commence from 1\/1\/2023. <\/p>  <p>  There have been arguments surrounding the mileage bands in the BIK structure as they can be perceived as incentivising higher mileage to avail of lower rates, leading to higher levels of emissions. The rationale behind the mileage bands is that the greater the business mileage, the more the car is a benefit to the company rather than its employee (on average); and the more the car depreciates in value, the less of a benefit it is to the employee (in years 2 and 3) as the asset from which the benefit is derived is depreciating faster. Mileage bands also ensure that cars more integral to the conduct of business receive preferential tax treatment. <\/p>  <p>  Acknowledging these environmental concerns however, the reform brought in the 2019 Finance Act reduced the mileage bands from five to four, thus weakening any perverse incentives of increasing mileage to reduce tax liability while still seeking to apply the tax in proportion to the quantum of benefit derived from the car.  The new structure with CO2-based discounts and surcharges provides a broad structure to incentivise employers to make greener choices when providing employees with company cars; the system will mean that low-emission vehicles and any EVs that are liable for a BIK charge will benefit from a preferential rate ranging from 9 - 22.5%, depending on mileage. Conversely, high emissions vehicles will be subject to higher rates of BIK. This will bring the taxation system around company cars into step with other CO2-based motor taxes as well as the long-established CO2-based vehicle BIK regimes in other member states. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland currently has a BIK relief for electric vehicles which is due to continue until end 2025.

The National Remote Work Strategy aims to make remote work a permanent feature of the Irish working experience in a way that maximises the economic, social and environmental benefits. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the national remote working strategy: Making Remote Work, the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) reviewed the current tax arrangements for remote working in respect of both employees and employers. The TSG paper outlines the effects of Covid-19 on remote working in Ireland, provides an international comparison of remote working tax rules, sets out options for consideration with regard to enhancing the tax arrangements for both employers and employees in respect of remote work and evaluates those options in accordance with the Department of Finance Tax Expenditure Guidelines. The paper is published on the gov.ie website.<\/p>  <p>  The feasibility of a bespoke tax credit for remote workers was considered as part of the review undertaken by the TSG, noting that stakeholders indicated a preference for a stand-alone remote working credit. However, for a number of reasons, including those outlined in the TSG paper, this option was not pursued. A tax credit for remote working would give rise to issues of deadweight loss and economic inefficiencies, as well as equity issues in the personal tax system. Further, it would be necessary to define qualifying criteria and potentially a minimum eligibility qualifying criteria to avail of the criteria that may necessitate distinctions be drawn between those that work from home on a full time basis and those that work from home on a part time basis. The cost of such a measure was another aspect that was considered. <\/p>  <p>  Subsequently, as part of my Budget 2022 deliberations, I decided not to introduce a tax credit for remote working. Instead, I introduced an income tax deduction amounting to 30% of the cost of vouched expenses for heat, electricity and internet services in respect of those incurred while working from home can be claimed by taxpayers. This measure enhances and formalises existing arrangements that are currently operated by Revenue on an administrative basis and its legislative aspects were provided for in Finance Act 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The amount of the relief will depend on the particular circumstances of the remote worker in terms of the level of costs incurred and their marginal tax rate. However, this measure will provide some relief for those with additional expenses arising from working from home.   <\/p>  <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s online system will enable individuals claim tax relief in real time as they pay for these costs throughout the year. People are, generally speaking, well accustomed to supplying receipts to vouch expenditure in order to claim refunds of monies in other areas.  For example, claiming refunds of medical expenses from health insurers are typically done on this basis.  A similar model operates for tax refund claims in respect of remote working expenses and, I am advised that, Revenue has sought to make the submission of such claims as easy as possible for taxpayers.   <\/p>  <p>  PAYE workers can make a claim for remote working relief in one of two ways:<\/p>  <p>1.  End of year claim - by completing an Income Tax return at year end<\/p>  <p>  Where a taxpayer claims remote-working expenses by completing an Income Tax return at year end, he\/she can upload supporting documentation via the Revenue Receipts Tracker. He\/she can opt to save the information to Revenue storage where it will prefill his or her tax return to assist in the completion and filing of the return. Valid receipts saved to Revenue storage do not need to be retained by the taxpayer for 6 years.<\/p>  <p>2.  Real-time claim - by using the My Account facility<\/p>  <p>  Revenue advises that the simplest way for taxpayers to claim their e-working expenses and any other tax credit entitlements is by logging into the MyAccount facility on the Revenue website. Revenue has provided a real-time facility available to claim remote working relief for 2022 when the expense is incurred.   To avail of the credit in real-time the taxpayer is required to upload the receipt details and a readable image of his or her receipt(s) to the Receipts Tracker in MyAccount at the time of making the claim. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised that Revenue has published detailed guidance on this matter on their website, with comprehensive information available in Tax and Duty Manual 05-02-13 e-Working and Tax, which is available at - www.revenue.ie\/en\/tax-professionals\/tdm\/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax\/part-05\/05-02-13.pdf.<\/p>  <p>  Guidance on how to register for My Account is available at - www.revenue.ie\/en\/online-services\/services\/register-for-an-online-service\/register-for-myaccount.aspx.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300069#WRD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Medical Certificates","counter":151,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300069#WRD01700"},{"type":"question","counter":152,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[10403\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300069#WRD01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of the review and the criteria changes planned in relation to the primary medical certificate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1493","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":153,"content":"<p>The Disabled Drivers &amp;amp; Disabled Passengers Scheme provides relief from Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT on the purchase and use of an adapted car, as well as an exemption from motor tax and an annual fuel grant.<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain charitable organisations.

Any increase in the cost of the Scheme would require a concomitant increase in tax, reduction in public expenditure, or increase in the Exchequer deficit.<\/p>  <p>  While I am very aware of the importance of this scheme to those who benefit from it, I am also aware of the disquiet expressed by members of this house and others in respect of the difficulties around access to the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, I gave a commitment to the House that a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities, would be undertaken. In this context I have been working with my Government colleague, Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman, Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. We are both agreed that the review should be brought within a wider review under the auspices of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, to examine transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities.  <\/p>  <p>  This the most appropriate forum to meet mutual objectives in respect of transport solutions\/mobility supports for those with a disability.<\/p>  <p>  The NDIS working group, chaired by Minister Anne Rabbitte, with officials from both my Department and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth as well as others, held its first meeting on the 26th January 2022. My officials will continue to work closely with officials from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, to progress this review, and on foot of that will bring forward proposals for consideration.<\/p>  <p>  I cannot comment on any possible changes in advance of proposals arising from the review.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300069#WRD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":155,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300069#WRD02100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Risk Management","counter":154,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300069#WRD02000"},{"type":"question","counter":155,"qnumday":98,"qnumall":"[10497\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300069#WRD02100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the status of all current and proposed flood relief schemes for County Cork.","asker":"1525","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":156,"content":"<p>The status of schemes currently being implemented, as well as those proposed, for Cork County, is set out below.

Following a tender competition, Cork County Council appointed JB Barry and Partners Ltd. in a joint venture with JBA Consulting Ltd. on 3rd February last as engineering and environmental consultants to carry out the design of the Bantry Flood Relief Scheme. The Steering Group, comprising representatives from the Office of Public Works, Cork County Council and the Engineering Consultant is now taken place to progress the Bantry Flood Relief Scheme.  The measures currently proposed for Bantry will protect some 198 properties.  In tandem with progressing this scheme, Cork County Council is preparing the consultants brief, to carry out the repair and re-construction of a culvert on Main Street, which is expected to issue in the first quarter this year.  This culvert has been identified as a significant element contributing to flooding on Main Street, New Street and north and south of Wolfe Tone Square in recent months.  The OPW and Cork County Council shall continue to liaise on the integration of these works with the flood relief scheme for the town.<\/p><p><b>Midleton<\/b><\/p><p>The Midleton flood relief scheme is currently in the final stages of scheme development of a number of flood relief options and the identification of a preferred scheme which is expected to be completed by Quarter 3 of 2022. It is also expected to move to planning stage towards the end of this year.  The next Public Participation Day is to be scheduled for Quarter 2 of 2022.  A Scheme Climate Change Adaptation Plan is being included in the scheme to aid in current and future options. The Midleton Flood Relief Scheme will protect some 246 properties when complete.<\/p><p><b>Ballyvourney\/Ballymakeera<\/b><\/p><p>The OPW, in partnership with Cork County Council, are engaging proactively to progress a preferred option for the Ballyvourney\/Ballymakeera Flood Relief Scheme and to provide proposals for Public Exhibition to inform a scheme that is technically, environmentally and economically viable to proceed to detailed design stage. Environmental surveys were updated in 2021 by the environmental engineers on the project with a view to completing the Environment Impact Assessment and to ensure that suitable mitigation requirements are implemented and appropriate processes to comply with statutory provisions are followed. The scheme will protect some 90 properties when complete. <\/p><p><b>Ballinhassig<\/b><\/p><p>A pre-feasibility study into the flooding issues in Ballinhassig has been completed by the Office of Public Works and has identified a preferred option for the area. Further assessment of the environmental impacts is currently being reviewed to inform the planning process, after which the project will progress to planning and detailed design. The scheme will protect some 8 properties when complete. <\/p><p>The proposed schemes for Ballingeary, Inchigeelagh, Inishannon, Castlemartyr, Castletown Bearhaven, Kanturk, Rathcormack, Schull and Youghal are not in the first tranche of projects to be progressed. The OPW and Cork County Council are working closely to ensure that the programme of flood relief projects identified for Cork County is kept under review, and that all projects will be commenced as soon as possible within the timeframe of the current National Development Plan.  The OPW, working closely with its Local Authority Delivery Partners, at all times strives to expedite and progress capital flood relief works with the minimum delay within the resources available to it.<\/p><p>In relation to schemes being progressed in the Cork City area, the status is as follows:<\/p><p><b>Lower Lee Flood Relief Scheme and Morrison&rsquo;s Island<\/b><\/p><p>The Lower Lee Flood Relief Scheme (LLFRS) is currently at Planning and Detailed Design stage and it is intended to submit the Scheme for Confirmation to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform later in 2022.  While the project budget of the Lower Lee Flood Relief Scheme at Public Exhibition stage was &euro;140m, significant enhancements to the proposed scheme design, resulting from engagement and submissions at Public Exhibition stage, will require this figure to be revised before the submission for Confirmation.  Once the Scheme is confirmed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 and 1995, and following the appointment of Contractors, the Scheme will have an anticipated construction period of 5-6 years.<\/p><p>The estimated cost for the Lower Lee Scheme includes approximately &euro;12m for the Morrison&rsquo;s Island scheme, which is a Cork City Council-led public realm scheme with flood defence elements part-funded by the OPW.  Although the Morrison&rsquo;s Island project is primarily a public realm project, it will also include the integration of flood defences in the area, and elements of its design are therefore being coordinated with the design of the Lower Lee Flood Relief Scheme, and co-funded by the Office of Public Works. <\/p><p>An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted approval for the Morrison&rsquo;s Island Public Realm and Flood Defence Project in June 2020.  However, in August 2020, the Save Cork City (SCC) Community Association Ltd. applied for, and was granted, leave to take a Judicial Review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s decision to approve the project.  The Judicial Review hearing took place in July 2021 and the High Court upheld the Decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to grant the planning permission for the proposed development, and refused a stay on the undertaking of any works pursuant to the grant of the planning permission for the proposed development.  Accordingly, tender documentation for the procurement of a civil works contractor is being finalised and will issue following the pre-qualification process for the shortlisting of candidates for the tender process, which is currently ongoing. <\/p><p><b>Blackpool<\/b><\/p><p>The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform confirmed the Blackpool Flood Relief Scheme, with an estimated cost of &euro;20.5m, in March 2021 and construction was expected to commence in 2022.  <\/p><p>In June 2021, the community group, Save Our Bride Otters (SOBO), was granted leave to apply for a Judicial Review of the decision of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to approve the Blackpool Flood Relief Scheme. A stay was also granted on works being carried out pursuant to the Decision, pending the resolution of these proceedings.<\/p><p>The Department of Public Expenditure has agreed to consent to an order reverting the evaluation of the Blackpool Flood Relief scheme back to an advanced stage of further public consultation. In agreeing to this, the Department of Public Expenditure has conceded the matter on a single ground related to public consultation procedures on certain information as part of the confirmation process. The confirmation process for this scheme, including any additional public consultation required, is a matter for the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform. The Office of Public Works will continue to engage with Department for Public Expenditure and Reform as appropriate to further progress the scheme.<\/p><p>The Office of Public Works, along with a multi-disciplinary team, has done extensive work over the last nine years to analyse, assess and model the flood risk in Blackpool, and has considered a wide range of options for managing the significant risk posed to property and people. This work has resulted in the development of the most effective Flood Relief Scheme to provide this community with much-needed protection from extreme flood events, both now and into the future. During the course of the development of the Blackpool (River Bride) Flood Relief Scheme, the OPW also has engaged extensively with the public and other stakeholders. The proposed flood relief scheme is a critically required infrastructural investment in the Blackpool area, which will serve to protect the businesses and people in the area from the ongoing risk of flooding. The Office of Public Works reiterates its commitment to achieving this objective.<\/p><p><b>Douglas and Togher<\/b><\/p><p>The Douglas flood relief scheme (including Togher culvert) is being progressed by Cork County Council and Cork City Council (following boundary extension). In November 2017, planning approval was given by An Bord Plean&aacute;la for the Douglas (including Togher culvert) scheme.  The scheme is being delivered in three Phases. Construction of the scheme commenced in 2019, with the first two phases now substantially complete. The construction contract was awarded for the final phase, Phase 3 - Togher Main works, in Summer 2021, with the scheme now at construction. The scheme will protect some 231 properties. <\/p><p><b>Glashaboy River (Glanmire Sallybrook)<\/b><\/p><p>The Glashaboy River Flood Relief Scheme at Glanmire \/ Sallybrook, Cork is being progressed by Cork City Council.

Cork City Council as the Contracting Authority for the project will appoint the civil works contractor.  Tenders for the above scheme were invited by Cork City Council on eTenders on 30th September 2021, with the closing date for receipt of tenders of 24th January 2022. The tenders are currently being assessed and it is anticipated that construction of the scheme will commence in Quarter 2, 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300069#WRD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":158,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300069#WRD02400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Television Licence Fee","counter":157,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300069#WRD02300"},{"type":"question","counter":158,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[10233\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300069#WRD02400","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if the Revenue Commissioners will be the authority responsible for collecting the television licence in 2022 or beyond.","asker":"1489","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":159,"content":"<p>The principal mechanism for the provision of public funding to support public service broadcasting in the State is the TV Licence fee.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Future of Media Commission was established by Government to consider the future of print, broadcast, and online media in a platform agnostic fashion; and the potential measures required to ensure that our public service media continues to play its essential role within our society for the foreseeable future.

This can be either an Approved Housing Body (AHB) or since 2018 a private company, Home for Life Ltd. If more than one party is interested in buying the property, the lender will provide information to the borrower around the options available to them and the borrower will make the decision on who purchases the property. The AHB or local authority (in the case where the property is sold to a private company) becomes the landlord and the borrower remains in the property as a tenant paying a differential rent to the landlord based on his or her income.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In the initial years of the scheme, the scheme relied solely on AHBs to purchase from lenders, properties that have been voluntarily surrendered by borrowers. A Review of the\u00a0MTR scheme\u00a0for borrowers of commercial private lending institutions was published in February 2017.\u00a0While there are obvious social and economic benefits to be derived from the MTR scheme, most significantly by facilitating individual households in mortgage arrears to remain in their home,\u00a0the 2017 Review acknowledged that consideration needed to be given to the capacity of AHBs to intensify their involvement in the MTR scheme given the ambitious targets for the AHB sector around delivering new social housing supply.<\/p>  <p>  The 2017 Review committed to exploring the potential of private institutional investment in MTR in order to allow the MTR scheme to deliver at scale.\u00a0The capital outlay to purchase these properties could be provided through private finance to avoid competing for upfront exchequer capital resources within the overall funding available for social housing.\u00a0An\u00a0Expressions of Interest\u00a0(EOI) Request issued in 2017 inviting parties from the private sectors to express their interest in participating in a new alternatively funded long-term MTR lease model. The National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) acted as financial advisor during the process, undertaking due diligence on the financial capacity of the proposers to commit to the long-term undertaking of the scheme. The outcome from the\u00a0EOI process was that a new MTR alternatively funded lease model\u00a0was announced\u00a0in 2018 with Home for Life Ltd. as the participant from the private sector.<\/p>  <p>  Under this alternatively funded model,\u00a0Home for Life\u00a0Ltd. purchases\u00a0properties from lenders subsequent to their voluntary surrender by borrowers that meet the MTR eligibility criteria and then enters into a long-term 25 year lease arrangement with the local authority in whose area the property is situated for a defined term at an agreed rent, thereby enabling the borrower to remain living in their own home under a tenancy agreement with the local authority.\u00a0Home for Life Ltd. is also responsible for managing and maintaining the property on behalf of the local authority in accordance with the lease requirements.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Regardless of who the property owner is under\u00a0the MTR scheme, AHB or Home for Life Ltd., the local authority is obliged to meet the housing needs of social housing tenants indefinitely and beyond the term of the applicable lease arrangement.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A key benefit of the MTR scheme is that a unit is being brought into social housing rather than an additional social housing unit having to be sourced from the rental market at a time of increasing acute supply issues in the rental market or removing an additional rental unit from the rental market. The availability of the scheme means that people can avoid losing their homes and the associated family upheaval. As the household are at risk of losing their home, the scheme avoids an additional person or household being placed on the social housing list or additional reliance on other housing support schemes such as the Housing Assistance Payment.<\/p>  <p>  The inclusion of a private entity, in addition to the existing AHBs who continue to be an integral part of the MTR scheme, gives opportunities to achieve greater scale and meet the long-term housing needs of a greater number of borrowers who have unsustainable mortgage arrears. This is evident through the increased number of completed cases since the private entity has entered into the scheme - up to the end December 2021, they have facilitated\u00a0672 families (40% of all MTR cases) to stay\u00a0in their homes. In 2021, approximately 250% more cases were completed as part of the scheme than in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  Given the sizeable cohort of borrowers still in long-term mortgage arrears, all the MTR providers participating in the scheme are needed in order to meet the demand for the scheme.

The full conditions for eligibility are set out in the scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, \u00a0ww.pyriteboard.ie.\u00a0 Under these conditions, if on 12 December 2013 a person owned, whether or not jointly, more than one dwelling, they may only make an application to the Pyrite Resolution Board for inclusion of one of those dwellings in the Scheme. <\/p>  <p>  The Housing Agency implement the remediation process and undertake procurement of professional services and the remediation contracts. At the end of 2021, 2292 homes had been remediated at a cost of approximately &euro;150m. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0In relation to the Defective Concrete Blocks Grant (DCB) Scheme, I brought a Memorandum to Government on an enhanced scheme on the 30 November 2021. It included an unprecedented suite of improvements to the current scheme which removes the financial barrier to scheme entry by simplifying and streamlining the application process.\u00a0 It also increases the grants available from 90% to 100% of allowable costs and the maximum grant level from &euro;247,500 to &euro;420,000, provides for a second grant in certain circumstances, introduces an independent appeals process and strengthens the certificate of remediation available to homeowners.\u00a0 Government approved the enhanced scheme which it is estimated will cost approximately &euro;2.2Bn.\u00a0 The terms of the enhanced DCB scheme reflect favourably when compared to the Pyrite Remediation Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The grant scheme when originally introduced was available to principal private residence only.\u00a0 However, I have extended that to now include the individual&rsquo;s principal private residence and RTB registered properties, that is, a house or apartment which an individual owns (or co-owns) and occupies as his or her only or main residence and a rented dwelling with a Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) registered tenancy on November 1st 2021 subject to a maximum of one rental property per household and the introduction of a clawback mechanism upon re-sale within a set time period depending on the remediation option used. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The decision to go with a grant scheme, as opposed to the type of scheme provided by the Pyrite Resolution Board, gives homeowners the flexibility to manage their own projects and allow them to deal directly with their appointed contractor. It is also of note that the quantum of homes affected is in the region of 7,500, the majority of which would be a bespoke design. This means the large scale and individualised, home by home plans that form much of the work involved is not currently feasible for the type of scheme provided by the Pyrite Resolution Board via the Housing Agency. Homeowners will also be eligible for the newly revised SEAI retrofit grants.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In relation to building standards, the Building Regulations apply to certain works to existing buildings e.g. all works in connection with the material alteration or extension of an existing building, a repair and renewal that is likely to affect the structural integrity of the building or building element being repaired or renewed etc. <\/p>  <p>  The requirements of the Building Regulations are set out in 12 parts (classified as Parts A to M). Technical Guidance Documents (TGDs) are published to accompany each part of the Building Regulations indicating how the requirements of that part can be achieved in practice. Some technical guidance documents provide specific guidance on works to an existing building e.g. Section 2 of\u00a0TGD L Conservation of Fuel and Energy. No works shall be carried out to a building which would cause a new or greater contravention in the building of any provision of Building Regulations. As a result, in general, the reinstatement of building elements in a remediation project is on\u00a0a &lsquo;like for like&rsquo; performance basis. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300069#WRD04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":178,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300069#WRD04700"},{"type":"question","counter":179,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[10173\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300069#WRD04800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will address concerns that the costs and inefficiencies in the planning process are creating a reduced ability among owners of agricultural land to progress the installation of solar panels that have the potential to reduce emissions and increasing the supply of green energy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":180,"content":"<p>Under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, as amended (the Act), all development, unless specifically exempted under the Act or associated Regulations, requires planning permission.\u00a0 Section 4 of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission.\u00a0Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. <\/p>  <p>  Class 18 of Part 3 of Schedule 2 of the Regulations provides an exemption for \"the installation\u00a0or erection on an agricultural structure, or within the curtilage of an agricultural holding, of solar panels (thermal collector or photo-voltaic)\", subject to a number of conditions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department, in the context of the Climate Action Plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the Regulations, with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity.

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs including the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the complex needs of some students would also be provided. <\/p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by my Department. It was decided that priority would be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role. <\/p>  <p>  The first national training programme for SNAs is now in place and it aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. The programme is fully funded by my Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA. <\/p>  <p>  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes and this will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.<\/p>  <p>  Raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been raised by the FORSA union and has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission.  My Department is engaging in that process.<\/p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for each individual school authority. In addition, the actual requirements for a post will vary depending on the specific needs of the children and the school to which the SNA is to be appointed. My Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualifications has impacted on the calibre of person appointed and it is also the case that people with experience and\/or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.<\/p>  <p>  However, having considered the claim and, in particular, the period of time since they were set, my Department is open to reviewing the position. My Department has also agreed to a review of the SNA contract which was agreed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement.   My Department is of the view that the forthcoming review of the SNA contract should be carried out and implemented first. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the approach outlined fully recognises the important place of SNAs in our schools.

A letter issued to the person concerned on 14 January 2020 informing her of this decision. <\/p>  <p>  This decision does not affect current entitlement to CA which will remain in payment.<\/p>  <p>  The Debt Recovery Unit (DRU) in Longford wrote to the person concerned on 12 January 2021 and advised that the current repayments of &euro;20.00 per week would remain in place and they were given 21 days to respond to this proposal.  This letter advised, in error, that arrears of &euro;25,134.10 were due, and proposed that these arrears would be withheld against the debt of the person concerned.  As per the revised decision of the Appeals Officer the original debt amount remains. <\/p>  <p>  The person concerned is currently making repayments of &euro;20.00 per week and on 17 February 2022 has an overpayment to the value of &euro;152,139.10 with the department.<\/p>  <p>  DRU will engage with the person concerned on foot of any response received and will take into consideration any financial burden they are experiencing as a result. <\/p>  <p>  Any new repayment plan applied will need to be reasonable to the person concerned and the Department.  As with all debts owed to the Department, the Minister must make every effort to recover debts in full and debts will remain until fully recovered<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300072#WRG03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":336,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300072#WRG03200"},{"type":"question","counter":337,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[10242\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300072#WRG03300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will reconsider a claim for a carer&rsquo;s allowance by a person (details supplied) in County Cork in view of the clear evidence that the number of hours worked is beneath the 18.5 hour threshold;

At that time I stated a need to look forward in our collective efforts to further improve outcomes for children and young people in Ireland, taking the learnings from the BOBF process on board. Work has begun in my Department on the development of the successor Framework and I look forward to working with all stakeholders in its development and implementation.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department is reviewing the Child Care Act 1991, following extensive consultation with stakeholders. The 1991 Act is a wide-ranging piece of legislation, which seeks to promote the welfare of children who may not receive adequate care and protection. The proposals include changes across a wide range of areas, from relatively minor or procedural issues, to more significant reform proposals.  Some of the more significant areas of focus are as follows:<\/p><p>- It is proposed to introduce a guiding principles section to the Act, with the best interests of the child to be the paramount principle. <\/p><p>- Proposals to foster improved interagency cooperation include introducing a duty to cooperate and legislating for both local and national coordination bodies.<\/p><p>- The voice of the child is to be strengthened both in court proceedings and in decisions taken outside the court setting.<\/p><p>- The proposals also include amendments to existing rules for Supervision Orders, Interim Care Orders, Care Orders, Emergency Care Orders and Voluntary Care Agreements. <\/p><p>My Department is also developing new Guardian ad litem legislation, which aims to extend the GAL system to benefit the greatest number of children and young people, and to ensure that the best interests of children and young people are paramount in childcare proceedings. In addition, work is continuing on the reform of the family justice system by the Department of Justice, and my Department continues to be represented on the Family Justice Oversight Group in this respect.<\/p><p>Finally, my priority is to ensure that all children in State care receive a high quality service and are supported to reach their full potential, as children, and into adulthood.  My officials liaise on an ongoing basis with Tusla officials, to identity and address issues relating to children in care as they arise, and across all the relevant settings. I also note that in the 2022 Performance Statement, I have requested that Tusla work to increase Tusla provided residential services and move towards a reduction in reliance on private provision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300073#WRH03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Direct

It facilitates the sharing of information between the Department of Health and its agencies. It is a long-standing structure which has been utilised over many years to provide a forum to steer strategic approaches to public health emergencies in Ireland and mobilise the necessary health service responses. National Public Health Emergency Teams have been established in recent years in response to public health threats, including H1N1 (swine flu) and CPE (Carbapenemase Producing Enterobacterales), for example. This public health approach is in line with the advice of the World Health Organization (WHO).<\/p>  <p>  Since its first meeting in January 2020, the NPHET for COVID-19 has overseen and provided direction, guidance, support and expert advice across the health service and the wider public service for the overall national response to COVID-19, including national and regional and other outbreak control arrangements. In particular, the NPHET has played a critical role in closely and continuously monitoring the evolving impact of COVID-19 on Ireland&rsquo;s population, as well as the health service&rsquo;s capacity, performance, and ability to respond. <\/p>  <p>  Following its meeting on 20th January 2022, the NPHET advised that the prevailing profile of COVID-19 in Ireland and the available evidence and experience of Omicron internationally allowed for a fundamental change in the management of COVID-19. It advised that this should entail a transition, in broad terms, from a focus on regulation and population wide restrictions to a focus on public health advice, personal judgement and personal protective behaviours.<\/p>  <p>On 17th February, the NPHET recommended the removal of remaining public health measures from 28th February, as planned, on the basis that there is no longer a continuing public health rationale for retaining them. <\/p>  <p>  In providing its advice, the NPHET has emphasised we cannot fully rule out the reintroduction of measures in the future and we must continue to ensure our response is agile and flexible, with an ability to respond rapidly and appropriately to any emerging threat. There will be an ongoing requirement to be able to scale up appropriate responses quickly should they be required.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the need for continued vigilance, the NPHET has advised that we are now entering a transition phase of the pandemic response. This transition will entail a shift from the emergency type processes and measures of the last two years while also necessitating the maintenance of high levels of readiness for COVID-19 outbreaks and the emergence of new variants of concern, with significant strengthening of existing disease surveillance systems. <\/p>  <p>  As we move out of the emergency phase of the pandemic and given the significant mainstreaming of the COVID-19 response, the continuing impact of the vaccination programme, and the programme of work already completed by the NPHET, it is now deemed timely to conclude the work of the NPHET. <\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Chief Medical Officer will continue to closely monitor the epidemiological profile of the disease and the Minister for Health has been provided with a specific proposal on the appropriate structure and processes for this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300074#WRJ03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances","counter":454,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300074#WRJ03200"},{"type":"question","counter":455,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[10146\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300074#WRJ03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to address the cost of breastfeeding equipment and supplies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1559","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":456,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300074#WRJ03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1608"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":457,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300074#WRJ03500"},{"type":"question","counter":458,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[10147\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300074#WRJ03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if section 38 and 39 workers will be eligible for the additional recognition payment applicable to frontline health care workers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":459,"content":"<p>Firstly I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to all healthcare workers for their efforts during this most challenging period.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the efforts of the general public, volunteers and all workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on Wednesday 19 January, the Government announced a once-off public holiday will take place on Friday 18 March 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The Government also announced COVID-19 recognition payment for frontline public sector healthcare workers, to\u00a0recognise their unique role\u00a0during the pandemic.

The Department currently has no plans to introduce an independent complaints mechanism for mental health services nor has a review been carried out to ascertain the cost of establishing such a mechanism.<\/p>  <p>In line with the Mental Health Act 2001 (Approved Centre) Regulations 2006, each inpatient mental health service, as with general health services, must have a complaints procedure in place, such as the HSE&rsquo;s &lsquo;Your Service, Your Say&rsquo; service. 'Your Service, Your Say' is available to anyone accessing HSE mental health services, be that on an inpatient or outpatient basis. Following the investigation of the complaint by the HSE, an individual may request an internal review to be carried out by the HSE if they are not happy with the outcome. Furthermore, in cases where the complainant is not satisfied with the response to their complaint, they can request an external review from the Office of the Ombudsman, or in the case of child and adolescent services, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children. This option is available to anyone who accesses our public health services, be it mental health services or otherwise.<\/p>  <p>The General Scheme of a Bill to amend the Mental Health Act, published in July 2021, provides for every person accessing treatment in an inpatient mental health facility to be given information about their care and treatment, including an explicit requirement to provide information on the service&rsquo;s complaints procedure. Furthermore, the powers of the Inspector of Mental Health Services are being expanded to include 24-hour community residential facilities and community mental health services. As under the existing Act, the Inspector will continue to meet with any person accessing mental health services who has requested such a meeting.<\/p>  <p>The General Scheme also includes a statutory right to engage an advocate under numerous heads, including a definition of advocate under Section 2, information on advocacy to be provided to people in approved inpatient facilities under Section 16, 79 and 91, access to an advocate during a review board under Section 16B, during inquiries carried out by the Inspector under Section 55, or when making decisions about treatment under Sections 56 and 104. <\/p>  <p>There are a number of advocacy supports for people accessing mental health services offered by the public and voluntary sectors. The HSE currently provides some advocacy supports such as a Peer Advocacy Service in mental health. This service is concentrated on inpatient services and is delivered by an external agency on behalf of the HSE. In addition to adult advocacy services, HSE National Mental Health Services has a pilot scheme in place in two inpatient units to provide an advocacy service through an external provider for young people and their families using Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).<\/p>  <p>The National Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities (NAS) provides a free, confidential service to people with mental health difficulties, particularly people with complex needs. NAS is funded and supported by the Citizens Information Board, which has a mandate under the Citizens Information Act 2007 and the Comhairle Act 2000 to provide advocacy for persons with disabilities. Citizens Information Centres can be found nationwide and provide free, impartial advice and advocacy, or the Citizens Information Phone Service can be reached by phone.  <\/p>  <p>Sage Advocacy also provides some advocacy support to people with mental health difficulties, particularly older people, in their role in supporting and enabling vulnerable adults and older people to make their voices heard in their healthcare decisions. The Irish Advocacy Network provides peer advocacy supports to people with mental health difficulties which can be accessed on a self-referral basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300075#WRK02287","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":507,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300075#WRK02300"},{"type":"question","counter":508,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[10192\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300075#WRK02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a child (details supplied) is on the waiting list for early intervention in Kilkenny; and the current wait time for same.","asker":"1449","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":509,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300075#WRK02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":510,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300075#WRK02600"},{"type":"question","counter":511,"qnumday":219,"qnumall":"[10193\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022022300075#WRK02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will request Beaumont Hospital to expedite an appointment sooner that February 2023 for an urgent referral for a person (details supplies); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1607","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":512,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

It is for this reason that supports to ameliorate the costs of illness should be available to all rather than focused on those with particular conditions. This is the principle behind the transition to universal healthcare envisaged by Sl&aacute;intecare, where people access the right services based on need and not ability to pay.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 1970 (as amended), all persons, irrespective of illness or condition, accessing public in-patient (including day case) services in a public hospital are liable for the statutory in-patient daily charge, which is capped at a maximum of &euro;800 in any period of 12 consecutive months. There are however exemptions from these charges for identified groups of people, including but not limited to people with full eligibility, that is medical card holders.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Medical cards are awarded without a financial assessment to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer, for a period of five years. Individuals with a terminal illness who have been certified by their treating Consultant as having a prognosis of 24 months or less to live are also now eligible for a medical card without a means assessment.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As is the case for all patients, cancer patients can apply for a range of supports, including medical cards, and they are assessed under the criteria applying to all applicants. Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.\u00a0Indeed, the Irish Cancer Society has found that over 80% of those diagnosed with cancer who apply for a medical card are successful. In certain circumstances, the HSE may grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold, where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  All patients require a responsive and compassionate health system to meet their medical needs.

The Points System is intended to promote compliance with the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy and seeks to deliver on the CFP objective of ensuring proportionate, effective and dissuasive penalties for serious infringements.<\/p><p>Serious infringements include  the following:- <\/p><p>- not fulfilling obligations to record and report catch or catch related data <\/p><p>- concealing, tampering or disposal of evidence relating to an investigation <\/p><p>- fishing without a valid licence, authorization or permit. <\/p><p>The points systems were due to be in place by 1 January 2012 and the delay in implementing them prompted the EU Commission to issue EU infringement proceedings against Ireland. A negative judgement from the European Court of Justice in any such proceedings could cost the State significantly in lump sum and ongoing fines.<\/p><p>Furthermore, serious financial implications arise from the non-implementation of the points system because, as a condition of the EU contribution to  Ireland&rsquo;s  European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Programme, certain conditions must be fulfilled, including implementation of a points system for both licence holders and masters.  <\/p><p>To meet the legal requirements on the State, the European Union (Common Fisheries Policy) (Point System) Regulations 2020 - SI No 318\/2020 were signed into force in August 2020. SI No 318 adopts the requirements of Article 92 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1224\/2009 of 20 November 2009 and Title VII of  Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404\/2011.<\/p><p>In accordance with the EU Regulations, this instrument establishes a point system, which will apply to the licence holder of a sea fishing boat when a serious infringement of the rules of the common fisheries policy is detected within the exclusive fishery limits of the State or for an Irish vessel wherever it may be.<\/p><p>The Sea Fisheries Protection Authority is determined as the competent authority for the establishment of the system and the assignment of points. The Licensing Authority is the competent authority for the recording of points assigned to the licence of an Irish registered fishing vessel and the transfer of those points.<\/p><p>SI No 318\/2020 provides for the establishment of a Determination Panel comprised of 3 independent legal professionals nominated by the Attorney General to determine if on the balance of probabilities a serious infringement occurred. The instrument also establishes an independent appeals officer to review the decision of the Determination Panel at the request of the licence holder.<\/p><p>My firm view is that SI 318\/2020 is necessary to protect law-abiding operators, who make up the vast majority of those in the industry, and to preserve this precious and valuable resource for all Irish fishermen and for future generations.
