He is joined by Ms Orla Duane, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Shane Cassells.<\/p> <p>  Are the minutes of 19 September agreed?  Agreed.  No matters arise from those minutes.<\/p> <p>  We shall now deal with correspondence.  There are three categories of correspondence.  Category A comprises the briefing documents and opening statements in respect of today's meeting.  No. 2425A, dated 1 October 2019, and No. 2426 A from An Bord Plean&aacute;la are briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.  We will note and publish these.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Category B comprises correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers or both and follow-up documents on Committee of Public Accounts meetings and other items for publication.  We discussed No. 2342 on the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland last week.  The information provided was not that requested by the committee and we circulated among committee members what we asked for precisely.  We decided not to publish at the time and to hold the matter over until we received a response from the corporation.  When we receive it, we can consider publishing. <\/p> <p>  No. 2354B is from Professor Phillip Nolan, President, Maynooth University, dated 29 July 2019, responding to a request from the committee for details on an investment by the university in a subsidiary which will not be recovered, as well as information regarding employment contracts for employees in the organisation.  Professor Nolan confirms the loss and states the investment was appropriate based on the information and advice available at the time.  He also provides an information note in regard to employment contracts and states that engagement of staff on an occasional basis is necessary, appropriate, fair and in compliance with relevant legislation.  While we will note and publish this item, I want to make a few remarks on the subsidiary.  Maynooth University set up a subsidiary called Innovation Value Services Limited for research and development and the organisation did not meet its expectations.  The company was ultimately wound down at a loss to the university of &euro;750,000.  That is a very substantial figure and that is why we wrote to the university.  In its detailed reply to us, it points out that the provision of &euro;750,000 against the impairment of the loan to Innovation Value Services Limited represents a real and regrettable loss, and that it will not impact on education or services to students but will reduce the university's capacity for research and knowledge transfer.  That is an honest answer from a third level college.  Normally it is said there is no effect but at least in this case the university says there will be an impact on its capacity for research and knowledge transfer.  The university had an innovation value institute in the college that had attracted over &euro;10 million since 2010.  It decided to set up a subsidiary, which it is entitled to do.  Before it set up the company, based on what is projected, it commissioned PwC to produce a report, and the latter advised against the initial business plan, which projected an investment of &euro;1.25 million.  The investment plan was then scaled back on that basis.  The university invested &euro;410,000 in the subsidiary in October 2015 and, in May 2016, it advanced another &euro;300,000.  After the first year of operation, it agreed to defer the loan repayments until December 2019 because it knew the organisation was not meeting expectations.  In May 2019, the decision was taken by the university executive not to invest further in the company.  The board of Innovation Value Services Limited met on 18 June 2019, which is not that long ago, and decided to wind up the company and cease trading by the end of the financial year, which I presume is about now.  Those are some of the salient facts.  We need to ask for a copy of the final accounts for the company when it is ultimately wound up and audited.<\/p> <p>  Second, we raised the question as to whether the loan of &euro;750,000 was included on the university's risk register.  The replay given was that the risks associated with Innovation Value Services Limited were not specifically included in the register.  The university said it updated the risk register in February 2017, which was two and a half years ago, and it was further updated over the summer of 2019, which has just passed.  At this stage, we must write to the university and ask for the risk register.  In my view, this should be produced on an annual basis, at a minimum.  The HSE produces them on a quarterly basis.  It does miss things but at least it has a system in place every quarter.  I expect a body such as the university to produce a register regularly.  A year is the most that should elapse before producing a register.  Even if we get a register once per year, it will not be too bad.  The one the university is operating from is two and a half years old.  I propose that we write to it asking it for the risk register it was working on over the summer.  Let us see where that stands.<\/p><p>That is all I want to say about the matter.<\/p><p> I mentioned the occasional lecturers.  The university gives details on this on page 17 of its letter, which is a very comprehensive document.  There are about 40 pages in the reply.  It indicates there are 1,394 occasional staff, 668 of whom receive under &euro;1,000 and 239 of whom receive between &euro;1,000 and &euro;2,000.  The overwhelming majority of them receive under &euro;4,000 and would not be considered in any way full-time.  They are occasional, perhaps.  Most of them are postgraduates at the college.  That is what the university says here.  I will come to Deputy Catherine Murphy, who will have more knowledge on this.  I am just putting on the record what the university says because we will discuss the response.  I want to put the response on the record because the university does not expect everyone to read the 40 pages.  The university is saying the overwhelming majority of the occasional staff are postgraduates doing just a small amount of work here and there.  It says it complies with legislation.  That is the university's response.  I have a duty to put it on the record.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019100300002#B00200","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570089600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Obviously, when we get more information back, we will come back to this.  If we had got a copy of the university's risk register last year, it would not have shown up this.  What else is the register likely not to include?  Seeing it now, after this has been disclosed, yes, they are taking corrective action, but I am concerned we are not getting a full picture.  That is one aspect.  The business of universities is about creating knowledge.  If NUI Maynooth is acknowledging the loss in respect of research and knowledge transfer, that is really at the core of what the university is supposed to be about.  I am not sure we have fully fleshed out what this implies, and I would like to hear from the university what it means by \"impact\".<\/p> <p>  Regarding the number of staff, I completely accept that universities have people coming in and possibly doing several hours' additional work and that that is normal practice and adds to the value of the university.  I think there are much greater employment protections at primary school level than at university level, not just in Maynooth but in the whole university sector.  People going to college, who are very often the people paying for the staff, and their parents - and there are Government grants and so on towards tuition fees - do not appreciate that very often what is provided is perhaps one contact hour for every lecturing hour.  I think great liberties are being taken in this regard.  A total of 1,394 is a lot of people without contracts.  We have spoken about this in the context of RT&Eacute; and bogus self-employment, for example.  Whereas this would not fall into the exact same category, it is a category of staff about whom I would have concerns as to how universities manage their accounts.<\/p> <p>  There is the other issue of how universities perform if not enough research hours are provided compared with contact hours.  This shows up in our accounts, and that is the only reason it is appropriate for discussion here.  However, we are hearing from the president of the college, not from the people who have a grievance about this.  I think we are hearing a one-sided view on it, and I have concerns about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019100300002#C00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1570089600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Much of what I wanted to say about the risk register has been said.

However, the risk register is only as good as what goes on it, so perhaps somebody could help us with that.  What criteria are used?

It is probably fair to say the register is not a precise science.  It is really about requiring an organisation to look at the specific risks that arise in its business.

Nearly every organisation will have things that it assumes will always work because they always have worked.  Having a good risk register is more an art than a science, and keeping it up to date is a procedural matter.  However, the judgments that are made as to what goes on it and what is an appropriate response are a matter that an organisation needs to grapple with.  The organisation needs to update it regularly, as the Chairman said.  A review once a year would probably not be adequate for a relatively large organisation.  One would want perhaps a quarterly review of the register and systems in place that ensure that it is not just something that is happening at the top of an organisation but that it percolates down through the organisation such that everybody is thinking about the areas specific to their aspect of the business and what they would do if certain of those risks materialised.  It is, therefore, hard to say \"this is an excellent risk register\" and \"that is a very poor one\".  It is seen in the outturn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019100300002#C00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1570089600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>On that point, let us take the case of Galway.  This is very much factual.  It is another problem about which nothing was done, but the hospital was good in that it put the capacity of the hospital on the risk register.  Then let us turn to the universities, not just NUI Maynooth.  Knowledge was mentioned.  I believe knowledge should be acquired through questioning.  I disagree slightly with just the way Deputy Catherine Murphy put it.  I believe that the universities should inculcate a questioning environment, which we seem to be losing, and that knowledge should be acquired in that manner as opposed to knowledge for knowledge's sake and for a profit.  However, that is a policy matter.  I was in Waterford on Monday leis an gcoiste Ghaeilge agus bh&iacute; m&eacute; in Institi&uacute;id Teicneola&iacute;ochta Phort L&aacute;irge.

It is to do with what it calls occasional staff and staff on contracts.  The volume of people on contracts at the university is high.  The university stated in its cover note that it does not engage persons on zero-hour contracts.  That is true.  However, there are if-and-when contracts or what it calls occasional staff contracts.  The university stated it believes the engagement of staff on an occasional basis is necessary, appropriate, fair and in compliance with relevant legislation.  In some cases, it may well be.<\/p> <p>  The difficulty is that we are seeing this more and more with public bodies which are employing people on if-and-when contracts.  On some occasions, it is the right thing to do; other times, it is not.  Watching this across all organisations, my fear is that some public bodies are hiding behind this position.  If-and-when or low-hour contracts may suit some people but they do not suit everybody.  If it does not suit somebody, then it is the only contract offered.  There is an issue in relation to their rights and entitlements, whether it is sick pay, holiday pay and other entitlements.  We have seen it with other public bodies and I believe we need to keep an eye on it.<\/p> <p>  I noted in Maynooth that 1,394 staff were on occasional staff contracts.  It seems to be a bit high.

Running costs of the agency are about &euro;80 million to &euro;90 million a year.  I am told that there is somewhere in the region of &euro;250 million in its accounts based on this levy.  We levy 2 cent per litre under an Act which states that the agency must cover its running costs and not to exceed that.  It now seems to have substantially exceeded this amount.  We are all hard-pressed consumers paying 2 cent per litre.  It has been mentioned in the media and in dispatches from Ministers and the Department that these excesses could be used for the climate action fund.<\/p><p> It has been mentioned in media dispatches from Ministers and their Departments that these excesses could be used for the climate action fund.  Frankly, that would be in breach of the law on the basis that if we are collecting the money for A, we cannot use it for B.  I am not against using money in this way, but we live in an era in which we all accept that we are heading for carbon taxes.  The receipts from the latter will be invested in the climate action fund.  If an excess of between &euro;100 million and &euro;150 million accrues because running costs are being exceeded and if, effectively, this is being collected illegally or in a manner that is contrary to legislation, something needs to be done.  The Government could consider whether this levy might be reduced or stopped - I accept that this is a policy issue - as long as we can ensure that the oil companies pass it on to the consumer.  I emphasise that 2 cent a litre is an awful lot.  On that basis, I think this is something at which we should look.  I suggest to the committee that we should invite NORA personnel and officials from the Department of Finance to come in to discuss the issue.

We asked the Minister to consider appointing an investigator under the relevant legislation to examine matters raised in the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report No. 104.  Mr. Beausang has advised that the Department is considering documents and has set out a number of concerns relating to the management of conflicts of interest.

We had lengthy discussions on this with the Department in the past.  We had similar discussions with the HEA when it became obvious that it was not able to publish the report it had done because it was outside its remit.  It looked like the Minister, through the appointment of a special investigator by the Department, was the only option.  I would like to draw the attention of colleagues to the second last paragraph of the letter that came back, which mentions that there had been a need to follow up with everyone who had submitted correspondence to the previous review, the report of which cannot now be published.  According to this letter, the correspondence and documentation subsequently received by the Department - the follow-up documentation - sets out a number of concerns relating to the management of conflicts of interest.  That was essentially our point from day one.  My point all along has been that the concerns which have been outlined, some of which were the subject of a report, cannot be left hanging.  We know it is probable that the report would have set out some of those concerns, but the HEA was just not able to publish it.  Is it going to be left hanging?  The Chairman is right when he says that the Department has come back to say it is still looking at whether further action is warranted.  If concerns relating to the management of potential conflicts of interest which have been documented by individuals still exist, there is a responsibility on the Department to follow them up.  It may or may not transpire that these matters were managed properly, but we cannot adjudicate on that.  It is not our job to adjudicate on it.  That is why we have a process.  Special investigators are appointed to establish the facts and report on them.  That needs to be done in this case to give closure to the issue.  If it is not done, all of these issues will continue to be raised by individuals within the institute, those individuals will not get any satisfaction and - more to the point - the facts will not be established.  We need to go back to the Department to say that if serious concerns are still being documented and sent to it, it has an obligation and a responsibility to follow them up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019100300002#E02500","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1570089600,"counter":65,"content":"<p>Having looked at the letter, my view is that it has parked everything to which the Deputy has been referring.

As we know, the HEA report looked in more detail at other issues relating to the spinning out of these companies, including the management of conflicts of interest.

The individual is in a difficult situation, which we all have encountered with constituents, as a consequence of SUSI's requirement that applicants provide financial information in respect of both their parents.  Even where a student's parents are separated or divorced and there may be difficulties within the household, SUSI insists on obtaining that information.  In some cases, a student might be living with one parent, who has no contact with the other.  It might even be the case that one parent has secured a court order against the other.  SUSI will not process grant applications until information on both parents is received, even though it is sometimes not possible for the applicant to obtain it.  I propose that we write to SUSI requesting it to indicate its process and procedures for dealing with such exceptional cases.  I have encountered students who could not go to college because one of their parents would not facilitate any correspondence with anybody.  Without that information, SUSI will not process the application.  That is unfair to students and it is not being dealt with in a satisfactory way.

I propose that we note the correspondence and keep the points raised in mind.<\/p><p>I want to follow it up in further detail.  I have looked at this correspondence.  At a previous meeting we asked about the valuation of car-parking spaces in some of these out-of-town locations.  To summarise this correspondence, there are two issues.  It referred to a two-year backlog for the 2017 appeals.  I am not sure if it is the tribunal or the Valuation Office.  We want that matter clarified based on this correspondence.<br\/><br\/>We really need clarification on the second item.  The correspondence from the Irish Petrol Retailers Association states: &quot;The Valuation Office has recently made some amendments to the methodology they use for service stations ... which is positive but we have been told that these amendments will not apply to stations revalued under the 2017 revaluation even where they are appealing to the Valuation Tribunal.&quot;  Essentially, the Valuation Office is stating that there will be two separate methods for valuing filling stations for rates: those valued under the 2017 regulations; and those now being valued under the recent amendments.  That is not fair.  Given that it could take ten years for such filling stations to be revalued again, they may be at a commercial disadvantage for up to a decade.  The IPRA is also saying that when filling stations appeal valuations carried out under the 2017 rules to the valuation tribunal, it will not accept the new amendments and is sticking to the old regulations.  That appeals process is unfair.  We want that clarified and it does not sound fair to me.<br\/><br\/>We asked the Valuation Office for a response on the issue of car park spaces at supermarkets, etc.  That was mentioned in the context of rates in towns.  The Irish Petrol Retailers Association graciously sent us a copy of the Valuation Office practice note regarding supermarkets.  We did not get it from the Valuation Office yet, but it is its document.  The petrol retailers are utterly confused by what the Valuation Office says about car parking at supermarkets.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>Car parking arrangements associated with retail units will be dealt with as follows:- Common car parking facilities serving retail units will be reflected in the rent passing.  [Is that the rent from the landlord to the supermarket?]  Under these circumstances these facilities will be reflected in the passing rent.<\/blockquote><p>It suggests that where somebody has developed a facility with many shop units, including a big car park used by all the customers for all the shops, the cost of the car park will be reflected in the rent charged by the landlord who owns the property.  However, we are asking about the rates and not the rent.<br\/><br\/>The practice note also states: &quot;Where the building occupier occupies car spaces at a physically separate location then they will be valued as a separate relevant property with a description of &lsquo;carpark&rsquo;.&quot;  It is stating where common car parking facilities are used for several shops, it is reflected in the rent.  My question is then about the rates assessment for the landlord.  Was the landlord assessed for the commercial value of the car park?  It seems to be suggesting supermarkets are covered in the rent.  I want to know where in the system the commercial value of the car park is valued for rates.  The Valuation Office seems to be suggesting the supermarket does not pay it.  That should mean the landlord does it.  Are we then going to be told the same property cannot be valued twice?  I have not worked that one out.  I want clarification on it.  It is a good question, and the answer muddied the water further as far as I am concerned.  We want to know the commercial value of the car park at these shopping centres.  Where is the rates demand notice and who pays them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019100300002#G02900","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570089600,"counter":117,"content":"<p>It does not cover all eventualities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019100300002#H00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1570089600,"counter":118,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019100300002#H00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1570089600,"counter":119,"content":"<p>A very large car park could be owned by-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019100300002#H00400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1570089600,"counter":120,"content":"<p>The supermarket-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019100300002#H00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1570089600,"counter":121,"content":"<p>-----the supermarket.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019100300002#H00600","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1570089600,"counter":122,"content":"<p>-----as happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019100300002#H00700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1570089600,"counter":123,"content":"<p>If it is exclusive to the supermarket, is it rateable?

Next week, we will have the National Transport Authority.  The following week we have Caranua.  The week after that we have the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine because there is a gap between the report and that.<\/p><p>We have a gap for the week of 31 October, on Brexit day.  People are not sure whether the D&aacute;il is sitting that week but we will assume it is.  There are a couple of items we could possibly include.  These are the Charities Regulator, Pobal and Sport Ireland.  We have mentioned the possibility and we can see whether we can get one of the three of them for that date.<\/p><p> On 7 November, we will discuss the relevant chapters of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I am sure we will also speak about the public services card, on which I want to comment now.  We will start to climb up to the HSE and the children's hospital as soon as possible after that because there is a chapter on it in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Now that we have the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General we will try to flesh out our work programme until Christmas at the next meeting.  There is nothing major to be said.<\/p><p> An item I want to raise that ties into the work programme is an issue that was raised last week in our very useful meeting with the Data Protection Commissioner on the use of the public services card and her report.  We also dealt with other financial matters.  Towards the end of the meeting, I raised the issue of a person who continued to use an expired free travel card.  The person should not have done so because social welfare payments had ceased.  However, the travel card element of the public services card had not been cancelled and the person continued to use it. After several months, the card was confiscated at Heuston Station when it did not work in the turnstile to leave the station.  Afterwards, the person received a fine from Irish Rail for &euro;1,000 for not having the correct ticket.  So far so good, but this raises data protection issues.  The person, whom I dealt with over the summer, told me the issue of how Irish Rail got the individual's name and address had already been raised with the Data Protection Commissioner.  There is no dispute with regard to the amount but there is a data protection issue.<\/p><p> Arising from our meeting last week, on Friday I received a very interesting email, as did the Comptroller and Auditor General, from a person with regard to a use of the public services card I had not really thought about until now.  If this is happening we really need it to be clarified.  On the public services card is a photo, the person's PPS number is on the back, and there is also the person's signature.  The card also shows a date until which it is valid.  On the front it may have the letters FT to signify free travel, or it may have the letters FT+S to signify the person's spouse can accompany him or her for free.  The individual who sent the card used it on the Luas in Dublin and on one of the major bus companies, not Dublin Bus.  When the public services card goes through the ticket machine information is recorded and the individual got curious about what is recorded when the public services card is given to private transport companies.  The person tracked it down and eventually received a letter back from the National Transport Authority, NTA, because the bus operator and Luas said it was nothing to do with them and that the person should contact the NTA.  In recent days, we received a copy of the letter sent to the individual by the NTA.  The NTA states that when a person uses the card none of the person's information on the card is recorded but every card has a number - not the PPS number - that the transport companies have.  This allows the companies to claim payment.  I know there are also lump sum grants but perhaps Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is slightly different.  This number records all of the trips and journeys made by card holder.  The rail company does not have the person's name and address or other details but it sends the number to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection where it can be matched to the person's PPS number.<\/p><p> The NTA states only the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection knows the PPS number and the individualised anonymous number held by the transport companies.  The Department does not provide this information to anyone.  As far as public transport is concerned, all the NTA knows is that the number has been used but not who used it or anything about the person using the card and it is entirely anonymous.  The email also states that when the public services card is presented at the ticketing machine, it records that a journey has been taken and assigns the value of the fare forgone to the record, which is stored in the ticket machine.  The information held by the transport company is the ID, which is the number on the card, the date and time of the journey, the route number and the fare forgone, which is the adult single fare.  The data is then uploaded to the back office system and subsequently made available to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The purpose of recording the information is so the transport operator can record overall passenger numbers and overall usage and also be able to make a claim for reimbursement from the Department in respect of services delivered to free travel pass holders.<\/p><p> It appears that when the information comes back from the travel company the Department of Employment Affair and Social Protection has details with regard to 900,000 people, including every State pensioner in the country, on every time they use public transport and every trip they take.  The allegation in the email is that the person did not know the State had such mass surveillance systems in place.  I do not think people knew the card and the Department could obtain details on every trip taken.  I can see why from a financial position but from a data protection point of view I can see that people were not aware that this is the case.  We will write to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to clarify this particular issue on whether it has a record of all of the travel taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019100300002#H03100","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570089600,"counter":148,"content":"<p>The NTA will come before the committee next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019100300002#J00200","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1570089600,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I know it will be budget week but I assume the Department has a lot of staff and that people dealing with data protection are not those involved in who gets an increase next week or whether there will be an increase.

They may be more familiar with some of the matters.<\/p> <p>  It is important to remind the committee that it would not be appropriate to discuss individual planning cases, as to do so could compromise decisions or various judicial review cases before the courts.  However, where we can discuss generalities of case types and broad issues emerging, we will endeavour to be as helpful to the committee as possible.<\/p> <p>  The board is well aware of its critical role in considering and determining planning appeals and major housing and infrastructure proposals, and it remains committed to delivering decisions as quickly and effectively as possible.  We are also very cognisant of our corporate governance responsibilities.  I can confirm that the board considers itself in full compliance with all applicable provisions of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.<\/p> <p>  We have developed and use a framework of assurances, including an audit and risk committee and internal audits, and we undertake regular updates at management committee and board levels of our risks and mitigation actions.  As is required under the code of practice, I receive a report annually from the independent, external chair of the audit and risk committee.  The committee's most recent report has confirmed that our risk management processes and internal controls are operating effectively.  As chairperson, I am also reassured of our financial and governance controls through the unqualified audit opinion from the Comptroller and Auditor General, both for 2018 and for all previously audited years.<\/p> <p>  The committee will have noted from our annual report and accounts that, in financial terms, as outlined by Mr. McCarthy, the board had a total income of &euro;24.4 million in 2018, comprising primarily an Exchequer grant of &euro;17.5 million and fees revenue of just over &euro;4 million.  We spent just over &euro;24 million, leaving a surplus of just over &euro;550,000 when capital transfers and appropriations were taken into account.<\/p> <p>  I will give members a little background on the organisation.  The board currently has 164 whole-time equivalent staff and ten board members.  The Minister and Department have been very supportive in approving recent resource requests, including our workforce plan for the period 2019-20, in recognition of the increasing demands and complexity of the cases that are coming before the board, including in relation to strategic housing developments, vacant site levy cases and major infrastructure projects, and taking into account the forecast increase in cases.<\/p> <p>  In policy terms, the national planning framework and the emerging regional spatial and economic strategies set a clear priority for appropriate development in the right locations to facilitate the sustainable and orderly growth of our cities, towns and rural areas, and the board has a clear role in implementing such policies through efficient and consistent processing of case decisions.<\/p> <p>  In a constantly evolving and more complex legislative and legal context, where environmental issues and public participation are rightly to the fore, it is crucial that the board has all the information it needs to make sound decisions and gives people time to feed in their views on proposals during the deliberative process, reflecting our core principles of integrity, independence and fair-mindedness.<\/p> <p>  While it is acknowledged that the board's capacity and performance to meet its statutory objective period of 18 weeks has been impacted, particularly in 2018, by the transition to our new case management system, the increased caseload and the fallout from reduced board capacity in 2017, we have made strong progress to turn things around in recent months.<\/p> <p>  In 2018, we recorded a 32% increase in the number of cases decided over the previous year, with over 2,800 decisions made.  In November and December alone, we decided almost 600 cases, which is up 36% on the same two months in 2017.  This helped us to reduce the number of cases on hand by more than 300, from 1,355 to just over 1,000 files at the end of the year.  This reflects the commitment of our hard-working staff and board to really get to grips with the backlog generated and deliver robust decisions as efficiently as possible.<\/p><p> In terms of meeting our 18-week statutory objective period for deciding normal planning appeals, we are aware that an overall compliance rate of 43% for 2018 is not what we would like.  Equally, however, the priority and focus for me since I arrived in the job and took over as chairperson has been to process and decide those cases longest with the board, which had a consequential impact on our percentage compliance rate last year.  However, we have a clear plan in 2019 to clear the backlog and get back to a compliance rate of 70% to 80% by the end of this year.  Things are going well.  Our aggregate compliance rate for appeals for the year was up to 67% by the end of August, and the average decision time was 19.5 weeks, down from 22.5 weeks in 2018.  For the last four months, we have averaged 78% compliance but we know that more work is needed.  The board&rsquo;s performance in relation to strategic housing developments has been very strong, with 39 cases decided during 2018, all within the 16-week target.<\/p><p> In overall terms, last year the board granted permission for 27 applications for more than 7,100 housing units and almost 4,500 student bed-spaces, which is a vital contribution to the overall increase in residential activity.  This trend has ramped up significantly in 2019, with 40 applications granted permission in the first eight months of this year for a cumulative 9,070 homes and more than 3,000 student bed-spaces.  We are continuing to prioritise these cases and to deal with any large-scale housing appeals expeditiously.  <\/p><p>Over the course of 2018, the board prepared a five-year strategic plan with four clear goals.  These are to: protect and enhance our reputation for independence, impartiality, integrity, trust and transparency; make robust, timely and high-quality decisions which support proper planning and sustainable development; improve our service to meet changing customer expectations; and foster a motivated, resilient and responsive organisation.  While this is, of course, a five-year strategy out to 2023, there are a number of initiatives and actions that we are prioritising in 2019 to help to realise these objectives and set us on the right path.  High among these priorities is the roll-out and refinement of the project, Plean-IT, which will ultimately enable appeals, observations, submissions and applications to be made online, linking in with the local authorities&rsquo; own e-planning initiatives.   <\/p><p>  I am conscious that I am taking up members&rsquo; valuable time to raise specific issues so I will leave it there.  I have included some summary graphs in my submission.  These outline high-level statistics as a reference.  We are happy to take any questions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019100300002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dave Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570089600,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Walsh.

Credit is due on that front.<\/p> <p>  With regard to what Mr. Walsh mentioned in his opening statement in respect of normal appeals, I am looking specifically at table 1 on page 16 of the annual report, which shows that the rate of compliance with the statutory guidelines, that is to say, the time in which the board would like to complete appeals, has fallen.  Does Mr. Walsh believe the Minister has provided the board with enough staff and resources to improve this situation?  I also note that Mr. Walsh mentioned sufficient improvements this year.

All our staff put a lot of work into it and it is good to hear that it is legible and easy to follow.  With regard to performance and the challenges the organisation has faced over the past two years, it has helped that the Department and the Minister have provided the resources for which we have asked.  Back in 2013 or 2014, we were down to 138 to 140 staff members.  We are now up to 166, plus the board.  Our workforce plan includes 16 additional posts to be filled over the next year and a half, and these have been approved by the Minister.  That level of staffing resource and budgetary supports means that we will have sufficient capacity.  The challenge for the organisation is often in retaining the great staff we have.  In a very buoyant market, there are opportunities for experienced and well-trained people in the public sector to move on.  Our job, as part of the strategic plan, is to ensure that people want to work in, and stay in, the organisation and that people see a future for themselves in it.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's question about performance, a 39% rate of compliance in respect of normal planning appeals is very poor.  This has been caused by the roll-out of the Plean-IT scheme.  It is very difficult.  I know from personal experience in previous roles and from talking with staff that the new case management system covers the entire operation of the board from reception through to how the board operates.  When anything new is introduced, even when it is as well developed as possible, there will always be challenges as people get used to the new system and make sure that it is as functional as it can be.  All it takes is a month or two of a slowdown for a backlog to build up.  Thankfully, that backlog is now clearing.  We have dealt with the oldest cases in the system and we expect that, by the end of 2019, our compliance rate will be above 70% and, perhaps, close to 75%.  This expectation acknowledges that in January we were already dealing with cases that had been on hand for longer than the 18 weeks, so we were not getting the benefit.  <\/p> <p>  In my opening statement, I pointed out that the percentage can sometimes mask the actual performance of the board.  In 2018, the average time to make decision was approximately 22.5 weeks; that time is now down to approximately 19.5 weeks.  For September, it was actually down to 19.1 weeks.  Even though the target is 18 weeks, the average performance is only one week longer.  It is not as if we have left appeals on hand.  We have dealt with the oldest cases and cleared that backlog.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019100300002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dave Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1570089600,"counter":179,"content":"<p>In the event of a backlog, is there a hierarchy of importance in respect of cases?

Are they given a lower priority in the context of the current housing emergency?  How are they assessed?  The pushing out of target dates probably has to do with compliance.  People sometimes feel that the target is not really a target if it can be pushed out.  It does not give certainty.

Given the priority Government and the Oireachtas places on ensuring quick decisions on appeals in respect of strategic infrastructure or strategic housing developments, we expedite them as best we can.  We prioritise such appeals and we have put extra resources into our strategic housing division to ensure we meet the 16-week deadline.  Of the 91 such cases we have decided on since January 2018, every single decision was made within the 16 weeks.  That has been a challenge, but we have met the deadline.  Similarly, insofar as is possible, we ensure that we have capacity to deal with applications relating to large infrastructure projects such as roads, energy projects, or major industrial developments.  That may have a knock-on implication for lower-level categories.<\/p> <p>  In addition to normal planning appeals, we deal with building control, referrals, and vacant site levies.  Through the management team and the board, the organisation has to assess how to best use our resources and how to prioritise, particularly in respect of the older cases.  We took a conscious decision to focus on the applications which had been in the system the longest.  That had an impact early in 2019.  We have now cleared the majority of those cases and we hope to get back.  Referrals are an important element of our work, but they can be more complex and can involve difficult questions of law.<\/p><p>They are more about deciding whether something needs permission rather than whether we have a file or appeal before us.  In the context of the Deputy's final question, on target dates, there is nothing more frustrating than having uncertainty around when one might get a decision.  In the past 12 months, where we have had to provide an extension and inform all applicants and anyone who is observing, we have given realistic dates and, in the vast majority of cases, met them.  That has made a difference to the feedback from consumers and customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019100300002#N00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dave Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570089600,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I welcome that.

It was updated in April 2019 and it reflects the fact we introduced some new fees in respect of vacant site levies, which is a new process the board has.  The majority of the fees we have set date back to approximately September 2011.  Every two years - we are due another periodic review - we look at the fees, particularly in the context of consumer price index increases, and propose whether we suggest increases.  I am sure we would all acknowledge that the tough times during and after the recession were not the time to be loading up.

We are not as far along in the process as we would have originally envisaged.  We planned it in 2014 and the project has existed for four or five years.  If everything had gone to plan, we would launch this year.  It is likely to be towards the end of next year but there are good reasons for that.  To return to the previous issue of delays and consequential impacts on the operation of the system, we need to make sure that whatever goes live will be fully functional and will maintain the confidence people have in the system.  The last thing we need is a less than perfect model to be out there where, from day one, people say it is not working and they cannot make their connections.<\/p> <p>  The issue is that everybody expects and knows about the system, and we are all working towards making the process as simple and efficient as possible.  As the Deputy will probably know from his local government days, paper and boxes of files are still being shipped.  We are keeping An Post and other organisations in business with the volume of paperwork, although that will all change.  Local authorities will be able to press a button and send all their digital copies to us.  We will not deal with large files.  We will have everything on our system and it will be visible.  Likewise, any letters and notifications will go out by email.  We will need to maintain some level of traditional correspondence for people who do not wish to engage in e-commerce, as in the case of driver licences, motor tax and passports.  The vast majority of people, however, including professionals, members of the public and local authorities, will embrace the change and are waiting for it to come through.  It will have greater efficiency, as well as a cost saving in the system, but it is also a simple requirement of how business needs to move on.  Before we developed the new system, the system was functional but it never had the required capacity.  When we went out with it, therefore, we knew that the design would be a web portal that would allow everybody to view, participate and make payments, and that it would, hopefully, provide an even better service to everybody.  <\/p> <p>  On SHD and oversights, we work within the remit the Minister and the Oireachtas have set in legislation.  The requirement for the proposer or applicant to put all the documentation on a website was very much mirroring what was already there in respect of the large-scale strategic infrastructure projects.  I am aware that as part of the legislative measures brought in in 2017, the Minister is undertaking a review of SHD and the process, and looking at whether there are ways to improve it.  An independent review group was established to produce a report.  The board will await the outcome of that and determine what the Minister and the Government wish to do, and we will adapt our systems.  The more information that is available on our website and on that of the planning authority, the better.  We do not want to hide information but rather make it as accessible as possible, which would be our ultimate goal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019100300002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dave Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1570089600,"counter":186,"content":"<p>Will Mr. Walsh elaborate on the rent review that was conducted, the lease and the review's outcome?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019100300002#O00600","speaker":"1369"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570089600,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I may ask Ms Moloney and others to deal with the details.

One area of interest is the operation of the strategic infrastructure provision.  Perhaps Mr. Sheridan might like to comment on this.  It concerns the determination the board must make further to county development plans.  I am thinking of areas like the development of the renewables sector and wind farms.  I note that An Bord Plean&aacute;la's annual report is very clear about the determinations it has made in respect of those.  The Department embarked on a trajectory a number of years ago.  Councillors were setting out provisions in their county development plans that would aid the development of renewables like wind farms in particular areas like boglands.  They were making it very clear in the development plan that the Minister was issuing directions to overturn those proposals.  Subsequently, it stopped doing that.  Recent county development plans contain variations that were put forward by the local authorities.  They were left in place when concerns may have been raised.  In other words, they agreed with the decisions of the democratically-elected local authorities.  An example could be if a local authority makes a determination through the democratically-elected councillors to designate an area in its county development plan that might be suitable for the development of a wind farm.  This is a global picture to help my understanding of the process.  Were the local authority to designate an area, for example, a bog, based on its assessment, the testing of wind speeds, the habitat and all the different matrices it uses, how much note of that would be taken by An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  Is it a definite \"No\" that it would override decisions like that in the county development plan or is it something of which it would take substantial account?  How does that process work?  It has always interested me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019100300002#P00200","speaker":"1369"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1570089600,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I will kick off.  Obviously, the Planning Act and the Schedule to the Act set the threshold.  I think it is 25 turbines or a wind energy level of 50 MW.  If something meets the threshold, it will come into the board directly.  Regardless of whether it involves large-scale or smaller-scale developments, the board must have regard to a range of factors.  They include national policy, planning guidelines, regional and spatial plans, city and county plans and local area plans.  We must look at the whole range of issues.  Regardless of whether it involves Government guidance or a county development plan, there are objectives that, depending on how one reads them, can conflict.  There could be objectives around encouraging greater renewable energy generation, protecting landscapes,  providing more industry and encouraging rural activity.  The board has a range of highly skilled and highly professional planners, who must take everything from the national to the regional to the local into account and must make a judgment call.  Planning is never an exact science.  It is not a blanket model that one can move because every consideration and every case has its own nuances around access, visibility, appropriateness of location, stability and even the appropriateness of whether one would get the right wind conditions to make it viable.  A challenge not only for the board but for planning authorities in dealing with smaller-scale projects is to weigh up all of these different factors and to find the best planning solution.

That is fine.  However, take the circle of the decision-making process.  It is corrupted if a person is appealing it and then the board has to consider that as part of the mix.  It cannot say that it is the same complete decision if it got all the way through the board but the person objecting does not exist.<\/p> <p>  One wonders why people have concerns about An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I have had concerns about it from a transparency point of view for many years.  This is an ultimate example of why people have concerns.  That is why Mr. Walsh must clean it up.  I will not stop in my political career until this is fixed.  I will keep going on this issue because I believe it must be cleaned up.<\/p> <p>  The people of Ballinskelligs, a small little place in south Kerry who are dependent on this type of development and need it, will not have this hotel because of this decision.<\/p><p>The decision was made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and that is fine.

The impact it has on small places is disproportionate and morally wrong.  There are many other questions about it.  Mr. Walsh should take that for what it is worth.<\/p><p> I have a couple of comments to make on transparency and I will get back to my recommendations.  That was a Freudian slip; I mean the recommendations that came out of the report.  My colleague went through issues about who makes decisions and most people do not know that it can come down to three people.  I knew that, although most people did not.

These suggestions are purely to protect the process of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<\/p> <p>  I return to the recommendations in the review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la that I sought.  When I was Minister, I had many others balls in the air about other matters, so I did not have much time for this area.  I did, however, ask for a complete review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, organisationally, which was done at the time by very eminent people.  I rarely do this, but I submitted a parliamentary question to my former Department, asking for an update, in chronological order, on the 101 recommendations contained in that review.  The Department refused to do that.  The Ceann Comhairle will be dealing with the matter and I look forward to that being resolved.

That would concern me because I felt at the time that there was not much of a pull towards my decision to start this review in the first place.  Page 30 of the annual report states the board consented to the quashing of ten of its orders where a procedural deficit was identified.  On ten occasions, the board had to quash its own orders which is a bit of an indictment of the procedures.

There are some very good recommendations in the report.

That again brings me back to transparency.  Where the board disagrees, it should give its reasons for doing so, supported, if necessary, by relevant evidence.

I am not going to take up much committee time on this but there are a number of other useful recommendations.  Recommendation No. 3 relates to managerial oversight.  Recommendation Nos. 6 and 8 deal with board members being appointed by the public appointments service, PAS.  That goes outside the board's remit and is more of a departmental issue but that is a no-brainer and should happen.  Recommendation No. 16 relates to biannual seminars.  Recommendation No. 24 deals with performance management.  There are a whole range of recommendations that need legislative changes which, I understand, would come through the Department and not the board.<\/p> <p>  Deputy MacSharry spoke about the use of local authorities and I do not believe An Bord Plean&aacute;la should be hiring rooms in hotels unless it is going through a very long process.  I think they should all be in local authorities, or somewhere close to them.<\/p> <p>  Recommendation No. 66 is aimed at easing pressures, getting the timelines down and meeting the timeframes set out.  It suggests appointing one board member for small developments unless they are going to contradict it.  The timelines must improve.<\/p> <p>  Referring back to my time in the Department, I believe the relationship between An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Department needs to change.  I will not say too much more about that but it needs to change pretty quickly.<\/p> <p>  Another recommendation is that where there is a contravention of a local development plan over a certain level, there should be consultation with the public.  Does that happen?  It does not.  That has to happen and that is an example of a recommendation that never came in.<\/p> <p>  The board should have an annual conference.  Recommendation No. 98 states there should be a head of communications.  At the end of the year, key decisions should be explained.<\/p> <p>  As far as I am concerned, all this is about transparency to the public about operations, the people who make the decisions, how people are appointed, how money is spent and to ensure that serious contraventions of local developments are explained.  All this needs to be front-facing.  The days of An Bord Plean&aacute;la hiding behind secrets and a process that nobody knows about, although I know about it and can see it, are over.  The process needs to be front and centre for the public to see.  People do not respect, appreciate or understand how all this works.  That is becoming a problem because discourses are emanating out there as regards decision making.  That creates rumours, which creates concerns.  I believe some of these are not warranted.  However, I demonstrated examples at the beginning of this meeting where they are warranted, justified and are affecting people's lives in a massive and disproportionate way.

It is important for the public to look at this.  I refer to the second appendix, detailing planning appeals received and decided by local authorities.  Everybody here is familiar with some local authority.  The information gives, for each local authority, the number of decisions made, the percentage of planning authority decisions confirmed, the percentage of planning authority decisions granted with conditions changed or added, and the percentage of planning authority decisions reversed.  I put my hands up as I will refer to Laois County Council, which had only 8% of the decisions coming before the board reversed.  That is the best record.  Kerry and Meath had 41% of the decisions rejected, Sligo had 38% of decisions rejected, Waterford city and county had 37% of decisions rejected, and Galway had 36% of decisions rejected.<\/p> <p>  Some planning authorities seem to be slightly more aligned to the board's thinking than other local authority planning offices.  Dublin is a little below average as well.  The witnesses get the point.  There must be a history of local authorities that have a significant number of decisions rejected year in and year out.  Other authorities tend to be more closely aligned to the board's thinking as it tends to support more of their decisions.  Perhaps the Department has a role in this.  Has there been an examination of these figures?  Has the County and City Management Association been involved?  Should there be uniformity?  It is clear that the board is the one national body that makes consistent decisions, regardless of the origins of an application.  It is clear that some local authorities get it and are fairly closely aligned but several others are operating away, probably hoping that cases do not go before the board.<\/p><p>If 41% of the decisions that come to the board are overturned, I worry about all those that would have been granted if they had come to it.

It was not about pointing to authorities that might not do everything right but rather to ones that present their information.  The vacant sites levy is an example.  It is new for local authorities and the board and we are constantly refining our processes.  There should be a dialogue, maybe facilitated by the Department or the new regulator, for people to talk and understand why we do something.  I do not mean that the board would tell people but some of the local authorities such as that in County Laois, which are obviously doing something right, could say this is how they approach the board and ask whether it is some best practice that could be shared with the 30 other authorities.

When people started building wind turbines, they normally had a height of 50 m, but they are now 180 m and we still have the same setbacks.  The Department is negligent - that is the most polite word.  The guidelines are utterly not fit for purpose.  They are not suitable for the scale of the structures coming through the system.

The TPNW provides for states to fulfil their disarmament obligations under Article VI of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and affirm their commitment to achieving a world free from nuclear weapons.  The TPNW plugs a legal gap by prohibiting the last form of weapon of mass destruction which has not yet been explicitly outlawed under international law.  I am pleased that during the Second Stage debate all parties expressed support for the passing of this legislation and shared a deep concern about the devastating consequences to humanity and the planet which would arise from the detonation of a nuclear weapon anywhere on the planet, whether by accident, miscalculation or design.  We are all agreed that the only guarantee of protection from the use of nuclear weapons is their complete elimination.  The ratification by Ireland of the TPNW will be an important step towards the realisation of this important goal.<\/p> <p>  The TPNW establishes a comprehensive set of prohibitions on participating in nuclear weapon activities.  The Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons Bill 2019 creates offences in respect of these prohibitions.  In addition to these core prohibitions that implement the disarmament pillar of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the TPNW obliges states parties to assist survivors of nuclear weapons testing or use in areas under their jurisdiction and to undertake necessary environmental remediation in areas under their control.  The treaty is the first international legal instrument to recognise the disproportionate impact on the health of women and girls of ionising radiation from nuclear weapons use.  The treaty also promotes equal participation in the treaty&rsquo;s work by women and men and includes a provision on disarmament education.   <\/p> <p>  Ratification of the treaty following the enactment of the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons Bill 2019 will be in line with Ireland&rsquo;s long-standing commitment to international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.  Ireland played a leading role in the treaty negotiations and, accordingly, signed the treaty at the earliest opportunity, on 20 September 2017.  Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with the treaty negotiations also reflected our principled position on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons, respect for human rights and the promotion of civil society voices.  These values are reflected in the treaty.  I am pleased to inform members that during a special high level ceremony at UN Headquarters in New York last week the TPNW took a significant step forward towards its entry into force when seven states signed and five states ratified the treaty.  The treaty now has 79 signatories and 32 states parties.  The treaty is more than halfway towards the 50 states parties required for its entry into force.<\/p> <p>  I would like to inform the committee that the Government is likely to propose an amendment on Report Stage to include a reverse onus clause in section 2 of the Bill.  This type of clause is to be found in other similar legislation, including the Biological Weapons Act 2011.  A reverse onus clause will ensure that, in the event of a prosecution being commenced for an offence under the Bill, a weapon or other explosive device capable of releasing nuclear energy will be presumed to have been designed for hostile purposes, that is, to cause or likely to cause death, serious injury or damage to property or the environment.  Thus, it will be for the defendant to cast reasonable doubt on this presumption in order to rebut it. <\/p> <p>  I again thank Deputies for their support for the Bill during its Second Reading.  More particularly, I thank Deputies for the richness of their engagement across a broad range of issues related to nuclear disarmament during that debate.  There is no doubt but that a world free of nuclear weapons is in best interests of humanity and the planet.  That is a shared view across the House.  I am confident that we will succeed in passing this legislation which will allow Ireland to ratify the TPNW in the coming months and demonstrate Ireland&rsquo;s leadership on the international stage on the issue of nuclear disarmament.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019100300002#A00300","speaker":"1241"},{"type":"speech","time":1570057200,"counter":1002,"content":"<p>Before we begin section by section consideration of the Bill, does any colleague wish to make some brief opening general remarks about the Bill?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019100300002#A00400","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1570057200,"counter":1003,"content":"<p>As I did not get the opportunity to speak to the Bill on Second Stage, I will take a few minutes to do so now.  <\/p> <p>  I thank the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.  Its research and background information on the Bill were very helpful.  Its work complements ours, particular of those of us in opposition.  It is of huge benefit to Members.<\/p> <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in supports and welcomes the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons Bill.  As the Minister of State said, it received unanimous support on Second Stage.  I imagine that support will continue as the Bill progresses through all remaining Stages.  The Bill will enable Ireland to become a state party to the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and give effect to its provisions in Irish law.  The treaty prohibits participation in a range of activities related to the transfer, development and use of nuclear weapons.  This is both very welcome and something to which every country should agree.  Nuclear weapons threaten the very existence of the human race and life on this planet.  They should not be developed, stored or used by anyone.  <\/p> <p>  It is worrying that many Cold War disarmament treaties are breaking down.  That should be noted in this discussion.  Presidents Trump and Putin are moving towards a new arms race.  We need to create a world free from nuclear weapons, chemical weapons and weapons of mass destruction.  Ireland must be a global leader on the issues of demilitarisation and disarmament.  <\/p> <p>  We should remember all victims and survivors of nuclear weapons.  Two nuclear weapons have been used in war - the bombs dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the US military in 1945.  These two bombs killed 120,000 civilians and flattened both cities.  They were deployed to kill as many civilians as possible.  It was a war crime, although it is never spoken about in these terms, and the effects are still being felt today.<\/p><p>We have seen pictures of babies born today who are suffering the effects of that war which should never have happened.  The development and use of nuclear weapons should have ended with it, but, regrettably, the opposite happened.  We know that more and more of these weapons were produced.  I always try to attend the annual event organised by the Irish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament on Merrion Square to remember all those who died in these two war crime events.  It is a small ceremony, but it is important that Irish people be given the opportunity to express their horror at what happened.  During the Cold War we saw massive proliferation of nuclear weapons which still pose a threat to humanity.  Nuclear weapons have been detonated on 2,000 occasions for testing purposes and demonstrations which have caused enormous environmental damage.  The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimated that in 2017 there were 14,465 nuclear weapons in the world.  They must all be destroyed and put beyond use.  <\/p><p> I reiterate my support for the treaty, Ireland being a signatory to it and the Bill, the effect of which will be to enshrine the provisions of the treaty in Irish law.  I am not sure about the amendment that has been tabled and hope someone will speak to it.  I am open to supporting it, but I am interested in hearing the Minister of State's views on it.  The treaty is not binding on states that are not a party to it and we have a long race to run before we reach full global nuclear disarmament.  Nonetheless, the treaty remains an important step in achieving nuclear disarmament.  In parallel to its support for the treaty, the Government should try to stop the erosion of Irish neutrality and oppose further militarisation of the European Union.  I know that there are differences of opinion, but it is not good enough to oppose nuclear weapons while remaining part of NATO's so-called Partnership for Peace.  We cannot chastise countries that have stockpiled and developed nuclear weapons in Europe and then join EU battle groups with them and silently move towards the formation of an EU army.  It is welcome that we have signed the treaty, but we must encourage more countries to do likewise.  We must also encourage those that have nuclear weapons to set out on the long road towards disarmament and the decommissioning of all nuclear weapons.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2019100300002#A00500","speaker":"1309","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1570057200,"counter":1005,"content":"<p>Obviously, I support the Bill and would like it to be even stronger, if possible.  That said, I have concerns.  While we are all agreed on the prohibition of nuclear weapons which are weapons of mass destruction, there seems to be an open field for the arms industry generally and the weapons produced that cause massive, rather than mass, destruction.  It is all very well to agree on the prohibition of nuclear weapons, but the bigger picture must be addressed.  This is particularly the case when one looks at the finance involved in the arms industry.  When I was speaking to the Bill in the D&aacute;il Chamber, I mentioned some figures which included the $1.74 trillion spent on arms in 2017.  In the European Union alone, military spending is &euro;260 billion per annum.  Apparently, it will take another $1 trillion to modernise the nuclear weapons capacity of the nine countries that have nuclear weapons.  While we are passing this legislation, supporting its provisions and asking that it be as strong as possible, we must be mindful of what is happening in the wider context.  There are a number of rather volatile world leaders who like to play war games with each other.  We are depending on them to behave rationally, but I am not sure if we can put too much store in that happening.  Of course, the countries that hold nuclear weapons will not agree with the treaty because they want to retain these weapons.  In that context, a lot more work needs to be done.<\/p> <p>  I have a question about divestment in companies that produce nuclear weapons.

As the Minister of State said, this country has a long and proud record in working towards the prohibition and elimination of nuclear weapons.  Going back to 1958, led by the then Minister Frank Aiken, Ireland introduced the first of what became known as the Irish resolutions at the United Nations which eventually led to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons which has become the cornerstone of nuclear disarmament.  The treaty is the most widely recognised agreement on nuclear disarmament.  As has been said, with so much uncertainty throughout the world, this is an issue that must continually be addressed by the international community.  The Bill is an important measure and we are glad to be able to facilitate its passage.
