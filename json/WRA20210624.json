Section 34 of the Acts provides that a landlord must state a reason for the termination in any tenancy termination notice served, and the termination will not be valid unless that reason relates to one of the following:<\/p>  <p>  - the tenant has failed to comply with the obligations (other than the obligation to pay rent) of the tenancy;<\/p>  <p>  - the tenant has failed to comply with the obligation to pay rent under the tenancy;<\/p>  <p>  - the landlord intends to sell the dwelling within the next 9 months;<\/p>  <p>  - the dwelling is no longer suited to the needs of the occupying household;<\/p>  <p>  - the landlord requires the dwelling for own or family member occupation;<\/p>  <p>  - vacant possession is required for substantial refurbishment of the dwelling; and\/or<\/p>  <p>  - the landlord intends to change the use of the dwelling.<\/p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies Act 2020 was enacted and came into operation on 24 October 2020 to temporarily modify the operation of the Residential Tenancies Acts to prevent any notices of termination served by landlords, in all but limited cases, from taking effect in geographical locations and during periods specified by the Minister for Health in Regulations made by him under section 31A of the Health Act 1947 in respect of which a restriction applies on the movement of people outside a 5 km radius of their place of residence. These tenancy protections also apply during the 10 days directly following the period specified by the Minister for Health in the aforementioned Regulations. Once the Minister for Health makes regulations restricting movement outside a 5 km radius of one's place of residence, the moratorium on evictions taking place will automatically apply.  <\/p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 introduced permanent protections to provide new procedures to be followed in the context of rent arrears warnings and associated tenancy terminations.<\/p>  <p>  Any notice of termination grounded on rent arrears must be copied to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) and will be invalid if it is not so copied. A notice of termination grounded on rent arrears can only be served by a landlord on the condition that a written rent arrears warning was given to both the tenant and the RTB and that the arrears were not paid within 28 days (doubled from 14 days from 1 August 2020) following receipt of the warning by the tenant or by the RTB, whichever occurs later. <\/p>  <p>  The RTB will acknowledge receipt to the landlord and tenant and provide the tenant with written information to enable them to get advice from the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) and on the income and other supports available. If the tenant agrees, the RTB can help them to engage with MABS to resolve their rent arrears and sustain their tenancy. The aim of the new procedures is to ensure that early action is taken to address rent arrears, to the benefit of both the tenant and the landlord.<\/p>  <p>  Where a tenancy is to be terminated on grounds of rent arrears on foot of Covid-19, enhanced protections and procedures now apply for tenants and landlords under Part 3 (Residential Tenancies) of the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020 (the PDRTA).  The PDRTA provides for temporary modifications to the operation of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to provide, subject to certain conditions, that during the period from 11 January to 12 July 2021 a 90 day (rather than the usual 28 days) termination notice period applies, where a tenant is in rent arrears due to Covid-19 and is at risk of losing their tenancy. The earliest termination date allowed in such circumstances is 13 July 2021. Rent increases are also prohibited for relevant tenancies until 13 July 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The targeted ban on rent increases under the PDRTA is due to expire on 12 July 2021. The Government published the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Bill 2021 on 17 June 2021 which, if passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas on or before 12 July 2021, will extend the targeted protections of the PDRTA until 12 January 2022, to afford more time to the most vulnerable tenants to recover their financial stability.<\/p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies Board displays comprehensive information on its website - www.rtb.ie - including guidance and frequently asked questions documents relating to terminating tenancies during the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400070#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Provision","counter":42,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400070#WRB01700"},{"type":"question","counter":43,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[33842\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400070#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his plans to provide social and affordable housing to persons with disabilities.","asker":"1525","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":44,"content":"<p>The National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability (NHSPWD) 2016-2021, which is a \u00a0joint publication by the Department of Housing and the Department of Health, sets out the Government&rsquo;s broad framework for the delivery of housing for people with disabilities.\u00a0 The Strategy was developed as part of a coherent framework of housing and care for people with disabilities, in conjunction with the Government&rsquo;s mental health policy as set out in A Vision for Change and the Report of the Working Group on Congregated Settings \"Time to Move On\" (2011) which provides for the transitioning of people with intellectual disabilities from institutional settings to community living.<\/p>  <p>  Persons with disabilities can, and are encouraged to, apply to housing authorities for housing supports, similarly to all citizens, and the range of social and affordable housing solutions are available to them following an assessment of their needs.\u00a0 Accommodation is provided by the local authorities and approved housing bodies supported by\u00a0Exchequer funding. <\/p>  <p>  The Housing Agency is responsible for implementation of the Strategy and has published a number of documents, including guidelines, to support local authorities in implementing the Strategy.

Local authorities vary significantly from one another in terms of size, population, population distribution, public service demands, infrastructure and other income sources, all factors which should be taken into account when comparing levels of funding in different local authority areas. <\/p>  <p>  Most of the funding from Central Government must be used for specified services. These can be grouped into 5 broad programme categories: recreational, education, environment, housing and transport. Across all schemes and funding sources,\u00a0my Department provided &euro;51.1m and &euro;82.9m to Galway County Council in 2019 and 2020 respectively. The increase between 2019 and 2020 is due to an increase in housing funding, as well as funding in respect of the Covid-19 rates waiver and other Covid related expenses that occurred in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for each local authority to consider how it can maximise local income sources and manage its own spending, in the context of the annual budgetary process. Local authority members may decide, as part of that process, to vary the ARV and LPT in order to increase the revenue available to them.\u00a0 I understand that Galway County Council has opted not to use these tools for many years. <\/p>  <p>  The power to vary LPT is a reserved function and local authorities must balance those priorities against available resources. To achieve that balance, the elected members must make informed and necessary choices to balance the level of service provision with the available income. For 2021, 22 of the local authorities throughout the country opted to vary their local property tax upwards while only three have opted to vary it downwards. Arising from these variation decisions, the local authority sector will gain an additional &euro;11.5 million from LPT when compared with 2020. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that Galway County elected members decided not to vary the LPT rate for 2021.\u00a0\u00a0My Department, as a matter of course, does not provide supplementary funding to local authorities in lieu of LPT changes; to do so would undermine one of the reasons LPT was introduced, which is to strengthen the link between the decision making of elected members of local authorities and services provided in the area. This has consistently been the position since 2015. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government 'Our Shared Future', commits to bringing about reforms in the workings of LPT. These reforms will involve bringing new homes, which are currently exempt from LPT, into the taxation system as well as providing for all money collected locally to be retained within the county. This will also be done on the basis that those counties with a lower LPT base are adjusted via an annual national equalisation fund paid from the Exchequer, as is currently the case. <\/p>  <p>  To this end, the Minister for Finance, Paschal Donohoe T.D., recently published the Heads of the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2021. The Bill will give effect to a package of measures in line with the Programme for Government to address the future of the Local Property Tax. The legislation required to implement those changes falls under the remit of the Department of Finance as a tax policy matter and will be considered by the Houses of the Oireachtas in due course. Minister Donohue also signalled the Government&rsquo;s intent to move to 100% local retention from 2023. Any changes to the allocation process may be considered in that context.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, on 13 April 2021, I met with a delegation from Galway County Council and agreed that\u00a0my Department will work with Galway County Council to explore the options available to putting their finances on a more sustainable footing. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400070#WRB04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Construction Industry","counter":70,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400070#WRB04500"},{"type":"question","counter":71,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[33085\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400070#WRB04600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his position on smaller building companies; and the measures his Department has in place to protect them.","asker":"1488","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":72,"content":"<p>Social housing construction projects (as with all publicly funded construction projects), must be competitively tendered, in accordance with the public procurement guidelines, to ensure transparency as well as value for money for the tax-payer and must comply with the Government&rsquo;s Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF).

There are many and varied reasons why some households may remain on the social housing waiting list for a longer period, generally associated with the\u00a0size and type\u00a0of home required and the availability of such\u00a0homes \u00a0in the areas of choice selected by the applicant household.

Information on the schemes that have received approval in principle under the Serviced Sites Fund are available at: <\/p>  <p>  www.rebuildingireland.ie\/news\/minister-murphy-gives-the-go-ahead-for-ten-local-authority-sites-for-affordable-housing-under-the-serviced-sites-fund\/, and <\/p>  <p>  www.rebuildingireland.ie\/news\/minister-murphy-approves-funding-of-e84m-to-support-delivery-of-1770-affordable-homes-under-the-ssf\/. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the 35 SSF projects referenced in the links above, approval in principle has also been given to five additional projects - Emmet Road and Oscar Traynor Road (Dublin City Council), Shanganagh (D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council), Hayestown and Ballymastone (Fingal County Council). <\/p>  <p>  Cumulatively, these 40 SSF projects, across 14 local authorities, will assist in the delivery of just over 4,200 affordable home to buy or rent. My Department continues to engage with local authorities to progress both current and potential projects, with the first SSF project to deliver affordable homes for purchase under the SSF later this year being the Boherboy project in Cork City. <\/p>  <p>  In making an application for SSF funding, each local authority must demonstrate that an affordability issue exists in the area in question and that it is viable to deliver homes, for purchase or rent, with purchase prices of at least 10% below open market values, with the reduction remaining as fully-repayable equity charge against the property. The scheme is targeted at first-time buyers, with some limited exceptions as outlined in the Affordable Housing 2021 Bill. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the affordable homes to be delivered through the SSF, Budget 2021 allocated &euro;75 million for the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme, which is aimed at first-time buyers buying a new-build home on private land. It will help these first-time buyers secure their own home by bridging the gap, by means of an equity stake, between the mortgage available to them and the price of the home they want. Work on the detailed design of the proposed scheme is ongoing and at an advanced stage. <\/p>  <p>  The Affordable Housing Bill 2021 will also place a new form of tenure in Cost Rental on a statutory basis for the first time. Cost Rental directly links rents to the cost of provision rather than market dynamics. Three initial Cost Rental projects are already underway. The first Cost Rental homes in Ireland, 50 two-bedroom apartments at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, will be delivered by the Tuath and Respond Approved Housing Bodies in Quarter 3 2021. Dublin City Council is also progressing a site at Emmet Road, Inchicore (the former St Michael&rsquo;s Estate), and the LDA is collaborating with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council on a site at Shanganagh, Shankill. <\/p>  <p>  The provision of Cost Rental housing is also being implemented through the new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) scheme, which was allocated &euro;35m in Budget 2021. I approved in principle the financing this year of 390 new homes across eight sites, located in Dublin, the Greater Dublin Area, and Cork. CREL support and careful cost management has generated initial rents which are at least 25% below comparable open market prices, delivering significantly improved affordability for renters. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the aforementioned measures in the Affordable Housing Bill 2021, the Land Development Agency (LDA) is tasked to work with Government Departments, local authorities, state agencies and other stakeholders to assemble strategic sites in urban areas and ensure the sustainable development of social and affordable homes for rent and purchase. On establishment, the LDA had access to an initial tranche of 8 sites that have near term delivery potential for approximately 3,400 new homes. In partnership with Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, the LDA has been granted planning permission for the development of 597 homes on a site in Shanganagh, County Dublin.  Approximately 34% of the units will be for social housing, 51% will be cost rental and 15% will be for affordable purchase. Work has commenced on the construction tender process, with construction anticipated to start in the second half of 2021. Information on the work of the LDA is available at: www.lda.ie\/. <\/p>  <p>On 4 May last, the Government also approved the drafting of amending provisions to Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, for inclusion in the Affordable Housing Bill 2021 as Committee Stage amendments. This will see an increase in the current 10% social housing requirement related to all new housing developments to a mandatory 20% for social and affordable requirements.  <\/p>  <p>  Other affordability measures, such as the Help to Buy Scheme, and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, are already available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable. <\/p>  <p>  The Help to Buy Initiative may return tax paid in the previous four years to eligible first-time buyers, up to a maximum amount of &euro;30,000, for a new home. Information is available at: www.revenue.ie\/en\/property\/help-to-buy-incentive\/index.aspx. The availability of the Help to Buy Initiative for first-time buyers can help secure the required level of deposit for a new home. <\/p>  <p>  The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, which operated by my Department, is designed to enable creditworthy first-time buyers, who are unable to access a mortgage from a commercial lender, to obtain sustainable mortgage lending to purchase a new or second-hand property. <\/p>  <p>  To support prudential lending and consistency of treatment for borrowers, a Loan to Value ratio of 90% applies to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan as per the Central Bank's prudential lending guidelines. Therefore, in order to avail of the loan, applicants must have a deposit equivalent to 10% of the market value of the property. <\/p>  <p>  Applicants must provide bank or similar statements (such as post office, credit union, etc.) for a 12-month period immediately prior to making an application, clearly showing a credible and consistent track record of savings. The cash savings should be no less than 3% of the market value of the property. Gifts are permissible up to 7% of the market value of the property, where their source is verified. <\/p>  <p>  Exceptions to the above can be made where an applicant\/applicants can clearly demonstrate a consistent and credible record of savings or rent payment through their bank account which, at a minimum, is equal to the proposed monthly loan repayment. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would add that the Government&rsquo;s upcoming Housing strategy, &lsquo;Housing for All&rsquo;, will detail an extensive range of measures and ambitious targets to underpin the delivery of affordable housing over the coming years. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400071#WRC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authorities","counter":102,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400071#WRC01100"},{"type":"question","counter":103,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[33811\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400071#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the resources which have been provided for the National Building Control and Market Surveillance Office; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":104,"content":"<p>It is a matter for each local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Statutory Instrument (S.I.) 682 of 2020\u00a0prescribed Dublin City Council-National Building Control Office (NBCO-DCC)\u00a0as a competent authority to carry out the functions of a Market Surveillance Authority under the\u00a0European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013 ( S.I.

The policy statement\u00a0is available on\u00a0my Department's website at:<\/p>  <p>  www.housing.gov.ie\/housing\/special-housing-needs\/older-people\/housing-options-our-ageing-population-policy-statement.<\/p>  <p>  It is intended that the Implementation Group will provide its final report addressing each of the 40 actions, by the end of 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that affordable, quality housing solutions are available to everyone in Irish society and supporting renters is a key component of that. The Affordable Housing Bill 2020 will ensure that affordability is put at the heart of the housing system and will underpin the introduction of a new national Cost Rental scheme. This year\u00a0will also see the first ever cost rental units,\u00a0more than\u00a0400 units, built and occupied in the State. Cost rental is targeted at moderate income households where the rent charged only covers the cost of provision of homes. The Land Development Agency will be put on a statutory footing and given capital to ramp up cost rental provision to the scale needed.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition to social housing rental accommodation provided specifically by local authorities for older people, Approved Housing Bodies who provide affordable rented housing for people who cannot afford to pay private sector rents or buy their own homes often focus on specific accommodation for particular groups, such as\u00a0older people.<\/p>  <p>  The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a form of social housing support for people who have a long-term housing need. If a household has been deemed eligible for social housing support, it is a matter for the local authority to examine the suite of social housing supports available, including the HAP scheme, to determine the most appropriate form of social housing support for that household in the administrative area of that local authority.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Under the HAP scheme, tenants source their own accommodation in the private rented market. The accommodation sourced by tenants should be within the prescribed maximum HAP rent limits, which are based on household size and the rental market within the area concerned.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government - 'Our Shared Future', commits to improving the security of tenure for tenants, through legislating for tenancies of indefinite duration, increasing Residential Tenancies Board enforcement and examining incentives for long-term leasing.<\/p>  <p>  Proposals for further amendments to the Residential Tenancies Acts are currently being developed, for inclusion in the General Scheme of the Housing and Residential Tenancies Bill which is expected to be submitted in the coming months for Government approval to proceed to legal drafting.

Local authorities have been advised that design- build rapid delivery approaches should be adopted where appropriate to deliver social housing projects on local authority-owned land.<\/p>  <p>  To support delivery, the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) put in place a framework of design-build contractors in 2017. This framework which expired in February 2021, was available for all local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to use in the interest of accelerated delivery.\u00a0 While some local authorities have progressed projects using the framework, the scope of works\u00a0was generally limited to certain development sizes and unit types. On this basis, other local authorities have implemented their own frameworks, while some have tendered on individual projects for design-build contractors, on a case by case basis. <\/p>  <p>  The Housing Delivery and Co-ordination Office and\u00a0my Department are currently working with the OGP on replacement frameworks which will operate on a regional basis and cater to a variety of development sizes and unit types, including apartments. In addition, Dublin City Council has developed a\u00a0framework\u00a0of design-build contractors for the delivery of a volumetric\u00a0programme of houses and apartments which is available to all local authorities and AHBs to use on larger projects. It is envisaged that over 1,000 fast-track homes will be built using the\u00a0Dublin City framework, and while the majority of these will be in Dublin, there will also likely be schemes in other large centres.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the issues around delivery that &lsquo;standard&rsquo; social housing construction projects face, are also faced by design-build projects, such as preparing sites, services\/access to the site, community consultation, planning, etc.\u00a0 There\u00a0can however, be savings in terms of programme and construction with these advantages growing as more use is made of these frameworks and as contractors gain more experience in implementing these methods. Under this mechanism, acceleration is delivered both by the use of the design-build services of specialist contractors and reduced construction time periods due to considerable off site fabrication. As well as off-site construction providing many benefits in terms of delivery and affordability, the new frameworks will provide sustainable and durable quality housing.

If upon review, a household is found to exceed the limits on income eligibility grounds, for example, they would be removed from the list.\u00a0Furthermore, authorities are also required, when directed by the Minister, to undertake a statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA) to count the number of households on the waiting list for social housing supports whose need has not yet been met. The SSHA process requires all local authorities to review those households who are on their housing list but who are not currently in receipt of housing support. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The 2011 Regulations prescribe maximum net income limits for each local authority, in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy. <\/p>  <p>  The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10% and separately a 2.5% allowance for each child.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.<\/p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.<\/p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to affordable measures, the Affordable Housing Bill, currently before the Oireachtas, includes provisions to underpin three schemes delivering on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to prioritise the increased supply of affordable homes through (1) affordable homes for purchase delivered by local authorities, (2) a new affordable purchase shared equity scheme for private homes, and (3) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2021 allocated &euro;75 million for the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme, one of the aforementioned provisions. It will enable first-time buyers to buy a new home, much sooner than would otherwise be the case, by bridging the gap between what people have and the price of the new home they want, while also building confidence in the construction sector to increase much need housing supply. <\/p>  <p>  Extensive engagement has been undertaken with key stakeholders to ensure the optimum design of the Scheme, and significant feedback has been factored in. Work on the final design of the Scheme is ongoing, in advance of its introduction later this year. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to affordable housing supports more generally, measures such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, are available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable.<\/p>  <p>  An enhanced Help to Buy scheme was announced as part of the &euro;7 billion July stimulus package, which was extended to December 2021 as part of Budget 2021. This allows first-time buyers purchasing a newly-built home &ndash; or building one themselves &ndash; to claim back up to &euro;30,000 paid in income tax and DIRT on bank deposit interest over the last four years.<\/p>  <p>  The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is a Government-backed mortgage which is for first-time-buyers nationwide to purchase a new or second-hand home or to self-build. This scheme offers loans on competitive terms to those who are unable to secure a sufficient commercial bank loan. <\/p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2019, &euro;310 million was made available to service local authority land for the delivery of affordable housing under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF). The SSF provides for key enabling infrastructure requirements that will help unlock publicly-owned lands specifically for the provision of affordable homes to buy or rent. This fund sub-vents the cost of facilitating infrastructure, with a current maximum SSF funding amount of &euro;50,000 available per affordable home. This sum is comprised of &euro;44,500 (or 89%) Exchequer contribution and a &euro;5,500 (or 11%) local authority contribution.\u00a0 On this basis, at least 6,200 more affordable homes, to buy or rent, can be facilitated by this measure.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  To date, funding support of &euro;200 million has been allocated to enable delivery of over 4,200 affordable homes for purchase or rent. &euro;50 million has been allocated to the SSF in 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400072#WRD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":168,"content":"<p>Question No. 64 answered with Question No. 34.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Schemes","counter":169,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400072#WRD02300"},{"type":"question","counter":170,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[33803\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400072#WRD02400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"his plans to make the Rebuilding Ireland home loans more flexible such as increasing financial limits; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":171,"content":"<p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan loan enables credit worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Single applicants for the loan\u00a0must not be earning greater than &euro;50,000 gross per annum.\u00a0 The combined income of joint applicants must not be greater than &euro;75,000 per annum.\u00a0 There\u00a0are no set minimum income limits; however, applicants do need to have sufficient borrowing and repayment capacity and must be capable of repaying the mortgage in accordance with the statutory\u00a0credit policy underpinning the loan.\u00a0 These income limits\u00a0are unchanged from the previous local authority loan offerings.<\/p>  <p>  The new Programme for Government &rdquo;Our Shared Future\" contains a commitment to expand the Rebuilding Home Loan.

Failure to register is an offence which may result in a criminal conviction, a fine of up to &euro;4,000 and\/or up to six months imprisonment.

It was jointly negotiated, and jointly agreed, by the EU and the UK &ndash; the result of a painstaking process which took more than four years, during which a whole host of options were explored. Ultimately, the Protocol was - and is - the only solution found to the problems caused by Brexit for the island of Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to reiterate that the Protocol makes no change to the constitutional status of Northern Ireland as set down in the Good Friday Agreement. The Protocol prevents a hard border on this island and protects the gains of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  As a jointly negotiated agreement, it now needs to be jointly implemented, in good faith. There are undoubtedly challenges. Earlier this month, the Joint Committee &ndash; the proper forum for discussion regarding implementation &ndash; came together to take stock of progress to date and give consideration to the identified issues of concern. EU and UK officials continue to work on developing solutions to these outstanding issues. It is important that process continue and be encouraged.<\/p>  <p>  Working together like this is the only path to sustainable solutions. Unilateral actions on sensitive issues in Northern Ireland never work. UK unilateral actions taken to date have damaged trust. The UK and EU must work together to find pragmatic solutions. In that regard I am encouraged by the decision of the UK Government to seek EU agreement on extending the grace period on chilled meat products. Vice President &Scaron;efcovic, speaking last Friday in Bruges, welcomed this request, which is currently being assessed. Requesting the extension recognises that the Protocol is jointly owned and is to be jointly implemented. <\/p>  <p>  The European Union continues to show that it is a willing partner. The UK must show its willingness by honouring the commitments to which it has already signed up, which it negotiated, agreed, campaigned on, and ratified through its parliament. <\/p>  <p>  There are options to reduce the burden on businesses. An SPS agreement, even on a temporary basis, would offer a clear win and has broad support in Northern Ireland. This could reduce the level of checks on agri-food products travelling from GB to NI by up to 80% - this is a prize worth fighting for. US interlocutors have been clear that such an agreement would not stand in the way of a UK-US trade deal. People right across the political, business, retail, and farming sectors in Northern Ireland have made clear that they favour such an agreement. The EU Commission has said it could be put in place within weeks. It would be a simple, concrete and popular step. <\/p>  <p>  It is clear that the politics of Brexit are proving to be corrosive to the already very sensitive situation in Northern Ireland, polarising opinion and increasing tensions. I want us to get to a place where the implementation of the Protocol is fully realised in a way that works for Northern Ireland. We all have a responsibility to listen to the concerns and engage with citizens, businesses, politicians and community leaders in the North. <\/p>  <p>  There is also an onus on leaders and politicians to engage openly and honestly with citizens, businesses, politicians, and community leaders to explain the context of the Protocol - and to be clear and honest that the alternative to the Protocol is not life as it was before Brexit, but a scenario of much deeper and more difficult disruption. <\/p>  <p>  There is no easy alternative to the problems caused by Brexit on the island of Ireland. We spent four years exploring other options without success.\u00a0 While Brexit has inevitably meant change for businesses, and sometimes difficult change, there are also significant potential opportunities for Northern Ireland through the Protocol, with open access to the rest of the UK internal market and to the entire EU Single Market of more than 450 million people. <\/p>  <p>  There is evidence of increased interest in Northern Ireland as an investment location - but stability and certainty are needed to help realise that potential. I will continue to do all I can to encourage pragmatic engagement on the implementation of the Protocol and to underpin peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400074#WRF03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Good Friday Agreement","counter":292,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400074#WRF03400"},{"type":"question","counter":293,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[29397\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400074#WRF03500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the steps he will take through international law to force Britain to adhere to international agreements such as the Good Friday Agreement and the Stormont House Agreement.","asker":"1504","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":294,"content":"<p>The full implementation and safeguarding of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent Agreements in a crucial priority for the Government.<\/p>  <p>  The Good Friday Agreement consists of two elements; the Multi-Party Agreement reached between the Northern Ireland political parties and the two Governments, and an Agreement between the Irish and British Governments to which the Multi-Party Agreement is annexed.

Work is ongoing with a view to achieving transposition of the Directive into Irish law as soon as possible.<\/p><p>The Commission for Regulation of Utilities will publish a draft framework later this year which will outline the details, including eligibility criteria and timescales for introduction, of the Clean Export Guarantee payment for exported renewable electricity, to give effect to the above-mentioned articles and allow for the commencement of export payments to micro-generators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400077#WRJ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Management","counter":459,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400077#WRJ02200"},{"type":"question","counter":460,"qnumday":186,"qnumall":"[34066\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400077#WRJ02300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if there are regulations requiring the display of a notice in outlets handling WEEE products to the effect that arrangements are in place for products at the end of their useful life; the enforcement that is in place to ensure obligations in relation to same are respected; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1549","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":461,"content":"<p>The regulations referred to can be found in\u00a0S.I.

This applies even if the EU has a Free Trade Agreement with the relevant third country.<\/p><p>In cases where it is applicable, the preferential tariff treatment must be claimed on import on the Customs declaration.<\/p><p>Vehicles originally exported from the EU to the UK which meet certain criteria may be eligible for Returned Goods Relief under the EU customs rules (the Union Customs Code). \u00a0Under Union Customs Code, goods can be exported from the EU to a third country and re-imported into the EU without payment of Customs Duty provided all the required conditions for Returned Goods Relief<b><\/b>are met.\u00a0The goods must have been originally exported from the EU, must not have been altered and must be re-imported within three years of export from the EU.\u00a0In very specific circumstances, relief from VAT may also apply where the goods are re-imported into the EU by the same economic entity that originally exported the goods out of the EU.<\/p><p>Further information on Returned Goods Relief and Movement of Motor Vehicles including proofs required for claiming the relief is available on Revenue&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>On the matter of Vehicle Registration Tax, the UK exit from the EU has no impact on VRT liability.\u00a0Buses generally fall within EU Categories M2 or M3 and, when registered in the State, these vehicles are liable to a VRT flat rate of &euro;200.<\/p><p>The Deputy is asking also about the potential for VAT recovery by businesses whose activities are exempt from VAT. The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply. In general, the VAT Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23% in Ireland, unless they fall within categories of goods and services specified in the Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply a lower rate or exemption from VAT. In addition, the Directive allows for historic VAT treatment to be maintained under certain conditions and Ireland has retained the application of VAT exemption to the transport of passengers and their accompanying baggage. This means that under Ireland&rsquo;s VAT rules, the supplier of passenger transport services does not register for VAT, does not charge VAT on the supply of their services and, consequently, has no VAT recovery entitlement on their input costs.<\/p><p>In accordance with the EU rules, Ireland may continue to apply this existing, historic VAT exemption on the supply of domestic passenger transport but, for as long as the exemption remains, the conditions under which the exemption was granted cannot be changed;\u00a0 for example, Ireland could not adopt the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion to introduce a new entitlement to VAT recovery on purchases of buses from Great Britain. In fact, the introduction of a new entitlement to VAT recovery for the passenger transport sector could only be done if Ireland were to decide to end its historic exemption for the sector, and bring passenger transport services into the VAT net;\u00a0 this would then require suppliers to register for VAT and require them to charge VAT on their passenger fares.<\/p><p>Finally, the Deputy may be interested to know that under the existing arrangements, certain reliefs from VAT are already available to passenger transport operators, whose businesses are established in this State, as follows:<\/p><p>- the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (Touring Coaches) Order of 2012 provides for a refund of VAT on the cost of acquiring &ldquo;qualifying vehicles&rdquo; used for the carriage of tourists under contracts for group transport; and <\/p><p>- provisions within Section 59 of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010, which allow a person established in this State to claim deductibility in respect of input costs incurred in relation to the transport of passengers outside this State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400078#WRK01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":493,"content":"<p>Question No. 197 answered with Question No. 196.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":495,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400078#WRK01700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works","counter":494,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400078#WRK01600"},{"type":"question","counter":495,"qnumday":198,"qnumall":"[34103\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400078#WRK01700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the length of time the works currently underway at a location (details supplied) were meant to take originally; when he now expects same to be finished; if the cost of the job has increased or is within budget; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the site has been inaccessible to the public for over seven months; if he will visit the site and meet with local persons who are very frustrated with this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":496,"content":"<p>I am advised that this information is currently being coordinated and I will respond Directly to the Deputy on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400078#WRK01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Information","counter":497,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400078#WRK01900"},{"type":"question","counter":498,"qnumday":199,"qnumall":"[33965\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400078#WRK02000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans to review the Freedom of Information Act 2014 in 2021; and the status of the progress made on drafting a new freedom of information Act and or amendments to the existing legislation.","asker":"1489","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":499,"content":"<p>From the outset, I wish to welcome the Deputy's ongoing interest in the Freedom of Information Act and related issues.

Relevant wrongdoings that can be reported include: criminal offences; failure to comply with a legal obligation; miscarriage of justice; endangerment of health and safety; damage to the environment; unlawful or improper use of public funds; oppressive; and discriminatory or negligent behaviour by a public body as well as any attempt to conceal or destroy evidence of any of the above wrongdoings.<\/p>  <p>  Workers can make a protected disclosure to their employer in accordance with section 6 of the Act. The vast majority of protected disclosures are made in this manner in the first instance. If a worker does not want to report to their employer or they have reported to their employer but no action or insufficient action was taken, they can report to a prescribed person under section 7 of the Act, provided they have a reasonable belief the information is substantially true. A full list of prescribed persons is available at:\u00a0www.gov.ie\/en\/collection\/41798-protected-disclosures-whistleblowing-list-of-prescribed-persons\/.\u00a0A worker in a public body can make a protected disclosure to a relevant Government Minister in accordance with section 8 of the Act. A worker can also make a protected disclosure to another third party in accordance with section 10 of the Act.

They are also protected from civil and criminal liability for any breach of confidentiality if to so was necessary in order to make a disclosure. Protection is provided through the Workplace Relations Commission and the courts. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy can see from the above, entitlement to protection under the Act depends on who has made the report, the matter that has been reported and to whom the report has been made. If a worker is uncertain as to whether they qualify for protection under the Act, they should seek legal advice. In this regard, my Department provides Exchequer funding to Transparency International Ireland to operate a free Speak Up Helpline and Legal Advice Centre to assist persons who have made or are considering making a protected disclosure.\u00a0 Further information can be found at:\u00a0www.transparency.ie\/helpline.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400078#WRK03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Heritage Sites","counter":509,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400078#WRK03100"},{"type":"question","counter":510,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[34033\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400078#WRK03200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the status of plans by the OPW to enhance the user and visitor experience at Castletown House, Celbridge, County Kildare (details supplied).

The aim of these rules is to ensure compliance with the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and equal treatment which are key to demonstrating the State&rsquo;s attainment of maximum value for money through competitive procedures. To create a level playing field for all businesses across the Single European Market, EU law sets out minimum harmonised procurement rules for all Member States.<\/p>  <p>  The Government recognises the importance of the SME sector and continues to enhance the already substantial measures to support SMEs in accessing the public procurement market. Significant work has been undertaken by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP), an office within my Department, to ensure that the opportunity to compete in public procurement is accessible by all businesses, including SMEs. Specifically, the OGP has developed a suite of policy measures aimed at assisting SMEs to access public procurement opportunities (implemented through Circular 10\/14). These include:<\/p>  <p>  - Proportionate financial\u00a0capacity\u00a0criterion (turnover requirements limited to\u00a0twice the\u00a0contract value);<\/p>  <p>  - Contracting authorities are encouraged to divide\u00a0public contracts\u00a0into lots;<\/p>  <p>  - Provision for &ldquo;consortia\u00a0bidding&rdquo; to assist SMEs\u00a0to\u00a0participate in procurement procedures where\u00a0they would\u00a0not have\u00a0the relevant capability or scale;<\/p>  <p>  - Proportionate insurance levels; and<\/p>  <p>  - Public bodies are required to advertise contracts for goods and services valued above &euro;25,000 on the national eTenders portal.<\/p>  <p>  This ensures that as many businesses and SMEs are aware of tendering opportunities as possible. Indeed, the latest analysis carried out by the OGP indicates that 92% of the &euro;4.8 billion procurement addressable expenditure analysed is with firms with an Irish base and that the majority of spend (53%) is with the SME sector.<\/p>  <p>  The OGP also collaborates with Inter Trade Ireland in the delivery of a series of &lsquo;Go-2-Tender&rsquo; events.\u00a0This programme has been developed to give SMEs the confidence, knowledge and practical skills to tender successfully for public sector contracts on a cross-border basis. The programme is geared towards SME&rsquo;s which want to improve their basis tendering skills to increase their success rates in public sector tenders.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government sets out a number of commitments in relation to public procurement including a commitment to continue to support and train Irish indigenous SMEs so that they can compete for public procurement contracts in Ireland and abroad.

It is regrettable that at this time, it is not possible to permit a broader return to mass events, but the current restrictions are clear that matches and competitive sporting events are not permitted except for those governed and overseen by recognised NGBs.<\/p>  <p>  As the summer goes on and the vaccination rollout continues the restrictions we must operate under will lessen, and I expect that a larger number and range of\u00a0events will be possible in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400079#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1475"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":529,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400079#WRL00800"},{"type":"question","counter":530,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[34001\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400079#WRL00900","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the reason a company (details supplied) in the events sector has not been able to obtain a grant; and if there will be further opportunities for the company.","asker":"1549","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":531,"content":"<p>I allocated &euro;50 million in 2021 to a suite of measures to assist the arts and culture sector.

I was delighted to be in a position to fund 237 successful applications under this scheme, the details of which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  There was a very high level of interest in this scheme, with over 400 applications requesting funding in excess of &euro;80 million. Given the available funding of &euro;25 million, difficult decisions had to be made and it was not  possible to award grants to everyone who applied. The 237 grants awarded will help support employment and wellbeing opportunities across all genres and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public.<\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department are engaging with applicants in relation to queries regarding the outcome of their Live Performance Support Scheme application.

These reforms will involve bringing new homes, which are currently exempt from LPT, into the taxation system as well as providing for all money collected locally to be retained within the county. This will also be done on the basis that those counties with a lower LPT base are adjusted via an annual national equalisation fund paid from the Exchequer, as is currently the case. <\/p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Finance, recently published the Heads of the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2021. The Bill will give effect to a package of measures in line with the Programme for Government to address the future of the LPT. Minister Donohue also signalled the Government&rsquo;s intent to move to 100% local retention from 2023. Any changes to the allocation process may be considered in that context.<\/p>  <p>  As the LPT revaluation process is likely to take a number of months, detailed information on the new yield per local authority will not be available until later in the year. Accordingly, LPT allocations for 2022 will provisionally be based on updated information regarding the 2021 yield, on a no change basis i.e. the 80:20 model. All other elements are also be based on 2021 figures, including the LPT baselines, the equalisation contribution and self-funding of housing and roads from surplus LPT. It is recognised that the yield will change following the revaluation and the matter will be revisited at that point. <\/p>  <p>  My Department last week confirmed provisional LPT allocations to local authorities for 2022 amounting to &euro;528m. These allocations include the Exchequer contribution to equalisation funding of &euro;34.3m. There will be no change to allocations for the 20 local authorities requiring equalisation funding, as their LPT yield is below their funding baseline. When detailed information on the new LPT yield becomes available, my Department will progress work on the planned move to 100% local retention of LPT and the effects on the funding system for local authorities. <\/p>  <p>  As previously, every local authority has the power to vary the basic rate of LPT in their local area by up to 15%; those variation decisions have not yet been made and are not reflected in these allocations. The proposed LPT Amendment Bill referred to above will bring forward the deadline for notifying Revenue of the Local Adjustment Factor (LAF) to 31 August in a revaluation year, such as this year.

The Programme commits to putting affordability at the heart of the housing system through\u00a0the progression of\u00a0State-backed affordable housing.<\/p><p>This commitment\u00a0is reflected in Budget 2021, which provides for an overall investment of &euro;3.3 billion for the delivery of housing programmes.\u00a0 This represents an increase of &euro;641m or 24% on 2020 and the single biggest spend on housing by any Government to fund\u00a0the largest build programme, in the history of the State.<\/p><p>Importantly, &euro;110 million of this amount will be provided to deliver a new national Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme for first time buyers and a new funding model to accelerate the delivery of cost rental homes through the Approved Housing Body sector.<\/p><p>&euro;75 million was allocated for the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme, aimed at first-time buyers buying new-build homes on private land. It will enable first-time buyers to buy a new home at a price they can afford, much sooner than would otherwise have been the case. The equity stake will fill the gap between the mortgage people can get, and the price of a new home. In so doing, it will build confidence in the construction sector to increase housing supply. The proposed price caps for the equity scheme are reflective of the median price of a new home bought by first-time buyers, and are targeted to address the affordability gap in different areas.\u00a0 It is anticipated that the Scheme will be supported and operated in partnership with the retail banks - depending on the final design, this will allow support for approximately 1,500 to 2,000 households to buy new homes in the first year.<\/p><p>The new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) is the first dedicated funding stream for Cost Rental housing in Ireland. CREL will assist Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) in developing or acquiring new homes for Cost Rental, to accelerate implementation of this new housing sector in the immediate term. The scheme harnesses the expertise and capacity of AHBs, amply demonstrated in the provision of social housing, and builds a foundation for further AHB involvement in Cost Rental.<\/p><p>Under the CREL scheme, the Housing Agency will make loans available\u00a0to AHBs on very favourable terms to cover up to 30% of the development or acquisition costs of new homes for Cost Rental. The Budget allocation of &euro;35 million is intended to assist the delivery and tenanting of c. 350 new homes this year, on top of the 50 new Cost Rental apartments scheduled for delivery later this year at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside.<\/p><p>To date, my Department has issued two\u00a0broad-based\u00a0Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) calls for proposals to local authorities. Funding of almost &euro;200 million has been approved in principle in support of 40 infrastructure projects in 14 local authority areas across 9 counties,\u00a0to assist in the delivery of almost 4,200 affordable homes for purchase or for rent.<\/p><p>Details of 35 SSF projects which received approval in principle\u00a0under the two SSF calls to date are available on the Rebuilding Ireland website as follows:<\/p><p>Call 1 www.rebuildingireland.ie\/news\/minister-murphy-gives-the-go-ahead-for-ten-local-authority-sites-for-affordable-housing-under-the-serviced-sites-fund\/  .<\/p><p>Call 2\u00a0www.rebuildingireland.ie\/news\/minister-murphy-approves-funding-of-e84m-to-support-delivery-of-1770-affordable-homes-under-the-ssf\/  .<\/p><p>In addition to these projects, approval in principle has\u00a0also been given to five further applications for SSF funding, namely, Dublin City Council&rsquo;s projects in Emmet Road and Oscar Traynor Road, Fingal County Council&rsquo;s projects in Ballymastone, Donabate, and Hayestown, Rush and Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council&rsquo;s project in Shanganagh.<\/p><p>In making an application for SSF, each local authority must demonstrate that an affordability issue exists in the area in question and that it is viable to deliver homes, for purchase or rent, with a price reduction of at least 10% below open market values.<\/p><p>In addition, the Land Development Agency (LDA) \u00a0is tasked with working with Government Departments, Local Authorities, state agencies, and other stakeholders to assemble strategic sites in urban areas and ensure the sustainable development of social and affordable homes for rent and purchase. On its establishment, the LDA had access to an initial portfolio of 8 sites that have near term delivery potential for approximately 3,400 new homes. Whilst the tenure mix for these homes has not been finalised, the LDA will have regard to Government policy, and all appropriate legislation,\u00a0in considering\u00a0the appropriate tenure mix for developments on public land, as well as the criteria for the operation of cost rental and affordable housing schemes. All these measures are designed to increase housing supply at a time when needed most.<\/p><p>The Government has also approved the drafting of amending provisions to Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, for inclusion in the Affordable Housing Bill 2021 as Committee Stage amendments. This will see an increase in the current 10% social housing requirement related to all new housing developments to a mandatory 20% for social and affordable requirements.<\/p><p>Other affordability measures, such as the Help to Buy Scheme, and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, are also available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable.<\/p><p>The Help to Buy Scheme may return tax paid in the previous four years to eligible first-time buyers, up to a maximum amount of &euro;30,000, for a new home. Information is available online at: www.revenue.ie\/en\/property\/help-to-buy-incentive\/index.aspx  .<\/p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan enables credit worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range. There are no set minimum income limits; however, applicants do need to have sufficient borrowing and repayment capacity and must be capable of repaying the mortgage. Further information on the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is available at   .<\/p><p>Finally, I can confirm the Government&rsquo;s upcoming Housing strategy &lsquo;Housing for All&rsquo; will detail an extensive range of measures and ambitious targets to underpin the delivery of affordable housing over the coming years.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400080#WRM02825","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Heritage Projects","counter":608,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400080#WRM02863"},{"type":"question","counter":609,"qnumday":236,"qnumall":"[34180\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400080#WRM02900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of heritage projects currently in hand or listed for attention in terms of projection and restoration; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":610,"content":"<p>My Department provides financial support for the protection of heritage buildings and historic structures through two grant schemes which are, in the main, administered by the local authorities.

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.<\/p>  <p>  A table setting out the details of the three bands and the limits currently applicable in each local authority area is available on the Department's website at the following link: www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/04c69-social-housing-support-table-of-income-limits\/<\/p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and separately, an allowance of 2.5% for each child.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.<\/p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.

Work on the final design of the Scheme is ongoing, in advance of its introduction later this year.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to affordable housing supports more generally, measures such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, are available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable.<\/p>  <p>  An enhanced Help to Buy scheme was announced as part of the &euro;7 billion July stimulus package, which was extended to December 2021 as part of Budget 2021.

The objective is to ensure long-term strategic housing needs are met. The purpose of the HNDA is to: (1) assist local authorities to develop long-term strategic views of housing need across all tenure, (2) provide a robust evidence base to support decisions about new housing supply, wider investment and housing related services, which inform an overall national housing profile, (3) inform policies about the proportion of social and affordable housing required, and (4) provide evidence to inform policies related to the provision of specialist housing and housing related services. Further information on the HNDA is available online at: <\/p><p>www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/eaa99-housing-need-and-demand-assessment-hnda\/.<\/p><p>The HNDA will inform the provision of housing, including affordable housing, helping to deliver on the Programme for Government commitment to putting affordability at the heart of the housing system, while also recognising that a need for affordable housing exists for people of all ages. Delivery on this commitment is evidenced in the measures contained in the Affordable Housing Bill 2021, currently before the Oireachtas, which provides for three schemes that will increase the supply of affordable homes through (1) affordable homes on local authority lands, (2) the introduction of a new form of tenure in Cost Rental, and (3) a new affordable purchase shared equity scheme.<\/p><p>The delivery of affordable homes on local authority land is supported by the &euro;310 million Serviced Sites Fund (SSF). In making an application for SSF funding, each local authority must demonstrate that an affordability issue exists in the area in question, and that it is viable to deliver homes with a price reduction of at least 10% below open market values, with the reduction remaining as fully-repayable equity charge against the property. The scheme is targeted at first-time buyers, with some limited exceptions as outlined in the Affordable Housing 2021 Bill.<\/p><p>Currently, 40 SSF projects across 14 local authorities have received approval in principle which, cumulatively, will assist in the delivery of just over 4,200 affordable home to buy or rent. My Department continues to actively engage with local authorities to progress both current and potential projects. The first SSF project to deliver affordable homes for purchase will at the Boherboy project in Cork City, and the first SSF project to deliver Cost Rental homes will be at Enniskerry Road in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, both of which will see new homes available later this year.<\/p><p>In addition to the affordable homes to be delivered through the SSF, Budget 2021 allocated &euro;75 million for the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme, which is aimed at first-time buyers buying a new-build home on private land. It will help these first-time buyers secure their own home by bridging the gap, by means of an equity stake, between the mortgage available to them and the price of the home they want. Work on the detailed design of the proposed scheme is ongoing and at an advanced stage.<\/p><p>The Affordable Housing Bill 2021 will also place a new form of tenure in Cost Rental on a statutory basis for the first time. Cost Rental directly links rents to the cost of provision, rather than market dynamics. Three initial Cost Rental projects are already underway at Enniskerry Road in Stepaside, Emmet Road in Inchicore, and Shanganagh in Shankill.<\/p><p>The provision of Cost Rental housing is also being implemented through the new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) scheme, which was allocated &euro;35m in Budget 2021. I approved in principle the financing this year of 390 new homes across eight sites, located in Dublin, the Greater Dublin Area, and Cork. CREL support and careful cost management has generated initial rents which are at least 25% below comparable open market prices, delivering significantly improved affordability for renters.<\/p><p>In addition to the measures in the Affordable Housing Bill 2021, the Land Development Agency (LDA) is tasked to work with Government Departments, local authorities, state agencies and other stakeholders to assemble strategic sites in urban areas and ensure the sustainable development of social and affordable homes for rent and purchase. On establishment, the LDA had access to an initial tranche of 8 sites that have near term delivery potential for approximately 3,400 new homes. In partnership with Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, the LDA has been granted planning permission for the development of 597 homes on a site in Shanganagh, County Dublin. Approximately 34% of the homes will be for social housing, 51% will be cost rental and 15% will be for affordable purchase. Work has commenced on the construction tender process, with construction anticipated to start in the second half of 2021. Information on the work of the LDA is available at: .<\/p><p>Another key priority of Government is to increase social housing stock nationally by more than 50,000 units, with a key emphasis on delivering new build homes. This is complemented by our support of local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) in working in partnership with developers to deliver new social homes through Turnkeys arrangements, which commonly provides a faster delivery of units<\/p><p>Not only will each of the aforementioned measures increase much needed housing supply, they will also help return confidence, and encourage employment, in the construction sector in general.

It will enable first-time buyers to buy a new home, much sooner than would otherwise be the case, by bridging the gap between what people have and the price of the new home they want, while also building confidence in the construction sector to increase much need housing supply.<\/p><p>Extensive engagement has been undertaken with key stakeholders to ensure the optimum design of the Scheme, and significant feedback has been factored in. Work on the final design of the Scheme is ongoing, in advance of its introduction later this year.<\/p><p>In relation to affordable housing supports more generally, measures such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, are available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable.<\/p><p>An enhanced Help to Buy scheme was announced as part of the &euro;7 billion July stimulus package, which was extended to December 2021 as part of Budget 2021. This allows first-time buyers purchasing a newly-built home &ndash; or building one themselves &ndash; to claim back up to &euro;30,000 paid in income tax and DIRT on bank deposit interest over the last four years. <\/p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is a Government-backed mortgage which is for first-time-buyers nationwide to purchase a new or second-hand home or to self-build. This scheme offers loans on competitive terms to those who are unable to secure a sufficient commercial bank loan. <\/p><p>As part of Budget 2019, &euro;310 million was made available to service local authority land for the delivery of affordable housing under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF). The SSF provides for key enabling infrastructure requirements that will help unlock publicly-owned lands specifically for the provision of affordable homes to buy or rent. This fund sub-vents the cost of facilitating infrastructure, with a current maximum SSF funding amount of &euro;50,000 available per affordable home. This sum is comprised of &euro;44,500 (or 89%) Exchequer contribution and a &euro;5,500 (or 11%) local authority contribution.\u00a0 On this basis, at least 6,200 more affordable homes, to buy or rent, can be facilitated by this measure.\u00a0<\/p><p>To date, funding support of &euro;200 million has been allocated to enable delivery of over 4,200 affordable homes for purchase or rent. &euro;50 million has been allocated to the SSF in 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400080#WRM04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"question","counter":639,"qnumday":248,"qnumall":"[34192\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400081#WRN00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will encourage local authorities to give favourable consideration to planning applications from the indigenous population throughout Ireland in circumstances in which they can meet their own housing needs through their own resources thus alleviating the burden on the already stretched construction sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":640,"content":"<p>I am assuming that the question relates to the provision of rural housing for people native to rural areas and that is the basis of my reply. <\/p>  <p>  Since 2018, the National Planning Framework (NPF) is the national planning policy document providing overall strategic policy for the future development of Ireland through specific National Policy Objectives (NPOs) that aim to support the overall rural and small town pattern of development in Ireland and deliver strengthened and diversified rural communities.<\/p>  <p>  Importantly, NPO 19 of the NPF aims to ensure that a policy distinction is made between areas experiencing significant overspill development pressure from urban areas, particularly within the commuter catchment of cities, towns and centres of employment, on the one hand, and other remoter and weaker rural areas where population levels may be low and or declining, on the other.  NPO 19 is also aligned with the established approach whereby considerations of social (intrinsic part of the community) or economic (persons working full or part time) need may be applied by planning authorities in rural areas under urban influence.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Rural Housing 2005, which were issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 as amended, planning authorities are required to frame the planning policies in their development plans in a balanced and measured way that ensures the housing needs of rural communities are met, while avoiding excessive urban-generated housing.  The Guidelines are available on the Government&rsquo;s website at the following link: www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/23809-sustainable-rural-housing-development-guidelines\/.  <\/p>  <p>  Updated Rural Housing Planning Guidelines are currently being prepared that will continue to allow for the development of homes in rural areas while also highlighting the need to manage certain areas around cities and towns in order to avoid over-development of those areas. I expect to receive an initial draft guidelines document in the coming weeks.  Given the complexity of the issues involved, the need for environmental assessment and both internal and external consultation, I expect final updated guidelines to be available later in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  In the interim, the NPF objectives together with the 2005 Guidelines, enable planning authorities to continue to draft and adopt county development plan policies for one-off housing in rural areas.  My Department communicated to planning authorities (Circular letter PL 2\/2017) on 31 May 2017, advising them that the existing 2005 Guidelines remain in place until advised otherwise by the Department.  <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the granting of permissions by local authorities, in making a decision in respect of an application for planning permission, planning authorities (and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in relation to planning appeals) are required to consider such applications in the context of the relevant Development Plan, or Local Area Plan where one exists for the area, as well as any relevant Ministerial Guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  It is noteworthy that there has been strong delivery of new homes in rural areas nationally in recent years &ndash; with more than 25,000 rural house planning permissions granted in last 5 years.  In the same period, more than 90% of that number of rural homes were built, comprising around one in three out of all houses completed in Ireland between 2016 and 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, it is unlikely that the construction of rural housing as opposed to scheme housing or apartments would have any alleviating impact on the construction sector.  There are diseconomies including supply chain and transaction costs associated with developing housing on multiple dispersed sites in comparison to larger-scale projects on a single site.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400081#WRN00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"question","counter":642,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[34193\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400081#WRN00600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the amount of public lands available throughout County Kildare for the provision of affordable or local authority housing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":643,"content":"<p>The Land Development Agency (LDA) is currently developing a register of all relevant public lands, which is lands owned by public bodies in population areas greater than 10,000.

Ireland is playing, and will continue to play, a full and active part in these engagements.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Protocol on Ireland \/ Northern Ireland specifically &ndash; itself a special effort to resolve issues arising from Brexit for the island of Ireland &ndash; Ireland attends and contributes to the meetings of the Joint and Specialised Committees seeking to resolve the various outstanding issues. <\/p>  <p>  Some have sought to characterise the Protocol as the problem. However it is clear that Brexit itself is the problem, and the Protocol is the agreed joint solution to address the challenges caused by Brexit for the island of Ireland. It is the result of a painstaking process which took more than four years. The Protocol prevents a hard border on this island, secures the gains of the Good Friday Agreement, and protects the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place within it.<\/p>  <p>  As a jointly negotiated agreement, the Protocol now needs to be jointly implemented in good faith. Earlier this month, the Joint Committee met to take stock of progress and to give consideration to the identified issues of concern. EU and UK officials continue to work intensively on developing solutions to these outstanding issues. Ireland supports and encourages these efforts.<\/p>  <p>  Working together like this is the only path to sustainable solutions. Unilateral actions on sensitive issues in Northern Ireland never work. UK unilateral actions taken to date have damaged trust. In that regard I am encouraged by the decision of the UK Government to seek EU agreement on extending the grace period on chilled meat products. <\/p>  <p>  We want to see positive momentum in the EU-UK relationship. We will continue to advocate so that the negative impact of Brexit on the people of Northern Ireland is minimised. This has always been the aim of the Protocol: to minimise the disruption which Brexit was inevitably going to cause for the island of Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The Government remains firmly engaged on Brexit-related political and economic developments. Ireland has played, and will continue to play a full and committed role on Brexit issues through the structures of the agreements, as well as through direct interactions with stakeholders and counterparts in Northern Ireland, Great Britain, the European Union and beyond. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the trading and commercial implications of Brexit for Northern Ireland &ndash; it has always been clear that Brexit had the potential to be profoundly disruptive for Northern Ireland.  We are listening carefully to genuine concerns and are committed to supporting engagement between the UK and EU to address outstanding issues appropriately within the framework of the Protocol. We are also highlighting the significant potential opportunities for Northern Ireland through the Protocol, with open access to the rest of the UK internal market and to the entire EU Single Market of more than 450 million people - a unique benefit for Northern Ireland in seeking more foreign direct investment.<\/p>  <p>  There are also of course options to reduce the burden on businesses. An SPS agreement, even on a temporary basis, would offer a clear win and has broad support in Northern Ireland from right across society. This could reduce the level of checks on agri-food products travelling from GB to NI by up to 80% - this is a prize worth fighting for. People right across the political, business, retail, and farming sectors in Northern Ireland have made clear that they favour such an agreement. The EU Commission has said it could be put in place within weeks. Reaching such an agreement would be a simple, concrete and popular step, which we strongly support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400081#WRN03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland","counter":672,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400081#WRN03400"},{"type":"question","counter":673,"qnumday":262,"qnumall":"[27648\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400081#WRN03500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"when he will continue his engagement with the new leaders of the two major Unionist parties in Northern Ireland.","asker":"1473","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":674,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach and I continue to engage with all the parties in Northern Ireland, including the DUP and UUP.\u00a0<\/p><p>We have of course seen some dramatic political developments over the last few days in Northern Ireland.\u00a0 I wish Edwin Poots well on a personal level following his announcement that he has stepped down as party leader, and I have congratulated Sir Jeffrey Donaldson as the new leader of the DUP.

Ireland fully supports the Council Conclusions on Hong Kong adopted by the EU last July, which set out a coordinated response package of measures in various fields including the operation of Member States' extradition agreements and other relevant agreements with Hong Kong. In line with these Conclusions, on 13 October 2020, the Government agreed to suspend Ireland&rsquo;s Extradition Agreement with Hong Kong. I also raised the matter of Hong Kong in my recent meeting with the Chinese Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, on 30 May.<\/p>  <p>  The EU has also issued a number of statements in response to this situation. Most recently the High Representative and Vice President issued a statement on 9 June which stated that the EU will continue to pay increased attention to the situation in Hong Kong as part of the overall relations between the European Union and China. Prior to this, EU Member States issued a statement on 11 March which highlights our regret that the fundamental freedoms, democratic principles, and political pluralism that are central to Hong Kong's identity and prosperity are under increasing pressure by authorities. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, the EU has raised its concerns regarding the situation with Chinese authorities on a number of occasions, including directly during the most recent EU-China Summit and EU-China Leaders' Meetings, and in multilateral fora such as the Human Rights Council. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has strongly condemned the coup carried out by the Myanmar military and its use of violence against civilians. The coup is a reversal of the progress made towards democracy and rule of law in Myanmar that has taken years to establish, and does nothing to tackle the public health, security or economic issues faced by the people of Myanmar. I have called upon the Myanmar military to demonstrate restraint; respect human rights and the rule of law; immediately release political detainees; and restore legitimate civilian government.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland remains active on this issue within the UN Security Council. The Council has expressed deep concerns regarding developments in Myanmar, has strongly condemned the use of violence by the military and has called for the release of all those detained.

The ICC does not substitute for national judicial systems. States bear the primary responsibility to investigate the most serious international crimes.

Along with our EU and like-minded international partners, we will continue to ensure that international attention remains focused on the appalling human rights situation in Belarus.<\/p>  <p>  Despite repeated calls from the international community, the Belarusian authorities have shown no willingness to investigate violations of human rights in their own country and have permitted the security forces to act with impunity. Ireland and the EU have been clear that impunity breeds violence and we have taken a number of concrete steps to bring international accountability.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has made our deep concern at the situation in Belarus clear in UN Security Council discussions on the matter. Ireland worked constructively to ensure the successful adoption of an EU-led resolution at the Human Rights Council that expanded the mandate of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to investigate the over two thousand reported cases of human rights violations in Belarus. The High Commissioner&rsquo;s team have begun their work, which will be complemented by the NGO-led International Accountability Platform for Belarus and investigations in EU Member States under the concept of Universal Jurisdiction.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  We regret that the Belarusian authorities continue to deny the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Belarus access to the country in her official capacity. Until she is given the opportunity to complete her important work, we will continue to support the renewal of her mandate, including during the ongoing forty-seventh session of the Human Rights Council. We will also continue to call on the regime to implement the recommendations of OSCE expert investigator, Professor Wolfgang Benedek, which are outlined in his November 2020 Moscow Mechanism Report.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Sanctions also play a role in bringing international accountability and as a signal of solidarity with the Belarusian people. I and my fellow EU foreign ministers agreed a fourth package of targeted sanctions during the 21 June Foreign Affairs Council, bringing the total number of those sanctioned to one hundred and sixty-six individuals, including Lukashenko himself, and fifteen economic entities. Those targeted include those responsible for the ongoing repression, the coercive forced landing of the Ryanair aircraft on 23 May, the falsification of the August 2020 Presidential election result in Belarus, and those supporting or profiting from the Lukashenko regime.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The EU is working on operationalising carefully calibrated economic sanctions that target the wallets of the regime. This is one of the concrete measures agreed by EU leaders at the European Council on 24 May, in response to the flagrant disregard for international law and human rights shown by the Belarusian authorities.

Member States have also coordinated on efforts taken at national level to provide support. For our part, Ireland contributed national funds to two projects through the European Endowment for Democracy that seek to protect the human rights and media freedoms of the Belarusian people. In a further signal of support, on 28 May the EU Commission announced a &euro;3 billion economic support package for a future democratic Belarus.<\/p>  <p>  Our focus remains on pressing the Lukashenko regime to respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the Belarusian people, to adhere to their international commitments, and to engage in a meaningful national dialogue that leads to fresh elections that are free and fair.

There were concerns about issuing guidelines in the current Covid context where the safe and sustainable reopening of schools remains the overriding priority for all stakeholders. <\/p><p>It is\u00a0my Department&rsquo;s intention to issue Guidelines to schools on the use of reduced timetables for the next school year.<\/p><p>It is intended that the guidelines will include measures by which schools will be required to report on the use of reduced timetables. <\/p><p>Until such time as this reporting mechanism is in place, data is not available as to the number of pupils who are currently on reduced timetables.<\/p><p>In relation to the number of appeals taken under Section 29 of the Education Act against suspension or refusal to enrol pupils with special educational needs, Section 7 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018\u00a0came into operation on the 12 November 2020 and\u00a0provided for the replacement of the existing Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 with a series of new sections numbered 29 to 29F. <\/p><p>These new appeal provisions in sections 29 to 29F are designed to work alongside the wider admissions framework in the 2018 Act. In accordance with\u00a0section 29B of the Education Act, 1998,\u00a0the Minister also developed\u00a0procedures for appeals which apply to all appeals\u00a0submitted from 12 November 2020 onwards.<\/p><p>Since the commencement of the new arrangements for appeals on the 12 November 2020 to date,\u00a0a total of 95\u00a0appeals have been\u00a0taken under section 29 of the Education Act 2018\u00a0where the applicant has indicated that the\u00a0child has\u00a0special educational needs.\u00a0This represents 29% of all appeals in the same period.<\/p><p>Prior to 12 November\u00a0only data in relation to total numbers of appeals per\u00a0appeal type was recorded and therefore\u00a0the Department\u00a0cannot provide data in relation to the numbers of appeals which related to children with special educational needs for previous years.\u00a0<\/p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act 2018 allows for appeals against\u00a0the decision of a Board of Management of a school to suspend or permanently exclude a student. The decision of the independent appeals committee in such appeals may only be challenged by way of a Judicial Review. It is open to either party to an appeal to seek a Judicial Review.<\/p><p>My Department has recorded the following number of Judicial Reviews\u00a0of\u00a0section 29\u00a0appeal decisions in\u00a0suspension and expulsion cases involving children with special educational needs in the last 3 years and to date in 2021:<\/p><p>2021 - 1 expulsion case<\/p><p>2020 &ndash; 2 expulsion cases<\/p><p>2019 - 3 expulsion cases and 1 suspension case<\/p><p>2018 &ndash; 0 cases<\/p><p>In relation to the number of pupils with special educational needs who may be currently on suspension, expulsion, or out of school, and for whom Section 29 cases may not have been brought forward, I wish to advise the Deputy that in accordance with the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 schools are obliged to report on school attendance, and data on non-attendance in primary and post-primary schools at the aggregated level are collected by Tusla through the Annual Attendance Report (AAR) and, also at the student level through the Student Attendance Report (SAR). <\/p><p>This latest report published presents data for the academic year 2017\/18 and is available on Tusla&rsquo;s website at <\/p><p><i> <\/i><\/p><p>As the information requested is collected and recorded by Tusla, I have referred this part of the\u00a0question to that agency, for their attention and direct reply to the\u00a0Deputy.\u00a0<\/p><p>Finally, in respect of children with special educational needs who may not be suspended or expelled, but who may be without a school placement, I can advise that ensuring that every child has a suitable school placement is a key objective of\u00a0my Department.\u00a0 Significant resources are allocated each year to ensure that appropriate supports are available\u00a0for children with special educational needs.<\/p><p>It is the policy of my\u00a0Department that all children with Special Educational Needs can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. <\/p><p>Such placements facilitate access to individualised education programmes which may draw from a range of appropriate educational interventions, delivered by fully qualified professional teachers, with the support of Special Needs Assistants and the appropriate school curriculum. <\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s policy focuses on ensuring that all students with special educational needs can have access to an education appropriate to meeting their needs and abilities.<\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of Special Needs Organisers (SENOs), for the development and delivery and co-ordination of education services to children with Special Educational Needs, including the establishment of special class and special school placements.\u00a0<\/p><p>In circumstances, where the NCSE confirms that no placement is available for a child with special educational needs, my Department can provide Home Tuition grant funding towards the provision of 20 hours home tuition per week as an interim measure until the NCSE confirms that a placement is available. <\/p><p>It is important to note that Home tuition funding is not an alternative to a school placement, by its nature it is intended to be a short term intervention. <\/p><p>For this reason home tuition will not be available where a school placement has been identified by the\u00a0NCSE. \u00a0<\/p><p>Similarly, failure to enrol a child in school will not give rise to eligibility under this scheme.<\/p><p>I\u00a0have no plans to change this approach.<\/p><p>Where the NCSE have identified an available school placement for a child,\u00a0the local SENO will continue to be available to engage with\u00a0the family and the\u00a0school concerned to ensure that the child's needs are addressed.<\/p><p>The total number of children with special educational needs who are being supported by the Home Tuition scheme on the grounds that they do not currently have a school placement, or an early intervention class placement, is 732. <table>    <tr>       <th>-<\/th>

As is specified in the 2012 Act, the amount of &euro;110m, plus interest of &euro;1.38m, was made available to Caranua, and held in a Statutory Fund managed by the NTMA.<\/p><p>To be eligible to apply to Caranua, applicants had to have been in receipt of an award of redress from the Residential Institutions Redress Scheme, or to have qualified for such an award had they not already received similar awards or settlements in court proceedings.<\/p><p>Given the finite nature of the funding available, Caranua announced in May 2018 that it would cease to accept applications from 1 August 2018. After that date, it mainly focussed on processing <\/p><p>applications on hand. It also undertook targeted outreach to certain groups, including survivors who were in prison.<\/p><p>As part of this process, Caranua engaged extensively with applicants who had not completed the application process, and established person-centred timelines for the provision of supporting documentation which would enable their applications to be progressed before Caranua was required to wind-down its operations. As the Deputy will appreciate, given the impending exhaustion of the funding available to it Caranua was not in a position to allow applications to remain open indefinitely. <\/p><p>Caranua finalised all outstanding applications and made all final payments in early December 2020, with the exception of a very limited number of cases which were referred back to Caranua on appeal, or where it had agreed to make staggered payments.<\/p><p>The specific details on applications requested by the Deputy are set out in the table below. These are, in the main, drawn from information published on Caranua&rsquo;s website, <i>www.caranua.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Number of applications approved and paid<\/th>       <th>57,161<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Average payment<\/td>       <td>Approximately   &euro;1,700<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of in   progress applications<\/td>       <td>Nil<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of ineligible applications*<\/td>       <td>5,009<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of  applications appealed<\/td>       <td>761<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of applications awaiting probate<\/td>       <td>Nil<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of  applications withdrawn<\/td>       <td>3,062<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>Overall, Caranua received over 62,000 applications for funding supports from over 6,000 eligible survivors. Caranua made over 57,000 payments to survivors, totalling almost &euro;98 million, and each applicant received an average of over &euro;15,000 in supports. It is not possible to give an exact figure for the number of ineligible applications, but 3,062 applications were withdrawn, while a further 1,947 applications were not approved by Caranua, a total of 5,009 applications. In addition, approximately 200 individuals who applied to Caranua were determined to be ineligible for support. <\/p><p>With regard to appeals, section 22 of the 2012 Act provides that a decision by Caranua to not approve an application could be appealed to an Independent Appeals Officer. In total of 761 appeals were submitted to the Independent Appeals Officer. All outstanding appeals were finalised by the Independent Appeals Officer in February 2021.<\/p><p>With regard to administrative costs, the 2012 Act provided that all expenditure arising from Caranua&rsquo;s operations must be met from the funding held in the Statutory Fund. There is no provision in the Act for Exchequer funding to be utilised to fund either supports for survivors, or the administrative costs arising. <\/p><p>Caranua&rsquo;s audited financial statements to the end of 2020 show payments to survivors of approximately &euro;97.8 million, while overall administrative costs had come to approximately &euro;13.5 million. This compares favourably with comparable organisations such as Northern Ireland&rsquo;s Victims and Survivors Service, which provides funding supports to those effected by the Troubles. <\/p><p>With regard to other supports available to survivors, the National Counselling Service, run by the HSE, is a free nationwide service, which provides face-to-face, phone, and video counselling. It provides a specific, trauma-informed, service for adults who experienced childhood abuse and neglect. This service is available to all survivors of institutional abuse.<\/p><p>Since 2019, the Department has engaged extensively with former residents in a Consultation Forum facilitated by external facilitators. This process led to the publication in August 2019 of &ldquo;Consultations with Survivors of Institutional Abuse on Themes and Issues to be addressed by a Survivor Led Consultation Group&rdquo; and a further phase of consultations which are ongoing. <\/p><p>The meetings are facilitated by professionally qualified facilitators who are funded by my Department. Matters relating to survivors of institutional abuse identified by survivors, and which are set out in the August 2019 report, continue to be discussed by the Group. I met with the Group in December 2020 to hear about the various issues which had been identified by the Group. <\/p><p>It is expected this consultation process will be concluded shortly.  Their findings will be further considered by the inter-departmental group and their conclusions will inform the consideration of proposals to Government in this context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400085#WRR01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":827,"content":"<p>Question No. 315 answered with Question No. 314.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":828,"content":"<p>Question No. 316 answered with Question No. 314.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","counter":830,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400085#WRR02200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Schemes","counter":829,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400085#WRR02100"},{"type":"question","counter":830,"qnumday":317,"qnumall":"[33980\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400085#WRR02200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated cost of providing the WALK PEER employment support service model in all 26 counties.","asker":"1467","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":831,"content":"<p>The Ability Programme is a pre-activation programme for young people with disabilities.

To support this, referrals to CE schemes will increase further\u00a0as\u00a0the economy continues to open up.<\/p><p>CE sponsoring authorities are also encouraged by my Department\u00a0to continue to promote\u00a0the benefits of CE in their local communities.  They can advertise their vacancies on\u00a0<i>www.jobsireland.ie<\/i>, the Department&rsquo;s online job advertising and recruitment service for job candidates and employers, including CE sponsors.<\/p><p>Jobseekers are advised to\u00a0register their interest through this website or by contacting a case officer in their local Intreo Centre who will determine their eligibility for the CE scheme.  The facility to register interest in CE schemes was introduced on the website in August 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p><p>It is important to note that there are currently 19,398 participants on CE and 42% of these CE participants are 55 years of age and over. Placements on CE are temporary and are subject to time limits to safeguard the availability of opportunities for employment on\u00a0CE schemes for other candidates. My Department supports the provision of public employment services with a priority on activation\u00a0and the progression of participants on\u00a0CE from the\u00a0Live Register into full-time employment.<\/p><p>I will continue to support and improve the programme for the benefit of the CE participants and the valuable contribution being made to\u00a0local communities through the provision of services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400085#WRR03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1563"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Support Services","counter":841,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400085#WRR03300"},{"type":"question","counter":842,"qnumday":321,"qnumall":"[34072\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400085#WRR03400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of persons employed in the local employment service and job clubs.","asker":"1604","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":843,"content":"<p>For 2021, my Department contracted for the provision of Local Employment Services with 22 different contractors.<\/p><p>These contractors employ approximately\u00a0307 full time equivalent posts\u00a0to deliver the service.<\/p><p>My Department has also contracted for the provision of Jobs Clubs with 37 different contractors <\/p><p>These contractors employ 81 full-time equivalent posts to deliver the service.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400085#WRR03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rental Sector","counter":844,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400085#WRR03600"},{"type":"question","counter":845,"qnumday":322,"qnumall":"[34076\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400085#WRR03700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of applications received for rent supplement in 2018, 2019, 2020 and to date in 2021; the corresponding number approved and rejected for each year; the number of these applications approved on the grounds of domestic abuse; the cost of paying rent supplement in each of the years 2018 to 2020 and to date in 2021; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":846,"content":"<p>Rent supplement continues to play a key role in supporting families and individuals in private rented accommodation, with the scheme supporting 18,851 active recipients\u00a0at the end of\u00a0May 2021.<\/p><p>The scheme provides short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.

Recruitment to the scheme in the scheme was severely affected by Covid-19 from 2020, with fewer hosts advertising vacancies due to impact of COVID-19 public health restrictions on business operations and employment.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  An internal review of the first year of the YESS programme, from October 2018 to October 2019,\u00a0 is underway.\u00a0 The report of this review has not been finalised due to demands of other work on foot of the pandemic.\u00a0 It is intended that once the new work placement programme commences in line with the Economic Recovery Plan, a full review and evaluation of YESS will be undertaken and made available.\u00a0 It is anticipated that this will be finalised over the coming months.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400087#WRT00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Rates","counter":906,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400087#WRT00800"},{"type":"question","counter":907,"qnumday":342,"qnumall":"[34112\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400087#WRT00900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated cost of a &euro;1 increase in each of the social insurance schemes, social assistance schemes, other weekly schemes and other schemes payments in tabular form (details supplied).","asker":"1577","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":908,"content":"<p>The\u00a0estimated cost of increasing each weekly social welfare\u00a0payment by &euro;1 is shown in the table below.\u00a0<\/p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Payment<\/th>       <th>Personal &euro;m<\/th>       <th>Qualified Adult &euro;m<\/th>       <th>Total &euro;m<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Social Insurance Schemes<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>State Pension (Contributory)<\/td>       <td>&euro;

In relation to other supports the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) provides financial support to full- and part-time students who are experiencing financial difficulties while attending higher education. Under the Fund, financial support can be provided to assist students who are unable to meet costs associated with day-to-day participation in higher education, including a number of categories such as books and other class material, rent, heating and lighting bills and other utility bills, essential travel, childcare costs etc. In response to the Covid19 pandemic, the SAF allocation for the 2020\/21 academic year was doubled from &euro;8.1 million to &euro;16.2 million. Since 2017, an additional &euro;1 million per year has been allocated to the SAF with HEIs asked to prioritise and ring-fence this element of funding for the support of part-time students who are lone parents or members of the other access target groups identified in the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education. An additional &euro;1 million was added to the fund in 2018 for students attending Professional Masters of Education (PME) courses, who are experiencing financial difficulty. This additional funding was also made available for the 2019\/20 year and again in 2020\/21. In relation to other supports tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States.

This approach for on-site activity is consistent with small group learning across further, higher and adult education. To enable this to happen, all existing restrictions and public health guidance with appropriate protective measures and limited congregation will be followed supported by reopening protocols and an adaptation framework that are aligned with public health guidelines to facilitate and ensure the safe return to classroom activity for this cohort of students. The Working Group has worked collaboratively to develop these sectoral reopening protocols and supporting materials and this work is now nearing finalisation.<\/p>  <p>  This approach notes the sector is much reduced with estimates placing student numbers at less than 10,000 currently in the State in comparison to pre-pandemic levels where the sector has capacity to facilitate approximately 200,000 foreign learners annually.

As the Deputy is aware the prisoner complaints system was introduced by the Irish Prison Service in November 2012, based on a model recommended by the then-Inspector of Prisons.  <\/p><p>All prisoners have the right to make a complaint at any time and are treated with the utmost seriousness. The current system categorises complaints according to their nature and seriousness, ranging from the most serious 'Category A' through to a 'Category F' complaint. <\/p><p>The most serious &quot;Category A&quot; complaints are those alleging assault or use of excessive force against a prisoner, ill treatment, racial abuse, discrimination, intimidation, threats or anyother conduct against a prisoner of a nature and gravity likely to bring discredit on the Prison Service. Category A complaints are independently investigated by persons outside the Prison Service. Category B complaints are serious level complaints, which may include verbal abuse, inappropriate searches or any conduct against a prisoner of a nature likely to bring discredit onthe Prison Service. Category C may include complaints about visits, phone calls, reception issues. Category D complaints can be made against professionals which include medical personnel and solicitors. Category E can be made by visitors to the prison.<\/p><p>Work is continuing on the completion of the necessary actions to introduce the new Prisoner Complaints System. This includes the drafting of the Statutory Instrument and the roll out of necessary training for Irish Prison Service staff. There is currently no mechanism in place to appeal an outcome of a complaint but this facility will be available for prisoners in the new complaints process. Unfortunately, it is the case that the impact of the Level 5 Covid-19 restrictions have delayed the completion of this work. My Officials continue to engage with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel with a view to completing work on the Statutory Instrument which will give legal effect to the new Prisoner Complaints System. <\/p><p>The Dochas Centre has a bed capacity of 146 female prisoners.

The HRB invests in data, research and evidence to deliver on the complementary objectives of improving people&rsquo;s health, delivering significant transformation in health policy and practice and supporting economic and social development. The focus of HRB investment is on patient oriented and clinical research, population health sciences, and health services research.<\/p><p>Health research is key to achieving the objectives of the health system. It delivers knowledge, insights and evidence to address key challenges in our society. It can be used to improve the quality and efficiency of our health services and enhance the quality of life of people throughout our society. Research enables us to develop more effective preventative strategies, better health care practices and treatments, improved models of care and more efficient ways to use human, infrastructural and financial resources.<\/p><p>The details provided below relate to HRB returns to DBEI (Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation) in respect of HRB expenditure (revenue and capital) for the above activities in 2019 and 2020, in line with the HRB Strategy 2016-2020. The breakdown below includes investment categorised in the report as &ldquo;health services&rdquo; and &ldquo;other&rdquo;. The &ldquo;health services&rdquo; figure relates to support for R&amp;amp;D which takes places in Irish higher education institutions, hospitals and other research performing organisations in Ireland. The smaller &ldquo;other&rdquo; figure relates to expenditure towards a number of EU Joint programmes. The expenditure is broken down based on the focus and enabler areas set out in the HRB Strategy (2016-2020).<\/p><p><i>Note<\/i>: The total figure for 2020 below is larger than that estimated at time of submission to DBEI (by approx. &euro;1.35M) as this reflects actual expenditure at end 2020 and includes additional investment by the HRB in support of the Government&rsquo;s response to COVID-19. The Covid-19 pandemic presented a unique set of challenges to our health system, society, and economy, and required a multifaceted and agile response and the capacity to make well informed decisions in real time. The HRB responded by redirecting available funding to COVID-19 priorities and by taking on a number of additional tasks. Examples include: <\/p><p>- the provision of evidence reviews to inform public policy responses nationally and globally; <\/p><p>- funding of research projects into medical, social and policy countermeasures, health service readiness, and patient safety projects, aligned with the WHO R&amp;amp;D Roadmap;<\/p><p>- enabling Ireland&rsquo;s participation in multinational clinical trials to evaluate potential treatments such as the WHO SOLIDARITY Trial; <\/p><p>- working with the Department and CSO to facilitate access to the CSO Covid-19 data hub for research purposes; and <\/p><p>- establishing a national Covid-19 research ethics committee on behalf of the Minister to expedite ethics reviews of Covid-19-related research projects.<\/p><p>The HRB continues to support the national and global response to COVID-19 and further details of the HRB current and planned activities can be found in the HRB Strategy (2021-2025), <i>Health research - making an impact<\/i>, which I launched earlier this (www.hrb.ie\/strategy-2025).<\/p><p><b>Focus Area 1: Address major health challenges (Innovative, investigator-led and internationally competitive research to address major health challenges in society<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th><\/th>       <th>2019 <\/th>       <th>2020 <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Health Research Charities Ireland (HRCI) contribution <\/td>       <td>- <\/td>       <td>297,482 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Medical Research Charities Group\/HRB Joint funding scheme <\/td>       <td>1,006,393 <\/td>       <td>354,263 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>HRB Health Research Awards <\/td>       <td>2,463,722 <\/td>       <td>472,254 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Investigator Led Projects <\/td>       <td>4,876,649 <\/td>       <td>2,055,843 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>SFI-HRB-Wellcome Research Partnership <\/td>       <td>1,615,569 <\/td>       <td>1,737,954 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>US Ireland Research &amp;amp;

Significant progress has been made on the capital project, with planning permission for the hospital secured in 2017 and, in 2018, the awarding of contract for substantial enabling works. <\/p>  <p>  The ownership and governance arrangements are more complex. The proposed corporate and clinical governance arrangements for the new NMH at Elm Park were set out in the Mulvey Agreement, which was finalised in 2016 following an extensive mediation process between the NMH and the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group, published thereafter and noted by Government in 2017. The Mulvey Agreement provides for the establishment of a new company - National Maternity Hospital at Elm Park DAC - which will have clinical and operational, as well as financial and budgetary, independence in the provision of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services.<\/p>  <p>  The draft legal framework subsequently developed is designed to copperfasten these arrangements. It provides that the new hospital remains in State ownership and that thus, the State&rsquo;s significant investment will be protected.  The clear legal advice provided to the State is that the draft legal framework ensures that all legally permissible medical services will be provided in the new hospital. The Sisters of Charity will not play any role in the governance or operation of the new NMH. In May 2017, the Sisters announced their decision to end their involvement and transfer their shareholding in SVHG to a new charitable entity, St Vincent&rsquo;s Holdings CLG.<\/p>  <p>  We will continue to examine all options carefully as we move forward towards finalisation of the arrangements. I have been very clear that I will not bring anything to Government unless it provides assurances around all legally permissible services being provided in the new NMH. In addition, the safeguarding of the State&rsquo;s investment must also be put beyond doubt.<\/p>  <p>  In that context, I intend to engage further with both St Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group and the Religious Sisters of Charity over the coming days and weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400092#WRY03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Practitioner Services","counter":1167,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400092#WRY03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1168,"qnumday":426,"qnumall":"[26347\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400092#WRY03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will address a matter (details supplied) regarding general practitioners charging to take blood; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1169,"content":"<p>There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition.\u00a0This has been advised to GPs by the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of GPs charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services is complex given the numerous reasons and circumstances under which blood tests are taken.

Since 01 January 2017, responsibility for this scheme, and the disbursement of funds from this scheme, are the responsibility of the HSE and the Department of Health no longer has direct involvement in this scheme. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year<\/th>       <th>NGO's<\/th>       <th>Voluntary Organisations<\/th>       <th>Total<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2000<\/td>       <td>454,566.24<\/td>       <td>2,640,000.00<\/td>       <td>3,094,566.24<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2001<\/td>       <td>774,540.23<\/td>       <td>2,732,000.00<\/td>       <td>3,506,540.23<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2002<\/td>       <td>818,000.00<\/td>       <td>3,476,000.00<\/td>       <td>4,294,000.00<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2003<\/td>       <td>860,439.31<\/td>       <td>3,533,000.00<\/td>       <td>4,393,439.31<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2004<\/td>       <td>978,000.00<\/td>       <td>3,631,000.00<\/td>       <td>4,609,000.00<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2005<\/td>       <td>1,940,929.64<\/td>       <td>3,609,765.00<\/td>       <td>5,550,694.64<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2006<\/td>       <td>1,505,000.00<\/td>       <td>3,815,000.00<\/td>       <td>5,320,000.00<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2007<\/td>       <td>2,006,706.14<\/td>       <td>3,903,000.00<\/td>       <td>5,909,706.14<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2008<\/td>       <td>2,229,651.12<\/td>       <td>3,985,000.00<\/td>       <td>6,214,651.12<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2009<\/td>       <td>2,123,331.93<\/td>       <td>3,985,000.00<\/td>       <td>6,108,331.93<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2010<\/td>       <td>2,125,450.95<\/td>       <td>3,785,999.00<\/td>       <td>5,911,449.95<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2011<\/td>       <td>1,825,794.00<\/td>       <td>3,286,000.00<\/td>       <td>5,111,794.00<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2012<\/td>       <td>1,542,444.55<\/td>       <td>3,286,000.00<\/td>       <td>4,828,444.55<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2013<\/td>       <td>1,585,958.34<\/td>       <td>3,286,000.00<\/td>       <td>4,871,958.34<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2014<\/td>       <td>1,447,309.11<\/td>       <td>3,286,000.00<\/td>       <td>4,733,309.11<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2015<\/td>       <td>1,517,310.76<\/td>       <td>3,286,000.00<\/td>       <td>4,803,310.76<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2016<\/td>       <td>1,488,425.00<\/td>       <td>3,285,659.00<\/td>       <td>4,774,084.00<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2017<\/td>       <td>1,683,350.00<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>1,683,350.00<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2018<\/td>       <td>2,126,000.00<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>2,126,000.00<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019<\/td>       <td>2,283,348.92<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>2,283,348.92<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020<\/td>       <td>2,852,517.21<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>2,852,517.21<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total<\/td>       <td>34,169,073.45<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400095#WRBB02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":1292,"qnumday":471,"qnumall":"[26658\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021062400095#WRBB03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the funding allocated to each NGO and charity in each of the years 2010 to 2020 by his Department.","asker":"1504","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1293,"content":"<p>Document 26658-21 contains details of funding provided to NGOs from 2010 to 2020.<\/p><p>The remaining documents detail payments made under the National Lottery scheme to voluntary bodies, including charities from 2010 to 2016.

However, what is important is what sites are screened in and what sites are screened out.  Some projects may have many sites within 15 kilometres but the screening rules for the qualifying interests of those sites allows for those sites to be screened out and barring any other issue the file can be approved without an appropriate assessment.  Most European sites within 15 kilometres of a forestry project are screened out due to the screening rules that apply.  It is therefore not the buffer distance of 15 kilometres that screens sites in, it is the screening rules. <\/p>  <p>  A significant amount of sites are screened in, not because of the 15 kilometre buffer but because of the compliance with European and National Case law in relation to the consideration of mitigation at screening stage.
