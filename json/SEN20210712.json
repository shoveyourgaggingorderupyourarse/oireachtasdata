Education is of critical importance to children and young people but education is about more than just schooling, as many perceive it to mean.  Education is a foundation for healthy development throughout one's lifespan.  It means the freedom to think, create, play and imagine.  It is learning about difference and diversity, and recognising the value of the contribution made by each and everybody.<\/p> <p>For many children, however, school can be difficult.  That is especially true for children with special educational needs and disabilities, for whom education poses all sorts of additional challenges.  On occasion, school can be so difficult for young people who require additional support that a school can struggle to appropriately meet their needs.  In certain instances, this can lead to breakdown in school placements, leaving vulnerable children with additional needs without an educational placement.<\/p> <p>I want to be clear that I am not singling out our teachers, special needs assistants and learning support teachers for criticism.  I am attempting to highlight the fact that some of our schools do not currently have enough resources to meet the needs of each individual child or young person in Ireland.  We often hear disability rights organisations and activists speak of people being disabled by their environment.  That is also true of children with special educational needs and disability in our educational settings.<\/p> <p>In 2018, Deputy Thomas Byrne sought data from the Department of Education regarding the number of children with special educational needs and disability who had been subject to the section 29 procedure under the Education Act which allows for a parent or guardian to appeal a school's refusal to enroll a child in an educational placement.  The data demonstrated that children with special educational needs and disability are disproportionately represented within the appeals process.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Ultimately, this suggests that children with special educational needs and disabilities are disproportionately refused enrolments in schools and are subsequently expelled from schools in equally disproportionate numbers.  What remains unclear, however, is the precise number of children with special educational needs and disabilities who have suffered a breakdown in their school placement, whether temporary or permanent.  <\/p><p>Additionally, I am seeking clarity regarding the investigation processes into the breakdown of educational placement for children with special educational needs by the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department or by the National Council for Special Education.  I suspect the Minister of State may say there is a complaints process for schools which any family can use to make any complaint.  This roughly goes that any such complaint can be raised with the teacher, the principal, the board and the Ombudsman.  The Education Welfare Act creates section 29 procedures, etc., for suspensions and expulsions and there is forthcoming legislation in terms of the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill.  Complaints procedures for schools give schools too much power.  The schools control the pace of the processes which can take, at times, two full years to work through.  As well as this boards do not have the adequate skills to meet the needs of special educational needs and disabilities students which they consistently demonstrate by allowing reduced timetables to persist and by refusing to open autism classes.  <\/p><p>Furthermore, when a placement breaks down, the Ombudsman is seriously constrained because if the complaint becomes a legal one, his process has to stop and sometimes the courts will not allow the raising of an issue which the Ombudsman may have addressed.  The biggest problem here is that it allows the child&rsquo;s rights to be severely impacted before the State does anything.  There is no proactive measure to stop discrimination or to uphold the Equal Status Act and the State is behaving negligently as a result.<\/p><p>Will the Minister of State recognise that it is morally unacceptable that what is on the Statute Book allows the same policy document which deals with a student who is bullying or harassing another student or teacher&rsquo;s code of behaviour to also use the same process to deal with a student with additional needs who is not capable of being responsible for a melt-down which he or she cannot control or who sometimes cannot communicate using words?  Despite the lack of statistics surrounding special educational needs and disabilities' students who were subjected to section 29 of the Education Welfare Act, it is clear that the Act as it stands is not fit for purpose.<\/p><p>I am calling on the Minister of State to provide us with the figures for the number of special educational needs and disabilities children who have experienced a breakdown in their school placement, either temporary or permanent, and that her Department begin the process of reviewing the Education Welfare Act in order to ensure that those children and families who go through the State system are owed the highest duty of care and are placed at the heart of the Act.  I therefore urge the Minister of State to work compassionately, understandingly and exclusively with special educational needs and disabilities' children and their families to find out what they require in order for their needs to be met.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#A00500","speaker":"1681","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>It is my belief that children with special educational needs should receive their education in placements which are appropriate to their needs alongside their peers, wherever possible unless such an approach would be inconsistent with the best interests of the individual child, or other children in the school.  This approach is consistent with the provisions of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act 2004.  My Department's policy, therefore, is to provide for the inclusive education of children with special educational needs in mainstream schools.  The majority of children with special needs attend mainstream education with additional supports.<\/p> <p>In circumstances where children have more complex special educational needs requirements, then a special school or special class places should be provided.  The policy of the Department, to touch on the question of resources which was mentioned by the Senator, is to continue to prioritise investment in special education.  This year &euro;2 billion is to be spent on special education.  When one is talking about a figure, one needs to be able to demonstrate where that money goes.  This year we have 13,600 special education teachers in the special education system, which is a 40% increase since 2011.  We also have 18,000 special needs assistants, which is a 70% increase since 2011.  Considerable work has also been undertaken this year to plan and provide for specialist places.  We are also opening two new special school and 269 new special classes this year.<\/p> <p>The National Council Special Education, NCSE, has primary responsibility for co-ordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.  It has well-established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents.  The NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can cater for all children who have been identified as having special education needs, including those children the Senator has specifically asked me about in respect of the breakdown of school placements or of those that are at risk.  When the NCSE becomes aware of a school placement which is at risk, it will engage with the family and the school to agree a plan to support the placement.  This plan may involve training and support being provided for the schools from NCSE staff.<\/p> <p>It may also involves the NCSE engaging with the HSE and with the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, in order to establish what other supports or guidance may be provided to a school in order to support that child because the joint approach spoken about by the Senator is very important.  In some circumstances, the NCSE may also arrange for additional supports and resources such as assistive technology, or additional special needs assistance support.  Additional training programmes or guidance may also be provided for the school.<\/p> <p>It is important also to point out, and I am not saying the Senator is saying this, that transfer between settings should not be considered or categorised as a placement breakdown because often there can be a child in mainstream who is moved to a special class or school and this is not a placement breakdown but it may be simply in the best interests of the child to move to that particular environment.<\/p> <p>There is also the home tuition grant, which the Senator would also be aware of, which provides 20 hours of home tuition per week as an interim measure.<\/p> <p>On section 29, it allows for appeals against the decision of a board of management of a school to suspend or permanently exclude a student.  Where a parent feels that a school has unfairly suspended or expelled a child from school, then an appeal mechanism is provided for.  Everything that is possible should be done to ensure that placements for children with special education needs do not break down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#B00200","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive response.  There are parts of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act that have not been commenced but there are also parts that need to be amended.<\/p> <p>I obviously agree that the transfer from one school to another at the request of the parties does not fall into the idea of a breakdown.  I refer to schools specifically set up for children with special needs who are then expelled because of their actual disability or special need for which they were admitted, for example, where a melt-down is being reframed as violent or as being an assault, when the entire reason they are in that special school and for the existence of that special school is because of those very behavioural issues.  It makes no sense that we have a special school that cannot deal adequately with breakdowns or meltdowns of children.  This is especially the case when it comes to the section 29 piece which relates to a completely different comparison.  <\/p> <p>I remember when working in the homeless sector a person was presenting with extreme mental health issues.  Having raised these issues in the interview process and admitting to them, the person was excluded from the hostel because they displayed these mental health issues.  I wondered was that not why the homeless services existed there in the first place.<\/p> <p>I want to make the point strongly that when we reach the point where section 29 has to be used or there has to be an appeal, we should not be allowed to expel children for displaying the actual disability or special need for which they were enrolled in the school in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#B00300","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for her comments.

It is important to say that there is that appeal mechanism available.<\/p> <p>From the data I have, there was only one expulsion case in 2021, by way of judicial review.

Some schools already do modules on road safety during transition year and this has proven very successful.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has designed a very impressive module which is available to schools but, unfortunately, there has been a very low uptake.<\/p><p>I wish to bring the House's attention to certain aspects of the module which comes under the heading of personal achievement and local and global citizenship.  The unit builds on existing curriculum links in junior cycle civic, social and political education, CSPE, and social, personal and health education, SPHE, through its emphasis on the values and skills that underpin responsible decision-making and in respect for the rights and safety of others.  The unit was designed by teachers and includes a wide range of methodologies and activities.  The programme is fully resourced with a step-by-step set of lesson plans and worksheets.  Each lesson is clearly structured and includes a teacher note, worksheets and class activities.  An interactive DVD also provides support and includes class activities, crash reconstructions and real-life stories.  The unit also includes project work and input from agencies such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the emergency services and those with responsibility for the national car test, NCT, which adds greatly to the effectiveness of the programme.  It delivers an important message that all students need to hear.<\/p><p>The transition unit is supported by digital resources including access to international websites on road safety issues and the Road Safety Authority, RSA, website.  The module develops and reinforces research, field work and project skills acquired at junior cycle, Streetwise road safety links, with the promotion of positive attitudes and behaviours associated with CSPE and SPHE, and links with ICT for research and project presentation.  It links with the leaving certificate physics motion and English media reporting of news and the role of advertising in promoting road safety.  The module has an introduction to road safety, what it means to the trainee, whose business is road safety.  It deals with pedestrians and cyclists.  It goes into safety precautions, seat belt wearing, child restraints, loose objects in cars and air bags.  It is quite a comprehensive module and its aims are to enable students to explore their own attitudes and behaviour in respect of road safety, promote visual literacy, enable students explore their own attitudes and behaviour in the context of road safety and increase road safety awareness among the wider school community.  It also seeks to identify the key causes of road accidents in Ireland explain the factors that contribute to road safety, identify the role of different stakeholders who have a remit for road safety, work collaboratively towards an agreed set of goals through a group project, practice basic first aid skills and so on.  Furthermore, it helps student successfully complete the driver theory test which is very important and something we are having difficulties with now.  This is a very important subject that should be mainstreamed in second-level schools and other areas of education, adult and otherwise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#B00600","speaker":"1687","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I wish to confirm that there are curriculum supports educating young people about road safety from a young age.  The Garda schools programme, at both primary and post-primary level includes modules on road safety and on cycle safety.  The aim of this programme is to engage with young people in order to enhance their appreciation of the need to be caring, law-abiding citizens and to increase awareness of their personal safety . The programme also seeks to improve awareness of road safety and to reduce injuries and fatalities.  My Department has engaged with colleagues in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that this programme contains strong links to the curriculum at primary and post primary level.<\/p> <p>The Senator mentioned SPHE at primary level, which offers particular opportunities, in an age-appropriate manner, to foster the personal development, health and well-being of individual children.  One of the three strands within SPHE is \"Myself\" which includes units on safety and protection.  Through the SPHE curriculum children learn to identify situations and places that may threaten personal safety, identify people who are responsible for safety in the community and learn and practice safety strategies for crossing the road, using the bus or being a pedestrian, develop and practice strategies for keeping safe when travelling, such as being familiar with the rules for travelling in car or bus or on a bicycle.<\/p> <p>The NCCA is in the process of reviewing and redeveloping the primary school curriculum, including SPHE and well-being.  Phase 1 of consultation on the draft framework closed in December 2020, with phase 2, focusing on learners, teachers, school leaders and parents, due take place in September.<\/p> <p>At junior cycle, SPHE has a specific personal safety strand  which provides a mechanism through which road safety issues can be best dealt with in an age-appropriate way.  At transition year, which is currently taken by 70% of students, there is an optional road safety programme which has been developed by the RSA in collaboration with the Department, the NCCA and the development service for teachers.<\/p> <p>While there are no plans to introduce mandatory driver education classes at post-primary level, it is important to point out that basic tuition to lay a foundation in driver education features on many school curricula already.  The optional RSA programme for transition year is available in 24-hour or 45-hour units and features inputs from various agencies, which the Senator mentioned, such as the ambulance service, the fire service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as providing for visiting speakers, trips out of school, projects and case studies.  It also introduction to road safety for pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists and motorists, and covers such issues as seat belts and airbags, driver fatigue, drink- and drug-driving, enforcement, basic first aid at road crashes, emergency services and rehabilitation.  The programme is also supported by digital resources, which the Senator also mentioned, including DVD support and access to international websites that deal with road safety.  Relevant driver theory test learning is included at the end of each module.  The programme does not include driving lessons.

She is welcome to the House and I am delighted that she has taken the time to speak to us.<\/p> <p>St. Mary's Boys' National School is a national school on Grotto Avenue in Booterstown.  There are about 300 boys in the school and it has demonstrated extraordinary inclusivity in regard to special educational needs, particularly autism.  While many schools in the area cannot accommodate children with autism, St. Mary's has gone to great lengths - I pay tribute to Mr. Noel Scully and his team at the school - to include and accommodate those students and to allow them to continue to attend in an inclusive and full way that is not possible in other schools.  Unfortunately, however, there is great demand in the area for autism services and autism inclusion facilities.  Autism affects boys to a much greater extent than girls, by a factor of four.  It is understandable, therefore, that there is much greater demand than there might be in a girls' school or even in a mixed school.  There is significant demand and the Minister of State is aware of that too.<\/p> <p>What is significant about the project is that there is very strong support in both the school and wider community and in the local parish for a solution that will facilitate the autism services unit, ASU, and there is a ready-made solution that will work.  Located immediately next to St. Mary's Boys' National School is the Booterstown parish hall, at the end of Grotto Avenue where the school is located, facing Rock Road with a side entrance that the students have to pass on their way to and from school.  It is an adjacent building owned by the Catholic parish of Booterstown.  Fr. Gerry Kane has been in touch with the school and is supportive of this and the building is available.  We - the students, parents and community - want the Department to purchase that building and to provide it to St. Mary's Boys' National School as a facility and location for an ASU for those who need it.  There is room in that building to meet the existing demand.<\/p> <p>The beauty of this project is that everybody is for it, as I think the Minister of State is too.  The Department sees the reasonable nature of what has been proposed.  It is a building right next to the school that is available and I understand the parish is willing to part with it to facilitate the ASU for St. Mary's Boys' National School.  The question is whether we can do this in short order.  The building is available now and will not interfere with, for example, adjacent community facilities there.  With the goodwill of the school community, the local community and, one hopes, the Department, there is a ready-made solution to deal with this issue, which exists throughout the area.  I do not believe there is an ASU anywhere in the area from Booterstown to Leopardstown.  There is one in Monkstown but there is a serious dearth of facilities for young boys, in particular, in this area.  St. Mary's Boys' National School has come forward with a ready-made solution that will be easy to effect.  All it requires is a budgetary box-ticking from the Department.  I hope that when the Minister of State responds, she will be able to tell us that progress is being made.  Parents are frustrated that the matter has been in progress for a long time and want to know when this can happen.  It is ready made and requires just a budgetary allocation from the Department to make it happen and create a solution, for both the Department and the school community in Booterstown.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#D00400","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

One step I want to take in my position as the first Minister of State with responsibility for special education is to ensure we provide special class places and special school places for all children with additional needs, whether in south Dublin, south Cork or wherever it is in the country.  That is something I am determined to do.  To that end, in the budget last year, I secured &euro;2 billion for special education for that very purpose, among other needs, for special education teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, and other matters.<\/p><p>As the Senator will be acutely aware, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, works, through its special educational needs organisers, SENOs, very closely with schools and parents to ensure we can provide all these class places.  We use a five-year forecasting model, which has recently been enhanced, to determine the capacity of those schools and places throughout the country.  We are aware that issues have arisen in recent years regarding a shortage of suitable school places in certain pockets of the country, driven primarily by the significant increase in the number of children with additional needs and in demand.  I heard what the Senator said about boys in the context of autism, but there has also been exponential growth in the incidence of girls with autism too, and there are a number of reasons for that.  Perhaps the enhanced method of diagnosis has resulted in that.  It is important there is suitable school accommodation for all children and, through that more enhanced national and local-level planning, it is my objective that all special education places can come on stream in a timely manner.<\/p><p>Turning specifically to St. Mary's Boys' National School in Booterstown, I note that a Zoom meeting will be held on the matter tomorrow evening.  The Department and the NCSE are grateful to schools that continue to respond positively in terms of trying to provide that education but we accept that there are circumstances in which there simply is not sufficient capacity, particularly in urban areas where there is high density and schools simply do not have room.  I can confirm the Department has been in contact with the parish in regard to the potential acquisition of the Booterstown parish hall and the Senator and I are <i>ad idem<\/i>on that.  It is something I very much agree with.  Evaluation of the hall has been received and assessed by Department officials and the Department is negotiating with the owners for the potential acquisition of the site.  The Senator will appreciate that due to commercial sensitivities, it is not possible to provide further information at this time.  Nevertheless, the acquisition is a priority for the Department and my officials will keep the patron informed of any key developments regarding the acquisition.  The site's acquisition is, obviously, complex and subject to the success of the negotiation and the conveyancing processes, and I would not like to say anything that would in any way jeopardise the outcome of that.  In those circumstances, it is not possible to give a definitive timeframe but I am hopeful there will be a speedy conclusion and resolution.  It is very important for the parents and the children with additional needs that we expedite this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#D00600","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I appreciate the work the Minister of State has done on this under her special education brief and acknowledge that she has secured money for the issue.

Since the opening of phase 1 in 2010 by the then Minister for Transport, Mr. Noel Dempsey, the completion of the line from Dunboyne to Navan has fallen off the agenda, including the national development plan, NDP.  However, there is reason to have great optimism at this very moment because we have the coming together of the review of the NDP and, critically, the review by the National Transport Authority, NTA, of the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area.  Key to the NTA review is the fact that the Navan element was analysed on an evidence basis.  This is important if it is to become part of the NDP.  I am hopeful that, when presented to the Minister, the NTA's review of its many projects will be favourable and that we will then see him ensuring that this project is included in the plan, but time is key because the two reviews are beginning to align at this very moment.<\/p> <p>We need a firm financial commitment towards the expediting of this infrastructure.  When I raised this issue with the Minister in the Chamber, he spoke of the need for positive statements from Meath County Council as the lead planning authority.  From a strategic planning point of view, the council's work to demonstrate the population growth in the urban centre of Navan and along the designated route has been exemplary.  It has been the essence of good planning in terms of creating centralised growth centres with good public transport hubs to provide people with easy access to their work or education in Dublin city centre.<\/p> <p>I am sure the Minister of State will refer to the Department's need to decarbonise and the sustainable mobility of people.  In July 2017, its economic and financial evaluation unit published a report that estimated the cost of aggravated congestion across Ireland's transport system and how it would grow without intervention in the coming decades.  Its analysis suggested that the cost of time lost due to aggravated congestion in the base year of 2012 was nearly &euro;500 million and predicted an increase to &euro;2 billion by 2033.  That is happening in County Meath right now.  Ours is the only county in the greater Dublin area without rail connectivity to its capital town.  What has been missing over the past decade has been the political will to make this happen.<\/p> <p>When the report lands on the Minister's desk, I am confident that the scoring matrix used by the NTA that would be required to recommend the line to Navan will stack up because of the critical analysis of population growth undertaken by Meath County Council.  However, this Commencement matter is not just about the analytics; it is also about the human side.  Significant research was done through interviewing people.  Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes was engaged to conduct field research on more than 3,000 citizens and a further online poll of 8,000 citizens.  Their testimonies about the detrimental effects on their family lives were harrowing.<\/p> <p>I hope that the Minister of State will make a positive statement about ensuring this line is be included in the NDP review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#E00800","speaker":"1641"},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I can hear the passion for this project in the Senator's voice.<\/p> <p>I am taking this Commencement matter on behalf of the Department of Transport.  Under the review of the NDP, the Department is examining its investment plans in light of the programme for Government.  The plan is based around outcomes.  The Senator is correct, in that I will refer to the sustainable mobility of 1 million people.  That is what we are discussing in the national development plan as opposed to specific projects.  The Department's submission to the review examines the plan at a policy level and identifies revised strategic priorities instead of entering into a discussion of particular projects.  However, I will discuss Navan in a moment.  A draft national investment framework for transport in Ireland will underpin the Department's submission.  It has four priorities: decarbonisation; protection and renewal; enhanced regional accessibility; and the sustainable mobility of people and goods in urban areas.<\/p> <p>The issue of a rail connection to Navan is being re-examined as part of the NTA's review of the 20-year transport strategy for the greater Dublin area.  The NTA is required to review and update the strategy every six years.  That review is well under way.  Initial public consultation has taken place and I am sure the Senator made a submission to it.  The NTA has engaged external expertise to re-examine the feasibility of a Navan rail line.  This assessment will be inputted into the overall review.  The next step is a second round of public consultation on the draft revised strategy, which is expected to take place in the autumn.  The Senator will be able to make a submission at that point as well.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge what he said about an evidence-based scenario, a score-based metric and the fact that Navan is the only area without rail connectivity.  I will pass his remarks on to the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton.  The Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 requires the preparation of a transport strategy for the greater Dublin area.  The current strategy was published in 2016 and extends to 2035.  The Act requires the strategy to be reviewed every six years.  In line with this statutory framework, the NTA's transport strategy for the greater Dublin area is under review.  The first stage of the consultation on the initial issues paper ended in January.  In late 2020, the NTA appointed technical consultants to develop an assessment study incorporating a comprehensive analysis of the business case for a potential extension of the existing rail line from the M3 parkway close to Dunboyne to Navan.  The outcome of the assessment is intended to inform an update of the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area.<\/p> <p>The Senator mentioned Meath County Council.  I understand the NTA is working closely with the council on undertaking a comprehensive assessment of the benefits of the project, encapsulating economic, environmental and societal benefits.  A multi-criterion analysis of options in accordance with a common appraisal framework for transport projects and programmes is also due to commence shortly.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Josepha Madigan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2424\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2424&amp;amp;pid=JosephaMadigan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->An appraisal framework for transport projects and programmes is also due to commence shortly.

There are serious questions, ones that are surely in the public interest to have answered, as to how such a high degree of saturation of the media landscape by sports betting advertisements has arisen, when the evidence of the damage being inflicted is so obvious and should be a concern to us all. <\/blockquote> <p>Those are the words of our President.  It is the second time in the past two weeks he has raised what he describes as the dangerous gambling advertisements which, he has said, are causing damage to families and individuals.<\/p><p>Our President is once again speaking for so many of us in this country.  Since introducing into the Seanad the Labour Party Gambling (Prohibition of Advertising) Bill 2021 and beginning a conversation about the number of gambling ads, I have been inundated with calls and emails from people all over the country who want to talk about their experiences or simply want to be able to watch their favourite sport without having to wade through advertisement after advertisement encouraging them to gamble.  That is what is happening, as I am sure the Minister of State has noticed.  In a recent online survey we carried out, 80% of respondents stated they have noticed an increase in gambling ads throughout their media.<\/p><p>Next Thursday, 5 July, will be the eighth anniversary of the Gambling Control Bill 2013.  I note from recent press releases and the Minister of State's words when he last visited this House that he intends bringing a gambling control Bill through the Oireachtas by the end of the year.  I respectfully state on behalf of so many that we cannot wait that long to ban gambling advertisements.<\/p><p>Estimates are that Ireland spends &euro;9.8 billion per year, marking it as out as the world's seventh biggest spender on gambling per head.  The industry needs urgent regulation due to the large increases in those reporting gambling addiction problems and those suffering in silence, afraid to reach out for help or, more worryingly, thinking they can gamble their way out of their problems.  One of the most worrying results in the Labour Party survey was that almost 65% said they were more inclined to gamble after seeing these ads.  That figure will please the gambling companies but should set off alarm bells for our public health system.  From the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland to gambling addiction support advocates such as Oisin McConville, Niall McNamee and Davy Glennon and now our President, there has been a consistent recent message: we must get rid of the number of gambling ads in this country.  A survey carried out by <i>thejournal.ie<\/i>over the weekend had more than 88% of respondents supporting a ban on gambling ads on TV.  Action must be taken.<\/p><p>I have spoken to many citizens who have lost so much as a result of gambling from loving partnerships to family homes to jobs.  It is important to remind ourselves that those most affected by the tsunami of gambling ads are real people who initially gamble for fun or take up one of the many offers from gambling companies to open a new account and, unfortunately, cannot control their habit.  This highly addictive behaviour takes over and, in many cases, ruins their lives.  We need to do more for the estimated 40,000 people in this country who have developed a gambling addiction and for those who may add to that figure because of the continuous and unrelenting advertising they face daily.<\/p><p>What disturbs me most is that there is no watershed on gambling in this country.  Our children and young adults are being exposed to a highly addictive behaviour.  We have many stories of children as young as six, especially when they were being homeschooled, asking parents what these ads were about.  The normalisation of sporting gambling continues apace by the marketing departments of the gambling companies and we must break that association.  We need to enact the Gambling (Prohibition of Advertising) Bill 2021.  We have to stop the bombardment of gambling advertisements.  The time for talking has long passed.  We have had eight years of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#F00900","speaker":"1684"},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I congratulate Deputy Bacik.  I have had the pleasure of dealing with her in here over the past year on justice issues.  She is a huge loss to the Seanad given her forensic analysis of justice legislation and ability to improve the legislation we have introduced.  I look forward to engaging with her in the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Wall for raising this important issue.  He has made this a hugely important matter for himself since he came into the Seanad and is committed to seeking gambling reform. <\/p> <p>The programme for Government gives a clear commitment to comprehensively reform the licensing and regulation of gambling activities. That reform will establish a gambling regulator focused on public safety and well-being.  It is important to understand that this regulator will not only regulate the industry in general terms, but will have a public health remit as the primary focus in every decision or recommendation he or she makes.  <\/p> <p>When I was appointed last September, I had listened to proposals and promises around reforming gambling for 20 years.  As far back as 2007, the appointment of a gambling regulator was an issue in the general election.  It has not happened.  I set out last September clear timelines and milestones to get this done comprehensively and we are on schedule for that.  We will publish a new scheme in September and have a CEO-designate, in effect a regulator, appointed by the end of this year.  There is a clear path towards the regulator being operational in early 2023. <\/p> <p>The legislation will empower the independent gambling regulator to develop regulations, codes of conduct and codes of practice on various issues relating to gambling, including advertising.  I expect a particular focus from the regulator on appropriate standards for advertising and customer protection by gambling operators.  These codes will be part of a range of conditions that the operators will need to adhere to and to enjoy the benefits of.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy James Browne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The regulator will have the power to impose fines where codes of conducts and regulations are not being complied with and to remove a licence or block the various sites if in breach of the regulations and the guidelines.  When appointed, the regular will be powerful and will be backed up with supports of comprehensive legislation.  <\/p><p>As the Senator will be aware, under existing law, licensed gambling operators are entitled to advertise their products and currently advertising does not come with the remit of the Department of Justice but the intention is to bring gambling advertising under the remit of the Department and the regulator.  Currently, it comes under the remit of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.  The general regulation of advertising in the media is, as I say, currently a matter for the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland under the remit of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.  There are no specific statutory requirements in regard to gambling activities, but all advertisements must meet the basic requirements of being truthful and to not mislead any potential customer.  How the new gambling operator might operate specific advertising regulations for the gambling industry will be informed by the report of the interdepartmental working group on the future of licensing and regulation of gambling approved by the Government on 20 March 2019.  The report noted that there are various issues involved in developing an effective approach to advertising on gambling products.  There are challenges around banning advertising on gambling.  A ban is certainly on the table but given much of the horse racing and other sports televised during daytime or at the weekend comes from other countries, finding a way to effectively ban advertising will be challenging.  I am conscious of what the UK is doing in terms of a review, including in regard to sports sponsorship.  <\/p><p>In developing the new legislation, my objective is to provide enhanced consumer protection for players and to limit harmful effects on young people and those susceptible to addiction.  We must ensure that gambling will be safe, fair and crime-free.  The legislation will be comprehensive.  The regulator will be powerful and advertising will be a central plank in all of that work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#F01000","speaker":"1618","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his kind comments in regard to Deputy Bacik.

The INMO figures for this morning show that there are 24 patients on trolleys in the hospital.  This day last week, there were 30 patients on trolleys.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree that as I have stated previously even one patient on a trolley in an emergency department for a significant period is one too many.  I acknowledge and commend the front-line staff who are working in these difficult circumstances in overcrowded emergency departments, particularly in UHG<\/p> <p>Enabling works on construction of a temporary extension to the emergency department at the hospital have commenced and are due to be completed in early 2022.  This will provide additional accommodation, including segregated waiting and treatment areas, isolation rooms, additional resuscitation spaces and support accommodation to take account of new requirements to treat Covid-19 patients.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify if a timeline has been set in respect of the lodgment of a planning application for the new emergency department and maternity and paediatric facilities at UHG.  Has Saolta given a timeline for this project?  Why are we still waiting?  Is the project being stalled purposely or is genuine progress being made?  Is the design 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 99% complete?  Is Saolta ready to sign-off on this project?  Is it awaiting national estates to give it the go ahead?  Is it waiting for Department of Public Expenditure and Reform approval?<\/p> <p>I have been through the history of this project previously.  As far back as 2015, the then Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, said that the emergency department at UHG was not fit for purpose.  We have had ministerial visits to Galway, where we have been told that planning permission would be lodged prior to Christmas 2018.  The specifications may have changed to a degree since then in the fit-out of the building, but I do not see the rationale for the planning permission not having been lodged.  Where is the design at?  Is it nearly complete and ready to go?  What is the stumbling block?  If I raise this issue with the Minister of State again in September, will progress have been made?  Will the planning permission be lodged before the end of this year?  Is there any certainty or a definitive timeline on this hugely important project for an emergency department and maternity and paediatric facilities for UHG?<\/p> <p>We have heard all the talk of major plans elsewhere in Galway in Merlin Park yet a project that has stood up to the options appraisal carried out by Saolta with the consent of the Department has indicated that the existing site at UHG is the preferred site for an emergency department.  This has been in every national plan for God knows how many years, yet no planning permission has yet been lodged.  I have said previously, and I reiterate today, nothing can be built without valid planning permission and valid planning permission cannot be obtained without first lodging an application.  I hope the Minister of State can shed some light on where this project is at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#G00500","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to outline to the House on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, the position in regard to the new emergency department at UHG.

I wish to address the failure of the Government to address the pay restoration issue for employees in health and social care sector who are employed by community and voluntary organisations.  What has transpired during the past two years represents a blatant disregard for fairness and equality of treatment.  To illustrate my point I will use an example of Clarecare, a professional social enterprise with charitable status providing a range of services to individuals and families in County Clare for the past 50 years.  It has a workforce of approximately 420.  Its services include family support services, elderly care services, counselling and addiction therapy in a residential facility.  It has a wonderful ethos and staff who are truly amazing.  They provide an enormous service to citizens across the county. They are highly treasured and really professional.  They do an enormously good job.<\/p> <p>Until 2014, the HSE provided all the funding to Clarecare, particularly for funding towards family support services as well as the elderly care services under what is known as a section 39 agreement.  In April 2010 during the economic crash, the HSE reduced funding to Clarecare and other organisations for salaries to the tune of 4%.  That had to be passed on by Clarecare to all staff.  When Tusla was established in 2014 the funding of the family support services provided to Clarecare was transferred from the HSE to Tusla and since then that funding has been provided to the Clarecare under what is known as a section 56 service level agreement.    <\/p> <p>In January of this year, the HSE began pay restoration to those contracted under a section 39 agreement.  However, as I understand it, no such restoration has been promised or provided to those under a section 56 agreement.  In practical terms, we have a team of workers who are contracted by the State through Clarecare to provide health and social care services in County Clare.  A pay cut was enforced on all of them in 2010.  Pay restoration was recommenced in January of this year but only some of the workers qualify.  That begs the obvious question: why?  They have been told if the HSE is providing the funding they will get their pay restoration but for those who were funded by the HSE when the pay cuts were introduced in 2010 and since 2014 have been funded by Tusla, it is tough luck, they do not get restoration.  That does not seem fair to me and it certainly is not seen as fair by the workers on the ground.  Neither is seen as fair by the people who they work with, assist and help on a daily basis.  In truth, as far as all those people are concerned, they are doing the same work they did when their funding came through the HSE stream, albeit their funding is now coming through a different route.  They find it hard to understand why they are not getting pay restoration.  The reality is it is State and taxpayer-funded.  The fact that it is a section 39 or a section 56 service level agreement should not matter to the people on the ground.<\/p> <p>I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s views on this matter.  It is blatant discrimination for a group of people who were treated in a fair and equitable way up to a certain point to now discover because their funding was transferred to a different Department they do not qualify for pay restoration of pay in terms of the pay cut they took in unison with everybody else at the time.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s deliberations on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#H00500","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  As he said, section 39 of the Health Act 2004 relates to funding of bodies by the HSE and section 56 of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 relates to funding by Tusla.

The section 39 organisations to which the agreement applied included those with service arrangements in place in 2013 which were still in place in 2019 and that received in excess of an agreed, specified amount from the HSE, which I understand was &euro;250,000 per year.  This was achieved through an agreed process on a phased basis.<\/p><p>Since the establishment of Tusla in 2014, the agency has funded many organisations, mostly in the community and voluntary sector, to deliver services on its behalf under sections 56 to 59 of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013.  These commissioned services fulfil Tusla's statutory responsibilities and deliver on the agency's strategic objectives.  Such organisations are important partners in the work of the agency and I value the unique position many of them are in that enable them to deliver services which can respond quickly to the needs of children and families in their local communities.  I acknowledge that some of these organisations were funded by the HSE under section 39 of the Health Act 2004 prior to the establishment of Tusla in 2014.  However, section 56(14) of the Act is clear that \"an arrangement under this section shall not give rise to an employment relationship between a service provider, its employees or agents on the one hand and the Agency on the other\".   Therefore, these organisations operate independently of Tusla and are responsible for the recruitment of their employees and for the terms and conditions under which they are employed.  Tusla is not the employer of the staff of such organisations and the remuneration of these staff is a matter for their own employers.<\/p><p>While Tusla is not the employer of the staff in organisations funded by section 56, the agency has raised the issue of the sustainability of the vital services provided by these organisations with me in the last year.  They are a part of the essential infrastructure of services and supports we have in place for children and their families.  At my most recent quarterly meeting with the board of Tusla, the chairman and I spoke about our intention to pursue additional resources for the sector as part of the Estimates process in 2022.   I assure the Senator, therefore, that I am committed to working with my colleagues in Government, and especially the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, Tusla and other service delivery partners to address the sustainability of these services and ensure that we meet the needs of children, young people and their families across Ireland.  I will be giving this issue my full consideration in the upcoming Estimates process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#H00600","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his commitment to fighting the case on behalf of these workers with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I am conscious that departmental speak has always surrounded section 39 workers.  I refer to their employment being the responsibility of the local voluntary organisations and, as such, no relationship existing between the State agency and the local organisations other than the provision of funding.  However, the reality back in 2010 was that the State required these organisations to cut salaries by 4% by reducing the funding provided.  It is all well documented.  The State knows full well what the different grades and rates of pay are and funding is provided <i>pro rata<\/i>in that regard, on the basis of whole-time equivalents, etc.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the lack of a direct contractual arrangement, therefore, it is important that there is a recognition that, in essence, the State is funding these individuals.

If we are to stand for anything in this House and across the public service, it must be based on fairness.

As the Senator is probably aware, Tusla was able to provide an additional &euro;7 million in funding last month for the section 56 organisations.  A once-off 5% increase in funding was provided to these organisations, which amounted to &euro;6.2 million.

I acknowledge the enormous success of the vaccination programme to date.  We are jabbing more arms in Ireland now for the size of our population than anywhere else in the world.  Everybody involved in that operation deserves our thanks and congratulations on that achievement.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State will be aware that the European Medicines Agency has approved four vaccines.  However, I am raising the question of Irish citizens outside the European Union who may have received a non-EMA-approved vaccine.  This includes people who may have received the Sinovac or Sinopharm vaccines, as well as the AstraZeneca vaccine developed in India.  This is particularly a problem for Irish citizens working, generally as teachers, engineers or other professionals, in the Middle East and other parts of the world.  Those people&rsquo;s employers arranged for them to get these vaccines very early during the global vaccination process and this situation now represents a difficulty for those people in returning home because Ireland only recognises the EMA-approved vaccines.<\/p> <p>This situation will also present a challenge to the roll-out of the digital Covid-19 certificates.  The EU is operating on the basis that only vaccines that have been approved by the EMA can be used for certificates.  It is up to each of the individual countries in the EU or the European Economic Area, EEA, however, to determine who may enter each respective state.  The difficulty which arises then is a discrepancy between the criteria in different European countries.  Spain, for example, will accept all EMA-approved vaccines and those approved by the World Health Organization to meet the criteria for entry, which gives a total of eight vaccines overall.  Greece and Estonia, then, will accept the vaccines which are recognised in the country of departure.  Therefore, if somebody is leaving Dubai to travel to Greece, for instance, and he or she has been vaccinated with a vaccine recognised in Dubai, the Greek authorities will accept that as meeting their requirements for entry.  In Iceland, the authorities will allow entry to someone who has been vaccinated with AstraZeneca in South Korea, as well as with the Sinovac vaccine.  A similar situation exists in Cyprus and Hungary, because those countries have also administered other vaccines.  In Slovenia, meanwhile, people will be permitted to enter once 21 days have elapsed, regardless of the vaccine received.  <\/p> <p>Across Europe, then, there is a divergence in the approaches which will be taken.  Our concern regarding this matter is obviously for those Irish citizens seeking to return home, especially if they have spent much of the time during the Covid-19 pandemic away from Ireland but have now received a non-EMA-approved vaccine.  We need clarity regarding what is going to happen concerning this situation, depending on how long it may take for the EMA to recognise those other vaccines.

Public health requirements have been put in place for travellers arriving to Ireland from overseas in order to protect against the introduction of new cases of Covid-19 and newly developing variants across the world.  Based on knowledge to date, the safest way to reopen society, including to international travel, is to continue to control disease incidence through a range of public health measures which are continuously reviewed, along with progressing the national vaccination programme to ensure as many people as possible within the population are protected through immunisation.<\/p> <p>Under the current measures, travellers to Ireland who are fully vaccinated with European Medicines Agency approved vaccines are exempt from hotel quarantine but are still required to show a negative pre-departure RT-PCR test and to complete a period of self-quarantine at home.

Housing is very complex and we deal with it daily in this House and in the D&aacute;il.  A particular cohort of people have been forgotten about.  I have raised this matter previously with the Minister but I want to have time devoted to it.  The cohort in question is the tenants of approved housing bodies, colloquially known as co-operative schemes.  A very good scheme was introduced approximately 25 years ago, whereby tenants who were on a housing list and qualified for social housing could come together, have input into the design of the housing scheme and fittings and be part of a co-operative to build their own scheme of houses.  At the time, it was a visionary approach and I thank the civic and community leaders involved who ensured it happened.<\/p> <p>In County Kildare we have 18 such schemes and they have housed 300 people.  The tenants have been paying 18% of their gross income throughout the period in question.  Many of them have children who are contributing.  The loans, which were capital loans given by the Government through the local authorities, are almost paid off.  I will give the example of Fen Grove in Newbridge, which has 18 houses.  The loans will be fully paid in 2025.  However, the tenants cannot buy their own homes.  When people got together to plan for the future and plan the houses, a commitment was made that tenants would have an opportunity to buy their homes, as is the case in the local authority housing scheme.  I have seen minutes of meetings of the Fen Grove housing co-operative in 1993 that clearly state tenants would be able to buy out their homes.  As I mentioned, there are various housing schemes in Kildare, which fall under eight different organisations, some of which have responsibility for a number of schemes.<\/p> <p>There has been poor corporate governance, which has been documented.  This is completely wrong.  The oversight has been incorrect.  The key issue I want to speak about, and that I want the Minister of State to bring back to the Minister and Ministers of State with responsibility for housing, is the fact that people should be able to buy out their own homes.  These residents entered an agreement with their housing associations in good faith.  They held up their end of the bargain and are now being left out to dry.  This debacle has tied these families to a life of renting.  At present, they have no option of owning their own homes.  Many will not qualify for a mortgage now due to their age.  Many have retired.  These residents chose Fen Grove precisely so they would have an option to own their own home.  At that time, homes were out of reach to them.  They have built their lives and reared their families in these homes on the understanding that eventually they would have the option to own them.  For the tables to be turned on them 25 years later is totally unacceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#K00500","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I am pleased to discuss this important issue and I thank the Senator for raising it.  Approved housing bodies, AHBs, are independent, not-for-profit organisations and they are also known as housing associations of voluntary co-operative housing.  It is important to be clear that AHBs are independent organisations and must operate in accordance with their own memorandum and articles of association.  They are governed by their own board of directors and most are registered charities.<\/p> <p>Under section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992, housing authorities may provide assistance to such bodies for revision and management of housing for people with a housing need.  Accordingly, AHBs are key partners of local authorities and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage across the broad spectrum of housing delivery.  AHBs are funded for delivery of housing units and related services by the Department through local authorities which have an administrative and oversight role under the relevant social housing funding schemes.  If an AHB is in receipt of funding under such a scheme for the provision of social housing, it must comply with the terms and conditions of that scheme.  The oversight of this rests with the local authority in whose functional area the scheme is located.<\/p> <p>Under such schemes, the AHB is required to make the property available for social renting for the duration of the mortgage or, as the case may be, the availability agreement.  On expiry of the mortgage period and subject to compliance with the terms of the funding agreement, the AHB becomes the owner of the property.  <\/p> <p>In accordance with departmental guidance, local authorities are requested to notify the Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government on release of all mortgage charges to AHBs within their area.  Should an AHB decide to sell a property that has been purchased using Exchequer funding, they must do so in accordance with any conditions attaching to the funding of that property.  The funding implications relating to such a sale may vary depending on the funding mechanism under which the property was acquired.  If a property is owned outright by an AHB and is not subject to public funding, the AHB may choose to sell that property, once this is allowed for in its constitution.  AHBs must have as their primary objectives the relief of housing needs and the provision and management of housing included within their memorandum and articles of association or registered rules, as the case may be.  The vast majority of AHBs are registered charities and, as such, must also comply with the provisions of the Charities Acts relating to the sale of charitable assets.<\/p> <p>It is important to be clear that the tenant (incremental) purchase scheme for local authority owned dwelling does not extend to AHB properties and it is not open to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to direct AHBs in this regard.<\/p> <p>I heard the Senator's concerns regarding the minutes of the 1993 local authority meetings and will bring them to the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#L00100","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has been in contact with residents and told them that the decision to sell homes to residents is one for individual housing associations.  The individual housing associations say it is not up to them.  It is clear that mechanisms should be put in place to fulfil the promise that housing associations can actually make that decision.  The residents need to have a clear direction on how they can purchase houses under approved housing schemes and under what criteria that can happen.  From what the Minister of State said, I gather that approved housing bodies can make that decision but I assume the Department has some role relating to the criteria and we need to work on that.<\/p> <p>I will briefly raise another issue.

This arises from a number of concerns relating to the Department and the navy.  I thank Mr. Darragh Duncan, a UCD student working as an intern in my office, who has done considerable research on the issue.  There are clearly many conflicting issues around these matters.  I will take the Minister of State through some of those issues chronologically.  On 15 February 2021, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>referred to a recent European Commission inquiry into Ireland's fisheries protection capabilities, deeming them unsatisfactory.  That finding relates to this Commencement matter.<\/p><p>On 4 June 2021, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>reported that Ireland has had to outsource fisheries patrols to other EU vessels to control our fisheries.  That is a challenge in itself.  On 6 April 2021, the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>reported that the Naval Service's plans to acquire a new flagship MRV at a reputed cost of &euro;200 million had gone to tender.  Further commentary has reported that the tender process is not going ahead.  The 2015 White Paper on Defence stated that such a vessel was required.  That vessel would need to be flexible and adaptive.  It would need to be able to carry freight and to be capable of a wide range of maritime tasks, both at home and abroad.  At this point, I acknowledge the amazing humanitarian work our Naval Service has carried out in the Mediterranean.  That was important.  <\/p><p>There are concerns around the issue of the European Commission's inquiry into Ireland's fisheries protection capabilities.  We should be concerned about that.  We must also address the issues of cost and morale within the Naval Service.  I am reliably informed that membership is now below 1,000.  It is, fact, approximately 900, when the Naval Service normally comprises the recommended level of approximately 1,200 members.  Without being negative, there are concerns about the morale of our navy.  There is a need to support it in terms of the infrastructure, machinery and expertise that are required.<\/p><p>There were suggestions that this MRV would be used as a hospital ship, would be capable of carrying troops and helicopters and would be amphibious, in addition to catering for airborne landings.  It would be a multifaceted, mutifunctional, expensive and essential military resource.  It is needed to provide humanitarian support and emergency services in Ireland.  There are concerns here.  I am asking that we have the necessary ships and specialist equipment, and the motivated staff to address issues around fisheries protection, which are critically important.  We also need to find out where we are on this project.  Is it on course as the draft tender documents set out?  It is important infrastructure that is needed.  It would give the Naval Service a boost and a sense that we are all on the one page.  It is important that we have absolute clarity about where we are on this important project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#L00500","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Defence and Foreign Affairs who cannot be present due to other commitments.

The Irish economic zone currently extends to 132,000 square miles.  This area is approximately five times the size of Ireland, and amounts to approximately 16% of all EU waters.<br\/><br\/>The Naval Service currently has a nine-ship fleet with two of those ships, the <i>L&Eacute; Eithne<\/i>and <i>L&Eacute; Orla<\/i>, in operational reserve.  The Government has acknowledged the recruitment and retention issues that are currently impacting on Naval Service operations and the availability of operational ships and also the impact on fishery patrol days, which is a situation that is being managed carefully.  The Minister's focus is on returning the Naval Service to its full capacity.<br\/><br\/>The White Paper on Defence sets out an ambitious programme of capital investment in the Naval Service, including the mid-life refit and upgrade of the P50 class of vessels, the <i>L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n<\/i>and <i>L&Eacute; Niamh<\/i>, as well as the replacement of the flagship Naval Service vessel, the <i>L&Eacute; Eithne<\/i>, with a multirole vessel, and, subsequently, the <i>L&Eacute; Ciara<\/i>and <i>L&Eacute; Orla<\/i>.  The P50 mid-life upgrade programme is well under way, with the recent return to operations of the <i>L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n<\/i>and work is commencing on the <i>L&Eacute; Niamh <\/i>project.<br\/><br\/>The multirole vessel project is an important developmental project and indicative of the Government's commitment to ongoing investment and development of defence capabilities.  The project is included in the national development plan as a major capital project and is an important element of the defence equipment development plan.  A joint civil-military project team has been appointed to manage this project.  Work to date has focused on the pretender concept of operations stage and preparing a detailed specification of capability requirements for a tender competition.  In addition, a competition is under way to appoint a marine adviser to support the procurement of a multirole vessel.  This process should be finalised within the coming weeks.  It is the intention that the new vessel will be able to contribute across a number of defence roles, with a design specification capable of providing a flexible and adaptive capacity for a wide range of tasks, both at home and overseas.  It is planned that it will be enabled for helicopter operations and will have a freight-carrying capacity.<br\/><br\/>It is intended to hold a public tender competition in due course to cover the supply of the multirole vessel, subject to availability of funding within the overall defence capital funding envelope.  As this project is at pretender stage, the Senator will appreciate that it would be inappropriate to comment further on the design and capabilities of the ship.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the European Commission's assessment that Ireland's fisheries protection capabilities are &quot;unsatisfactory&quot;, while it is acknowledged that there is room for improvement in respect of Ireland's sea fisheries protection, the Minister is satisfied that the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and Naval Service continue to actively engage with the Commission and EU partners on matters related to the Common Fisheries Policy.

It is an important day for the community.  Last year celebrations were cancelled because the Covid-19 and this was respected and I hope that they proceed safely.  <\/p> <p>This weekend showed us that while progress is being made in some respects with a DUP city mayor attending our National Day of Commemoration, the First Minister and deputy First Minister attended a commemoration of the Battle of the Somme and many bonfires went off at the weekend without controversy, we still have a long way to go.  We also saw the burning of Irish flags and other Irish or Catholic symbols and images of people who support the protocol over the weekend.  That is not a celebration of culture.  It is very disappointing for those people who respect different cultures.  Many people on this island work hard to do that in an inclusive way and that behaviour should be condemned without any excuses.<\/p> <p>The other issue I raise that relates to northerners is parity of vaccines.  I am glad that fully vaccinated northerners may not be left in the cold when it comes to indoor dining.  There is still confusion over the digital Covid-19 certificate.  The North has its own vaccine passport and there is a question regarding how this will be aligned.  From 19 July, Ireland will broadly align itself with the EU approach to non-essential travel into the EU from third countries and unless there is an emergency brake applied, no testing and quarantine will be necessary. However, there is still confusion for people, in particular, who live and work in the South and who got their vaccines in the North.  They may have lived in the South for decades and they live cross-Border lives, as we want them to.  Some are employed in this building.  They may or may not carry Irish passports and that should not matter.  They need clarity and reassurance at the moment and specific communications because they still want to see their loved ones and families in the EU.  In many cases, their housemates, co-workers, the people they dine with, their travel buddies and even their families may have the digital Covid-19 certificate.  It is good to see the recognition of vaccines for indoor dining but we should aim for parity of vaccines on our wee island.

What a wonderful achievement for a wonderful person and politician.  I said to her here last week, when she was sitting next to me and pushing her 12 or 13 amendments to the Gender Pay Gap Information Bill, most of which were not accepted by the Government, that this will no doubt be her last piece of important legislation in this House.  Everyone wished her well and believed that this was her time and that she deserved to be recognised by the electorate.  She achieved a resounding success and was the victor on the occasion of that by-election.  I also join colleagues in congratulating all the other candidates to put themselves forward.  I know some of them well and it takes courage to put one&rsquo;s name on the ballot.  It also takes courage to counteract scrutiny of a by-election.  It is a very tough election for anyone who has ever stood in a by-election.  Politicians had to put up with a lot of personal attacks and abuse in the campaign.  It should be condemned and is unacceptable, but to be fair to the candidates, they handled it remarkably well.  They will have another day and I have no doubt that we will see many of them in Leinster House in the future.  That is the great thing about politics.<\/p><p>I also join in congratulating Independent Councillor Ian McGarvey a very happy 91st birthday.  What a wonderful man.  If we learn anything about politics, and we all talk about bringing new people into politics, but let us also help to support the retention of those already there.  Ageism is well alive in politics.  A teacher said to me the other day that she had just retired at 66 years of age and she is an active member of the INTO.  She asked if I thought she had a place or role in local government.  I said that of course she had.  She has vast experience and I told her to put her name forward.  We should always remember that older people also have a place in politics.<\/p><p>I wish to dwell on two issues and one is more power to local government.  There is a particularly good article for those who may not have seen it in the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>by our Minister of State with responsibility for local government, Deputy Peter Burke.  I recommend that all Members read it and they will see for themselves why I think it is so good.  I thank and acknowledge the Government&rsquo;s now final commitment that we are going to have an end to the strategic housing development policy, which did not work.  Everybody said that it would not work.  It was a disaster, however it was approached.  The price is that the citizens had to pay and to go to the courts to vindicate their rights of engagement and, in most cases, they were successful.  That was the wake-up call for the Government but I want to acknowledge that it happened.<\/p><p>Finally, we will take the Land Development Agency Bill later.  I acknowledge the difficulties that the Leader has with her agenda but 135 minutes is tight for this important legislation.  I accept and acknowledge that she has a tight schedule between now and the end of this week, which I will go along with.  I ask Members who have city and county councillors in their parties to please support and in some way contribute to the debate on section 183 disposals.  It is of great significance for their members and for everyone else in this House as to their political affiliations.  I hope that we can stand in solidarity with one another today and send a clear message that we are not going to take the power of section 183 disposals in respect of land for the Land Development Agency away from our city and county councillors.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We have the power.

What a wonderful addition to the D&aacute;il she will be.<\/p> <p>Irish agriculture must change.  The change required to put it on course is transformational and the 2020s must be the decade that starts that substantial directional change.  The last major food systems shift was in the post-war decades.  The misnamed green revolution, fuelled by fossil fuels, led us along the path of abundance and growth, but at an enormous cost to our environment.  The next major food systems shift is now and it must be one during which the environment stops paying a heavy price.<\/p> <p>Agricultural policy, like food production, must be rooted in the soil.  I have visited many farmers over the course of the past year or so.  Some see the value in the soil and farm it to protect its biology and function.  Others see it merely as a medium to feed in order to grow a crop.  Soil is more than just a growing medium.  It is something living and breathing.  It can store carbon and it hosts a quarter of our biodiversity, or it should do if it is treated right.  We have, sadly, become addicted to feeding our soil with artificial fertilisers.  Those fertilisers are finite if they are mined or produced with fossil fuels.  If we are to fix things, we must do more than just cut back.  We must wean ourselves off these synthetic inputs and embrace the new agricultural revolution that is now upon us.  We in Ireland have a choice.  We can either lead and capitalise economically and environmentally on that leadership or we can sit and wait, pay huge fines and spend the next decade catching up, licking our wounds and regretting that we did not act sooner because that is what will happen.<\/p> <p>Our farming system is hooked on synthetic nitrogen and it is time we started the detox.  This will open the door to a whole new world of sustainable farming practices which we, as policymakers, must nurture and support, and legislate for if needs be.  I am not talking about everyone going organic.  While I believe organic farming is a vital component in our fight against climate change and for biodiversity, that is not what I am talking about now.  I am talking about the mainstream, the farmers our citizens will almost wholly rely on to meet our climate and biodiversity targets.  Luckily for us, the vast majority of those farmers are already extensive.  They do not place an undue burden on their lands or on our shared environment.  However, those who do that will have to change and play a significant role in shaping our future.<\/p> <p>We are all in this together and no one is entitled to a free pass.  It is time to design and deliver for a future that in which our land is released from the tyrannic grip of fossil fuels and finite minerals, where our food systems truly work in harmony with nature and we mimic ecology in everything we do.  The time has come for us to build a truly sustainable food system, one which is diverse and has plants and animals working together to sustain life.  Irish agriculture needs systemic change to set it on a secure path to resilience and as we seek to get farming back working with nature, we all need to remember that ecology does not do fossil fuels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#S00200","speaker":"1661"},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":92,"content":"<p>It was a wonderful weekend.

It was a wonderful tournament and we all wish everyone well at the end of it.<\/p> <p>I will raise an issue that I bring up from time to time, a matter on which I always ask for a debate but that has not happened yet.  That matter is the continuing use by US troops of Shannon Airport.  I was at a well-attended protest yesterday.  We need to reflect on where we are in terms of Shannon Airport and its use by the US military.  Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, it is estimated that 5 million deaths have occurred, including the death of 1 million children.  We are, unfortunately, culpable because we continue to facilitate the movement of US military through Shannon.  Some 17,000 troops have already moved through Shannon this year.  We continue to allow planes sending troops to war zones to land.  Mid-air refuelling aircraft help the planes that are bombing to refuel so that they can continue to bomb, as they did last month in Syria and Iraq.  <\/p> <p>I would like a debate on the issue and again ask the Leader to organise one.  It is frustrating to hear people rightly speaking about human rights but determined to ignore what has been happening in Shannon for far too long.  I am proud to believe we should be a neutral country but we are not neutral in practice.<\/p> <p>In a similar vein, I again bring up the issue of the TRIPS waiver because for the life of me I cannot understand the Government's stance on this issue.  People are dying.  As I said last week, and as emerged at the recent G7 conference, the people in Cornwall who are vaccinated outnumber the people vaccinated in the 24 poorest countries in Africa.  For reasons I do not understand, our Government is refusing to support the call for a TRIPS waiver.  There will be a crucial meeting of the World Trade Organization on 27 July.  It is crucial that Ireland stands up for the people of the world.  It is, frankly, immoral and indefensible to continue to hide behind big pharma and not be strong on this issue.  I call on the Leader not on a party political basis but on the basis of what we should all be able to agree on in this Chamber.  I call on the Government to stand firm with the people of the world by calling for the waiver of intellectual property rights because as all of us will agree, no one is safe until everyone is safe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#S00500","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":95,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Labour Party group, I thank the Cathaoirleach, the Leader and everybody else for their congratulatory words to Deputy Bacik.  I know she would be very touched by all the kind words and messages from Senators from across the Chamber on Friday, over the weekend and today.  It is, of course, an enormous privilege for her to have been elected as a Deputy for Dublin Bay South.  It is also a privilege for the Labour Party.<\/p> <p>Deputy Bacik leaves behind the Seanad which she dearly loved and of which she was extremely proud to be a Member for 14 years as a representative of the Trinity constituency.  There are a number of other examples, but Deputy Bacik is a fantastic example of what is possible in the Seanad in terms of the legislation she has brought forward over the years.  There is a degree of sadness on her part that she is leaving the Seanad behind.  The four Labour Party Senators remaining are a little sad that we are losing her because she was a fantastic leader for us.  She has also been an inspiration for us in the Labour Party over many years.  As my colleague, Senator Moynihan, said, Deputy Bacik represents the best of us.  The best is yet to come.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise the issue of the 24 drugs and alcohol task forces in the country.  The heart of their work is about bringing together statutory agencies, local drugs projects and community representatives.  We know that if we are to tackle drugs, it must not be treated only as a medical or health issue.  It also touches on housing, economics, mental health and communities.  It alarms me that the Department of Health, on 24 June, took the unprecedented step of suspending the north inner city drugs and alcohol task force.  There are serious questions about that move.  It is unprecedented in the 25 years of task forces.  We are not clear as to the legal basis of the Department's move to suspend the task force.  We do not know why the Department did it.  If it was so concerned about governance issues, as the Department set out in its letter of 24 July to members of the task force, why did it and the HSE sign off on a service level agreement in the spring of this year knowing what they knew about the process of appointing a chair of the task force?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marie Sherlock:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Many people might say there is no smoke without fire.  At the heart of this issue is the independence of the chair, which is not about whether a person is a member of an organisation or is funded by the task force or will be impartial in the role.  It is about how active they will be and what kind of advocacy they will bring about in that role.  That is at the heart of this matter.  I know I am out of time but I am going to write to the Minister about this.  This is not just about the north inner city task force.  This is about all the drugs task forces across the country. for which there are implications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#S00600","speaker":"1683","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I join with the Cathaoirleach in wishing all French citizens in Ireland, and indeed, the ambassador and staff at the Embassy, a happy Bastille Day.

We have seen an increased numbers of people swimming in the sea.  As we all know, swimming in the sea is completely different to swimming in a pool because of the cold temperatures, different wave currents and challenges the sea brings.  Water safety training should be compulsory at secondary level.  A verifiable water safety module is needed in which every young person should engage and get a certificate and acknowledgement.  Sea currents and the dangers of swimming in the sea are very much apparent and well-documented.  I offer my sympathies to the young man in County Clare who lost his life last week.  He was a qualified lifeguard, which just shows us the challenges the sea presents.  I, therefore, ask for a debate in the autumn on water safety at secondary level and built into that needs to be a respect for lifeguards and the instructions they dispatch.  Too often, we see those instructions are ignored.  It is, therefore, something we can and should work on.

This is an issue and a problem for society.  There are no borders when it comes to social media, and in particular platforms like Twitter and Facebook, as we saw in February of this year when a teenager in County Kerry racially abused former England star Ian Wright.  He was very lucky to escape conviction on that occasion.  That was followed by a great tournament, which was sullied last night by that incident with the English players, the storming of Wembley Stadium by ticketless fans, the trashing of the area outside, the booing of the Italian national anthem and a worrying undercurrent.  Some expressed wonder that it was great to have fans back in the stadium.  Perhaps it was not.<\/p> <p>That issue of the racial abuse of sports players also happens in this country, however.

I got to know her in 2016 when I became a Member of this House and she has been a pleasure to work with.  She is always very kind to new Members and is a terrific role model for women of all parties and none who wish to enter politics, so I wish to put my congratulations on the record.<\/p> <p>Today, I will raise the issue of cancer care.  Unfortunately, Covid-19 has impacted severely on cancer diagnosis and treatment, with many people getting delayed diagnosis of new and returning cancers due to delayed or cancelled scans during the pandemic.  It is absolutely horrendous for the patients and their families when this happens.  We know that cancer care has been one of the major casualties of the pandemic.  There was a massive diversion of resources from cancer care and other healthcare to Covid-19.  This was the right thing to do and thanks to the stellar work of many medical professionals a massive number of lives were saved, although many lives have been lost.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise two issues confronting people, and their families, who are facing cancer treatments.  The first is inpatient charges.  People are charged &euro;80 per hospital visit for chemotherapy and the like.  This is capped at ten visits, so the maximum somebody will pay is &euro;800 per year.  However, &euro;800 per year for somebody who may not be working or who has no massive means is a huge financial burden.  It is quite shocking.  The inpatient cost must be capped.  It affects not just people going in for cancer treatment but also people getting any treatment in hospital.  Nobody would deny reaching out to cancer patients and, perhaps, reviewing the payment they have to make.<\/p> <p>The second issue is the hospital car parking charges.  I know the Government is looking at capping them and giving some concessions in public hospitals for people with cancer, but this should be considered immediately and introduced as soon as possible.  Perhaps the Leader will raise that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#U00400","speaker":"1630"},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I congratulate Deputy Bacik.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise awareness of homeowners who are awaiting the outcome of the working group to assist some 90,000 apartment owners who are living in Celtic tiger legacy apartments with substandard fire safety provisions.  In some instances, there are no fire retardant measures at all.  I am in constant contact with homeowners who have been obliged to pay exorbitant fees to rectify the substandard fire safety provisions in their complexes and who are also paying mortgages for homes they believed to be safe.  A defects working group was established under the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, but for some weeks now there have been rising tensions between departmental officials and the members of the working group regarding setting the terms of reference.  I have listened to parents talk about their fears at night when they are putting their children to bed.  They are afraid about whether they will get out if there is a fire and whether they are safe.<\/p> <p>Homeowners are completely innocent in this situation.  I believe there has been almost criminal behaviour on the part of builders who have knowingly cut corners.  There also was a failure in enforcement of building regulations and standards.  The Minister must intervene with the working group to ensure that the terms of reference that are established address the needs of homeowners.  The redress must have a retrospective element.  If one is a professional landlord, one can write off the cost of remediation against tax, whereas homeowners who are paying mortgages are unable to do that.  We have to address that in this year's budget.  We also must create a register of builders who have allowed this situation to occur and block them from bidding and tendering for work in the State, paid for the State, until such time as they have addressed the outstanding defects.  They cannot walk away and pretend they have clean hands.  So far, nobody has died, but it will be too late after a fire and deaths occur to address this situation.  We need action on it now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#U00500","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Obviously, I wish my great colleague and friend, Deputy Bacik, the very best.  She has been an enormous inspiration to me and throughout the student movement.  It is wonderful to have had somebody with such tenacity and commitment in this House and now to see her represent us in the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>I wish to discuss the fact that July is Disability Pride Month.  The month originated in the USA and has spread globally.  The annual event seeks to shine a light on physical, learning and hidden disabilities and mental health conditions.  It is used to talk about disability as an identity, a community and a culture, and a positive pride for disabled people.  It is a reminder that there is no single way for being disabled to look.  There are many ways that disabled people live, whether it is physical, mental or intellectual disability.  Disability is a diverse identity that intersects with race, sexuality, gender, sex, religion and much more.  The month is important for many reasons.  We can all agree that our world is not designed and built for disabled people.  We do not have universal design embedded into our structures.  We do not have universally designed learning and mainstreaming in our further and higher education system.  Considering that 15% of the worldwide population is disabled, it is astonishing that there is still such an egregious divide in our society.  For example, in DART stations disabled people have to ask permission to use the lifts.  Disabled people have to book accessible buses or ramps up to 48 hours before travelling.  There are disabled people who are not legally allowed to make their own decisions, and there are disabled people who are locked out of education in Ireland due to either physical constraints or an affordability issue such as putting their social welfare supports at risk.  We should be angry at how disabled people are treated under our watch.<\/p> <p>I ask all Members of the House to engage with the spirit of Disability Pride Month.  As legislators, we must challenge systemic ableism and the discrimination disabled people face.  We can do this by ensuring we have laws and policies that tackle systemic ableism, but we also have to do it ourselves in our own lives with closed captioning, alt tech and subtitling.  I remind Members that disabled people are not a problem to be overcome.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Annie Hoey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The problem is the system and oppression that we, as legislators, stand over and which we have to correct.

There has been a fantastic show of solidarity in this House in paying tribute to such a wonderful colleague.  I was lucky to have served with Deputy Bacik here since 2016.  As Senator Ardagh said, Deputy Bacik was a role model for me prior to entering politics.  She bravely stood up for women when it was not popular and suffered electoral defeat after electoral defeat but was true to herself and her core belief system.  That paid dividends in the end.  I could not be happier for my Labour colleagues across the House and for the Deputy.  These days have to be savoured because they are a long time coming.  I was lucky to work with her on the cross-party group and in the justice role I served in prior to this term.<\/p> <p>I also pay tribute to Senator Boylan, who also contested this election, and to all who put their names forward, including Councillor Deirdre Conroy for the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  To put your name forward is always a brave thing to do and to do it in a by-election is extra brave so I commend them.  There was always going to be only one winner of the by-election but democracy dictates we have several people contesting it.  They have all played an active role in the democratic process and are to be commended.<\/p> <p>One of the most striking things about this by-election was the number of women contesting it.  I was around the constituency for the past month and to see so many female faces looking out from posters was inspirational to me and, I am sure, to all the young women and girls in the constituency and beyond who saw it.  Hopefully, it will encourage more women and young girls to start thinking about a career in politics.  From whatever background and whatever your political persuasion, there is a place for you and your voice.<\/p> <p>We will have the by-election to fill the place on the Trinity College Dublin panel shortly.  I encourage women to start thinking about putting their names forward and I appeal to the Trinity electors to vote for women and give us another woman in this House.

I too pay tribute to everyone who put their names forward.

Deputy Bacik shows that continuing to put yourself forward pays off in the end.<\/p> <p>Today, an event from two years ago came up on my Facebook feed.  It was an event on zero waste where people came in to us and helped support each other in finding other uses and a practical way of contributing to a circular economy.  One thing that has gone under the radar a little is that last weekend the single-use plastics directive was signed into law here.  The regulations were signed by the Minister at the weekend.  People may not that realise 70% of plastic waste in the marine environment comes from ten products.

It was a special occasion and involved everybody and everything.  There was a vintage care rally with cars from that period, including Kitty Kiernan's car.  She was Michael Collins's partner.  Ford Model Ts and other 1920s cars were there and it brought one back in time.

Senator Keogan raised some of the concerns that have been shared with her.  The difficulty is that nobody would willingly try to do something that would discriminate against some of the people who are not yet vaccinated but in the absence of any other choices, I am not sure what else we can do other than keep the entire hospitality and tourism sector closed, which is not palatable to any of us.  While people will find bits of the legislation that will be published this afternoon difficult, and I am sure we will all express our concerns about it, I have not heard any other suggestions from any party or Independents about what we would do differently other than just open everything up and have a free-for-all.  That is not something that society is ready for and it would not be wise.  I am mindful that I have not seen the legislation yet.  A large element of the legislation will refer to the future use of antigen testing in Ireland.  Senator Gallagher opened the Order of Business by talking about the pilot project that has successfully been under way for a number of weeks in our university sector.  Some 8,000 staff and students have undergone multiple tests weekly.  The outcome of that will be available to us soon.  Some of us have been talking about it for months.  I am sick listening to myself talking about antigen testing.  It will be more widely used in society as we move into the phase of living with Covid as opposed to trying to deal with some of the horrendous issues that we have been dealing with in the past year.  I thank Senator Dolan for raising the matter.<\/p><p>Senator McGreehan has asked me to write a letter to Team Ireland, which I will.  We have been spoiled for choice with sports in the past couple of weeks, between tennis, Formula 1, the Tour de France and the football.  It is good to have something to look forward to.

It is unfortunate that we have to have special days and events to talk about the impact of the decisions that we make on people with disabilities but it is welcome that we will shine a light on it this July.  I concur with the Senator and ask everybody else to do the same.  We can talk about the difficulties that people face and the invisible challenges that they have every day.  It is important to keep it on the agenda.<\/p><p>Senator Seery Kearney talked about the terms of reference with regard to the fire safety standard and defects group that has been working on in recent months.  I read with interest this morning that we are at an impasse because the obvious solution for the people on the working group is for the State to provide a fund to make sure that we can compensate those homeowners who, as the Senator rightly says, through no fault of their own find themselves in terrifying situations.  This is not the first time and it will not be the last.  The State needs to be the first port of call for fixing the issue but those people who were responsible for building defective homes that did not meet the standards and regulations that existed at the time need to be made culpable.  While they may have closed their companies so that they cannot be pursued financially, it needs to be ensured that they never build anything else in this country or any other European country again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#V00900","speaker":"1653","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":117,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#W00200","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I look forward to the resolution.

That is why we can never have a lockdown again.  It is empowering to hear that he is of that mindset.  He talked about the further, wider use of antigen testing in our screening process in future.<\/p> <p>Senator Carrigy talked about hospitality and the serious issue of the 18-month backlog with regard to driver's licences.

I thought it was abhorrent for a Conservative MP to state in her WhatsApp group with other Conservative MPs that maybe one of them would be more mindful if he spent more time concentrating on football than on feeding hungry children.  My retort to her is that maybe if she was doing her job, he would not have to spend so much time feeding the hungry children of England.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#W00300","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":119,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#W00400","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":120,"content":"<p>It is despicable.

If he has not broken the rules, then the rules need to be changed.  It is not acceptable that we have such a level of discourse on what we now all take for granted as a daily part of Irish and international life.  We need to take the online safety and media regulation Bill, grab it by the scruff of the neck, and make sure that these people are culpable.  Society is changing.  We sometimes make excuses for the kind of behaviour that happens on social media and state that it is not the kind of behaviour that happens in real life.  These are real people, not pretend people.

If she sends the letter, I would be happy to support her.  The point of having these is to represent the challenges faced in communities.  They are not to be talking shops that are to be managed and controlled by vested interests that want an outcome.  They have to have at their heart the people living with these challenges to know what kind of a society they live in and life they have.  I would be happy to do anything that I can to help the Senator.  She can let me know.<\/p> <p>Senator Paul Gavan asked for a debate on US troops using Shannon Airport again.  In case he thinks I do not ask, I ask for them and I facilitate any debates that I can.  The ones that do not make the cut are not necessarily down to me but I will certainly make that request again.<\/p> <p>The Senator also raised the TRIPS waiver.  I do not understand the logic behind it other than that we seem to be protecting the profits of big pharmaceutical companies.  There was a report from the World Health Organization on Saturday that only 25% of the world's population is vaccinated.  Here we are thinking that we are deadly in Ireland, with nearly 70% of people having had their first dose and 50% having had their second dose.  If the whole world is not vaccinated, then we will be in a repeating cycle.  It does not make sense to me.  I do not know how I can help the Senator other than to try to have a debate on that when we come back in September, which I can try to organise.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan talked about the Land Development Agency.  He is right.  He has been saying for months that there have been significant challenges and that all of the legal challenges that people have taken have ultimately been successful, which tells us that there is something wrong with the process.  We look forward to the new solutions from the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.<\/p> <p>Senator Higgins talked about wishing people well on 12 July, which of course we all do.  It is a celebration for that community and the people who live on that part of our island.  I do not understand people burning flags to assert their own culture and causing offence to people of a different culture who live on the same island.

The Bill provides for a genuine alternative to examinership for small and micro companies.  It gives these companies the same access to corporate rescue as larger companies, thus providing them with a genuine opportunity to restructure their debts and continue trading.<\/p> <p>In light of the economic impacts of the pandemic, the Government made a commitment to review the Companies Act to simplify and improve examinership laws for the small business sector.  The Bill is a key commitment in the programme for Government and for me and is the culmination of a significant body of work by the Company Law Review Group, CLRG, and nearly a year's work by my officials and me, including significant consultation with business and industry representatives, with the support of Members of the Oireachtas.  I thank the members of the Oireachtas committee in particular for facilitating the pre-legislative scrutiny phase.  It demonstrated that, when we work together, we can achieve real progress.<\/p> <p>The Bill delivers a new corporate rescue framework designed specifically for small and micro companies, which are key to our country&rsquo;s economic success and recovery.  The framework is an alternative to examinership that is more cost efficient and capable of conclusion within a shorter period.  As our country emerges from the pandemic, the Bill will ensure that the necessary legal framework is in place to help viable small and microbusinesses stay in business.  Delivering the Bill is reflective of the Government's continued commitment, as well as my own, to our small company sector and the jobs it provides.  Where this sector and the companies that will be able to qualify for the process are concerned, it is worth noting that we are discussing 98% of companies, which support 780,000 workers.  It is a substantial component of our economy.  While I am hopeful that pressure on small businesses is beginning to ease with the gradual reopening of the economy, I recognise that many of these companies, while viable, will nevertheless continue to experience difficulties as we emerge from the crisis.  In that context, the Bill is essential to provide these companies, where necessary, with a clearly defined and accessible rescue process that will give them the breathing room they need to get back on their feet.<\/p> <p>The Bill's key feature is a novel process that reduces court involvement as far as possible with a view to speeding up the rescue process and reducing the associated costs.  The small company administrative rescue process, SCARP, is initiated by the directors of the company concerned and can proceed without significant court involvement if the company&rsquo;s creditors are positively disposed towards the rescue plan.  The process is capable of conclusion within a shorter timeframe than examinership.  Currently, examinership can run for up to 150 days.  The new process seeks to arrive at a conclusion within 70 days, although this can be suspended where applications to court are required to allow the court the necessary time and flexibility to deal with the matters raised.<\/p> <p>I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill.  Part 1 contains the Short Title, commencement provisions and interpretation.<\/p> <p>Part 2 inserts a new Part 10A into the Companies Act 2014 providing for the SCARP.  This Part, which is divided into 12 chapters, details the legal framework for qualifying for, initiating and the subsequent operation and conclusion of the rescue process.<\/p> <p>Chapter 1 defines relevant terms specific to the newly inserted Part 10A for the purposes of the operation of the rescue process for small and micro companies.<\/p> <p>Chapter 2 sets out the requirements that an eligible company must meet to avail of a rescue plan.  It provides that the process adviser, who is a qualified insolvency practitioner, must determine whether the company concerned has a reasonable prospect of survival.  The chapter outlines various criteria that the process adviser may have regard to when making his or her determination on the company&rsquo;s viability.<\/p> <p>Chapter 3 provides for the appointment of the process adviser by a resolution of the company directors.  The rescue process is commenced by a resolution rather than by an application to court.  The chapter goes on to set out the process adviser&rsquo;s various duties, for example, to keep the original determination as to the viability of the company under constant review and to give notice of his or her appointment to the Companies Registration Office, the relevant court and Iris Oifigi&uacute;il and on the company&rsquo;s website.   It also obliges the process adviser to give notice to employees, creditors and other stakeholders so that they are afforded an opportunity to disclose any fact they consider material to the process.  In this regard, all relevant parties are involved from early on in the process.<\/p> <p>Chapter 4 provides for the rescue plan process.  It allows for repudiation of contracts where the process adviser considers it necessary for the survival of the company as a going concern.  Repudiation allows the company, subject to court approval where appropriate, to accept or reject formally certain uncompleted contracts to which it is party.  Any party to a contract that suffers loss or damage because it is repudiated becomes an unsecured creditor for the amount of loss or damage.  The Bill provides for repudiation to be dealt with in two ways, those being, by application to court or through an out-of-court process led by the process adviser, who will engage and negotiate with the relevant party.<\/p> <p>Under chapter 5, the process adviser is required to call a meeting of all creditors and members to present the rescue plan.  The rescue plan is binding without court approval provided at least one impaired class of creditors votes in favour of the plan and no creditor raises an objection to the plan within a 21-day cooling off period.  A rescue plan shall be deemed to have been accepted by a class of creditors when 60% in number representing the majority in value of the claims in that class vote in favour of the rescue plan.<\/p> <p>Under chapter 6, creditors have the right to object to the rescue plan.  Where that happens, the courts will have a role in adjudicating the matter, as is currently the case with examinership.<\/p> <p>Chapter 7 provides for the treatment of liabilities of third parties for debts of a company using the rescue process and chapter 8 provides for the conclusion of the rescue process.<\/p> <p>Chapter 9 incorporates safeguards for creditors such as various enforcement provisions in respect of failure by company directors and process advisers to comply with filing, notice and information obligations.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Robert Troy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2305\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2305&amp;amp;pid=RobertTroy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There are also safeguards against, and penalties for, irresponsible and dishonest director behaviour.  Chapter 10 sets out the various powers of the process adviser, chapter 11 provides for the remuneration costs and expenses of the process adviser and chapter 12 deals with matters of a general nature, such as the suspension of various time limits set out.<\/p><p>Part 3 of the Bill provides for miscellaneous amendments of the Companies Act 2014 necessitated by the introduction of the rescue process, such as additional cross-referencing throughout the Act.  It also provides for amendments arising from the CLRG's first phase of work in the area of employees' rights as creditors under the Companies Act in line with the recently published plan of action on collective redundancies following insolvency.  These are discrete amendments, which will improve the flow of information to employees as creditors during a liquidation and provide for a dedicated position for employees on the committee of inspection, a committee which may be elected to oversee the liquidation.  Finally, it provides for the application of the temporary amendments made by the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Act 2020 to provide for meetings under the small company administrative rescue process, SCARP, to be held virtually during the Covid-19 period.  I look forward to engagement with Senators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#Z00300","speaker":"1596","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his continued support and for his briefing on the legislation.  I welcome this legislation, which is much needed and will play an important role in giving smaller companies an opportunity to survive as we emerge from this pandemic.  We must ensure businesses have an opportunity to recover from the pandemic and that their long-term viability is not impacted by short-term issues caused by a crisis not of their making.  There is so much focus on larger companies and foreign direct investment, which are of course important.  However, we must always remember that small and medium enterprises, SMEs, the length and breadth of this country are the heartbeat of the Irish economy and that small and micro companies represent 98%, as the Minister of State alluded to, of all companies in Ireland.<\/p> <p>Currently, at least five court applications are required to comply with the processes in an examinership.  This, obviously, adds significant legal expenses to the process of getting court protection and makes it an unviable option for most small and micro companies because of the costs and timeframe involved, about which I will go into further detail.  Allowing small companies with short-term issues to go through an administrative rescue process without the costs and challenges that are part of examinership will give them the best possible opportunity to trade their way back to solvency, which most of them will do.  It is something that has been raised as a key need by business representatives with every Senator I am sure over the past 12 months.  The commitment to providing SMEs with the most effective supports possible in the programme for Government meant it was essential this was addressed.  I am pleased to see Government maintaining that commitment. <\/p> <p>Certainly, in my heartland of Galway city, many smaller companies are facing challenges as we emerge from Covid in terms of short-term finance despite unprecedented Government supports, which I acknowledge.  This scheme will be of assistance to many, thereby protecting employment and providing companies with the opportunity to emerge from Covid.  The fact that there is also a shorter timeframe is essential for this process.  That it can conclude within a ten-week period, rather than the 150 days which examinership can take, is also very important and welcome.  The shorter timeframe is essential.<\/p> <p>The legislation will assist companies that support in excess of 800,000 jobs in this country, that employ fewer than 50 people and have a turnover of less than &euro;12 million per annum.  These companies need help now and we must support them.  The unprecedented supports the Government has put in place have been of great assistance.  I speak to business owners in Galway city and county, and in the west, who acknowledge that.  While they are very thankful for the wage subsidy, the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, and the array of supports that have been given, we all realise these will eventually need to be tapered off.  The ability of companies to restructure with minimal cost and red tape will make a very positive difference to them.  The proposal has already received broad support, in principle, from stakeholders, certainly from people who have engaged with me.  It must also be recognised that it has been supported, in the main, by Members in both Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>I know the Minister of State has a very busy schedule and I am not sure if he will come before Seanad &Eacute;ireann again this week.  If he does, that is okay, but I wish him and Aideen Ginnell, who are getting married this Thursday, well, and a long and happy life together.  I have no doubt that Aideen will need great patience, which I am sure the lady has.  She will need to have it as she knows the time constraints.  I understand the restrictions are testing for all couples throughout the country.  As wedding numbers are limited to 50, and Robert is from a family of 12, I do not understand how they managed it, but they are where they are.  I take the opportunity, as I have no doubt the Leas-Chathaoirleach will, to wish Robert and Aideen the very best for this Thursday. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#AA00200","speaker":"1646"},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":143,"content":"<p>All Members join in wishing the Minister of State well.

I hope everything goes well on Thursday.  I have no doubt that it will.<\/p> <p>I support this Bill.  The proposals contained in it stem from a 2020 Company Law Review Group report, but I recall there were calls for legislation along these lines during the 2009-10 period when so many companies were failing for so many reasons, which we remember.  I am not sure why this did not happen at the time although I presume it may have been because, at that time, the creditors of those failing businesses were the major banks which were themselves failing and were even banjaxed.  It probably made little sense to change the law at the time since it would have been of little practical assistance to anybody.  It is prudent and welcome that it is being done now.<\/p> <p>However, it again shows the reactive nature of policymaking in this country.  Just as the examinership process was introduced in a hurry in 1990 to save the Goodman beef empire from the consequences of its over-reliance on exports to Iraq, the proposals before us are a last-minute reaction to the problems faced by small business as we come out of almost 18 months of Covid cold storage.  In particular, small businesses will have to face up to Revenue liabilities, which have been warehoused and put on ice during the Covid crisis.  It should not have taken this looming problem to spur the Government or the Oireachtas into action.  When it comes to the concerns of small businesses we should be thinking ahead more than we do, particularly when it comes to assisting those who are in difficulty through no fault of their own and providing them with a means to get back into health in a way that does not penalise anyone unduly.<\/p> <p>The examinership process introduced in 1990 has been of great use since then in giving companies the breathing space to engage with creditors and formulate plans to rescue their businesses which may be in difficultly.  However, clearly, it is not an effective process in all cases and is much less likely to be effective for, or appeal to, small and micro companies or to family businesses in particular.  While the process is straightforward in theory, in practice it can be cumbersome, costly and, indeed, intimidating for directors and shareholders.  Five separate court applications are necessary, from start to finish.  This involves legal costs of course, but also other costs such as seeking reports from an independent expert and so on.<\/p> <p>The Bill dubs this new rescue process the small company administrative rescue process, SCARP.  The SCARP process can be commenced by a resolution of the directors and does not need the permission of a court.  In the round, this removal of the court element requirement from a large number of company rescues will reduce the costs on businesses and the overall burden on directors, shareholders and creditors alike.<\/p> <p>The timeframe of the process will also be much quicker, thankfully.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Examinerships run for up to five months, which is a very unsatisfactory length of time for any small business to be put through the wringer.  Under the SCARP, a scheme of arrangement will be drawn up within two months.<\/p><p>It is important that any new system not unfairly prejudice creditors of a business going through the SCARP.  We have to remember that, in most cases, these creditors are themselves small businesses and may face their own pressures.  The Bill contains good protections in this regard.  The golden rule under the existing examinership regime is that, under a rescue scheme, creditors cannot be left any worse off than they would have been had the company been wound up through a liquidation.  That rule is replicated in the Bill before us.<\/p><p>While the process is taken out of court to a large extent, creditors can object to the SCARP and insist on court approval first.  That would deter against any attempt or possibility that the process would be used to evade or stymie creditors.  If a business is in genuine difficulty, it will be in the interest of creditors to see this resolved, to see the business stabilised and to have the outstanding debts paid, so it is unlikely to be seeking court approval willy-nilly.  This is important.  The safeguards against dishonest or irresponsible conduct by company officers or practices such as reckless trading are to be welcomed.<\/p><p>Sadly, it seems to me, and no doubt to others, that there will inevitably be a significant rise in business failures in 2021 and 2022.  Most of these will have been unavoidable.  However, some will have been as a direct result of policy choices made by the Government.  The greatest example, of course, concerns the pub, restaurant and hospitality sector, whose full reopening has been delayed by the Government recently, meaning the vast majority will have lost out on a summer season, which they will desperately have needed.  I am aware of the good intentions behind the policy but I worry about whether the right call was made.  I fear that when we look back at the decision to delay reopening in the cold light of day, the cost of it will be seen to have far outweighed the benefits, particularly given the advances we have made regarding vaccinations.<\/p><p>While the businesses have been kept on life support, there is a danger that they will be brought back to earth with a bang once the supports end.  For that reason, we should do everything we can to assist them to rebuild for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#AA00400","speaker":"1673","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I hope he has a successful week.  Covid might be the reason we want to get this legislation across the line for the summer but it has been a while in the making.  It has been examined by the Company Law Review Group, CLRG, and that has involved analysis by practitioners, businesses, unions and academics.  Prior to that, there was public consultation.  The legislation fills a gap in our examinership laws.  It is tailored to meet the needs of small and micro businesses, enabling those that are viable but vulnerable to restructure their debts and, hopefully, keep trading.  There is no better time to do that.<\/p> <p>Through a mix of grants, loans, tax warehousing and waivers, the Government has supported businesses as much as possible in the Covid crisis.  The Government has been responsive to our calls when we have identified gaps in supports, be they for the self-employed, small businesses or those availing of the Covid restrictions support scheme.  Many a support has come online over the past year.  Despite those supports, some companies still find themselves struggling.  Of the businesses that commenced an insolvency process last year, only 5% went through for examinership.  Under the proposed new mechanism, small firms facing insolvency will be able to cut debt with support from a majority of creditors without the high costs and will be able to do so in a shorter period.<\/p> <p>The amending legislation today represents a commitment made by the Government to look beyond practical supports and review the Companies Act and regulatory framework to simplify and improve our examinership laws, specifically for the small business sector, and to try to ensure those businesses that can survive will do so, not just during the pandemic but beyond. <\/p> <p>There are two key areas in the delivery of this new corporate framework, that is, cost and time.  The international framework for examinership is overseen in the courts.  This is expensive and prohibitive for small, struggling companies.  It is not realistic for a small company to engage in this way so we have to address the barriers so it can access protection and support and retain the jobs we desperately need.  This Bill would oversee a process that would reduce the involvement of the courts as much as possible and speed up the rescue process.<\/p> <p>The aim is to reduce the examinership timeframe from 150 days to 70 days, although there is flexibility to accommodate the courts.  The cost could be lowered from between &euro;80,000 and &euro;100,000 to between &euro;20,000 and &euro;50,000.  The SCARP is initiated, importantly, by the directors of the small and micro businesses and can commence and proceed without significant involvement of the courts.  It is commenced by resolution of the directors rather than an application to the court, and is overseen by a process adviser.  While taking into account the vulnerability of the business in receivership, it must also be fair to the creditors who, as my colleague Senator Mullen said, are often small businesses themselves.  Creditors will be able to vote in favour of the proposal as long as no creditor raises an objection to the plan within 21 days following the vote.  Small companies have to be competitive and agile in respect of how they react to the reality of business, and the proposed framework complements that.  Ultimately, the process has to be more successful than the liquidation process or it will not work.<\/p> <p>I would like clarification on virtual annual general meetings.  Is it just for companies going through the process or is it in general?  Small companies, in particular, need to be productive.  It has been recognised that this is the area we need to work on.  Virtual annual general meetings can facilitate a more efficient way of working.  We should consider this if it is not included.<\/p> <p>SMEs are often referred to as the backbone of the Irish economy.  It is only right, therefore, that they would have equitable access to rescue processes.  Our small business sector represents our neighbours, partners, brothers and sisters and, in my case, the parents of our children's friends.  There are 800,000 employees in the sector, and 78% of the companies operate in areas that are hit especially hard by the pandemic, such as leisure, tourism and hospitality.  Let us get through this pandemic and leave our company law in a better place than we found it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#BB00200","speaker":"1648"},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":147,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  I welcome this Bill, or these amendments to an existing Act.  The legislation is great.  As a coalition Government, we agreed we would introduce it under the programme for Government.  A year on, we are delivering on that, which is really positive.  Now, as we hope for some sort of post-pandemic Ireland, is an important time to do this.<\/p> <p>The main objective of the Bill is to provide for a stand-alone rescue framework to help small businesses of up to 50 employees to remain in business during periods of temporary difficulty.  On Senator Mullen's question as to why we did not do this sooner, nobody saw the pandemic coming.  Considering we are still in it, it is not bad that, a year on, we are delivering on that.  Small and micro enterprises comprise 98% of all Irish firms.  I have spoken about SMEs in Ireland but we do not really appreciate the number of jobs and the amount of money they generate.  When thinking about that, we should always bear in mind whether it is a small or micro company that we are supporting.  Wherever possible, we always should support them.  As the preceding Senator said, 800,000 people are employed in the sector.  Many businesses in the sector have been damaged by what has happened in the pandemic.  Retail, tourism, the arts, hospitality and the service industry, which are really strongly represented in my county, Clare, have been affected.  We have all seen at first hand the challenges small businesses have faced.  This Bill is so important because it will hopefully help them find a rescue plan that will cost them less, keep more of them afloat and make it easier on them rather than having them get caught up in courts.  We are all aware of how complicated and costly courts can be.  This Bill is an important amendment to the 2014 legislation.<\/p> <p>Chambers Ireland, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and ISME were all involved in the consultation on this Bill so it is not as if we just tore into it.  There was really good consultation with many people.  It is on listening to those in the sector we are trying to save that we come up with proper solutions, which is what this Bill is doing.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I only became the spokesperson for enterprise, trade and employment one year ago but in that year I have been combing through everything that has been happening in government to see what it has been doing for that sector.  It has been really impressive to see the amount of supports, grants, advice and mentoring that has come through every sector and especially for small businesses through the local enterprise offices.  It is a real sign we value that sector of society so much in that so much has gone into that sector in the past year.<\/p><p>I have had businesses complain they cannot keep up with all the supports and they are so busy working, they have not got time to find them all.  To that end, I have put together a PDF document of every single support available to small and microbusinesses in Ireland, with live links.  I will give it to every Senator here in order that we can share it with all the small businesses.  Anybody who runs a small business will tell you he or she does not have the time to be looking things up.  I find departmental websites quite daunting to navigate at times.  It is good we get that Bill and the information out there on all the supports we have put in place for small businesses.  There are some really good ones.<\/p><p>I have seen businesses that were never online before coming online and businesses that never use social media or PR tools really upping their game.  People are discovering small businesses that may have been there for years.  Thanks, in some kind of twisted, positive way to the pandemic, they have a presence they never had before.  People are discovering businesses in their areas that they now support.  That is thanks, in no small way, to the supports we have brought to date.  This is another stepping stone in hoping we can try to keep as many small businesses going and not just surviving, but thriving again, post pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#BB00300","speaker":"1659","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I look forward to that link, as I am sure do other Members, which will be helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#CC00200","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":150,"content":"<p>It is nice to see the Minister of State and I wish him well for his big day on Thursday.  There is more or less unified agreement that there has long been a need for the examinership-lite model and that is what the small company administrative rescue process Bill attempts to deliver.  There are many welcome aspects of the Bill, which outlines the small company administrative rescue process.  However, the success or failure of the process will boil down to two things, namely, speed and cost.<\/p> <p>The new process must not only be cheaper than the current administrative process, which is estimated to cost an average of between &euro;80,000 and &euro;120,000, but also needs to be quicker.  It is hoped the new process will reduce the costs to between &euro;20,000 and &euro;50,000, which is extremely welcome.  Any reduction in costs will be welcome if we can achieve it.  However, these costs are only estimates and my concern is that in practice, they could end up being much higher.<\/p> <p>As for the length of time the new process will take, it is estimated there may be little reduction in the length of time it takes to conclude the new small company administrative rescue process in comparison with normal administration.  As outlined in the legislation, the process could take up to 49 days to produce a rescue plan and it could take even longer to implement it thereafter.  At its core, this legislation is about saving companies and, ultimately, saving jobs.  Therefore, I feel there needs to be further provision for workers.  <\/p> <p>It is important that a rescue plan for an eligible company does not include a reduction in the number of employees unless this has been done by agreement with employees and their recognised trade union or representative body, save in the case of a voluntary redundancy process.  Any rescue plan should make provision to ensure collective agreements can be and are honoured regardless of what happens to the company into the future.<\/p> <p>While this legislation may not get the same coverage as other legislation because it is relevant only to small and micro companies, it is important to remember that these companies provide employment to 788,000 workers in this State.  This is significant legislation which, it is to be hoped, will have a wide-ranging and positive impact.  The reality is that the pandemic has taken a significant toll on the economy in general, but especially on small and micro companies.<\/p> <p>Once Covid-19 restrictions ease this summer and Government support and creditor forbearance reduces, it is clear that a cost-effective restructuring process will be required.  Numerous companies with sound business models incur significant debts for many reasons.  This new process must put those businesses and their workers front and centre and ensure this new process is cheaper and quicker.<\/p> <p>We are discussing liquidations.  I need to mention the Minister of State has a report on his desk, the Duffy Cahill report, for many years now.  Provision must be made to look after workers in a liquidation scenario.  We have had Clerys, Debenhams and TalkTalk closures and a list of other examples.  We have seen closures in Limerick at Debenhams and a recent announcement of the Gap store closing in Limerick in September, with the loss of 26 jobs.<\/p> <p>Every time this happens, we say we cannot allow it to happen again.  I urge the Minister of State to act on the recommendations and select whatever is the preferred option and to talk to the Opposition. We will not do anything other than try to be constructive and get this done.  We need to ensure workers are not left high and dry by the process because that will not do anyone any favours.  This process will benefit companies and its ultimate objective is to save the businesses and jobs.<\/p> <p>There is another body of work to be done to ensure those jobs are decent jobs.  That is the work of the trade union movement, working co-operatively with progressive parties like Sinn F&eacute;in to ensure we can make work better.  We need to recognise that while we have legislation to help save businesses, we also need legislation that protects workers in a liquidation because very often they are left aside.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#CC00300","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I wish the Minister of State and his future wife, Aideen, the best for Thursday.  It is unfortunate that on Sunday the Lilywhites will come between the celebrations but that is the way it has to be.  There is no doubt the aims of this Bill can be considered reasonable.  The objective is to put in place a small companies administrative rescue process, SCARP, to effectively reduce the number of companies that go into liquidation and instead give them access to an affordable rescue plan.  There can be no doubt but that in a Covid-19 Ireland, many companies are struggling and, unfortunately, are struggling to survive.  Every effort must always be made to ensure companies, under the pressure of Covid-19-related debts and commitments, have a choice to avail of the new SCARP provided for in this Bill, rather than liquidation.<\/p> <p>In the D&aacute;il, our enterprise spokesperson, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in raised a number of concerns and issues with the Bill, which I would like to raise once again with the Minister of State.  The first is the speed at which the Bill has been brought forward.  This Bill is more than 60 pages long and is set to become the bedrock of legislation in this area for the considerable future, if passed.  In his contribution in the D&aacute;il, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in posed a question as to the compliance of this Bill with European Directive No. 2019\/1023.<\/p> <p>Directive No. 2019\/1023 is, as we know, an alternative to liquidation for companies of all sizes in all European countries, which will reduce the current level of liquidations.  This offers the same function as it is hoped will this Bill.  We are told the Government has asked for a derogation until 2024 for the implementation of this directive, yet we have before us the ideal opportunity to implement legislation that would comply.  It would seem the question remains as to why the Government will not make this legislation compliant and I ask the Minister of State to address this important point.  As was said in the D&aacute;il last week, surely it would be far safer and more effective to make this Bill before us now compliant, rather than try to make amendments at some future date.<\/p> <p>Given the recent events throughout various sectors of Irish industry, which have already been referenced by colleagues, I have to raise my concern as to how this Bill, if passed, will treat workers.  My colleague submitted a number of amendments that were not accepted in our attempt to address what we see as some flaws in this legislation.  Those concerns remain and given the time afforded to this Bill, those concerns remain for the workers.<\/p> <p>As mentioned in the D&aacute;il, the legislation, unlike similar legislation in New Zealand, does not offer enough protection for workers.  This Bill does not offer the protection, unlike that passed in New Zealand in which workers are excluded as a protected class of creditor.  Under section 558N, any equality claim should be excluded from the court's power to stay proceedings and under section 558L unpaid awards to workers should be excluded from write-down without the need for a worker to actively assert that right as a creditor.<\/p> <p>There must be a fear for some sectors of Irish industry in which workers are unrepresented by a union that workers' rights, without the explicit protection of a unique class of creditor, could be subject to some exploitation.  There may be a situation in which workers' terms and conditions could be attacked or undermined as part of the offence of owners' contracts, as was threatened in a recent dispute.  I want to raise again the time afforded to the Bill.  We obviously accept the situation we are in, especially those businesses, as I have already outlined, but speed can often lead to more problems than anticipated and we hope this is not the case.<\/p> <p>As we said in the D&aacute;il, we wish we could give unqualified support for the Bill.  There can be no doubt cheaper and easier access to a rescue plan would always be preferable to liquidation but in light of the issues I have once again raised with the Minister of State, we worry there may be flaws and it may be the workers who will end up being exploited most if these flaws are not addressed.  I thank the Minister of State once again for joining us today and look forward to his replies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#CC00400","speaker":"1684"},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":152,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is welcome.

I come from a small business background and I am aware of the plight of small businesses, especially in times of Covid.  We are starting to come out the other side.  I have been working with many small businesses that are either feeling the pinch or have found recovery hard.  The Bill comes at an opportune time, and the fact that we are updating the 2014 legislation is most welcome.  Some 778,000 workers are employed by small companies.  I know that we have to protect employees but unless we can protect the companies they are working for, they will not have any companies to be employed by.  That is something we have to keep in mind.<\/p><p>Many small businesses, especially across the hospitality and service sectors, have really felt the pain.  As has been mentioned, while there has been a delay to the opening up and expansion of the hospitality sector, many businesses have not been able to open because they did not have outside facilities.  I welcome the fact that Cabinet is looking at opening up these businesses.  The fact that 17 companies made submissions to this shows that there was a real interest in it.  I know that key stakeholders engaged with it as well.  The fact that small businesses have an equal footing with some of the larger companies is to be welcomed.  The period of examinership has been reduced from 150 days down to 70 days and the costs are being kept down as maybe the cases are not appearing in court.  Some of the financial institutions have not been good in working with small businesses and that is what I am finding from listening to them.  This Bill will strengthen the foothold of small businesses.  Senator Gavan referred to Debenhams and Gap in Limerick.  Both of those businesses closed and many employees were hit by that.  While I know that Debenhams is a bigger company and it has a bigger sister company, Gap in Limerick had fewer than 25 employees.  It ended up being closed down and the staff did not get a lot out of it.<\/p><p>The rescue plan has been put in place and it should be binding on all members and creditors where it is approved by 60% in number of one class of impaired creditors representing a majority in value of the claim.  This is referred to as a cross-class cramdown.  The process does not require an application to the court in circumstances where no creditors object to the plan.  These are most welcome because any of the small businesses I have been talking to are really appreciative that these changes are being brought in.  I want to wish the legislation all the best because it is good that small businesses are being helped along the way.  I compliment the Minister of State and the T&aacute;naiste on all the work they have done on this and for seeing any problems that small businesses are facing.  I wish the legislation safe passage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#CC00500","speaker":"1384","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":154,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is welcome to the House.  According to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, there are nearly 1 million people employed by SMEs in this country.  According to the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the Central Bank, a quarter of these SMEs could be vulnerable to liquidation.  Employment and livelihoods are at risk and the small company administrative rescue process could be vital in saving many of them.  It is important to make one thing clear: the Bill before us does not solve this issue.  In some instances, the rescue process will only kick the problems that SMEs face further down the road.  With continuing lockdowns, mass uncertainty and no clear policy or guidelines coming from the Government, however, the Bill is vital.  According to a regulatory impact analysis that we received in respect of this Bill, the World Bank is clear on one thing: there is no consensus on an optimal insolvency model specifically suitable for SMEs.  Our insolvency rates are low but according to further World Bank commentary, it took 13 quarters from the onset of the financial crisis in 2007 before OECD countries reached a peak of insolvent liquidations.  On foot of that, it is prudent to establish an efficient insolvency regime in this country because the worst is yet to come for SMEs and their employees.<\/p> <p>While the Bill may be necessary in light of the state in which SMEs find themselves, the question must be asked as to whether we are looking at a real solution or if we are continuing to patch up a problem that we have created.  The problem is lockdown - the State's intervention in the normal operation of our economy - and the continued uncertainty, with no co-ordination and unfair treatment of businesses.  Some 78% of SMEs operate in sectors that are moderately or highly affected by the pandemic.  These are the sectors which the Government and NPHET called non-essential.  I would like to remind everyone that there is no form of employment or business that is non-essential.  There is a complete lack of respect from this Government and public health toward SMEs.  While this Bill would help viable companies survive, it would not help all the companies affected by the Government's policy these past 18 months to survive.  It is too little, too late.<\/p> <p>There are zombie companies operating in Ireland.  These are companies that are not viable, that cannot service their debt in a growth economy and that the rescue process will not save.  However, we will pump them with support under the false illusion that an end is in sight.  These companies are already dead; we are just keeping them alive with life support.  This is a positive end for some but many will not survive.  Where is the end?  Where is the plan?<\/p> <p>We are considering this Bill and the Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill today, both of which are designed to help business as we emerge from the pandemic.  Are we emerging from it?  We select dates for reopening and then we change them.  There is no clear plan or goal and, in the meantime, we are passing legislation that is designed to keep the show on the road.  The show is over for many companies.  Even if it is not over and even if the rescue process will help them survive, the headache, heartache and hurt that the rescue process will cause for creditors and business owners is nothing to be commending.  The companies Bill is necessary and the rescue process is more accessible to SMEs than examinership is but at the end of the day, we have failed businesses in this country.  This process will save some businesses and it will not save many which, if we had treated them as essential and important, and as they deserved to be treated, would not require the rescue process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#DD00200","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1626078600,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.

Kildare County Council, together with the local enterprise office, LEO, and County Kildare Chamber, published its economic strategy last week for attracting new investment and sustaining industry and enterprise and ensuring long-term sustainable goals.  When we look at the statistics in that strategy, we can see that small businesses make up 92% of the active businesses in Kildare.  That is incredible.  Some 92% of the rates we receive in Kildare are from the type of business the Minister of State is looking to support.  While Kildare has the second highest level of foreign direct investment in the country, the fact is that 92% of our small, family run and local businesses will be helped by this is noteworthy.<\/p> <p>While our rescue framework of examinership is internationally recognised and successful in its own right, the associated costs mean that it may well be beyond the reach of small enterprises and microbusinesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071200002#DD00300","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1626078600,"counter":156,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
