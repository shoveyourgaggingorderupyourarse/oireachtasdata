While delivery of DRT services remains a cornerstone of Local Link, in recent years, a local demand has been identified by Local Link offices and the NTA for higher frequency scheduled services. <\/p>  <p>  There has been a substantial increase in funding allocated for Local Link services since 2016, going from &euro;12.2 million in 2016 to &euro;28.206m in 2021.  The additional funding since 2016 has enabled the introduction of 85 new Rural Regular Service routes, as well as improvements to DRT services and the piloting of evening\/night-time services in certain rural areas which have now been mainstreamed. The new Rural Regular Services operate at least five times per day over a 5,6,7 days per week schedule. They are specifically designed to ensure connectivity with other public transport services and better linkage of services between and within towns and villages.<\/p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann operates a substantial PSO business under contract with the NTA, providing subvented bus services outside Dublin, and in regional and rural locations throughout the country. Bus &Eacute;ireann also has a separate, commercially-run business, \"Expressway\", which operates a number of inter-regional bus routes in competition with other, private, commercial operators in the licensed bus market.  <\/p>  <p>  From a Local Link perspective, the 176 service connects Monaghan Town with Cavan town via the villages of Threemilehouse, Newbliss, Clones town, Scotshouse and Ballyhaise. Routes M1 &amp;amp; M2 provide six days per week transport to Monaghan town connecting the villages of Knockatallon, Tydavnet, Scotstown and Ballinode with Monaghan, and Castleblayney, Doohamlet, Ballybay and Ardaghy to Monaghan. Onward travel is facilitated by these services from Monaghan town bus station to the following destinations: Carrickmacross, Dundalk, Drogheda, Dublin, Belfast, Armagh, Derry, Cootehill, Athlone, Galway, Enniskillen  and Letterkenny. There were no changes introduced since July 2021.<\/p>  <p>   In addition to the above mentioned Regular Rural Services a number of Demand Responsive Services operate in the area.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of new public transport services, including in County Monaghan, the NTA is developing its Connecting Ireland Rural Mobility Plan to improve mobility in rural areas by providing better connections between villages and towns and by linking these areas with an enhanced regional network connecting cities and regional centres nationwide. <\/p>  <p>  The Connecting Ireland plan is a major national public transport initiative developed by the NTA with the aim of increasing public transport connectivity, particularly for people living outside the major cities and towns. It will significantly increase both the number of routes and the frequency of existing services right across the country. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be pleased to learn that Connecting Ireland proposes to specifically expand the public transport network in rural areas and to increase service levels.

The National Transport Authority (NTA) is also engaged with public transport operators regarding the issue of anti-social behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has been engaging regularly with the NTA and the three CI&Eacute; companies, on the issue of anti-social behaviour and in relation to the putting of measures in place to ensure the safety of passengers and staff. <\/p>  <p>  As I previously mentioned, both Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann have reported that the level of anti-social behaviour is relatively low on their services, which is positive.<\/p>  <p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have advised that they have been working extensively with employees and trade unions, with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and their private security personnel to ensure they both proactively put in place measures to address anti-social behaviour, and respond to specific incidents, to ensure as safe a travelling and working environment as possible.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has also provided specialist teams to support these operations including the use of the Garda Dog Unit for both high visibility public order patrols and the use of drug detector dogs when the rail network was being used to avoid the increase in Garda road policing checkpoints, particularly in the south and south-west of the country.  A number of significant detections have been made where suspects attempted to use the rail network for the transportation of illicit substances.<\/p>  <p>  ,An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have also established regional quick response hubs at Portlaoise and Thurles to support our intercity services in order to address incidents of antisocial behaviour on-board our services and this has had a significant impact in reducing ASB and increasing compliance.<\/p>  <p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann also issue non-statutory prohibition orders to persistent offenders that pose a threat to both customers and staff members alike for criminal behaviour and ASB.  These such orders have been served on persistent offenders to refuse them the use of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann services until their behaviour improves.  This has been a very effective approach in overall reduction of risk.<\/p>  <p>  There have been several examples of joint operations with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS) &amp;amp; Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann (I&Eacute;) targeting anti-social behaviour in stations and onboard with various checks with AGS at a range of stations. Irish Rail have also begun a programme to highlight risks of trespass including social media material targeted at younger people, and continue to monitor such issues and actions to prevent further incidents.<\/p>  <p>  Further, as part of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s  2021-2023 Security Strategy, the company has a range of measures in place to counteract and proactively prevent anti-social behaviour, such as;<\/p>  <p>  - An Increase in security resources with up to 20 security teams operating daily on-board and in stations (spend on security has increased from &euro;3.7 million to &euro;5.2 million pa since 2016)<\/p>  <p>  - Fleet-wide CCTV resources, including cab monitoring functionality on DART, InterCity Railcars<\/p>  <p>  - DART text alert line established for discrete reporting of ASB incidents<\/p>  <p>  - Several proactive Garda \/ I&Eacute; operations for specific events, such as the mid-term and Halloween season, northside beaches in summer, concerts \/ sporting events<\/p>  <p>  - Customer Service Officer role expansion on Intercity ensures point of contact for customers to raise issues, and to escalate to Central Control \/ Garda&iacute;<\/p>  <p>  - School visits and videos on safety and trespass in urban areas<\/p>  <p>  - Respect, anti-racism and CCTV awareness campaigns undertaken<\/p>  <p>  The measures in place and those planned are yielding and will continue to yield results, however this is an issue which will require continuing joint action. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have stated that they want to continue working with their employees and trade unions to address the scourge of anti-social behaviour and that disrupting, through industrial action, the overwhelming majority of customers who are law-abiding and rely on our services daily, will not achieve this.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister of State for Transport, I will continue to work collectively with all stakeholders to ensure the safest possible travel environment for members of the public, and safest possible working environment for the employees providing our valuable public transport services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400065#WRG01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":226,"content":"<p>Question No. 99 answered with Question No. 98.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport","counter":227,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400065#WRG01400"},{"type":"question","counter":228,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[52456\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400065#WRG01500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the public transport consultation opportunities that will be provided by the all-island strategic rail review; and the capacity of the review to examine new rail infrastructure projects.","asker":"1451","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":229,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[53687\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400065#WRG01600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the progress of the Strategic Rail Review; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1583","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":230,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 and 151 together.<\/p><p>As the Deputies are aware, my Department, in co-operation with the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland, is undertaking a <i>Strategic Rail Review<\/i>.

Ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050.

Under the National Development Plan &euro;1bn has been allocated to specific carbon reduction measures, including vehicle electrification. <\/p><p>On foot of the Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway Report published in September, the Government will continue to provide a generous suite of EV supports until end 2022. In support of this, &euro;100m has been allocated in 2022 to ensure the continued transition to electric vehicles.  This is an almost doubling of the provision made available in 2021 and underpins the Government&rsquo;s commitment to making electric vehicles accessible to all. This funding will continue to incentivise the switch to electric vehicles as well as enabling the expansion of a fast and rapid electric vehicle charging network to stay ahead of demand. <\/p><p>The full report of the EVPP Working Group is now available online.<\/p><p>Considerable progress has been made, as a result of the work of the <i>Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce<\/i>, to ensure that conditions and policies are in place to support citizens in making greener vehicle choices.

Once funding arrangements have been put in place with Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 and in line with the National Development Plan (NDP), the planning, design and construction of individual national roads is a matter for TII, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.<b><\/b>This is also subject to the requirements of the Public Spending Code and necessary statutory approvals. In this context, TII is best placed to advise on the current status and funding of proposed national road projects in west County Cork.<\/p><p>Noting the above position, I have referred your question, on this occasion, to TII for a direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.<\/p><p>Regarding the R586, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993. Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by Exchequer road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority. <\/p><p>The major cuts to funding for regional and local roads during the post 2008 recession resulted in the build-up of a substantial backlog of works across the country. As the length of the regional and road network in Cork is about 12% of the total, the Cork County share of the estimated backlog would be over &euro;600 million.<\/p><p>Because of the pressures on the regional and local road network, over 90% of available Exchequer grant assistance to local authorities is being directed to protection and renewal works rather than roads upgrades. <\/p><p>Under the NDP there has been significant increases in grant support to local authorities in recent years. In this context Cork County Council has been allocated &euro;68.5 million in grant funding this year. As grant funding for the maintenance of regional and local roads is allocated to local authorities on a pro-rata basis, determined mainly by the length of the regional and local road network in the county, the fact that Cork County Council has the longest road network is reflected in its grant.<\/p><p>As regards the R586, Cork County Council received an allocation of &euro;325,000 this year under the Specific Improvement Grant Programme to progress the road re-alignment at Ilen Bridge on the R586. The drawdown of funds for a project in any particular year as well as implementation of the scheme is the responsibility of the Council.<\/p><p>Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under the Specific\/Strategic Grant Programmes are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis. All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and the Department's Capital Appraisal Framework (CAF). Given the limited funding available for road improvement works it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind. Any projects put forward for consideration are assessed taking competing projects and available budgets into account. The Department has not received any further applications from Cork County Council for additional specific improvement works on the R586.<\/p><p>It should be noted that Exchequer funding for regional and local roads is intended to supplement realistic contributions from local authorities&rsquo; own resources. As the statutory road authorities for their areas, it is open to local authorities to reprioritise investment towards regional and local roads.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400066#WRH00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Network","counter":260,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400066#WRH00900"},{"type":"question","counter":261,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[53496\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400066#WRH01000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the position regarding the proposed development of the DART to Wicklow town; the next steps required to progress this project; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1626","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":262,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[53652\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400066#WRH01100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the progress he has made towards the preparation of a railway order for DART+ fleet and DART+ coastal south; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1481","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":263,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[53688\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400066#WRH01200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the progress he has made towards the preparation of a railway order for DART+ south west; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1583","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":264,"qnumday":234,"qnumall":"[53902\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400066#WRH01300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the progress to date towards the extension of DART services to Maynooth, County Kildare and further afield in north County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":265,"qnumday":236,"qnumall":"[53904\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400066#WRH01400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the degree to which the relevant authority is willing to accept the concerns expressed at various stakeholder discussions with the public and public representatives with particular reference to the need to avail of the opportunity to extend electric rail services beyond Maynooth to Kilcock in addition to Hazelhatch and Sallins, County Kildare thereby investing for the future transport needs of the north County Kildare region; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":266,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[53908\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400066#WRH01500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the extent to which it is anticipated the commuter rail network serving north County Kildare can be enhanced to meet the demand in the short to medium-term; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":267,"qnumday":241,"qnumall":"[53909\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400066#WRH01600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the preferred options for the upgrading of the rail network serving north County Kildare in the short to medium-term; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":268,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110, 147, 152, 234, 236, 240 and 241 together.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputies will be aware, the Minister for Transport has responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.

I expect these trends to continue as restrictions are lifted in line with public health advice.<\/p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, since the start of the pandemic, the Government has put in place a series of both horizontal and industry-specific measures that can be availed of by SPSV drivers.  These measures are aimed at supporting the industry through this difficult period and ensuring that drivers are well positioned to take advantage of any improvement in demand as society reopens.<\/p><p>In this context, I understand that as many as 70% of SPSV drivers have availed of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment which, as the Deputy will be aware, has been extended to February 2022. Self-employed SPSV operators can continue to claim the PUP and earn up to &euro;960 in a given 8-week period, net of expenses. As society reopens and passenger demand for taxis increases, this continues to be a very important support for drivers as they return to work. Drivers coming off the PUP can avail of the COVID-19 Enterprise Support Scheme, worth up to &euro;1,000 to meet the costs associated with returning to work.<\/p><p>Support for SPSV operators also continues to be available through a number of measures designed to address statutory costs faced by operators which cannot be deferred. Standard licence renewal fees for SPSVs were waived in 2021 and I can confirm that they will be waived again in 2022 at an estimated cost of &euro;3 million. The NTA has put in place schemes to refund the Motor Tax paid by SPSV operators in the period 1 September 2021 to 31 August 2022 and to waive NCT fees for the same period. Further details on these schemes are available on the NTA website. The NTA has also extended standard age limits for taxis and hackneys several times since the start of the pandemic, and these are now waived through to the end of 2022, thereby ensuring no operator exits the industry simply because of the need to replace a vehicle.<\/p><p>Recognising that the replacement of a vehicle is the single largest cost faced by any SPSV operator, and in view of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to support the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero\/low-emission vehicles, the funding available to the Electric SPSV (eSPSV) grant scheme was increased for 2021 to &euro;15 million, up from &euro;1 million.  The amount payable under the scheme was also doubled to &euro;20,000 for operators who scrap older vehicles and make the switch to full electric models. The take up rate for this scheme has been exceptionally high and the 2021 scheme recently closed to new applications following the exhaustion of this year's allocation for the scheme.  Further extensions for EV schemes have, however, been recently announced under Budget 2022.<\/p><p>Furthermore, Microfinance Ireland announced on 9 September that a loan finance up to &euro;25,000 is now available to support the eSPSV Grant Scheme, as many SPSV owners are finding it difficult to secure finance from banks and other commercial lending providers. Further information on this facility is available from Microfinance Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400068#WRK01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects","counter":369,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400068#WRK01700"},{"type":"question","counter":370,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[53495\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400068#WRK01800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if a commitment will be made to liaise directly with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to assess the feasibility of Louth County Council&rsquo;s Drogheda Northern Cross Route (PANCR) proposal through the urban regeneration fund from a joint perspective similar to the successful Waterford north quays project in which his Department committed &euro;30 million towards the final project through the NTA; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":371,"content":"<p>Louth County Council is the statutory planning and road authority for its area of responsibility.

The service resumed, on a gradual basis, in mid-June 2020. However, driver theory tests were not deemed an essential service under Level 5. As a consequence, the service was closed from late December 2020 until 08 June 2021. When operations resumed, there was inevitably an increased level of demand due to the backlog. <\/p>  <p>  To deal with the backlogs, capacity has been significantly increased. Prior to Covid, an average of 10,000 to 5,000 theory tests were conducted per month. Currently 25,000 to 50,000 tests are being provided per month and significant inroads have been made to clear the backlog. There is now spare capacity in the system to meet demand.  <\/p>  <p>  The RSA has also been working to extend its online theory testing service to have up to 10,000 online theory tests available for all categories of vehicles per month. These tests are available on a first-come-first-served basis.<\/p>  <p>  Due to the suspension of driver testing services in the initial pandemic response, along with the health protocols required since the resumption of services, services are operating below normal capacity and a significant backlog has developed. <\/p>  <p>  In line with the gradual reopening of services this summer, driving tests for all those who are eligible to take the test and have been waiting longest have now recommenced. Critical frontline workers continue to be the prioritised. The service continues to operate under restrictions in the interest of making it a safe environment while there is an ongoing presence of Covid. <\/p>  <p>  When the service resumed in June 2020, testers were conducting five tests each per day. Since 27 September 2021, this has been increased to seven tests per tester per day.    <\/p>  <p>  In order to deal with the backlog, the RSA received sanction to hire 40 new temporary testers, in addition to 36 they were sanctioned to retain or rehire in 2020. These new testers have completed their training and are now conducting live tests since July 2021. Sanction has also been granted to recruit a further 40 testers. An extra 10 temporary test centres have been opened and a further 9 locations have been expanded within the existing premises, to accommodate more testers. <\/p>  <p>  The volume of tests being offered weekly continues to grow and for the past 4 weeks the average increased to 4098 tests being offered per week.

The grant schemes are kept under continuous review to ensure that they are as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort.<\/p><p>To date in 2021, almost &euro;65m has been provided in grants to support the purchase of electric cars. By year end, this will represent almost a doubling of supports to EVs in 2020.<\/p><p>As a result, the EV percentage of overall car registrations has increased significantly this year and represented over 15% to end Q3 2021. Government is on track as regards the number of vehicles which need to be sold in 2021 to reach its projected annual EV target as set out in the CAP 2019. As of 30 September, there were 45,423 EVs registered in the national fleet.<\/p><p>In the past year, many new BEVs with ranges of over 400km on a single charge have been introduced to the Irish market. Range anxiety is no longer an issue for electric vehicle purchasers, and while PHEVs provided an interim option, but emit both CO2 and air pollution emissions, this interim option is no longer necessary. Government supports should be provided to full electric vehicles, which will be the most effective means of reaching our carbon reduction pathway.<\/p><p>I announced after the budget that grant support for PHEVs will be removed from 1 January 2022. Any PHEV which registers for the grant in accordance with the scheme rules before this date will be approved and the commitment carried forward into Q1 2022. However, from 1 January 2022 the SEAI will no longer accept grant applications in respect of PHEVs. <\/p><p>For the top 10 PHEVS sold in 2020, four are high cost vehicles for which a grant would not be applicable and two have a direct BEV equivalent, that would be more useful in terms of decarbonizing the car fleet. Of the four remaining, three are made by manufacturers that have an equivalent size BEV model and only one model has no BEV alternative in its range. <\/p><p>Under the Terms and Conditions of the grant process, drawdowns normally need to be made by year end (31 Dec). However, due to the slowdown in global car manufacturing, I am extending this drawdown date to 31 March 2022, to allow time for customers to take final possession of the vehicle. <\/p><p>A range of incentives are in place to encourage the purchase of electric vehicles including:<\/p><p>- VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000 for BEVs;<\/p><p>- A grant of up to &euro;600 towards the installation cost of a domestic charge point for new and second-hand BEVs or PHEVs; <\/p><p>- A low rate of motor tax;<\/p><p>- BEV and PHEVs qualify for 50% and 25% toll reductions respectively up to a maximum &euro;500 annual threshold for private vehicles and a maximum annual threshold of &euro;1,000 for commercial vehicles (greater off-peak rates also apply to the M50 toll);<\/p><p>- BEVs qualify for a 0% Benefit-in-Kind rate up to &euro;50,000 without mileage conditions;<\/p><p>- BEV\/PHEVs and their associated recharging infrastructure qualify under the ACA scheme and;<\/p><p>- A grant of up to &euro;10,000 to support the purchase of a BEV in the taxi\/hackney\/limousine sector with an additional &euro;2,500 available for those choosing to make their vehicle wheelchair accessible.

The scale of these interlinked challenges on this island is such that we can deal with them far more effectively by pursuing all of the opportunities we have to work together, North and South. Cross-border cooperation is vital to help businesses grow, develop and thrive on our island, particularly in the context of our new trading environment.<\/p><p>My Department supports cross-border trade initiatives principally through the funding of InterTradeIreland. ITI works to promote trade and business on an all-island and cross-border basis and to help businesses in dealing with the joint impacts of Brexit and the pandemic. Its work is helping to build and strengthen the business and commerce between North and South. <\/p><p>Through its range of programmes, the Body continues to assist and develop cross-border trade and businesses as they face the challenges that have emerged in recent years. Their Brexit Advisory Service provides a focal point for small and medium enterprises working to navigate the changes in cross-border trading relationships brought about by Brexit. The Acumen trade programme is designed to support businesses by funding a part-time or full-time sales salary support to develop cross-border trade. <\/p><p>My Department has been steadily increasing its contribution to ITI in recent years to ensure the body has the resources it needs to support SMEs. In 2022 ITI will receive a total of &euro;11.586 to continue its existing programmes and expand its services. This will help them to develop a cross-border Trade Information Service, which will assist businesses seeking to engage in the new trading environment, as well as a Supply Chain Programme, which will help firms to improve their understanding of and management practices in relation to their supply chains and to identify new suppliers.<\/p><p>Another important cross-border initiative that my Department contributes to is INTERREG VA, an EU funded programme designed to support cross-border collaboration between Ireland, Northern Ireland and western Scotland. My Department has responsibility for funding projects under the Research and Innovation strand of the current INTERREG VA programme, together with our counterparts in Northern Ireland, the Department for the Economy. We have committed a total of &euro;21 million over the course of the seven-year programme, that will conclude in 2022.<\/p><p>PEACE PLUS is a new, &euro;1 billion EU cross-border programme that will build on the success of INTERREG. My Department and the Department for the Economy will be responsible for funding SME development and transition and the Innovation Challenge Fund under this programme. Our budgetary commitment will be &euro;23 million over the seven-year period that the programme will run for. The outline for PEACE PLUS has recently been approved by the North-South Ministerial Council and the programme is currently being finalised.<\/p><p>The cross-border work of both ITI and the INTERREG programme is particularly important in the context of the Government&rsquo;s Shared Island Initiative. Under the National Development Plan, we have doubled the Shared Island Fund to &euro;1 billion out to 2030. With this fund, the Government will work to develop and deliver joint and coordinated investments to build a more connected, sustainable all-island economy. These investments will help to grow business and employment opportunities both North and South.<\/p><p>As set out in the National Development Plan, Project Ireland 2040 will fund key cross-border infrastructure projects, including the A5 transport Corridor to the North West, the Ulster Canal renovation, the upgrading of the Dublin-Belfast rail connection and all-island research centres. While the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will play a key role in the delivery of Project Ireland 2040, responsibility for the work around infrastructure falls under the remit of other Government Departments.<\/p><p>The below table sets out the funding for ITI and INTERREG on behalf of my Department for the years 2021 and 2022.

Analysis carried out in 2016 for the Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty found that 28% of households in Ireland could be in energy poverty i.e. would need to spend more than 10% of their income on their energy needs. Good progress has been made since the launch of the Strategy.  The ESRI carried out an analysis of the number of households at risk of experiencing energy poverty in 2019 and again in 2020. This showed that the share of households needing to spend more than 10% of their income on their energy needs was 17.5% in 2020.  The Survey on Income and Living Conditions supports this, indicating that the proportion of people who report that they are unable to afford to keep the home adequately warm, has fallen from 9% in 2015 to 4.9% in 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  Government policy to alleviate energy poverty for a number of years has focused on supplementing lower income households through the Fuel Allowance and other payments, as well as providing free energy efficiency upgrades through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland schemes and the Social Housing retrofitting programme. <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2022 has allocated &euro;202 million for residential and community retrofit next year. Over half of this (&euro;109 million) will be used to provide free energy efficiency upgrades to households that are in, or at risk of, energy poverty. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will invest a further &euro;85 million as part of the Social Housing Retrofit Programme in 2022. Overall, this represents an allocation of &euro;194 million to retrofitting homes of those most at risk of energy poverty next year - an increase of &euro;20 million on this year&rsquo;s allocation.

the Circular Economy Programme; the National Food Loss Prevention Roadmap; and the Circular Economy Fund. The Bill also gives the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications the power to introduce environmental levies on certain single-use items, and to prohibit their placing on the market where a suitable re-usable alternative is, or could be made, readily available. These measures will be introduced by means of secondary legislation.    <\/p>  <p>  Building on the success of the plastic bag and landfill levies, the proposed new economic instruments are intended to incentivise more sustainable consumer behaviours, and not to be revenue raising measures. Therefore, it was deemed appropriate to cap the maximum rate chargeable while ensuring that this maximum was set at a level which ensured that the levies could retain their dissuasive effect over time, taking account of the potential for inflation over the lifespan of the levies. A &euro;1 maximum was deemed appropriate to meet these requirements. The initial rate of the levy will be set by way of secondary legislation and is expected to be significantly lower than the &euro;1 maximum provided for in the Bill.    <\/p>  <p>  The measures in the Bill have been the subject of extensive consultation as part of the development of both the Government&rsquo;s Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy and the forthcoming Circular Economy Strategy, due to be published shortly. In respect of the Waste Action Plan, stakeholders are also represented through a cross-sectoral Waste Advisory Group. This forum has proved very successful, and a Circular Economy Advisory Group will be established to provide for a similar approach to the implementation of the Circular Economy Strategy. Where any measures provided for in the Bill are to be introduced by way of secondary legislation, these measures will be the subject of further consultation with all relevant stakeholders. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400072#WRO01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1479"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":533,"content":"<p>Question No. 199 answered with Question No. 198.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":534,"content":"<p>Question No. 200 answered with Question No. 198.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Environmental Policy","counter":535,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400072#WRO01800"},{"type":"question","counter":536,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[53890\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400072#WRO01900","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the extent to which his Department has examined the fullest possible extent to which all measures to offset the impact of meeting such targets on industry, sector by sector with particular reference to the need to avoid permanent damage to the economy while at the same time meeting carbon reduction targets;

This includes &euro;10m funding for a Runway Overlay Project at Cork Airport, a project vital for the future of the airport. In relation to current funding, the process to administer &euro;15.6m between Cork and Shannon Airport has commenced and funds under this scheme will be disbursed to the airports by the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  A further &euro;1.4m in funding was provided to Cork Airport over the summer under a Damages Scheme.  This funding provides Cork airport with flexibility to roll out route incentives\/charge rebates, in consultation with airlines, with a view to supporting recovery and growth of connectivity. In this context, the Deputy will be aware that Ryanair has recently announced the reopening of its Cork base from December with 12 routes for the winter months and 20 routes operating from Cork for summer 2022. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is wholly committed to supporting the aviation sector, including supporting Cork Airport during its current closure and future re-opening. Government is also currently considering the possible need and options for further targeted supports for aviation, with a view to aiding in the restoration of lost air connectivity and competitiveness. Finally, the Deputy may be aware that Cork Airport will meet the eligibility criteria for funding under the Regional Airports Programme next year. The level of funding that might be available under this Programme is currently being considered in the context of the Estimates process in relation to Budget 2022.

However, I am not involved in day-to-day operational matters. <\/p>  <p>  While most public transport in Ireland comprises the bus and rail services funded through the National Transport Authority's (NTA) public service obligation (PSO) programme, there is part of the national public transport system that comprises non-subvented bus services, which are run on a commercial basis by bus and coach businesses of varying sizes throughout the country.  Bus &Eacute;ireann operates a substantial PSO business under contract with the NTA, providing subvented bus services outside Dublin, and in regional and rural locations throughout the country. Bus &Eacute;ireann also has a separate, commercially-run business, \"Expressway\", which operates a number of inter-regional bus routes in competition with other, private, commercial operators in the licensed bus market.  <\/p>  <p>  The Covid-19 health emergency has had a profound impact on the public transport sector due to the fall in passenger numbers and associated drop in fare revenues.  In this regard, the Government agreed substantial increases to the PSO budget to ensure the continuation of PSO services throughout 2020 and 2021.  In addition, the Government has recognised the impact of the pandemic on the licensed bus sector - which normally operates on a commercial basis without public subvention but which, during the Covid crisis, was in a situation where its operations were no longer commercially viable, owing to the impact of Covid-19 on passenger numbers and the associated drop in fare revenue.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, in June 2020 the Government decided to introduce new, temporary financial supports for certain licensed services provided by commercial bus operators to ensure the continued operation of these essential services.  Among the commercially-operated routes that have qualified for support under the temporary scheme are most, but not all, of Bus &Eacute;ireann's \"Expressway\" services.  Notwithstanding these supports, though, the Covid situation has still had a profound impact on the company's financial situation, that the Board of the company is obliged to address. Following extensive analysis and work within the company, the decision to consolidate its Expressway network was taken by the Board of Bus &Eacute;ireann in September 2020. The decision impacts four routes - the X1 Dublin\/Belfast service (which ceased operations in November 2020), the X12 Dublin\/Limerick service (which ceased operations on 30\/01\/2021), the 20\/X20 Dublin\/Galway service (which ceased operations on 28\/07\/2021) and the X8 Dublin\/Cork service (which ceased operations on 04\/09\/2021).<\/p>  <p>  In circumstances where a commercial operator ceases operating a specific route, the NTA undertakes an examination to determine whether, with the discontinuation of the commercial service, it is necessary for a replacement PSO service to be introduced to ensure no loss of connectivity to the travelling public. This process includes an assessment of the level of demand for public transport services in the affected area, an evaluation of whether existing PSO services can be reconfigured to meet any shortfall, or whether it is necessary to competitively tender for the provision of services. In light of the decision by Bus &Eacute;ireann to cease operating the X20 route, the NTA completed a detailed assessment of the X20 corridor and have determined that despite Expressway&rsquo;s withdrawal, sufficient connectivity is provided by the remaining operators and the public service obligation is adequately met by other rail and bus services, thereby negating the need for any further intervention on the route.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400073#WRP03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":607,"content":"<p>Question No. 231 answered with Question No. 170.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cross-Border Co-operation","counter":608,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400073#WRP03800"},{"type":"question","counter":609,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[53855\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400073#WRP03900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the details of the cross-Border Project Ireland 2040 infrastructure projects and the funding allocated for 2021, 2022 and 2023, in tabular form.","asker":"1466","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":610,"qnumday":233,"qnumall":"[53873\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400073#WRP04000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the details of his Department&rsquo;s current cross-Border initiatives, goods and or services committed to and the funding allocated to each for 2021, 2022 and 2023, in tabular form.","asker":"1466","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":611,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 232 and 233 together.<\/p><p>There are a number of cross-Border transport related projects and initiatives currently underway or planned. <\/p><p>In relation to rail, my Department in co-operation with the Department for Infrastructure (NI) has commenced an all-Island Strategic Rail Review which will strategically consider the rail network on the island of Ireland in relation to improving sustainable connectivity between the major cities, enhancing regional accessibility (including to the North-West) and supporting balanced regional development.

Later this month the National Transport Authority (NTA) will launch the second 'spine' of the BusConnects programme, the 'C-Spine' which will benefit Maynooth, Celbridge and Leixlip and introduce much improved bus services across the area. Kildare will of course also benefit from the development of the DART+ programme with two separate projects &ndash; DART+ West and DART+ South West &ndash; benefitting the county in the years ahead and transforming the capacity and service level of rail once developed.

In 2020, biofuels in transport replaced c. 209 million litres of fossil fuels and avoided approximately 520ktCO2eq greenhouse gas emissions. <\/p>  <p>  The biofuels obligation, provided for under Part V of the National Oil Reserves Agency Act 2007, requires fuel suppliers to include a certain proportion of biofuels in fuels for use in road transport. Currently, the biofuel obligation rate is 11% (i.e., not less than 11 litres in every 100 litres of road transport fuel is biofuel). <\/p>  <p>  In 2020, over 239 million litres of such biofuels were placed on the Irish road transport fuel market, mainly biodiesel and ethanol and to a lesser extent bio-liquid petroleum gas (LPG). Small quantities of bio-methane were also placed on the market, but as a developing technology bio-methane does not currently fall within the biofuel obligation.<\/p>  <p>  I intend to publish a Renewable Fuels for Transport Policy Statement shortly which will set out the future trajectory of increase in renewable fuels use in land transport, including future indicative blending rates for biofuels in diesel and petrol to deliver targets under the Climate Action Plan. This aligns to our international obligations to reduce emissions in the transport sector, which in the future will involve renewable fuels obligations for aviation and maritime as set out under the EU Fit for 55 proposals. <\/p>  <p>  The Renewable Fuels for Transport Policy will seek to incentivise deployment of developing alternative fuels such as bio-methane and green hydrogen to a greater extent in the transport sector in the future. In the road transport sector, this will be complemented through existing supporting measures such as the alternatively fuelled heavy duty vehicles grant, the accelerated capital allowance scheme for natural gas propelled vehicles and related equipment, which will include hydrogen vehicles and equipment, and the reduced excise rate on natural gas.<\/p>  <p>  All biofuels placed on the market are required to meet strict sustainability criteria as set out in the European Renewable Energy Directive. The Directive place limits on biofuels produced from crop-based feedstock, and a timeline for phasing-out supply of any biofuels produced from feedstock determined to be a high risk under indirect land-use change (ILUC). In addition, the European Commission is currently developing a central database to track and trace biofuel feedstock. <\/p>  <p>  The National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA), which administers the biofuel obligation, may only issue certificates for biofuels placed on the market in Ireland where the supplier can demonstrate compliance with sustainability and proof of origin criteria.<\/p>  <p>  Implementation of the Renewable Fuel for Transport Policy will be subject to consultation with industry in 2022, and then every two years over the course of the pathway to 2030. My Department also intends, in 2022, to carry out an assessment concerning the future availability of renewable fuels, which will inform implementation of the Policy beyond 2025.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400074#WRQ01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":631,"content":"<p>Question No. 240 answered with Question No. 110.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":632,"content":"<p>Question No. 241 answered with Question No. 110.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":633,"content":"<p>Question No. 242 answered with Question No. 235.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":634,"content":"<p>Question No. 243 answered with Question No. 239.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":635,"content":"<p>Question No. 244 answered with Question No. 239.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Transport Policy","counter":636,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400074#WRQ01525"},{"type":"question","counter":637,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[53913\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400074#WRQ01550","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his vision for the future for enabling the transport sector to meet its obligations while complying with international agreements affecting the industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1465"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":638,"content":"<p>Awaiting reply from Department.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traffic Management","counter":639,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400074#WRQ01600"},{"type":"question","counter":640,"qnumday":246,"qnumall":"[53916\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400074#WRQ01700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the degree to which it is possible in conjunction with Kildare County Council to update the traffic management plan for Celbridge area with a view to ensuring major improvements without the closing off of existing routes; if he will coordinate efforts to address these issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":641,"content":"<p>My Department was a major stakeholder in the design of Traffic Management Guidelines, which can be accessed at this link assets.gov.ie\/30277\/e3faaeaef9f74832947150bd6de1fae2.pdf.<\/p>  <p>  Using these guidelines, responsibility for formulating a traffic management plan for a specific town or area lies within the remit of the local authority, working closely with the National Roads Authority and Transport Infrastructure Ireland in the case of national roads and motorways.

The price of fuel on the forecourt is set by the individual retailer and would likely take into account the costs associated with the retail of the product such as those mentioned above together with the cost of having oil delivered.  <\/p>  <p>  The current spike in energy prices arises principally from the global recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and is being witnessed across the European Union as well as many other regions. <\/p>  <p>  For large scale diesel consumers such as those involved in the road haulage and public transport sectors, the Deputy will be aware that the Diesel Rebate Scheme was introduced by my predecessor in 2013. This Scheme offers a partial excise refund to qualifying operators based on the retail price of diesel.  The scheme is designed to provide a level of support when the retail price of auto diesel is relatively high.  The rebate kicks in when the price at the pumps goes above &euro;1.23 per litre; increasing gradually to a maximum rebate of 7.5c when diesel reaches &euro;1.43 per litre.  In Budget 2020, I provided for a temporary enhancement to the scheme in light of the challenges arising from Brexit uncertainty facing the industry.  This involved a doubling of the marginal rate of compensation at prices over &euro;1.32 (VAT inclusive) up to the maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cents per litre.  In recognition of the vital role that the haulage sector plays in the economy, I have maintained this enhancement to the scheme which offers more generous conditions to essential users.   This measure is aimed at maintaining the competitiveness of the road haulage sector and minimising the impact for the sector and related businesses which rely on road haulage services.  Passenger transport is also benefitted by this scheme which is available to passenger bus operators.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that businesses that are registered for VAT may deduct the VAT charged to them on the purchase of business inputs, such as road diesel and other motoring costs. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400074#WRQ02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Exemptions","counter":651,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400074#WRQ02600"},{"type":"question","counter":652,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[53749\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400074#WRQ02700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a local property tax exemption on an unfinished estate (details supplied) in County Kerry will be extended to 2025; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":653,"content":"<p>The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides for certain properties to be exempt from LPT during the current valuation period (2013 to 2021) and the next valuation period (2022 to 2025) where they meet certain qualifying conditions.  <\/p>  <p>  However, certain exemptions will expire on 31 December 2021 and as such will not be available for the new valuation period.

As famine-like conditions are reported, and in light of ongoing military clashes, there is a pressing need for full humanitarian access, a negotiated ceasefire, and political dialogue to find a resolution to the conflict.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland continues to strongly advocate for urgency in the response to the crisis, and for a peaceful resolution to the conflict - through our bilateral engagement, our EU membership, and at the UN Security Council.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is at the forefront of efforts at the UN Security Council to address the conflict in Tigray and other parts of northern Ethiopia, including calling for the most recent open meeting on 6 October, where the UN Secretary General denounced Ethiopia&rsquo;s expulsion of seven senior UN officials. In the light of the intensification of military clashes, including recent airstrikes on Tigray, we continue to work for Security Council action to help promote a resolution of the crisis. <\/p>  <p>  The Government also continues to support a strong and constructive EU response to the crisis.  At the EU Foreign Affairs Council on 18 October, Minister Coveney and EU Ministers for Foreign Affairs continued their discussion on ways to ensure humanitarian access, and to press the parties to engage in dialogue. The need to support African Union efforts, including that of Special Envoy President Obasanjo, was particularly emphasised. There will be a further discussion on Ethiopia and Tigray at the Foreign Affairs Council on 15 November, in which Minister Coveney will participate. He also plans to travel to Ethiopia when possible to speak directly with Ethiopian leaders. <\/p>  <p>  I am also alarmed by the conflict&rsquo;s impact on civilians, including harrowing reports of widespread and ongoing sexual violence, and other serious violations and abuses of international human rights law and international humanitarian law.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the processing time for Foreign Birth Registration applications stood at 18 months due to the dramatic increase in applications as a result of Brexit and the aforementioned necessary rigorous processing that applies to citizenship applications. <\/p>  <p>  Operations at the Passport Service were severely disrupted by public health restrictions brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. During this period, it was necessary to pause Foreign Birth Registration processing in order to focus also on the provision of urgent passport services. When Passport services were scaled up in May 2021 to more normal operational levels in line with the phased easing of restrictions, Foreign Birth Registration staff were redeployed to assist with the delivery of our expanded essential passport services operation, and have continued to do so in light of continuing strong demand for Passport services. <\/p>  <p>  The Foreign Birth Registration Service continues to consider urgent requests to expedite an application on a case by case basis, in cases such as expectant parents, or stateless persons. Over 5,000 emergency Foreign Birth Registration applications have been processed in 2021. Expectant parents and other emergency applicants should make contact with the Passport Service Customer Service Hub to advise of their circumstances, and can do so by telephone or webchat on the Department&rsquo;s website (www.dfa.ie).<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service is actively preparing to resume processing Foreign Birth Registration applications as soon as possible and I will arrange to have the Deputy informed once a date for the resumption of processing these applications has been finalised. My Department is fully committed to allocating the necessary resources to assist with the high volume of applications, with a focus on reducing turnaround times.  <\/p>  <p>  In the context of the National Development Plan, the Government is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service.  Over the next couple of years, the Department will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies to the Foreign Birth Registration and passport services. Budget 2022 also included an investment of an additional &euro;10m for the Passport Service in response to the increasing demand for passports and Foreign Birth Registration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400077#WRT01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":749,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400077#WRT01600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces","counter":748,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400077#WRT01500"},{"type":"question","counter":749,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[53732\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400077#WRT01600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the status of the regularisation of the title for Nenagh military barracks; his plans for the site once this is completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":750,"content":"<p>The former barracks in Nenagh is no longer required for military purposes.

FoodCloud manages the procurement and storage of 23 dried FEAD food products and coordinates the collection of the products by the other partner organisations which are the local charities.  There are over 150 charities approved as partner organisations across the country and over 5,000 tonnes of food have been distributed to communities through these charities since the programme commenced in late 2016. In 2020, over 250,000 people were supported through this programme.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the school meals programme provides funding towards the provision of food for disadvantaged school children.

The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.<\/p>  <p>  There are 1,506 schools and organisations benefiting 230,000 children on the programme with a budget of &euro;65.1 million provided for the scheme in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, entry to the School Meals Scheme has been confined to DEIS schools in addition to schools identified as having levels of concentrated disadvantage that would benefit from access to the School Meals Programme.  <\/p>  <p>  Prior to the introduction of DEIS in 2005, all schools and organisations that were part of one of a number of Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; initiatives for disadvantaged schools were eligible to participate in the programme, which included Breaking the Cycle, Giving Children an Even Break, the Disadvantaged Area Scheme, Home School Community Liaison and the School Completion Programme.

It was formed in late 2020 to build capacity within the disability community so that people with disabilities and their representative organisations can participate fully in the development of policies and programmes. <\/p>  <p>  One of the Disability Participation and Consultation Network&rsquo;s first tasks has been to bring the voices of people with disabilities into consultations on Ireland&rsquo;s first State Report to the UN on our progress in implementing the Convention.  The Disability Participation and Consultation Network facilitated a consultation process amongst its membership to complete that task and I expect that they will continue to feed into policy-making across Departments. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to capacity building via the DPCN, the Minister of State with Special Responsibility for Disability, Ms. Anne Rabbitte TD, launched a new annual Disability Participation and Awareness Fund (DPAF) on 18 October this year. <\/p>  <p>  In this first year of the Fund, resourcing is being provided through the local authority system in order to focus efforts and build capacity at local and community level. It is intended that the 2021 Fund will inform a further funding call in 2022, and in that regard I note the Deputy's suggestions regarding core funding.<\/p>  <p>  Under DPAF 2021, it is open for community and local organisations, including DPOs, to partner with local authorities and bring forward proposals that will support the participation of people with disabilities in local activities, to help remove barriers to community involvement, and to support the promotion and implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) in communities.  <\/p>  <p>  A total of &euro;2.5m will be made available in 2021 to Local Authorities to fund projects in their local area.

I think it&rsquo;s important to point out that this generally requires a response within community and institutional - including schools - contexts, rather than an automatic resort to criminal sanction. The Government recognises that this is wider than simply a justice issue &ndash; it&rsquo;s about various Departments and statutory agencies working together to combat this issue.  <\/p><p>That said, this Government is acutely aware of the impact any kind of harassment can have on a victim and that harassment can take different forms and have different levels of severity.<\/p><p>That is why Coco's Law, otherwise known as the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020, not only introduced new offences but also broadened existing harassment offences and introduced stricter penalties for them.<\/p><p>Coco's Law provides for a new offence of sending, distributing or publishing a threatening or grossly offensive message by any means of communication with intent to cause harm to the victim, which means our legislation now covers once-off communications as well as harassment.<\/p><p>The definition of harassment includes harassing another person by persistently following, watching, pestering, besetting or communicating with or about them. The changes made by Coco&rsquo;s Law to this offence  have also ensured that communicating with or about a person by any means is covered &ndash; including through the use of social media or technology.<\/p><p>It also increases the maximum penalty for harassment from 7 years&rsquo; to 10 years&rsquo; to reflect the harm caused by the most serious forms of harassment.<\/p><p>If charges are to be brought under this act against a person 17 or younger, then the consent of the DPP is required. As noted earlier, this is a safeguard that was put in in recognition of the need to use other means to tackling bullying and harassment in younger people, while still leaving the door open for charges to be brought in more extreme cases.  <\/p><p>When I commenced this legislation in February of this year I announced funding for the National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre at DCU to establish a &lsquo;Research Observatory on Cyberbullying&rsquo;. This &lsquo;Observatory&rsquo; will provide up-to-date research and advice as well as monitor the impact of anti-cyberbullying laws and regulations. It also aims to explore the impact of laws and regulations on those who engage in, or are targeted by, cyberbullying, cyberhate, and online harassment.<\/p><p>I also provided funding for the Webwise &lsquo;Lockers&rsquo; programme to update their secondary school resources which promotes the autonomous, effective and safe use of the internet by young people. The funding has enabled Webwise to update the materials used in schools to include information about Coco&rsquo;s Law.<\/p><p>The Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act provides for offences that cause harm to another person and also for the offence of making someone believe they are going to be harmed. If the perpetrator of an offence under this Act is a young person, they can be considered for admission to the Garda Diversion Programme, which operates under Part 4 of the Children Act 2001.<\/p><p>The Diversion measures specified in the Act include the administration of Garda cautions (in the presence of parents\/guardians) and supervision by a Garda Juvenile Liaison Officer. In addition, a young person can be referred to a Youth Diversion Project funded by the Department which provide programmes and supports to enable young people to make positive behavioural changes.<\/p><p>It may be of interest to the Deputy to know that there are also new legislative proposals that will impact on this area.<\/p><p>The General Scheme of the Hate Crime Bill has been published and it will introduce aggravated forms of these offences where they are motivated by prejudice against protected characteristics. The protected characteristics under the Criminal Justice (Hate Crime) Bill 2021 are,<\/p><p>-  Religion<\/p><p>-  Race<\/p><p>-  Colour<\/p><p>-  Nationality<\/p><p>-  Ethnic or national origin<\/p><p>-  Sexual orientation<\/p><p>-  Gender<\/p><p>-  Disability<\/p><p>This legislation is currently being drafted by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel.<\/p><p>In addition to the legislation referenced above, separate legislation to include provision for an online safety commissioner has been proposed by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, and the General Scheme of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill was published earlier this year.<\/p><p>It contains provisions empowering the proposed Media Commission to make online safety codes; assess the compliance of online services with those safety codes; direct online services to make changes to their systems; processes and policies and design and seek to apply financial sanctions to services who fail to comply.<\/p><p>The online safety codes will set out how social media companies will have to deal with harmful content, such as cyberbullying.<\/p><p>Finally, the Deputy may be aware that the Minister for Education attended the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science recently to provide an update on a number of issues including the measures that are being taken to prevent and tackle bullying in schools. During the Minister&rsquo;s appearance at the Joint Committee, she announced that the Department of Education will commence a review of the Department&rsquo;s 2013 Action Plan on Bullying and the 2013 Anti-bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-primary Schools.  The Minister also announced that during this school year, that the Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate is prioritising monitoring and gathering information about the implementation of anti-bullying measures in schools across all its inspection types. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400081#WRY03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":921,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400081#WRY03200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":920,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400081#WRY03100"},{"type":"question","counter":921,"qnumday":341,"qnumall":"[53731\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400081#WRY03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number and names of residential service providers that have established family forums; the steps taken by his Department and the HSE to support residential support providers establish family forums; his views on the effect of the family forums on the quality of life of day service users, residents and their families; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1512","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":922,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to a service matter, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400081#WRY03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":923,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400081#WRY03400"},{"type":"question","counter":924,"qnumday":342,"qnumall":"[53800\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400081#WRY03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if Ireland has made provision for the recognition of Covid digital certificates issued by countries outside the EU for the purpose of entering hospitality or alternatively, if an EU Digital COVID Certificate can be issued to prospective visitors to Ireland.","asker":"1549","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":925,"content":"<p>Following the successful rollout of over four million EU Digital COVID Certificates issued in Ireland, the Government has decided to expand the service to Irish Passport holders vaccinated in third countries, as is permitted by the EU Digital COVID Certificate Regulations.  <\/p><p>An Irish passport holder vaccinated in Northern Ireland or Great Britain can currently apply for an EU Digital COVID Certificate from Ireland.

To date, the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund has approved &euro;255 million for 164 larger projects, worth a total of &euro;347 million. The Fund seeks to support large scale, strategic projects, which have the potential to transform rural economies and communities and can deliver planned and sustainable regeneration in towns and villages, driving greater economic activity and footfall, addressing dereliction and ensuring the re-use of buildings. In 2019, funding of &euro;325,000 was approved to Waterways Ireland to develop the Ulster Canal project to ensure that Phase 2 of the project is ready to proceed to construction. In April 2021, RRDF funding of &euro;5.57m was approved for Phase 2 of the Ulster Canal Restoration Project. The project will restore the Clones section of the canal, creating a navigation channel extending from Clones to the Clonfad Aqueduct. The overall cost of Phase 2 is &euro;12m and the project was also awarded funding of &euro;6m under the Shared Island Fund in December 2020.<\/p>  <p>  PEACE PLUS is a new cross-border EU funding programme for the period 2021-27, which will succeed both of the current (2014-20) PEACE IV and INTERREG VA Programmes.  The Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) and relevant Government Departments in Ireland and Northern Ireland have finalised the PEACE Plus performance framework.  The value of the new PEACE PLUS programme is estimated at just over &euro;1 billion and represents an opportunity to continue to fund peace building interventions alongside activities which help to make the region a more prosperous, healthier place to live through funding areas of mutual interest on a cross-border basis.  The draft programme document was recently approved in both jurisdictions and the next step is the draft programme will now be considered by the EU Commission.  Following the Commission&rsquo;s approval, it is likely that the programme will be launched in Spring 2022. It is currently estimated that my Department will have responsibility for the oversight and delivery of projects amounting to some &euro;375m under PEACE Plus, contributing funding of over &euro;96m over the lifetime of the programme, but will be refunded over &euro;76m, resulting in a net contribution of over &euro;19m.   It is anticipated that spend will commence during 2022, however, at this time it is not known what the commitment my Department will be making over the next two years as the drawdown of funding for the programme is not spread evenly over the programming period. <\/p>  <p>  PEACE IV is a cross-border Programme co-financed by the EU through the European Regional Development Fund.  It supports peace and reconciliation and promotes social and economic stability in Northern Ireland and the Border Region of Ireland (Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo) and is managed by the SEUPB, one of the North-South Bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement.  The total value of the Programme is c.&euro;270m (including Irish and UK match funding).  It is 85% funded by the EU, with a matching combined contribution of &euro;41m from the Irish and UK Governments.  My Department of Rural and Community Development is an Accountable Department for PEACE IV and provides funding under three of the four programme measures, with responsibility for the oversight and delivery of projects amounting to over &euro;180m in the region.  Over the lifetime of the programme my Department will contribute over &euro;39m but will be refunded c. &euro;33m resulting in a net contribution of over &euro;6m.  By the end of 2021, funding of just over &euro;30m will have been provided to the SEUPB since the programme&rsquo;s inception, with funding of &euro;6.967m paid during 2021, resulting in an outstanding balance of almost &euro;10m to be drawn down before 31 December 2023. <\/p>  <p>  The Libraries Capital Programme will invest &euro;29m in 17 projects, a Small Scale Capital Works programme and the My Open Library service between 2016 and 2022.  This includes funding of &euro;2.8m for the library element of the  Monaghan PEACE Campus, which also receives funding under the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services Programme.<\/p>  <p>  LEADER is a multi-annual programme co-funded by the EU to support rural development outside of farming. The programme plays an important role in delivering on our common rural development agenda, supporting communities and enterprises in progressing employment, social inclusion and environmental projects at local level. Several North-South LEADER cooperation projects have been approved for funding by North South Local Action Group partners and when delivered, will provide great benefits for rural communities in both jurisdictions. The total value of the southern element of these co-operation projects is just over &euro;1.1m.<\/p>  <p>  The next LEADER Programme to be delivered under a new EU CAP framework will not commence until 2023. To bridge the gap between the 2014-2020 programme and the next framework programme, my Department launched a Transitional LEADER Programme for the period 2021-2022, which commenced on 1 April 2021. The Transitional Programme has a budget of &euro;70m for the period 2021-2022, which is co-financed by the EU.  The programme will place a focus on recovery from the impact of Covid-19, community capacity-building, digitalisation, and climate action. <\/p>  <p>  The &euro;70m is being allocated as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;65m is being allocated to support locally-led rural development across the 29 Local Action Groups (LAGs)<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;3m is being allocated to support the LEADER Co-operation measure which encourages rural areas to work together on joint projects with mutual benefits for each participating area<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;2m will be allocated to prepare for the next LEADER Programme.<\/p>  <p>  The increase in the Co-operation measure will provide funding for LAGs to work together on inter-territorial or trans-national LEADER projects.<\/p>  <p>  In Northern Ireland, to date Letters of Offer worth &pound;60.9m (99% of the total Local Action Group (LAG) project allocation of &pound;61.3m) have been issued across the schemes to rural businesses, the Community Voluntary Sector and to Councils for the benefit of rural communities. Total LEADER investment spend to date is &pound;55m of which &pound;45.1m is project spend. <\/p>  <p>  Cooperation encourages and supports LAGs to undertake joint actions with other LAGs taking a similar approach in another region, EU Member State or a third country. There are currently eight LEADER Co-operation projects which include North South Local Action Group partners and represent an investment of close to &pound;2.5m. This includes the International Appalachian Trail in the Northwest as well as Industrial Heritage, Coastal defence and regeneration projects. These projects have taken time to develop but are now well advanced and nearing completion. When completed, these projects will generate great benefits for local communities in both jurisdictions and it is hoped that these relationships can be developed going forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021110400085#WRCC01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1083,"content":"<p>Question No. 396 answered with Question No. 395.<\/p>"}]
