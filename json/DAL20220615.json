I look forward to her response. <\/p><p>We all know the importance of early intervention for children when it comes to critical therapy services.  I know this is also a matter close to the Minister of State's own heart, and that of the Taoiseach.  I have spoken to both of them previously about cases I have been working on and they are also looking at these issues and trying to find the answers.  However, I am sorry to say that in many cases at the moment, we are not getting there soon enough.  What is worse, for many worried parents, is the complete lack of empathy shown by the HSE.  I will read a recent email from a very stressed parent in my area.  She states:<\/p> <blockquote> \t... I have another pressing concern for [my son].  He is in serious need of speech and language therapy.  He was [given] an initial assessment for speech and language in Shamrock Plaza in April 2021.  We were [given] exercises to do and were scheduled to go back in June 2021.  We received communication that we had been transferred to the disability team.  There has been a lack of communication from then in the past year apart from last summer when they were in the process of moving this service over. <br \/><br \/>I've called numerous times to try [and] speak to someone.  The only communication I've received in this regard is a letter to tell me to stop ringing them.  They are too busy to give [my son] an appointment.  It is absolutely ridiculous how our children and the families of these children are being treated.<br \/><br \/>[My son]'s paediatrician has sent letters to the service explaining the urgency of the situation ...  They haven't even received a response to these letters.<br \/><br \/>[My son] is scheduled to start preschool [at the end of August this year] and national school in 2023.  He is being let down by these so called services again and again.  He is well able to attend main stream school but the longer he is left without these services, the harder it will be for him to settle into school. <\/blockquote>  <p>At the end of that email, the lady in question wrote a very serious line, asking, &quot;Can you please help some very stressed parents?&quot;  They are at breaking point.  What I want to know is how the Minister of State can help.  Would she agree that this is no way to treat parents?  The parents who are contacting me are at breaking point.  The communication from the HSE to the parents has not been acceptable.  This lady told me she has been tormented.  She has been ringing and ringing and yet has not received any other information.  No one is communicating with her.  What can we do?  How are we with regard to early intervention services for the children who need them in CHO 5, Carlow-Kilkenny?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500003#A00500","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1655280720,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter and for giving me the opportunity to speak on it.  She is right that I take this issue very seriously.  A script has been circulated but I am not going to stick to it.  I would like to tell the Deputy the case she has raised is unique.  I would like to say that parent is the only parent in the country who is experiencing this.  I would hate that parent to think I have sat on my hands for the past 12 months.  I have repeatedly asked the HSE to improve its communication.  To spend the time to write a letter to that parent to tell her to stop contacting the HSE is unforgivable.  There is no excuse for that.  That woman, like any other parent, is seeking services for her child so she can give him the best start in life.  That is what early intervention is about.  Time and again, communication has failed us, whether in how we communicate with parents, how we communicated the reconfiguration of progressing disability services for children and young people, PDS, or how we told parents what PDS teams they were part of.  We have failed again and again.<\/p>  <p>  That is why I secured funding in the most recent budget to ensure we would have administrative staff on all those teams.  If we had dedicated people to answer the phone and ensure communications went out, parents would not get to the level of frustration where they have to continuously contact their public representatives to make representations so their child may get seen to or even find out where they are on the list.  The plan was that there would be two posts, a grade 3 and a grade 5, on each of those teams, so the telephone would be answered and proper communications made.<\/p> <p>My office has worked tirelessly with national head office within the HSE to support it in terms of what good communications might look like and what parents are seeking, that is, information on when the team will be reconfigured and how the process will involve the parents.<\/p> <p> It is regrettable that the parents' forum part of PDS has been established in only five of the 91 teams.  Through this forum, parents can come together and get a clear understanding.  When I was in Cork recently, one parent said that, if parents knew what the plan was and understood it, they would work with the HSE but that there had been no communication whatsoever.  This is no way to treat parents.  Communication is the essence of what PDS should be about from the start, not telling parents where their children's cases are in April, moving them in June only to then leave them not knowing what is happening.<\/p> <p> Without proper early intervention and diagnosis, services cannot be accessed.  The HSE talks about delivering needs-based services, and we know from recent months that, if people want to access social welfare and education services, they must have their diagnoses.  Early intervention is key.<\/p> <p> The Deputy asked about CHO 5, what position it was in compared with other CHOs and so on.  No different from any other CHO, the Deputy's CHO is under immense pressure relating to the recruitment of staff.  To support teams on the ground, I wrote to the T&aacute;naiste in recent weeks asking for occupational therapists, physiotherapists and speech and language therapists to be included on the critical skills list.  Doing this would be important.  I have also met Mr. Paul Reid and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, in recent weeks.  We want to put together a roadmap - we will have it in the next four weeks - for bolstering our PDS teams.  While I am committed to the PDS, we must consider more agile ways of supporting families in getting interventions.  This would involve returning therapists to special schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500003#A00600","speaker":"1484","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655281320,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I can see how passionate the Minister of State is.  I met CHO 5 two weeks ago when I raised my concerns about communications regarding services.  The CHO told me it was understaffed.  While I believe it is doing its best, there is no communication from the HSE to the many families involved.  Some sort of system needs to be put in place so that parents can be told there is a plan.  We need a plan from all of the CHOs, although I can speak only about CHO 5.<\/p>  <p>  Early intervention is important.  From speaking with parents, I know they are tormented about this and concerned for their children.  Could there be at least more communication with them so that they are told what will happen but that it will take a few months longer because the CHO is understaffed?  As the Minister of State knows, it is unfair if there is no communication.  I am concerned for the parents and the children.  It is not good that parents are contacting us saying they cannot get answers.  I even feel I am not getting answers unless I go to the Minister of State.<\/p>  <p>  We need to recruit staff as quickly as we can.  We cannot have children not being assessed or not receiving the therapies they deserve just because their parents do not know what is happening.  We need to sort out this issue as soon as possible.

For the past two years, I have been successful in the funding I have acquired.  While I am grateful for that, it is disheartening to secure enough funding for 475 posts but for it not to be operationalised on the ground.  I was disturbed to discover recently that the HSE did not have a pay grade for behavioural therapists.  Section 38 and section 39 organisations do.  I am grateful that Mr. Reid has taken on board this issue and I hope to see behavioural therapists as part of my plan.<\/p>  <p>  Funding is available, so this is not a resource issue.  We need to consider a more agile approach.  I am working with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, on trying to create more third level spaces, but let us be realistic, it will take three to four years for those places to come on board.  This is why the critical skills list is important, as is an examination of what is being produced in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK in terms of speech and language services.  From what I gather from CORU, only two modules are missing.  Why not recruit those staff but train them in those two modules while they are in place?  The main dearth of delivery is in speech and language therapy.  We need to consider a more agile approach that works with the universities across the Border that are producing speech and language therapists and creates opportunities for them.  I have also discussed assistant psychologist posts and funding and supporting assistant psychologists in education as a way of encouraging them into the service.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that we return our teams to their maximum capacity.  Until such time as they are at least 90% staffed, we cannot train young people coming through college because there will not be proper clinical oversight.<\/p>  <p>  A great deal is happening and I hope that I will be able to answer the Deputy better within the next four weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500004#B00300","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1655281320,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500004#B00400","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","time":1655281320,"counter":15,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500004#B00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1655281320,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Baineann mo cheist le barda Naomh Monica in Ospid&eacute;al na hOllscoile, Gaillimh.

I heard that it was closed for three weeks.  I decided to write to the hospital's management and ask it some basic questions about when it closed, why it was closed, when it was going to reopen and, most importantly, what the implications were for the patients on the main gynaecology ward of UHG, which serves approximately 1 million people from Donegal to Galway.  The Minister of State is familiar with the hospital.<\/p><p>Savita Halappanavar died in 2012.  Her death and the deaths of many other women - significantly, until Deputy Martin Browne entered the Chamber, all of the representatives on the floor were female, but this matter is of concern to us all, including the male Deputies - were never to happen again, so we developed a national maternity strategy.  Here we have UHG's main ward closed, though.<\/p><p>When I got answers, I found out that it had been closed since March.  Was the Minister of State aware of that?  She can answer me later, but the Minister was certainly not aware of it, and neither were people in Galway.  People are contacting Deputies at their peril, terrified that something might happen to them.  We call them &quot;whistleblowers&quot; when all they are doing is making basic facts known to us.  I found out to my horror that the ward had been closed since 23 March.  I am told that it will not be reopening, although it is not put in that way.  The hospital's management gave me no date because the hospital has no staff.  It does not tell me what staff the hospital does not have or what the management has done to address this issue since March.  The management tells me that there are no consequences to the closure, which begs the question as to why the ward was necessary in the first place.<\/p><p>I will put this in perspective.  The person involved has given me permission to read out this correspondence.  I will not use her name: &quot;I heard you on [the local radio] and I was so upset to hear that the HSE has told you that the closure of the main Gyne ward in UHG has had no impact on care well let me tell you my story.&quot;  She does this in four very short lines, at the start of which she gives her name and says that she had an operation elsewhere, after which she took ill at home and was brought by ambulance to UHG.  She continues:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe harrowing scenes we then witnessed in the Emergency Surgical Unit were beyond distressing.<br \/><br \/>I then waited 3 nights on a trolley after major surgery before I could be given a bed in St Angela's [this is one of the two wards identified for use while St. Monica's ward is closed].  Every day I heard o we'll have a bed today for you.  I was admitted on [Tuesday at 1.30 a.m.] and did not get a bed until that Friday evening at 6.30pm. <\/blockquote> <p>It is unusual for me to read out something, but when I was trying to digest the answer and see where the meaning was, that brought it home that this is spin.  It is unacceptable that this is the reality.  I spoke to that person and she said she witnessed patients on the ground with blankets over them.  I will leave it to the Minister of State to answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500004#B00600","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655281920,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this question and it is not the first time she has raised it here.  I have also heard the Deputy talk about it locally.  As the Deputy has said, St. Monica's ward in University Hospital Galway was temporarily closed on 23 March this year, but I am pleased to report the ward reopened on 13 June.  I reassure the Deputy that during this time all gynaecology patients were cared for in St. Angela's ward and we are aware of that.  Experienced staff from St. Monica's ward provided care to the women in St. Angela's ward.  In addition, women who experience a foetal loss were cared for in St. Catherine's antenatal ward by experienced midwives.  No gynaecology surgeries were cancelled due to the ward closure or due to bed capacity during that time.<\/p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question I was not aware it was closed initially and now I am telling the Deputy it is open as of 13 June.  In the answer I have and which the Deputy has, there is no reason given that ward closed so I cannot answer that question the Deputy asked me.  As part of the Saolta University Health Care Group, University Hospital Galway is the Saolta model 4 hospital delivering emergency medicine, acute medicine and acute surgical and critical care 24 hours a day, seven days per week.  It is one of the major teaching hospitals and it is partnered with the National University of Ireland, Galway.  Since 2018, &euro;3.1 million in funding has been provided for additional staff for women's health services in University Hospital Galway, and the Government is committed to promoting and improving women's health outcomes.  It was only this morning that I read in our local newspaper about the menopause clinic that will be opening in September this year.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE's national women's and infant's health programme has developed an ambulatory gynaecological model of care that centres on the establishment of one-stop see-and-treat ambulatory gynaecology clinics.  The development of these clinics will help to improve access to gynaecological services, reduce the requirement for multiple gynaecological appointments and ensure sustainability of service provision into the future.  Importantly, it will help to improve clinical outcomes.  It is estimated that approximately 70% of general gynaecological referrals are suitable for management in this setting.  The roll-out of this new model of care began in 2020 and at present nine of these clinics are operational, including the one in University Hospital Galway.<\/p>  <p>  I confirm that St. Monica's ward has reopened and that the patients have been provided with care in other wards in the hospital.  I apologise that the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, is not here himself to answer the question, but at the same time he has taken on board what the Deputy has raised here and he has asked questions on it.  I am glad to see the outcome is this ward is operational again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500005#C00200","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1655281920,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I know he is busy and I know exactly how busy the Minister of State is.  I pay tribute to her work all the time but this is the most serious situation.  This is spin upon spin.  If the ward is closed because of a lack of staff, and I welcome that it is reopened, then how did it suddenly reopen?  Where did they get the staff from?  Why did they have to close it in the first place?<\/p>  <p>  There was mention of communications in the previous Topical Issue matter and I understand the communications unit had no idea St. Monica's ward was closed since March.  I did not know it was closed.  The person who told me said in great fear that it was closed for three weeks.  It was closed since March and nobody was going to tell us that.  It was not going to reopen on whichever date the Minister of State gave us and we do not know if all the beds have reopened.  I am a female Deputy and I have read all the reports, including the report on the series of deaths in Portiuncula University Hospital and the long-term consequences of practices there.  I have read the report on the Midlands Regional Hospital Portlaoise, the report on Savita Halappanavar and all of the reports, and here we are.  Two years ago I was obliged to bring a motion before the D&aacute;il for the implementation of the national maternity strategy, following on HIQA's condemnation.  I will take the word \"condemnation\" back because HIQA is not inclined to condemn but it had serious concerns with the failure to implement the national maternity strategy more than halfway through its term.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State does not engage in spin and that is the last thing I want.  When I raised this two weeks ago, I got all the good news.  I read the strategies and I do not need to be told about these things.  I am here to highlight an unacceptable situation, disingenuous communications, the most serious consequences for women and a pretence that they are being treated in other wards that are at capacity.  I visited someone in hospital a few weeks ago and there were 17 people there, men and women, in various stages of distress and undress, and the nurses were run ragged.

When we talk about spin and everything else, I know the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, takes this role seriously, so much so that he paid a surprise visit to the accident and emergency department in University Hospital Galway last Thursday night week.

I am glad to see the ward is open but I will be twice as happy when I know it is open to full capacity.  People entering the gynaecological side of University Hospital Galway are going there for various reasons and there are various levels of trauma from which we need to protect each woman who is passing through it.  It could be a woman getting the good news she is pregnant, it could be a woman in for a 12-week scan, it could be a lady who is experiencing the loss of a baby or it could be other ladies who have gone in for many other issues.  We need to ensure the hospital works to maximise the supports for women who are entering it.

This anomaly was exposed by Tracy McGinnis last week in the midst of grieving for her beloved son, Brendan Bjorn.  She is seeking action from the Government to amend the legislation and she has put forward a solution she believes will ensure no other parent faces the additional pain and suffering added to grief already felt following the loss of a child.  I am sure that is the most difficult time in any parent's life.  Because Brendan was 17 and in receipt of disability allowance, which due to the severity of his disability, his mother collected for him weekly, on his death the payment ceased immediately.  If Brendan was 15 and in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance, that payment would have continued for 12 weeks.  What it comes down to is the question of what is the difference between a 15 year-old with a disability and a 17 year-old with a disability when they pass away.  Why should they be treated differently based on age?  This is wrong, it has been highlighted by Tracy, and it needs to be fixed because this can and should never happen again to any parent in this State.  I commend Tracy on looking out, at this time of immense grief, and trying to ensure this does not happen to any other parent.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday I wrote to the Minister with a draft amendment that will fix this situation and see disability allowance treated the same as domiciliary care allowance when it comes to children who are cared for at home after they pass away.<\/p> <p>I ask the Minister to accept that amendment, make any necessary changes and bring it forward urgently.  Having spoken to Tracy, I also ask that the amendment is done in the name of Brendan Bjorn as a fitting tribute to him.<\/p> <p> I reached out to Tracy yesterday.  It was hard to find the words to say to her because on 17 May, her whole world came crashing down.  Brendan was 17 years of age and she had cared for him at home each day since his birth.  Most of us here can only imagine the immense loss Tracy must feel.  I express my deepest sympathies to her and to Brendan's brother.<\/p> <p> All of this came about initially following a letter that was sent from the Minister's Department asking Tracy to repay the disability allowance that was paid out the day after Brendan died.  I acknowledge the Minister rightly apologised for that and the payment is not now owed.  However, the wider issue here is the way in which disability allowance is treated after a child passes away.  The other anomaly here is the fact that many other social welfare payments continue for six weeks after a person has passed away.  Disability allowance is one of those payments but only in respect of a recipient who is a spouse or partner.  The disability allowance, when it is paid to a spouse or partner, continues for six weeks but not when it is paid to a son or daughter.  Such people face an immediate cliff edge when they lose a child.<\/p> <p> I raise the issue this morning to ask the Minister to please consider that amendment.  She can fix the situation today and I ask her to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500005#C00800","speaker":"1604","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655282520,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I again extend my sympathies to Ms Tracy McGinnis on the loss of her dear son, Brendan, and to his brother, Declan.<\/p>  <p>  This matter came to my attention at the weekend.  I apologised on behalf of the Department and I accept we need to look at the matter.  I am committed to doing that.  I will put some context to how the system works.  The key role of the Department of Social Protection is to provide income support where an income need arises because of a particular contingency, be that illness, disability, caring or unemployment.  Disability allowance is the Department's main income support for people who have a disability.<\/p>  <p>  To be eligible for disability allowance, the disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the person must be aged between 16 and 66 years of age.  The nature of the disability must substantially restrict a person's ability to undertake work that would otherwise be suitable for persons of similar age, experience and qualification.  The allowance is also subject to a medical assessment, a means test and an habitual residency requirement.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently just under 156,000 recipients of disability allowance with expenditure in 2022 expected to be almost &euro;1.9 billion.  The current maximum personal rate of payment is &euro;208, with the maximum adult dependant rate at &euro;138.  Rates for child dependants are &euro;40 for children under 12 and &euro;48 for children over 12.<\/p>  <p>  The main legislative provisions relating to payments after death are contained in section 248, chapter 2 of Part 9 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005, as amended.  If a recipient of disability allowance dies and there is an increase for an adult dependant in payment, the payment continues for six weeks.  If a recipient of disability allowance dies and there is no increase for an adult dependant, entitlement to payment ceases when that person passes away.  However, if another person is in receipt of carer's allowance in respect of that person, the carer's allowance payment will continue for a period of 12 weeks.  In circumstances where a person is in receipt of another social welfare payment together with a half-rate carer's allowance, then the half-rate carer's allowance will also continue for 12 weeks.  The carer's support grant, which is paid on the first Thursday in June, will automatically be paid where carer's allowance is paid on that date.  This will also include instances where the person being cared for has passed away before that date.<\/p>  <p>  The Department recognises the need for a transition period during which people can grieve and plan for a life following the death of a family member.  If a person is unable to collect a payment or manage his or her financial affairs, that person can appoint an agent to collect social welfare payments on his or her behalf.  Where disability allowance is paid to a collection agent, the Department may not be aware of the relationship between the agent and person who was in receipt of disability allowance.  In many cases agents may be a spouse, adult child or a non-relative, such as a carer, neighbour or a manager of a residential care setting.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious of the matter the Deputy has raised.  I know Tracy must be suffering unthinkable grief following the sad loss of Brendan.  That, of course, was not helped by the correspondence she received from my Department.  For that, I again apologise.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is staffed with hard-working, dedicated people who went above and beyond for our citizens during the recent Covid-19 pandemic.  They deal with members of the public, including those enduring a period of hardship, with care and compassion.  This example has shown us that sometimes we get it wrong and we have to do better.  We must learn lessons and will improve our processes.  I have no doubt we will do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500006#D00200","speaker":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1655282520,"counter":27,"content":"<p>If the Department does indeed recognise the need for a transition period during which people can grieve and plan a life following the death of a family member, then this anomaly should be fixed.  It can be fixed easily and I have sent the amendment to the Minister.  I would appreciate it if, in her response, the Minister would confirm whether she believes this is an anomaly.  What is the difference between a 14- or 15-year-old child with a disability, who is in receipt of domiciliary care allowance and who passes away and a child who is 16, 17, or 18 years old and in receipt of disability allowance?  Whether that payment continues should not be dependent on age, the payment the person is receiving or whether a wife, spouse, partner, son or daughter is accepting the payment.  That makes no sense.  It should not be the case.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister referred to the letter that was sent by the Department.  I acknowledge what she has said.  That is fine.  To be honest, I was not going to raise the matter of the letter.  I did so only to give a bit of context because that is how this all came about.  It is how this anomaly was exposed in the first place.  The wider issue here is not the letter.  The issue is the fact that disability allowance should be treated in the same way as domiciliary care allowance when a child who is in the care of a parent at home and is in receipt of disability allowance passes away.  That is an anomaly.  If that anomaly were fixed, there would be no letters and the issue would not arise.  The issue is not so much the letter, albeit the Minister is right that communication needs to be considered.  I find it hard to believe the Department in certain circumstances may not be aware of who the collecting agent is and what his or her relationship is with the person involved because the Department knows a lot of things.  Even if the names of the collecting agent and the child are not the same, I find it difficult to understand that the Department would not know the agent who is collecting a payment from the Department of Social Protection or what their relationship is to the eligible person.  I find that hard to believe.  Will the Minister accept this is an anomaly?  Will she consider the amendment I have proposed?

The first is the fact that workers on the ground within our horticultural sector feel as though decisions on access to horticultural peat have been seen as a done deal.  It is felt as though now that the furore over the issue has abated, the Government feels as though it is business as usual and  the sector has been left to pick up the pieces and carry on.  That was the distinct impression a representative of the sector got after confronting a junior Minister at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine about the issue.  The operator felt sidelined and ignored and was more or less told that the Department hoped it had weathered the storm and could move on.  In the same way, the working paper compiled by three Departments totally ignored the recommendations of the working group on the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry.  That was a pivotal moment, and is the second reason for me raising the matter.<\/p><p>Following a series of delays, the final report of the working group on the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry was published.  It was more or less ignored, despite many sensible recommendations being set out in the report.  The possibility of developing primary legislation to resolve the dual issues of the planning and harvesting of peat for horticultural purposes has been effectively dismissed, despite the working group's recommendations to do so.  Instead, guidance on the regulation of peat extraction in Ireland was to be provided.  The working group outlined that growers are reporting that they are being quoted prices for imported peat in 2022 more than 45% more expensive for volume purchasing, and that prices are likely to rise even further for smaller customers.  This was ignored as well.  At the time, I said that serious questions needed to be answered about whether the three Departments with responsibility for the issue were only ever intent on following their own preconceived plans of action, rather than taking the work of the group chaired by Dr. Munoo Prasad seriously.  Those questions were not answered <i>per se<\/i>, but the response to the report spoke volumes.  Research into peat alternatives is all well and good, but when the sector is suddenly left without a stable ingredient, research is of limited benefit, as its needs are immediate.  Operators in the sector say that they should have seen the Minister of State's colleagues in the Green Party as natural comrades.  Instead, a sector that has offset more carbon than any other was targeted with a brush that gave no recognition whatsoever to the contribution it makes and the potential it has in carbon offsetting.  Its needs have been met with the granting of a tiny amount of the area of land traditionally used for peat extraction.  Instead, we have seen tonnes of peat imported into this country in a way that expels far more carbon than would ever be needed.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to State to outline what progress has been made in providing alternatives to the sector.  Did the 2,000 tonnes of peat that Bord na Mona stated was to be sold to the highest bidder actually go to the sector?  We were told that we had 2,000 tonnes of peat that is suitable for professional growers.  Are we starting with the 2,000-tonne stockpile that we were told about?  I ask the Minister of State to confirm whether the recommendations of the working group on developing primary legislation to resolve the dual issues of the planning and harvesting of peat for horticultural purposes have been cosigned to history, or whether work to pursue it is happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500007#E00300","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1655283120,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  As he will be aware, extraction of peat for the Irish professional horticultural industry in recent years has been challenging from a legal and regulatory perspective.  A series of High Court judgments, beginning in the early 2010s, that dealt with peat extraction and lack of compliance across the extraction sector has generated supply challenges for the horticulture sector, which continues to rely on peat as a raw growing material.<\/p>  <p>  I want to highlight the importance of the horticultural sector and its significant contribution to the economy with a farm gate value of almost &euro;521 million in 2021.  The horticultural sector is the fourth largest in agriculture in terms of output value.  An estimated 17,600 people are employed in the sector between primary level and value added downstream.  Approximately 60% of the value of Irish horticulture is dependent on peat as a growth medium with the mushroom, amenity and soft fruit sectors being most reliant.   <\/p>  <p>  The working paper to address challenges related to peat supply in the horticulture sector was put in place by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in conjunction with the Departments of Environment, Climate and Communications, and Housing, Local Government and Heritage following the publication of the Final Report of the Working Group on the Use of Peat Moss in the Horticultural Industry, which was commissioned by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan.  The paper sets out a series of joint actions that have been put in place to alleviate the difficulties being faced by horticultural growers dependent on peat as a growing medium.  The actions include a range of targeted measures that reflect the multifaceted nature of the problem and the subsequent need for short-, medium- and long-term solutions.  These actions were developed to address the short-term issue of peat supply, the medium-term issue of future access to peat and the longer-term issue of replacement with alternatives.  The ultimate ambition is to support the horticulture industry, the people employed and the many families that depend on this important sector. <\/p>  <p>  Peat is a finite resource and there is an acknowledgement of the need to transition to more sustainable growing media.  Indeed, most amenity horticulture growers are now using reduced peat levels in growing substrate, where the peat is blended with material such as bark fibre at levels of between 10% and 30%.  I welcome the general agreement across the horticulture industry that the use of peat should be phased out by 2030 or by 2035 at the very latest, provided alternative materials are available.  The phasing out of the use of peat by 2030 would align with other climate commitments the Government has made.  However, there is also a recognition that a very limited volume of peat may be required for a period in certain sectors, in particular, professional horticulture, until alternatives become available that are affordable and sustainable and meet quality, environmental and productivity requirements for the horticulture sector.  My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and I have continued to highlight the importance of transitional peat supply and to assist in considering solutions to this issue.  In doing so, the working paper and associated actions led by the Department will support Irish horticultural growers who are dependent on peat until viable alternatives are found.  The Department is also funding two sustainability research projects through the EU producer organisation, PO, scheme for fruit and vegetables.  The first project is looking at spent mushroom substrate and how this could be used as a peat replacement material within the wider horticulture sector.  The second project is investigating the sustainable replacement of peat in mushroom casing material.  This support is being reflected in ongoing shelf and house trials on peat alternatives, and good progress is being reported by industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500007#E00400","speaker":"1661"},{"type":"speech","time":1655283120,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  In her response, she said that an estimated 17,600 people are employed in the sector.  If the Government would only listen to the sector, it would realise that it is putting those working in the sector at risk of losing their jobs because of the price of importing peat from 3,000 miles away.  As a member of the Green Party, I do not know how the Minister of State and her party can stand over the practice of importing peat from 3,000 miles away.  Hundreds of trucks bring peat to ships over there, it is shipped 3,000 miles across the sea, and another few hundred trucks have to pick it up here.  We are talking about a minuscule volume of peat required to keep the mushroom and horticultural industries going.  The Government is closing the sector down.  It does not make any sense.  The Government keeps talking about alternatives.  Again, I ask the Government to listen to the stakeholders.  It is fine to say that there will be alternatives available down the line.  The sector is at risk now because the smaller operators cannot afford to import peat.  For the bigger operators, the price of importing peat has gone up by 22% from last year.  The Department needs to pull it finger out.  The Minister of State did not confirm whether the 2,000 tonnes of peat to which I referred is available to the sector.  Is that peat there?  Has it been assigned to the sector?  Alternatives are no good to the 17,600 people who are affected.  There will be a furore when big mushroom operators or other horticultural centres start closing down.  The Ministers and other politicians will go and get their pictures taken with operators, and will say they are in favour of helping them out.  Now is the time to help the sector.

our own energy supplies, including renewable energy sources;<br \/><br \/>- Ireland, like all other member states, is bound by European Union (EU) directives on energy regulation, meaning an obligation exists to plan and develop self-sufficiency options;<br \/><br \/>- currently Ireland is in an extremely vulnerable and utterly unsustainable position in terms of security of energy supply (dependent on the United Kingdom (UK)), with Brexit adding a further layer of uncertainty and risk, as the UK is no longer legally bound by any measure, including the solidarity principle in the 2020 agreement regulation, to provide us with supplies, thus significantly increasing Ireland's gas supply vulnerabilities;<br \/><br \/>- the Economic and Social Research Institute recently ranked Ireland as the fourth most energy insecure country in Europe;<br \/><br \/>- although we are at a critical juncture in planning for Ireland's energy future, the energy security review, promised in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future in June 2020, has yet to even be published;<br \/><br \/>- Ireland has a goal of being carbon neutral by 2050, however, the reality of the situation is that trains, tractors, trucks, trawlers, planes and the bulk of the existing car and van fleet run on oil;<br \/><br \/>- Ireland simply cannot become a green economy overnight, when 87 per cent of our energy supply still comes from fossil fuels;<br \/><br \/>- Ireland currently imports 100 per cent of our oil needs and over 70 per cent of our gas needs (interconnectors from Scotland to Ireland), with gas imports rising steadily in line with production declines at the Corrib gas field;<br \/><br \/>- dependence on gas imports has risen sharply from 33 per cent in 2017 to 72 per cent in 2021;<br \/><br \/>- currently 30 per cent of Ireland's gas needs come from the Corrib gas field, our only indigenous source, which will reach depletion by the decade's end;<br \/><br \/>- oil and gas will be required for decades to come and the Barryroe oil and gas field (in the Celtic Sea and discovered by Providence Resources) is Ireland's only indigenous oil discovery, which has the potential to be developed in the short-term;<br \/><br \/>- the large-scale offshore wind generation projects offer Ireland real potential but require proper planning and will take  of euro and a medium- to long-term timeframe to develop, to ensure any actual or meaningful impact on decarbonisation;<br \/><br \/>- Ireland has the potential and options available to become almost entirely energy self-sufficient, which in the short-term means opening up the Barryroe supply and simultaneously getting serious about developing alternative renewable sources such as offshore wind;<br \/><br \/>- against this backdrop, and in light of the Government's failure, Ireland is facing an existential threat to the cost of food and energy, together with a complete lack of any energy security;<br \/><br \/>- all Irish consumers will face much higher fossil fuel prices following the EU leaders' agreement to ban most Russian oil imports;<br \/><br \/>- the Government has failed to address these seismic issues in any meaningful way that simultaneously reduces the cost burden and ensures a sustainable supply channel for both affordable food and energy into the future;<br \/><br \/>- this unprecedented energy crisis is compounded by the Government's policy position on energy, which is imprisoned by the single lane and oftentimes narrow ideological position of the Green Party;<br \/><br \/>- the Government's narrow ideological energy policy means closing down our own national resource supply of oil and gas, meaning we must import from anywhere that will supply us, at whatever price is dictated by exporters;<br \/><br \/>- in theory this policy approach may sound good or go down well at Green Party meetings, but it will send this country and our people down a dangerous energy eddy;<br \/><br \/>- the current Government policy ignores the fact that we will continue to need natural gas to anchor our entire electricity system for a long time to come;<br \/><br \/>- importing the necessary oil and gas will not only create a much larger carbon footprint, but it will also be costlier and leave us extremely vulnerable to supply and price shocks, while the monetary cost of importing oil represents a net loss to the Irish economy and the Exchequer; and<br \/><br \/>- the Government can no longer use this issue to virtue signal or purport their empty green credentials, as the consequences of doing so impacts the entire economy and especially every household, small business, farmer, and transport operator in a deeply negative and costly way; <\/blockquote>further notes that: <blockquote> \t- there is no justifiable case for not developing our own available oil and gas resources, and there is certainly no justifiable reason for this Government to stand over a current policy that adds to our carbon footprint, by importing gas from places like Qatar, which creates fourteen times the carbon footprint of using and developing the Corrib and Barryroe oil and gas resources;<br \/><br \/>- the hypocrisy-laden Government's energy policy, which turns a blind eye to importing from dictators on the one hand and aims to criminalise an Irish person who gives a bag of turf to a neighbour on the other, is affecting the nation's energy security and leaving Irish consumers to pay more than anyone else;<br \/><br \/>- today, despite the rhetoric, all of Ireland's oil and the vast majority of our gas is imported, and Ireland will continue to depend on oil products for the foreseeable future, or until the Government acts rather than speaks of increasing renewable supplies;<br \/><br \/>- the purely politically induced ban on Irish oil and gas represents a false narrative, as it generates a greater carbon footprint and ensures all Irish people pay more for electricity, gas, home-heating oil, petrol, and diesel and is seriously adding to our cost of living burden, while being devoid of any scientific or economic rationale;<br \/><br \/>- moving away from Russian supplies for both oil and gas at the EU level will have a detrimental impact, whether directly or indirectly, on supply to Ireland;<br \/><br \/>- the only practical solution is to reopen access to new supplies off our coast;-&mdash; the Government's decisions to close our turf-burning energy stations, further intending to close coal-burning stations too, will compound matters and result in a sole reliance on imports; and<br \/><br \/>- this current policy being pursued by this Government is leaving Ireland open to any and all international events of the future, which are well outside of our control and exposes not only households but our entire economy to price hikes that are completely outside of this country's control; <\/blockquote>recognises: <blockquote> \t- that energy imports have a higher carbon footprint than local production;<br \/><br \/>- that Providence Resources unreservedly supports Government and EU policies aimed at tackling climate change;<br \/><br \/>- that the Barryroe production is not incompatible with Ireland's transition to a carbon neutral economy by 2050;<br \/><br \/>- that Providence Resources is confident that there is an attractive economic and technical case for first appraising and then developing the Barryroe oil and gas field;<br \/><br \/>- that an updated Competent Person's Report (CPR), delivered by RPS Energy Consultants (RPS), was completed at the beginning of February 2022, which confirms 81.2 MMstb of Gross 2C oil resources can be accessed through an initial two-phase development project, addressing one reservoir in the central segments of the field only, those closest to the 2012 oil discovery well;<br \/><br \/>- that a 2019 Price Waterhouse Coopers (PwC) report (when oil was $64 a barrel, it is $122 this week) estimated that one oil find off our coast would involve total expenditure of &euro;16.25 billion, provide up to 1,200 jobs and &euro;8.5 billion in production and corporation taxes;<br \/><br \/>- that the same PwC report estimated that over the project lifecycle of one gas field the expenditure would reach about &euro;2.3 billion, provide 380 jobs and &euro;2.42 billion in production and corporation taxes per annum;<br \/><br \/>- the enormous potential of Ireland becoming energy self-sufficient with the full optimisation of Barryroe, the largest undeveloped hydrocarbon field in Europe;<br \/><br \/>- that successful exploitation of the Barryroe oil and gas field would provide significant strategic and fiscal value to the Irish economy, at no cost to the Irish taxpayer;<br \/><br \/>- that indigenous energy sources create less environmental impact, compared to imports;<br \/><br \/>- that, all in all, developing our own energy resources is not only responsible but is also critical, bringing a raft of environmental, economic and security of supply benefits, while not doing so means we are in breach of EU energy directives and the prospect of exposure to heavy fines;<br \/><br \/>- that, following Brexit, Ireland is no longer compliant with the EU's requirements for energy security, according to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, as our gas import infrastructure currently runs through a &quot;third country&quot;, and there is no legal obligation on the UK to consider Ireland's energy needs in the event of significant disruption; and<br \/><br \/>- that the current policies being adopted by this Government are taking the country and citizens down a dark tunnel, endangering our energy security; and <\/blockquote>calls on the Government to: <blockquote> \t- recognise that an urgent change in the trajectory of its energy policy is now desperately needed, as emissions associated with indigenous production can be up to 30 per cent lower than sources from outside Europe due to enhanced production technologies and shorter transport distances;<br \/><br \/>- explain the effect of current Irish Government policy which purports to protect the environment, when in fact it only increases our emissions by forcing Ireland to rely on the importation of all our gas and oil needs, at a time when EU gas and oil production is rapidly declining;<br \/><br \/>- ensure that Ireland is equipped with the policy options of developing, as transition energy supplies, its own oil and gas sources in the

<\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>On 21 March 2022, when on board the <i>RV Mallet<\/i>, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan, gave an interview during which he made an extraordinary arrogant statement.  This statement highlighted just how out of touch he and the party are with reality.  He said that politicians demanding a renewed focus on fossil fuels as a solution to the energy crisis &quot;need a lesson in energy economics&quot;.  It is the Green Party and its coalition partners, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, that need more than one lesson in energy economics.<\/p><p>Last week, on an EU-wide comparable basis, Ireland's inflation rate was 8.2%, which is a 38-year high.  Half the rate of inflation is due to energy alone.  This is what people who get up early in the morning have to deal with as a result of the policies of this Government.  In a recent submission to the Department of Finance, the Freight Transport Association of Ireland said fuel price increases of 50% are having a crippling effect on the freight industry.  The same can be said for farmers, fishermen and all food producers.  This all feeds in directly to massive price increases in everyday food items.<\/p><p>This is what economists call hyperinflation.  Each year, we purchase approximately &euro;8 billion of fossil fuels from other countries.  This is the single largest transfer of national wealth out of our economy.  It is a situation those of us in the real world know will continue for decades to come unless we develop our own fossil fuel resources.  This is what economists call a balance of payments deficit.<\/p><p>The Minister of State has no difficulty with the fact that we import fossil fuels from other countries but he and his Green Party colleagues have an idiotic ideology that this is okay as long as we do not produce them ourselves.  This is despite the fact that transporting these fossil fuel imports creates 14 times the carbon footprint of developing and consuming our own oil and gas resources.  This is what economists refer to as greenwashing, and the outsourcing of some of our emissions is green hypocrisy.  The Minister of State does not need a shorter shower.  What he definitely needs, though, is a long cold shower to wake him up to the realities of the national energy crisis.<\/p><p>Each year, the Department of the Taoiseach prepares a national risk assessment.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State would take interest in what we are saying.  I know the Green Party has no interest in what is going on in the real world but I would appreciate if he would give me the courtesy in the nine minutes I have.  Each year, the Department of the Taoiseach prepares a national risk assessment.  In the 2021 assessment, which was signed off by the Taoiseach, energy security was one of the key risks identified.  It highlighted the potential disruption to a secure and sustainable energy supply.  It emphasised that it is vital that Ireland ensures affordable, sustainable and diverse energy supplies.<\/p><p>What the Minister of State, supported by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, is doing is the polar opposite.  His and the Minister's Department is responsible for preparing a national energy security review.  This should have been published by his Department three years ago.  It was a cornerstone of the programme for Government, which all three Government parties signed up to two years ago.  As of today, it still has not been published.  Yet, on 6 June 2022, it was reported in a national newspaper that on 26 May 2022, the Department convened a meeting at the National Emergency Co-ordination Centre to discuss the oil emergency crisis.  It was reported that among the matters discussed was a limit to be placed on all essential car travel and a strict limit on the volume of fuel a motorist could buy at any one time.  Failure to have our national energy security review published is a dereliction of the Minister of State's duties and those of Deputy Ryan in his responsibilities as a Minister.<\/p><p>We import 70% of our natural gas requirements.  While some of this is used to generate electricity, gas accounts for 21% of all primary energy consumed in Ireland.  If anything were to happen to this supply of gas, not only would the lights go out, our economy would also be shut down overnight.<\/p><p>Natural gas is transmitted to Ireland through two pipelines, both of which originate from the same physical point of Moffat in Scotland.  If there was an accident or explosion at the Moffat site, both pipelines would be out of commission and our economy would be brought to its knees.  This is what the European Commission refers to as the N-1 formula.<\/p><p>The ESRI recently ranked Ireland as the fourth most energy insecure country in Europe.  Our gas supplies come through Britain and while Britain was a member of the EU, it had an international legal obligation to ensure that we would have adequate gas supplies.  This legal obligation no longer applies.  In recent weeks, the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs have repeatedly accused Britain of bad faith attacks on the Northern Ireland protocol.  They have also accused Britain of making no effort to resolve the protocol row and said the British Government is not listening to anyone and is on the brink of breaking international law.  During the Brexit negotiations, the current British Home Secretary, Ms Priti Patel, made an appalling comment about using food shortages to pressure Ireland in the Brexit negotiations.  These are the very people in whose hands we have placed our national energy security.<\/p><p>The Minister of State, the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste have been asleep at the helm as this energy hurricane is rapidly approaching.  The Minister of State should wake up.  Ireland is one of the few countries where the word &quot;energy&quot; does not appear in the name of any Department.  This is itself demonstrates the lack of priority this Government places on a fundamental area of national security and prosperity.  We are not climate deniers here.  We are realists, not idealists.  In an interview with Newstalk on 29 September 2021, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, said that Ireland will need fossil fuels going forward.<\/p> <p>In <i>The Irish Times<\/i>of 18 May 2022, Muireann Lynch, a senior research officer at the ESRI, wrote a long and authoritative article entitled, &quot;No point pretending we don&rsquo;t need new sources of fossil fuels&quot;.  The Minister must wake up and take time to read that article.  In recent months, countries such as Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and the United States have woken up to this fact and have started to explore their own fossil fuel resources.  The Green Party is the only party that appears to think that we can migrate to a miracle renewable world overnight.  The CSO has recently published an official statistic that fossil fuels provide 87% of all primary energy consumed in Ireland, yet the Minister and his convert, the Taoiseach, are placing all of their energy chips on the wind roulette.  The Minister must wake up.<br\/><br\/>Week after week, leading people in the renewable industry come out and highlight the reality.  Last week, the head of power generation at Bord na M&oacute;na said the Government was deluded if it believes 80% of the State&rsquo;s power would come from renewables by 2030.  In recent days, the managing director of Statkraft Ireland said Ireland is firefighting an energy crisis and was highly critical of an inadequate electricity infrastructure.  The Minister must wake up.<br\/><br\/>The licence for the Barryroe field predates the prohibition of a new exploration licence.  This is written in law and is an accepted principle in the programme for Government.  Last year, the Minister granted Providence Resources, the owners of the Barryroe field, permission to undertake a site survey, which they completed.  Since then, Providence Resources has written to the Minister on two occasions seeking a licence undertaking and has provided the Department with all the information requested.  The Minister has not replied to either of those letters.  One could assume from the approach that he is stonewalling the company to progress the Green Party agenda.  If that is the case, it is in direct contravention of the code of conduct for office holders in which the Standards in Public Office Commission states that the public interest should always take precedence over the interests of a political party.  If the Minister's strategy is to stonewall and frustrate the company, he is also exposing the State to a potential massive legal claim for interfering with the company&rsquo;s legitimate property rights.  This time the answer is not blowing in the wind, but it may lie in the shallow waters 50 km off the shore at Barryroe in the constituency that I am honoured to represent, where the people do get up early in the morning and do work extremely hard and live in the real world.  I have the honour of being one of the elected representatives and I will do whatever I can to protect these people in the coming energy and food crisis.  The Minister must wake up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500008#F00700","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655284320,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I am pleased to get the opportunity to speak on this very important motion this morning.  I thank Deputy Collins for highlighting the very attractive proposal of utilising the Barryroe oil and gas field off the south coast of Cork.  It is understood that 365 million barrels of oil and gas are deposited there and deeper exploration could unearth much more.  At a time the country is struggling to survive because of massive increased costs for oil and gas, it would surely be helpful if we could access even some of this from our own oil and gas fields in Barryroe.  Moreover, as the Kinsale field is exhausted, and the Corrib field deposits of gas are waning quickly, it is vital that we utilise Barryroe and resume drilling for gas off the west coast of Kerry, which the Government stopped, as we will need gas and oil for at least 40 more years.<\/p><p>We should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and use our own jurisdiction to the maximum.  The further away the source of oil and gas imports - that is if we are able to get them - the greater the carbon footprint.  The closure of Bord na M&oacute;na in the midlands and stopping the generation of electricity in Lanesborough and Shannonbridge were short-sighted.  We all know that since these generating stations were closed the cost of electricity has gone up daily.  The Government should reverse this decision and utilise every bit of turf we have in the country.  Turf kept this country going during the Second World War.<\/p><p>Shannon LNG should also get the licence to import gas from western sources such as the United States and other countries that would be minded to sell gas to us.  It will not cost the country 1 cent as this company has spent several million euro to date and will totally fund the operation itself.  As a reliable energy source with low emissions, gas must remain part of the energy mix.  With the trouble caused by Putin and Russia and the problem that we have in the United Kingdom, we need gas from a reliable source, and we need another source now to ensure future energy security and economic prosperity.<\/p><p>I cannot understand it.  Cork is lucky to have the Taoiseach at the present time and two senior Ministers.  The Government is acting recklessly by not listening to this proposal to provide energy off the county they represent.  They are also representing the country and the country depends on energy security.  Continuing to expose the country to global oil increases and raking in millions of euro in every kind of tax is all reckless behaviour.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach promised the people of north Kerry when canvassing with the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, in the 2020 general election that he would ensure Shannon LNG got over the line.  Now he has allowed the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to make submissions against this proposal.  This is also reckless.  We have to be realistic as families need cars to go to work.  There are no other options for people in rural Ireland.  They need cars to go to work and to take their children to school.  They are struggling.  Many families are in serious jeopardy.  The running costs of lorry transport has doubled.  I saw the price of diesel all along the road as I came up the day before yesterday.  It was &euro;2.10 for diesel and &euro;2.20 for petrol.  Farmers and contractors are paying &euro;1.60 a litre for green diesel.  They are under immense pressure and the Government is doing nothing to help them.  The Government could take less tax, but it does not want to do that.  Another issue concerns private bus operators transporting children to school.  The Minister is not doing enough.  The Government could at least forgo the extra carbon tax and excise VAT that it is clawing back now.<\/p><p>The senior Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on 19 May addressed the Seanad on energy and stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe have never found oil in commercial quantities.  All the likely sites&hellip;are in very deep, distant waters. <\/blockquote>  <p>That is incorrect.  What the Minister said is that we just do not have a lot of oil and gas reserves.  These statements are incorrect, and I cannot understand why he made them.  It shows his fundamental lack of knowledge on this very important matter.  The Barryroe discovery is in 100 m of water, 50 km offshore and is regarded as the largest undeveloped hydrocarbon field in Europe.  The accepted industrial reserve projections indicate 365 million barrels of equivalent oil and gas resources in that field.  I ask the senior Minister to correct the record because he has misled the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500009#G00200","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1655284320,"counter":43,"content":"<p>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm labhairt ar an r&uacute;n seo ar maidin.  Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Teachta Michael Collins agus leis an bhfoireann go l&eacute;ir at&aacute; ag obair linn.  Rinne siad s&aacute;r-obair ar an r&uacute;n seo chomh maith.  No self-respecting Government would voluntarily destabilise or disown natural and long-lasting sources of energy dependence for the State, which it has the privilege to govern.  Yet, this is precisely what many people see when they look at the actions of this Government and its decision to essentially throw all of our energy needs into one big green basket.  In the near to medium term, the effect of such an approach will turn Ireland into a basket case.<\/p> <p>It is truly alarming we now have a Government that appears oblivious to any evidence that does not support its own ideological biases.  A hundred years after our independence we are, it seems, as dependent as ever on the importation of fuel, not to mention peat.  This is completely at odds with what people in the past fought for.  The programme of the First D&aacute;il in 1919 stated clearly that the people of Ireland have the right to use their own resources but the Government has taken that right from us and has now put us into a situation where we have an energy crisis and there are questions over our energy security.  The Government, therefore, needs to act on these questions because they are coming from very good and reliable sources.  We are now regarded as the fourth most energy insecure country, according to the ESRI.  The Government can disregard what the Rural Independent Group is saying but is it also, in its arrogance, disregarding what the ESRI is saying because it does not want to hear any of this until there is a crisis?  We will be in a deep crisis if the Government does not act.<br\/><br\/>What is any sane person going to make of the fact that in 2021 alone we imported in excess of 42,800 tonnes of peat valued at &euro;7.3 million.  To do so when we have an enormous indigenous supply boggles the mind.  It makes no sense.  It is the definition of shooting ourselves in both feet, all the while creating a situation where emissions from such activity are multiples of what they would be if we simply used the peat and turf on our own doorstep.  I have consistently made the point that while the Government talks a great game about transforming energy sources and promoting and increasing alternatives sources but the facts say otherwise; they are black and white.  Only last week it was reported online by <i>The Ditch<\/i>that while the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, claimed more than a month ago to have opened a solar farm in Wicklow it is yet to supply any electricity to the national grid.  As the <i>The Ditch<\/i>noted on the same day the Minister opened the farm, his Department falsely claimed in a press release the farm was delivering electricity to Ireland's grid.  Again, it is all about spin.  In fact, the solar farm, which is owned by a French multinational energy provider, is yet to be made fully operational despite the Minister and his Department's claims as well as the media fanfare that greeted the farm's opening.  It seems to be all about the openings and the fanfare.<br\/><br\/>The we have the problems I have repeatedly pointed to in the area of microgeneration and the support scheme for it.  The Minister confirmed to me in a reply to a parliamentary question that the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU, &quot;... is not setting a date or deadline for the timing of the first payment ... &quot; to the microgeneration customers.  My constituents, including farmers and families, are still waiting to receive such payments.  This is totally unacceptable.  As reported then, a promised 1 cent per litre cut to the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, levy was not delivered by Government but the decision not to implement it only came to light when revealed by the<i>Irish Independent<\/i>last week.  The decision means motorists battling soaring fuel rates at the pump missed out on a saving of &euro;20 million of fuel costs.  That is to say nothing of the delays in getting the licensed haulage emergency support scheme up and running.  Though it was announced in March is was not until approximately six weeks later that 3,000 haulage and freight operators could access the scheme.  Where is the sense of urgency?<br\/><br\/>On the broader picture and how we offer real, practical and vastly less expensive fuel alternatives, I and my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group recently met representatives of both the Alliance for Zero Carbon Heating and Liquid Gas Ireland.  These groups offer credible and sustainable alternative models that must be actively explored by Government if it is serious about approaching this issue in a much more credible way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500009#G00300","speaker":"1592","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655284920,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &quot;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&quot; and substitute the following:  \tnotes that: <blockquote> \t- the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future sets out a clear pathway towards less reliance on fossil fuels across every sector of our society, and it specifically contains a commitment to end the issuing of new licences for the exploration and extraction of gas on the same basis as the decision taken in 2019 by the previous Government in relation to oil exploration and extraction;<br \/><br \/>- this commitment was made effective immediately, and since June 2020 the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications no longer accepts new applications for new petroleum authorisations and, in addition, there will be no future licencing rounds;<br \/><br \/>- holders of existing authorisations, including Exola DAC, a subsidiary of Providence Resources Plc are not affected by these changes and may apply to progress their authorisations through the licencing stages towards a natural conclusion &ndash; which may include expiry, relinquishment or production;<br \/><br \/>- the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 gives statutory underpinning to this position and a new policy statement for petroleum exploration is currently being prepared to reflect the current policy and legislative position and to provide clarity to stakeholders in relation to future authorisations which may be granted under legislation; <br \/><br \/>- an application for a Lease Undertaking made by Providence Resources in respect of the Barryroe oil and gas field is under consideration by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications; <br \/><br \/>- broader energy policy or energy security considerations have no bearing on the regulatory process: applications for petroleum authorisations are assessed against a number of criteria in accordance with Section 9A of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960 and Section 3 of the Licensing Terms for Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration, Development and Production, which includes the technical competence of the applicant and the financial resources available to it in order to undertake the work programme and any other commitments pursuant to the relevant petroleum authorisation; and<br \/><br \/>- the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications does not publish information on individual applications whilst they are under consideration.&quot; <\/blockquote> The programme for Government states climate change is the single greatest threat facing humanity and commits the Government to react comprehensively and imaginatively to this challenge in a manner that ensures we achieve a rapid reduction in and then reversal of our impact on the climate.  Climate change means the fossil fuel-based economic model is no longer fit for purpose and we must make the necessary structural changes to break the link between fossil fuels and economic progress.<br \/><br \/>The measures proposed by the Deputies would represent significant changes in policy and would have significant negative effects on key national objectives on the environment, climate action and energy.  The Government is opposing the motion and proposing a countermotion that notes that the Government's policy on oil and gas exploration has been clearly articulated through the programme for Government and is underpinned by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021.  The policy and legislative framework sets out that while existing authorisation holders may seek to apply to progress through the various stages in the petroleum exploration process, no new applications for oil or gas can be considered.<br \/><br \/>Previous Governments have operated a concession system whereby petroleum exploration companies are given rights to explore for petroleum within defined acreage offshore, through a licensing system that progresses from a licensing option to an exploration licence and a lease, in the event of a commercial find.  Progression from licensing option to exploration licence and between the individual phases of an exploration licence depends on the authorisation holder fulfilling work programme obligations.  Industry carries the financial risk associated with such exploration and fiscal terms have been designed to strike the necessary balance between attracting the high-risk exploration investment necessary to prove the potential of the Irish offshore and maximising the return to the State from Ireland's natural resources.<br \/><br \/>Since exploration began in the Irish offshore, four commercial gas discoveries have been made, namely Kinsale Head, Ballycotton, Seven Heads and Corrib.  While there have been some discoveries of oil in the Irish offshore, to date none of these have been declared commercial.  In the interest of transparency and in accordance with section 57 of the Petroleum and Other Minerals 1960 Act, the Minister is required to present to the Houses of the Oireachtas a six-monthly report on petroleum exploration and development in Ireland.  This report sets out the particulars of all authorisations granted by the Minister that are current during the reporting period.  This includes the amount relating to petroleum exploration and development collected by the Minister during the reporting period and other information relating to petroleum exploration and development in Ireland.  In addition, an acreage report setting out the position of each authorisation and a concession map is published every quarter on the Department's website.<br \/><br \/>The Government is reducing the reliance of every sector of our society on fossil  fuels.  The programme for Government committed us to ending the issuing of new licences for the exploration and extraction of gas on the same basis as the 2019 Government decision on to oil exploration and extraction.  This has been given statutory effect in section 21 of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, which prohibits the issuing of new extraction licenses for oil and gas.  There is no argument for reconsidering the ban on new offshore oil and gas exploration.  A revised petroleum policy statement will be published in the coming months to reflect the current Government position.  It will also give clarity to stakeholders on the position regarding authorisations into the future.  A transition to renewables is the only way to progress and the proposed change set out in the motion would only distract from this.  While no new authorisations for new exploration will be granted, existing authorisations are unaffected by the change and can continue to apply through the licensing stages until they reach a natural conclusion that may include expiry, relinquishment or production.  However, any applications for follow-on authorisations still require ministerial consent.  The criteria are set out in section 9A(1) of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960 and section 3 of the Licensing Terms for Offshore Oil and Gas Exploration, Development and Production.  They include the technical competence of the applicant, the financial resources available to it to undertake the work programme and any other commitments pursuant to the relevant petroleum authorisation.  All applications are processed in the same manner in line with the relevant policy and regulatory requirements and they are all subject to robust assessments from a technical and financial perspective.  The timelines associated with processing applications can vary, depending on the nature of the applications, to complete such assessments.<br \/><br \/>The application for a lease undertaking referenced in the motion is being considered under a robust assessment process by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, in line with the criteria referenced earlier.  It is important to note the licence application assessment process is informed only by financial, technical and environmental considerations and not by energy security or broader energy policy matters.  The Department does not publish or discuss information on individual applications while they are under consideration. <\/blockquote> <p>It would be inappropriate for me or the Department, from a legal and regulatory perspective, and will offend due process to comment on specific details regarding any individual licences or applications pending a formal decision being made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500010#H00200","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655285520,"counter":47,"content":"<p>The Minister of State might have heard of the film \"Saving Private Ryan\".  The new film will be about saving Ireland from the Minister, Deputy Ryan.  In his opening statement, the Minister of State said the programme for Government states that climate change is the single greatest threat facing humanity.  The single greatest threat in this country at the moment to people and their families is surviving because of what the Government is implementing.<\/p>  <p>  We are going to go through the fuel prices as of 13 June.  A gallon of fuel is &euro;4.90 without tax.  When the Government puts tax on it, that brings the price to &euro;9.67.  An average car requires ten gallons of fuel, which brings the cost to &euro;96.80.  If there were no taxes the cost would be &euro;49.  That is amazing.  People are suffering at the moment.  The first thing the Government should do is to protect the here and now, and then transition into the future for future generations.  It has reversed the cycle to wipe out the here and now, where there might be no future.<\/p>  <p>  I have a green agenda, which is to lower emissions in this country.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, has stated that 87% of people travelling in and out of this country come through Dublin Airport and travel throughout the country for cheap flights in cars and buses using fossil fuels.  If traffic was dispersed around the country to other airports, we would reduce emissions.  That is a green agenda. <\/p>  <p>  Roughly 90% of roll-on, roll-off traffic comes through Dublin Port.  A loaded truck travelling 100 km requires 56 l of fuel, plus AdBlue.  Trucks are travelling from Dublin to Cork, Limerick, Galway and Clare.  My job is to lower emissions.  It is common sense.  We have ports in Foynes, Cork and Rosslare, but the Government promotes Dublin.  More fuel is burned with trucks travelling up and down the country to export and import goods.  That is not a green agenda.  Common sense tells us the dispersal of traffic is necessary.  Shannon Foynes Port, which is waiting on investment, can take the largest ship in the world.  That means we could get rid of 30 or 40 ships and instead use one, which would lower emissions.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of natural resources in this country, I refer to oil exploration off the coast of Cork.  We could be self-sufficient while waiting for green energy in the future.  Instead, we bring oil from around the world, which uses emissions, into Ireland.  We can lower emissions by extracting oil here.  The Minister of State will ask me how that is possible given that it is a fossil fuel.  It can be done very easily.  If oil is extracted off the coast of Cork, we will not have to ship it halfway around the world.  We are all under the same sky.  I would get rid of the shipping costs of fuel being imported into Ireland from around the world.  I would save the environment in the now until we have alternatives.  <\/p>  <p>  Some 70 wind turbines have been taken down in Galway at a time of crisis.  What do we do?  We open up Moneypoint and start burning fossil fuels again.  The Government has an ideological perspective.  I am in favour of wind farms and offshore energy, but they are not available in the here and now.  My job and that of the Rural Independent Group is to protect the people now and work for the future.  We do not see anything wrong with the agenda for a greener environment.  We are here to protect the people now.  The Government and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, are not doing that.  <\/p>  <p>  It was stated on social media during the week that the Minister, Deputy Ryan, does not tell lies.  He does.

I am doing it.  We are all sharing cars and doing our bit for the environment.<\/p>  <p>  My job and that of the Rural Independent Group is to protect our families and the people of Ireland who elected us to protect them now and in the future.  As I said, we all have our own green agenda, but the Government has single-handedly driven inflation in this country through its views on social media and everything else.  Now it is open up to propaganda everywhere and people are jumping on the bandwagon.  People are suffering because of these views.  We all have the same vision, but the vision is a transition as we have always said.<\/p>  <p>  I remind the Government that if people get sick - please God, they will not - what will come to collect them is an ambulance run on fossil fuel.  If there is a fire in a house, what comes to put out the fire?  It is vehicles with fossil fuel engines.  Our schools and most of our hospitals run on fossil fuels.  Garda cars driving around the country are run on fossil fuel.  People all want to make a difference, yet the Government cannot see that.  The Minister of State needs to wake up.

We need to be self-sustaining.<\/p> <p>We can see what happens in Europe.  We are at the end of the chain when it comes to getting food in here at exorbitant prices because the Government has stopped us from being self-sustainable for the here and now.

We have an energy security crisis and the Government has significantly contributed to it.  We have an energy cost crisis and the Government has significantly contributed to it.  The Rural Independent Group suggests, however, that the answer is new fossil fuel infrastructure, which would be hugely damaging to the environment and would do little for energy security, particularly considering the locking in of such fossil fuel use.  We are looking at countries spending billions of euro to buy themselves out of the type of contracts that would be needed if this motion were to succeed.  Such infrastructure would last 30 or 40 years.  That would take us well past 2050 and any prospect of delivering on emissions reduction targets and, whatever it might do for energy security, it would do absolutely nothing for energy costs.  Do we get Corrib gas cheaper than we get Qatari or British gas?  No, we do not.  Sinn F&eacute;in therefore does not support this motion.<\/p><p>We do not support the Government's countermotion either because there is absolutely zero acknowledgement in it of the Government's role in sleepwalking the State into this energy security and energy cost crisis.  There is no mention of data centre policy.  As recently as yesterday, we had reports that the energy generation being procured by the State to prevent power outages in winter 2023 will cover only about 60% of the generation gap that might arise.  Why?  It is largely because of data centres.  There is no mention that we have become more dependent, not less, on fossil fuels in recent years thanks to a complete failure of policy.  There is no mention of the Government's failure, along with the ESB and the CRU, to deliver on committed capacity.  Capacity is committed and there is failure to deliver on it.  There is no mention of the failure to deliver on our offshore wind potential.  If the Government will not take Sinn F&eacute;in's advice as to what needs to be done, there is an article practically every week in the <i>Business Post<\/i>from industry leaders telling the Government what needs to be done.  There is no mention of the failure to deliver microgeneration in schools, farms or community centres, or anywhere else for that matter, at scale.  There is no mention of the failure to adequately support people and to ensure a just and fair transition.  Every scheme the Government comes up with fails the equity test and the just transition test.<\/p><p>What is in the Government's countermotion?  There is mention of a framework with 31 responses.

That should have been done already.  The Government needs to set out a comprehensive and coherent plan to deliver energy security, with all options on the table.  It must deliver a just transition and the most rapid and fair transition to a net-zero energy system.  We need to accelerate the delivery of offshore wind energy by providing the funding and resources needed to agencies such as An Bord Plean&aacute;la to ensure that long planning delays are avoided.  We need to establish a cross-government, high-level task force to bring forward recommendations on how to lower the price of renewable energy here because it is not just fossil fuel energy but also renewable energy that is too expensive in Ireland.  We need to draft and publish a national strategy on green energy.  In the first instance, the most important thing the Government needs to do to protect consumers is to introduce an emergency budget that provides targeted measures to help households struggling to meet increasing energy costs.  This Government and previous ones have pursued failed policies that have brought us to the brink.  People know what amber alerts are now because they are part of the public conversation.  That is an absolute failure of Government policy to match energy demand with energy supply.

The microgeneration scheme has been on the agenda for years and years.  Deputy Stanley tried to promote it.  It is the most basic form of utilising our resources.  It is not done.  Obviously, we have optimum capacity for offshore wind energy.  Wind energy is not dealt with.  Green hydrogen is not dealt with.  Electricity infrastructure is not available in rural areas.  What does the Government do instead?  It has the stick ready at all stages.  The reality people face right now is a 50% to 60% increase in the cost of fuel over recent months, which is having a horrendous impact on families.  The cost of home heating oil has more than doubled, which is also having a horrendous impact.

As was mentioned, in the previous D&aacute;il, of which I was a Member, Deputy Stanley tried to introduce a microgeneration scheme.  Individuals and small businesses acted on this but they still cannot get excess electricity back into the grid or sell it to the grid.  Microgeneration is a solution that was in place; it was not just an idea.  The refund scheme was another solution but this Government and previous Governments have said \"No\".  They have decided to forget just transition and instead just beat people with a stick.<\/p>  <p>  A previous speaker referred to what will happen this winter.  I, too, dread the circumstances the most vulnerable, the elderly, people with disabilities, and people in rural communities who depend on home heating oil will face.  They are not on the grid.

There are solutions but every time we listen to the other side of the House speak on green policy, the only solution they propose is to box people into a corner and punish them rather than looking at what works in other parts of the world.  There are simple solutions for public transport.  In Japan, for example, people can pay for a train ticket with used plastic bottles.  That is a solution and, in the first instance, people are also cleaning the place.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in raised the idea of a refund scheme.  I remember speaking on the matter in the previous D&aacute;il when I recalled an earlier refund scheme where people received 5 pence for returning a bottle.  The bottle was brought back to the shop where it was washed, recycled and refilled.  This meant there was less rubbish, people were educated and they also made a few bob.  I mentioned at the time that schoolchildren who were not old enough to get a summer job in a factory would go to a beach or down the b&oacute;ithr&iacute;ns of this country on their summer holidays to pick up plastic bottles, clean up the environment, educate themselves and get a few bob in pocket money.

It raises some sobering points around energy security, an issue that ordinary working families are dealing with at present.  Every day, we hear of people who are choosing to miss meals in order to put fuel in their vehicles to go to work or to turn on heating in their homes.<\/p>  <p>  The cost-of-living crisis has become embedded in our daily lives, causing real hardship for working families.  Ireland&rsquo;s energy and food security are intertwined and must be prioritised.  The Government&rsquo;s failure to act swiftly and decisively will have serious consequences for this and future generations.<\/p>  <p>  The extraction of fossil fuels is causing a major imbalance in our human environment and ecosystems.  Climate change is irrefutably a threat to the future of our planet and we have little time to spare.  Harnessing renewable energy is the best solution.  We cannot waste one more day.  Planning procedures need to be superseded and major funding in infrastructure must be provided if the Government is serious about having a reliable green energy supply.<\/p>  <p>  Rosslare Europort has recently set out its ambition to become Ireland&rsquo;s offshore renewable energy hub.  It is ideally positioned to serve the many offshore wind developments planned in the Irish and Celtic seas, the majority of which are located within 100 nautical miles of Rosslare.  The port already has an ambitious master plan in place and several planned road developments would enhance its bid to become a renewable energy hub.  This development will require significant investment and I understand an application has been submitted to secure European funding for it.  I ask the Minister of State to support the development of Rosslare Europort as the nation&rsquo;s renewable energy hub and to assist and invest in this project which would benefit the whole country well into the future in providing energy and food security for all.  The investment would also deliver approximately 2,000 desperately needed jobs in Rosslare.<\/p>  <p>  Energy and food security are becoming a real threat to Ireland and we already see the consequences.

She was dead right on that.  She was signalling that workers are up for the challenge of climate change and want to play their part.  There needs to be recognition on the part of the Government of the lived reality of workers today.  For example, low-income workers do not want tax cuts; they want better services.  The Government's advice to workers struggling to find the money for a fill of diesel, which they need to drive to their low-income jobs, is that they should go to the Department of Social Protection on the day or week that they do not have money.  That advice is bananas, as any Deputy who has ever held a constituency clinic will say.  The resources and capacity are not there and nobody has told the Department of Social Protection.

Last year we passed legislation to keep oil and gas in the ground through the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act although it did not apply to existing exploration licences.  That Act commits us to a legally binding path to net zero by 2050.  Later today we will debate the annual transition statements.  We are waiting on the Government's sectoral target ceilings.  Here in Ireland, the Government is not acting quickly enough and we know that globally swift enough action is not being taken.  Four critical climate indicators broke records last year: greenhouse gas concentrations, sea level rises, ocean heat, and ocean acidification.  Extreme weather events with record heat waves and extended droughts across the world amount to dangerous warning signs that urgent action is needed.  Real and urgent action is required in Ireland to reduce our emissions.  We know how far off track Ireland is and the recent EPA report tells us this.  As red greens we in Labour believe that Ireland must, as quickly as possible, develop our renewable energy resources and future proof our society from reliance on fossil fuels and that is the appropriate path to take, not the promotion of extraction of new oil and gas.  That is why the Labour Party cannot support this motion.  We believe there must be a just transition to meet the necessary climate targets to which we have signed up.<\/p><p>Rarely do we see a Private Members' motion in this House that could have been written by a private company engaged in oil exploration.  The motion before us wilfully ignores the overwhelming evidence that we &ndash; all of us on this planet - must wean ourselves off fossil fuels as quickly as possible.  Drilling in the Irish Sea is not a short or even medium-term solution to the current cost of living crisis, the rising prices of fuel, or the very valid concerns about energy security.  The horrific war in Ukraine, waged by Putin, is a wake-up call for Europe on our dependency on Russian fossil fuels and the urgent need to decarbonise.  It is not credible to argue now is the time to restart the long-term exploration and exploitation of fossil fuels in Irish waters.  Let us not forget that this motion is not about oil that is sitting there ready to be extracted as though a tap can be turned on.  Were it to proceed, it would be many years, if at all, before any fuel might be extracted, even if that were desirable or appropriate.<\/p><p>Providence Resources wants to be granted a &quot;lease undertaking license&quot; so to drill an appraisal well in the Barryroe oil field.  If it was granted, reports say it would then have to begin raising $65 million to finance that well.  According to the company, even if everything worked out production would only begin from mid-2026.  This optimistic scenario from the company&rsquo;s point of view still offers no immediate or even medium-term benefits for our energy security.  Therefore, even if we leave aside the huge climate issue, which we cannot do, if licences were granted it is really difficult to see how it would benefit energy security.<\/p><p>The motion also neglects to mention that several attempts were made to find a commercial field at Barryroe in the 1970s.  The motion makes various other statements that are simply not credible including &quot;that indigenous energy sources create less environmental impact.&quot;  Let us be clear: developing new offshore oil wells in Irish waters would have a massive and potentially devastating environmental impact.  The solution is not to do more damage, but to mitigate, reduce and repair the environmental harm already caused to our planet through our massive over-reliance on fossil fuels.  Only yesterday, the UN Secretary General, Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, was crystal clear when referring to western countries, saying new funding for fossil oil exploration and production infrastructure is delusional and would worsen the global problems of pollution and climate change.  That is really clear.  Only May last year, the International Energy Agency, IEA, reported that we must stop all new oil and gas exploration projects if global warming was to be limited to 1.5&deg;C above pre-industrial level target.  This scenario can only be achieved with massive investment in low carbon and renewable technologies.  The IEA&rsquo;s road map for net zero by 2050 makes clear that we need to expand our clean energy supplies rather than doubling down on fossil fuels as this motion would have us believe.<\/p><p>Let me quote directly from the IEA road map report:<\/p> <blockquote> \tBeyond projects already committed as of 2021, there are no new oil and gas fields approved for development in our pathway... The unwavering policy focus on climate change in the net zero pathway results in a sharp decline in fossil fuel demand, meaning that the focus for oil and gas producers switches entirely to output &ndash; and emissions reductions &ndash; from the operation of existing assets. <\/blockquote>  <p>The report is clear that pursuing offshore oil wells now would go against all international advice and all plans needed to address climate change in any real and substantial way.  It is also the case when we look at our national research.  Research from UCC shows that as we decarbonise, it creates significant risks of stranded fossil fuel assets.  Again the motion does not take cognisance of this.  It is another reason why we should not be encouraging more oil development.  Instead we need to support a just transition which does not lock in the wrong sort of investment but looks to invest in renewables, the generation of clean energy and in the job creation that will accompany that.  What Ireland can, and we in Labour say it must do, is to ramp up our efforts to build the offshore wind infrastructure we so badly need and invest in active and sustainable travel measures including cycling infrastructure which is woefully inadequate across our cities and the country.  We need to retrofit our building stock and provide better supports for those who are keen to engage in retrofitting of their own homes and we need to use new battery technologies and invest in solar energy.<\/p><p>Ireland is now a member of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance and we need to be leaders in advancing a fossil-free future.  The crisis in world energy markets as a result of the brutal war in Ukraine has told us it is important to stop using oil and our reliance on fossil fuels as quickly as possible.  That is reflected in the Minister&rsquo;s amendment and in many of the other amendments.  Indeed, the  Minister&rsquo;s amendment does address key points but it does not go far enough.  It does not give sufficient clarity on the time line for getting us to the point where we can meet our targets and finally get to the enhanced production of clean, green energy and renewables.<\/p><p>There has consistently been slippage in the meeting of our targets.  The EPA has made that clear.  A lack of urgency has characterised the Government response and a lack of sufficient supports to enable people to move to meeting targets.  On EV charging points and retrofitting we are seeing a lack of sufficient supports and resources.  This means there is a risk that we remain a climate laggard and that we will simply be unable to develop our offshore wind generation capacity and our renewable capacity at sufficient speed.<\/p><p>Finally, I want to raise again the urgent need to speed up the adoption of measures to reduce the reliance of the EU on Russian oil and gas.  We in the Labour Party have called for a full embargo on Russian fuels.  I welcome the action taken at EU level on oil but we need to do more on gas.  New oil and gas wells here or elsewhere are not the solution.  Rather we need an urgent, just transition to renewable energy, greater investment in energy efficiency and the development of a green hydrogen strategy.  We in Ireland can be world leaders in this.  This motion would take us backwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500014#M00200","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1655287320,"counter":71,"content":"<p>As the Social Democrats spokesperson for climate action and as a member of the Joint Committee on Climate Action, I am not shocked but I am disappointed to see this motion come before the D&aacute;il advocating the phasing-in rather than the phasing-out of fossil fuels in Ireland.

Do we now have people in the House denying scientists and their capabilities?  That is a very dangerous road to go down, that people in this House think they know more than all the climate scientists who have come together to say this.  I was not going to use the term \"climate deniers\" later in my speech, but I think it is incredibly appropriate at this point.  Just this week, we have heard outspoken climate leaders such as UN Secretary General, Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, calling the dash for new fossil fuels as delusional.  At home, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, said that urgent implementation of all climate plans and policies, plus further new measures, are needed for Ireland to meet the 51% emissions reduction target for 2030.<\/p>  <p>  I agree we must be cognisant of the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, which recently ranked Ireland as the fourth most energy insecure country in Europe, but how we address energy security in Ireland will define how successful we will be and what kind of future we are laying for the children who come after us.  The real reason behind our own energy insecurity is lack of Government implementation of its own climate actions.  It has failed to invest in our renewable energy sector or upgrade our grid infrastructure and has failed to think ahead for a generation whose future is now compromised and under threat.<\/p>  <p>  The EPA report referenced the worrying situation of our emissions.  Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions projections were described as very bad and, as a result, Ireland is way off course to meeting its targets.  It further outlined what I have known to be true as a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action, that there is a huge gap between the ambitions of Ireland's legally binding climate Act, which targets a 51% cut in emissions by 2030, and the actions needed to deliver on that ambition.  The report highlights that even in the unlikely event that every planned climate policy and measure outlined in the climate action plan were fully implemented on time, Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions would only fall by 28% by 2030, a little more than half of what is legally required.<\/p>  <p>  There are already concerns about the Government's carbon budgets, as our emissions continue to rise rather than go down.  How then can it be justified that we open up more oil and gas fields and rely even more on fossil fuels as a climate measure?  Our target to be carbon neutral by 2050 does not legitimise development of our oil and gas supplies.  What the Government must do is act on its own ambitions and those as set at international agreements, something this motion conveniently ignores.<\/p>  <p>  The motion further states that Ireland simply cannot become a green economy overnight when 87% of our energy supply still comes from fossil fuels.  No one is saying this can happen overnight.  The problem was not made overnight.  We have known about this issue for decades, and yet climate change deniers such as we seem to have in the Opposition have stalled these efforts.  Those very same politicians are now in the House calling for action.  We cannot become a green economy overnight, but we will never become a green economy if we do not start to walk away from fossil fuels now.<\/p>  <p>  The reason Ireland is so dependent on gas is that the Government failed to act on renewable energy opportunities and continues to lag in terms of reforming the planning system to cater for offshore wind farm production.  There are shortcomings in An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the setting up of maritime area consent offices and the necessary upgrades to the grid infrastructure to facilitate such an increase in capacity of offshore wind.  The issue here is not the need for more oil and gas but the need to divert away from oil and gas.  Even if we were to start opening up existing oil and gas fields off Ireland, it would take years before anything was developed or oil was extracted and ready to be sold on the market.<\/p>  <p>  We have been promised by the Government that an energy security review is forthcoming, and it still has not been published.  However, without this, we do not have a clear picture on our energy security situation.  As another Deputy mentioned, it is this lack of strategy that provides a gap for these kinds of debates to be facilitated.  Furthermore, the Government has failed to provide a strategy on energy demand in Ireland.  It continues to allow data centre development go ahead unabated, with no clear plan on how to manage large-scale energy demand.  All data centres' energy usage amounts to that of every single rural house in this country.  The fact the Government has not strategically managed that is a major failing and one that will come back to bite us.<\/p>  <p>  We cannot have these discussions without first acknowledging energy demand and the disproportionate effect this is having on our energy system.  Yes, the Government needs to reduce the cost burden of energy and ensure a sustainable supply channel for both affordable food and energy into the future.  It can do this by implementing a transition that is fair and just to rural Ireland, especially for rural areas where farming is dominant, where there is little to no rural transport and where people are very much reliant on traditional forms of energy.  Time and again, I have called on the Government to transform dramatically rural Ireland's public transport network, provide public links and rail and incentivise people to invest in electric vehicles.<\/p>  <p>  To address the short- to medium-term price increases, the Social Democrats have called for an emergency energy budget to put &euro;300 into the pockets of workers earning up to &euro;50,000, using a refundable tax credit.  We have also proposed the creation of a hardship fund in order that those most at risk of food and fuel poverty can access emergency payments immediately.  The Government also needs to reduce excise duty, because the reality is that Government is profiting on these skyrocketing costs.  The profits it is making on people's hardship in trying to pay for fuel need to go back into people's pockets.<\/p>  <p>  It is disheartening to hear such rhetoric at this time of full knowledge of what we are about to encounter if we do not act now.  The motion goes so far as to suggest a regression of all we have worked for to date.  In fact, the motion reads like a lobby love letter from Ireland&rsquo;s oil and gas sector.  What got us here in the first place was a cosy relationship between politicians and industrial lobbyists, a relationship that has proven incompatible with our climate, our future and the sustainability of our local communities.  It is time to wean ourselves off this most addictive drug.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500015#N00900","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1655287920,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I will start by arguing this motion has nothing to do with energy security and everything to do with profit and the bottom-line security of Providence's resources.  Perhaps the rural Deputies might considering altering their headed paper to say, instead of \"I'm working on behalf of the people of this or that county\", \"I'm working on behalf of big oil and gas\".  It seems they really believe that Providence oil and gas will be the saviour of us all.  If only we could free Providence from the nasty grip of the Green Party, it would bring down the cost of living, cure climate change, bring joy to the poor town and village dwellers, replenish the State's tax coffers and probably even defeat Putin into the bargain.<\/p>  <p>  Apparently, Providence oil and gas has a miraculous quality that makes it different from other oil and gas companies.  Not long ago, I was accused of hypocrisy by one of these climate warriors because I drive a diesel van.  However, it turns out that once my diesel van and everyone else's diesel van runs on Providence oil, the problem will be solved.  According to the lobby register, Providence Resources has not approached a single Deputy or official in this D&aacute;il since May 2020, when it last met Deputy McGrath to discuss the wonders of Barryroe.  It must have been some meeting because, two years later, despite the turbulent time the company has had, Deputy McGrath was so impressed by the briefing that he has composed one of the longest motions in the D&aacute;il, a love-struck motion to a private oil and gas company.<\/p>  <p>  I note the Deputies' concern, with us being dependent on various dictators and tyrants for our oil and gas, but they do not seem to realise that Providence would not have and never has had an issue with entering a marriage with Chinese or Qatari states if it meant it could exploit Barryroe.  I agree we need to get away from dependence on oil and gas from dictators, but I go much further and say we need to get away from dependence on oil and gas, full stop.  Whether it is fracked US gas, Canadian crude oil or Russian gas, we need to get off this train as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, I have to commend the proposers of the motion on their achievement in cramming in so many half-truths, misleading statements and outright falsehoods into one motion.  I want to go through a few of them.  The first one is that \"Ireland is in an extremely vulnerable and utterly unsustainable position in terms of security of energy supply\".<\/p> <p>This is not true.  What makes us insecure is the crazed policy of allowing data centres to proliferate.  It is a policy the Deputies support regardless of whether these centres consume 14% or 30% of all the electricity we make.  Another half-truth is that all Irish consumers will face much higher fossil fuel prices following the EU leaders' agreement to ban most Russian oil imports.  We face these hikes primarily because of profiteering by energy companies and private firms.  We do not depend on Russian gas.  Profits have leapt enormously since this crisis began.  That is an aspect of the free market, which I am in favour of regulating and controlling to prevent profiteering, but the Deputies are strong believers in that free market.  Why would they not be?<\/p> <p> The statement that the monetary cost of importing oil represents a net loss to the Irish economy and the Exchequer is utterly untrue.  Whatever Providence Resources does with its fields, it will sell its oil and gas at market prices to whoever wants them.  Those are the terms of the leasing licence in this State.  There is absolutely nothing to say it must or will sell to the State and nothing to say that it will do so cheaper than the oil and gas we currently import.  It would be very good news for the Providence shareholders but it will not make a blind bit of difference to the people of this country.  Do the Deputies believe that Shell or Equinor sell us Corrib gas cheaper because they put on the green jersey?<\/p> <p> The biggest and most dangerous untruth is the one that states there is no justifiable case for not developing our own available gas and oil.  This is a slap in the face to the school strikers and the climate movement.  It is a death sentence to millions in the developing world and a condemnation for this and future generations.  There is no justifiable case relating to the science that states we have ten years to reduce our emissions, the International Energy Agency, which states that the globe cannot build new fossil fuel infrastructure, or the last Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, which told us that our carbon budget would run out in years and that investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure is moral and economic madness.  Moral and economic madness is an apt description of this motion.  It states, \"Providence Resources unreservedly supports Government and EU policies aimed at tackling climate change\".  Maybe it does in its imagination in the same way Shell, BP, Exxon and Saudi Aramco do.  They do so in words while, with every fibre of their being, they engage in drilling and profiteering from oil and gas as long as it is possible.  The cry of the fossil fuel corporations and their shareholders is, \"To Hell with future generations\".<\/p> <p> Another claim relates to Ireland having enormous potential to become self-sufficient with the full optimisation of Barryroe.  The claim is that there are 300 million barrels of oil in Barryroe and it would not make a jot of difference to Ireland's economy, its energy security or the ordinary people of this world.  Its exploitation would swell the coffers and profits of the Providence shareholders.  Across the globe, oil and gas companies and their backers make the same claims as they do here.  In reality, they are destroying the planet and its future habitability.  In April, we found that just 20 of the world's biggest oil and gas companies, including Shell, Exxon, Gazprom and others, are projected to spend &euro;932 billion by the end of 2030 to develop new oil and gas fields.  Globally, we will emit more carbon dioxide than ever before.  The levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will reach historic highs.  None of the consequences, including the extreme heat, drought or storms affecting millions across the globe, matter to those who see just a few more dollars in the oil and gas industry.  We need to keep it in the ground and make sure every penny available for investment finds its way into renewable energy, retrofitting every home and paying for free, frequent public transport throughout the country.<\/p> <p> The Deputies are right that the Green Party is failing, but it is not, ironically, in the way that the Deputies seem to think.  The Green Party is failing to deliver radical measures to address climate emergency demands.  It is failing to stop data centres, to retrofit homes on the scale we need and to deliver free public transport.  We need that to tackle the root causes of the crisis.  The clear contradictions in Government policy allow climate change deniers to deride all climate action.  They put carbon taxes on ordinary people while supporting the proliferation of data centres and allowing the fossil fuel industry and its backers to be able to say it is a con, that the Government just wants to tax people and that it is not serious at all.  We have tabled an amendment to the motion.  It will probably never get heard, but I would like to draw people's attention to it.  It is quite a lengthy amendment.  I believe I do not have to move it today, but we want to get the Deputies who have spoken against this motion to back that amendment if they have a chance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500015#N01000","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655288520,"counter":85,"content":"<p>The reason the Deputy cannot move it is that there is another amendment to deal with first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500016#O00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1655288520,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tA.<br \/><br \/>To insert the following after &quot;reflect changing circumstances following the Russian invasion of Ukraine;&quot;:  \t&quot;&mdash; the cheapest barrel of oil is the one not burned and calls on the Government to reduce fossil fuel consumption by: <blockquote> \t&mdash; immediately approving applications received under the National Retrofitting Scheme, which are presently delayed by up to six months, if the homeowner has been fortunate enough to secure an assessment;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; expediting the rollout of the National Broadband Plan, thus reducing the need to travel to work;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; increasing renewable energy under the Biofuels Obligation Scheme to 10 per cent in petrol and 12 per cent in diesel, effectively doubling the usage of biofuels in Irish transport as committed to in the Climate Action Plan;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; establishing without delay a renewable heat obligation scheme similar to the Biofuels Obligation Scheme;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; supporting the development of an indigenous biomethane production for use in heating and transport;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; encouraging the use of Hydrotreated Vegetable Oils in the transport sector following the model as outlined in the Swedish Renewable Transport Policy;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; directing Gas Networks Ireland to design and construct district heating systems in suitable towns and urban districts;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; implementing as a matter of urgency through Bord na M&oacute;na, a bioenergy strategy including the use of fixed price contracts, to increase the supply of biomass for energy from our agriculture and forest sector;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; enacting the Wind Energy Development Guidelines signed off by the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment in June 2017 to replace the outdated 2006 guidelines; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; delivering its long-promised policy statement on geothermal energy and the required supporting legislation;&quot; <\/blockquote> B. <br \/><br \/>To insert the following after &quot;does not publish information on individual applications whilst they are under consideration&quot;:  \t&quot;and further calls on the Government to take decisive steps to reduce our medium-term dependence on fossil fuels by implementing in full the Offshore Renewable Energy motion unanimously approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 8th December, 2021, and to set out a clear policy strategy for the domestic production and consumption of green hydrogen.&quot;  <\/blockquote>  <p>Mattie's proposals and Eamon's proposals are just Tweedledee and Tweedledum.  They are never-never land plans.  Actions are being announced and all the decisions are ones I took as Minister.  For example, it will have taken five years from the Cabinet decision to stop purchasing fossil fuel buses until the first electric double decker bus goes into operation next January.  The reality is decisions take far too long to implement.  People are hurting due to the cost of fuel and inflation today and our climate is fast reaching the point of no return.  While we are big on glossy plans and targets, we are weak on practical implementation.  By 2022, Ireland had committed to funding a programme that would see 45,000 homes retrofitted this year and each year in future, but this green Government has reduced that target to just 22,000 homes.  We will be lucky if we see the first of the new retrofitting grants actually paid out by the time the winter fuel allowance is paid this September.  Those with rooftop renewable energy generation were legally supposed to receive microgeneration payments this time last year.  That was only because I signed up to an EU law forcing this to happen, against advice to the contrary.  These families will be lucky if they get the first payment this month.<\/p><p>The focus of Minister after Minister and the battle cry of environmentalists has always been to have more ambition, but no one has taken action to achieve our existing ambition, never mind the new targets for which we have no roadmap.  No one is prepared to answer how we will get there.  There are no answers, which I fear will ultimately leave agriculture having to carry its own emission costs as well as the other, non-performing sectors, by 2030.  The Government is giving away our offshore renewable rights, as it has in the past with oil and gas, just to achieve our renewable energy targets.  This is all at a time when some of the so-called environmentalists are literally rubbing their hands with glee at the price of petrol and diesel, quietly hoping it will rise by at least another 50 cent per litre.  They fail to realise that with no alternatives, all we are doing is hurting families while we continue to fail our environment.<\/p><p>The &euro;500 million Government climate action fund that was designed to provide innovation needed to provide fossil fuel alternatives in an Irish context is instead being raided to replace the funding that should be coming from other Departments.  What we have in front of us is a fairy tale set of proposals from both Government and Opposition, with very little practical action that would make a real difference to families who are hurting.  I have set out ten practical measures in our amendment that will wean us off oil and ensure we have a greener society with practical, implementable steps that can make a real difference to families.  If we had implemented those, it would not have left the Minister for Transport in the situation he was in earlier this week, where the only practical solution he had for those families who are struggling to pay the cost of petrol to get to work is to contact the local community welfare officer or, to put it more bluntly, &quot;Sod off and contact St. Vincent de Paul&quot;.

The motion from the Rural Independent Group is born out of frustration with where we are now and what is going on.  It gives us an opportunity to highlight some deficiencies.  For example, the national retrofitting scheme has been announced but it is not happening.  The national broadband plan is in place but it is not going at the speed it should if we want to keep people in their own localities, working locally, saving on cars on the road and on energy.<\/p> <p>We should enact the wind energy development guidelines that were signed off in June 2017 and have not been implemented.  We should enact microgeneration payback for people who invested money and put the panels onto their houses with an express intention they would be paid for any excess electricity going into the grid from 1 July last year.  To date they have received nothing.  They do not even know how much energy is going back out to the grid because it has not been metered.  It is a complete kick in the backside for anybody who decided to do anything about changing their lifestyle.  They were told to invest, they invested and now they are getting nothing back.  The contract is broken.  This is part of what is wrong with the agenda we have for climate action.  The contracts are being broken left, right and centre.  What we have left is people who are taking up the slack for inaction.<\/p> <p> We need to make sure transport modes are changed so that people can use a train.  The western rail corridor is there to be opened.  We have to have another review of it when we could be transporting people into Galway city through a very clean form of transport rather than having Claregalway stuffed with 30,000 to 40,000 cars per day.  We wonder why we are not meeting our targets.<\/p> <p> The electric vehicle charging infrastructure in this country is a joke.  I know of two people who bought electric cars and have sold them again because they cannot rely on the public infrastructure that is there.  That is an indictment of what we promise, what we say should be done and how we are going to have this great vision to bring Ireland into a green, renewable economy.  We have everything but we have nothing.  The motion on offshore renewable energy we brought in last December should be enacted.  We should take it on.  It was agreed by everybody.<\/p> <p> The biggest frustration people have is they are enduring additional costs, including in my own constituency of Galway East, to go to work and bring their children to school.  They have to use their cars.  They do not have public transport.  The school transport system is a joke at times.  They pass people by and do not bring them to school.  They prefer to see parents coming out in the car and bringing them to school, clogging up the outside of the school, burning more fossil fuels and creating more demand for it, which is leading to a motion such as the one before us.  We have announcement after announcement from the Government.  We do not have any plan or implementation strategy for them.  Therefore we have no action on the plans and announcements the Government makes.  We are here today and we have no results.

In the electricity sector, new companies came in such as Iberdrola.  Up to last February, companies signed up with Iberdrola.  All of a sudden, it decided it was leaving the market.  Those who enter into a contract are supposed to honour it.  Any person who enters into a building contract or whatever can be sued if they do not honour it.  These seem to be able to walk about.  In the first quarter of this year, that company made &euro;1 billion profit.  Where is the Government holding companies to account that are doing this?  Where is the EU legislation?  They hit the small person constantly, but when it comes to a big conglomerate, they let it off scot free.  How can they walk away with that?<\/p>  <p>  For contractors in the farming community, &euro;1.50 is the price of green diesel today.  Those who have the Luas, the DART and all the different public transport modes might not understand that people in rural Ireland have to drive to work.  They have to bring their kids to school.  When I was going to school there was a bus, but it is backwards we are gone now.  If a child is not within a certain mileage of the school, it is a case of \"tell Mammy or tell Daddy to bring them in the car\" or around Dublin in the SUV.  There is no joined-up thinking in how we solve things.  We are looking at EirGrid at the moment and talking about new generators.  What have we done?  We have closed some of the stuff.<\/p>  <p>  I could not believe what I read yesterday about the Minister, Deputy Ryan saying someone should go to the social welfare office.  Someone who is on &euro;25,000, &euro;30,000 or &euro;35,000 will go out the door of the social welfare office as quick as they came in.  It shows the disconnect that Ministers have that they do not understand that people have to be under a certain threshold before social welfare will even talk to them.  They will not even look at them.  Why do we not bring in something for the people who are really hurting at the moment, those who have to drive to work and bring their children to school?  I know it is holiday time now but it is only a few months until they go again.  There are people who are reliant on heating their homes.<\/p>  <p>  There is this thing about retrofitting but with the best will in the world, as the Minister should know, the facts are that even around Dublin schemes are being stopped because building costs are going out of control and getting labour is a major problem.  Six companies are in this new retrofit scheme so far.  Six companies will not do the number of houses required.  We are probably looking at a 30-year period to do the houses we are talking about.  The Government needs to show stability and basically help people.  People out there are hurting seriously at the moment between the electricity going up and fuel costs going up.  There does not seem to be a plan.  I read that in Malta yesterday white diesel was &euro;1.41.  I saw coming up here this morning that it costs between &euro;2.03 and &euro;2.15 while some places are at &euro;2.20.<\/p>  <p>  Something needs to be done.  Decisions have been made by the Taoiseach and supported by most of the House but sometimes when we make decisions that hurt us, such as that on the oil from Russia, we seem to run off and agree with everything in Europe while other countries are going to have it piped all the time.  They are not going to suffer like we are.  Sanctions should always hurt the oppressor, not the innocent people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500017#P00300","speaker":"1508"},{"type":"speech","time":1655289120,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I thank the Rural Independent Group for bringing forward this motion.  It is important we discuss our energy policy.  It is something I have advocated for some time.  We simply do not have energy security in this country at the moment.  We are in the decade of remembrance, the decade of celebrations.  One of the first things the State did when it was founded was develop energy security and energy policy.  It was a massive undertaking.  It is fantastic the ESB allows school tours of Ardnacrusha again, just to see what the State is capable of.  We are so inured to the failures of the State, the failure to develop infrastructure projects and see what actually could be done.  About a third of the GDP of the State in its first couple of years was devoted to building that plant at Ardnacrusha.  It is quite an emotional thing to actually see it and realise the sacrifice that went into it.  It was blood and bones as well.  Men died to build it so the State would have energy security.  Then we abandoned it for a false reassurance that we could rely on the kindness of others.  That has not worked out very well for us.<\/p>  <p>  I wonder if the Taoiseach still lives in a pipe dream where he thinks we can rely on the kindness of others, or if he wants to rely on the kindness of others to get a job in Europe.  As Deputy Fitzmaurice said, he is blithely going along with whatever von der Leyen is throwing out there at the moment, to the detriment of our own people, our State and its security.<\/p>  <p>  The previous speaker referred to a disconnect.  There is a massive disconnect between our energy policy and our energy needs.  The Rural Independent Group has brought forward this motion that refers to energy security, whether from sustainable or non-sustainable means.  There is an elephant in the room.  The D&aacute;il as a political entity is very good at not addressing the reality.  There is a big debate on whether nuclear power is sustainable and whether it can be considered to be renewable.  Either way, nuclear power is key to energy security across Europe.<\/p> <p>We are quite happy to buy nuclear power here in Ireland.  This Chamber is probably lit with nuclear power occasionally because we buy power from France.  France, in its wisdom, did not decommission its nuclear power plants when the Germans were following a fashion.  Germany was actually handing over energy security to the Russian state.  The Germans are still taking in the Russian gas.  We are crucifying ourselves but they are still happy to run their industries with Russian gas.  I refer to industries that make arms to sell to Ukraine to keep a conflict going.  They buy the energy to fuel the making of those armaments from Russia.  It is a ludicrous scenario.<\/p> <p> We need to think about nuclear power.  I do not love the idea - very far from it - but I recognise that we use nuclear power in this country and have to have energy security.  Small modular reactors may well have disadvantages but I would like to know what they are because, equally, there are advantages.  To put it in context, each small nuclear modular reactor is about the same size as one of the three generators at Moneypoint.  That we were going to power down Moneypoint and just abandon it now seems like such incredible hubris.  However, I agree with the Greens on one thing: we cannot continue to rely on coal-powered energy indefinitely.  We do need to consider something more sustainable.  Nuclear power is more sustainable.  I accept it is not without disadvantages but we have to deal with the reality of our energy needs in this country, not with what we would like them to be.  If we are to rely on wind, we should remember we have to power the country when the wind is not blowing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500017#P00400","speaker":"1518","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655289720,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I am happy to confirm the Government's position in response to the motion proposed.  The Government has moved a countermotion that affirms its policy position on reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.  The programme for Government indicated clearly how we can achieve that, including by committing to ending the issuing of new licences for the exploration and extraction of gas.  This mirrors the previous 2019 Government decision relating to oil exploration and extraction.  That commitment has been actively in place since 2020, and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is no longer accepting applications for new petroleum authorisations and will hold no future licensing rounds.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation copper-fastening the commitment in the programme for Government is the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act.  The Department is also working through a revised policy statement on petroleum exploration to reflect the current policy and legislative position, which will be published in the coming months.  The revised policy statement will give clarity to stakeholders on the position on authorisations in the future.  As referred to earlier, it is important to note that the licence application assessment process is informed only by financial, technical and environmental considerations, not by considerations related to energy security or broader energy policy matters.  As previously mentioned, the application for a lease undertaking referred to in the motion will be treated like all other applications for petroleum authorisation in accordance with the relevant legislation, with the full assessment being undertaken in line with the relevant criteria.  It is under active consideration by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, and it would be entirely inappropriate to comment further pending the making of a formal decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500018#Q00200","speaker":"1573"},{"type":"speech","time":1655289720,"counter":94,"content":"<p>The Minister of State's reply was almost as brief as the contribution of the other Minister of State.  What I am saying is not personal.  If the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, was not here because he is sick, I will understand and accept it; however, if we see him around the House today or this evening, we will be very annoyed.  We tabled this motion in good faith, as we are entitled to do as elected Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la and members of a registered technical group in this House.  We are not going to take any lectures from the Government and certainly not from Deputy Bacik, the leader of the Labour Party, or Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, nor will we take any from Deputy Jennifer Whitmore of the Social Democrats.  I also welcomed the school tour that was here today.  To think that we would be in any way disparaging or disappoint schoolchildren is incorrect.  We regularly bring in school tours here from our constituencies and all over.<\/p>  <p>  The problem we have at the moment is groupthink.  If you think outside the box and even offer to do so, be wise and be careful so as not to cut off our noses to spite our faces, you are demonised as a climate-change denier.  We are no such thing.  I resent Deputy Bacik's comments that our motion or speeches were written by an oil or gas company.  Nothing could be further from the truth.

He does an excellent job for us.  It is iar-Seanad&oacute;ir Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill, whom I thank.  I also thank Deputy Michael Collins, who has been pleading with people.  We are not looking for new licences willy-nilly; simply and plainly, we are seeking to be sure that we can keep the lights on.  We all know we have to have a transition.  An Teachta Nolan has been talking about this daily since the lovely phrase \"just transition\" came up.  It is the most unjust transition.  It involves shutting down the bogs, coal plants and everything else before we have any alternative.  Deputy Bacik said we should cycle.  We would look well cycling from Cahersiveen, Kerry.  I would look well cycling from Newcastle to Clonmel or Nenagh in County Tipperary to work and whatever else.<\/p>  <p>  I understand now, although I am not certain, that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, told people to go to their social welfare office yesterday.  The Department of Social Protection knew nothing about it.  I understand the Taoiseach has now said it.  I salute the social welfare officers and community welfare officers for the work they did during Covid and continue to do.  My concern is over the incompetence and downright blackguarding by the Government owing to its profiteering and tax take from oil at present when a European colleague like Malta has it available for &euro;1.40 per litre.  In this regard, let us consider what we are being told by the European Commission.  The Taoiseach is so good at dancing to every tune it plays.  Even if they are wildly out of tune, he dances anyway.  He would dance because he wants to dance into Europe when he, along with his party, will be hunted from the doors by the people of Cork.  He will be hunted, imithe, but he will get a big job in Europe.  Let us consider the damage he is doing with those who are doing whatever they want.  Last week, he was a cheerleader for stopping the importation of Russian gas.  I hate this war; it is horrific, but anyone with his or her eyes open can see we had these problems coming down the line before there was ever a mention of a war in Ukraine.  Put that in your pipe and smoke it.  Yesterday the Taoiseach replied to Deputy Michael Healy-Rae and said Mr. Putin and the war in Ukraine were the whole problem.  This is a total mistruth.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith said no threat exists to Ireland's current supply of gas coming from the North Sea primarily.  She also mentioned the plant at Moffat in Scotland.  What happens if it is sabotaged?  Accidents can happen.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and all the Cork brigade - the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, is not involved but I am referring to the other two - are trying to be stronger than each other in attacking the Prime Minister in No. 10.  What if he takes action, closes down or squeezes the pipe and turns off the gas to a trickle?  I recall a former Fine Gael Minister glibly with a glass of water telling us all he would turn off the tap to a trickle.  This might come home to roost, and it could be with oil.  Our motion merely wants to ensure our children and families are fed, our workers can go to work and our economy can continue.  These are basic human rights.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Nolan referred to the great men and women of 1916 and the great men of 1921, 1922 and 1923.  Many lives were lost to give us our freedom.  One of their first acts, as referred to by Deputy McNamara, was developing our natural resources.  They were men of forward thinking.  As he said, many were injured or lost their lives in accidents when developing our resources, but they had the foresight.  We are where we are now because of the latter-day emperor with no clothes, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who has a second incarnation in the Department of Transport.  I was part of the previous Government he was a member of.  I fundamentally disagreed with his policies.  Now he is back and he has both Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and several Independents backing whatever he does.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome Deputy Naughten's amendment but put it to the Independents that they should put their money where their mouths are tonight.  Will they support the Government or put bread on the table for the families they purport to represent?  They cannot have it two ways.  You would think you could fool the people given the indoctrination that is going on now.  I beg the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for her indulgence in that, while I realise we are not supposed to speak ill of our Uachtar&aacute;n or President, and I do not, to link the horrific terror attack in Nigeria to climate change is certainly stretching it.<\/p> <p>The archbishop out there dealt with that so I do not need to say any more about it.<\/p> <p> We are indoctrinating the good children in schools across the system that we are backward-thinking and we have no voice.  We are not allowed to have a voice and we are not supposed to have a voice, according to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith in her diesel guzzling van.  I am surprised she does not have electric or does not use the bike.  I know she used to use the bike.  Maybe she has the bike in the back of the van, like the Minister, Deputy Ryan, going to Limerick, or in the back of the State car, or whatever.  The con job is over.  The people are hurting.  Businesses are clinging on and have not reopened since Covid and more of them are going to close.  God help us all in the winter, when we see the price of oil.  All we are asking about is the near 60% tax the Government takes.  The ironic and subtle, or if not subtle, then the most sly thing of all is that the more fuel goes up, the more tax the Government gets out of it.  They are rubbing their hands with glee.  It is like rubbing Vaseline into a fat sow&rsquo;s I won't say where, but we know where, although some might not.  That is what it is.  The old people used to talk in those realms and terms.  I like to go back and think that the old people were wise. <\/p> <p> Let us remember that before the Minister ever came up with his retrofitting and green houses, we had thatch houses with a small window and a lovely cosy roof, that were cool in the summer and warm in the winter, before ever we had all of this green indoctrination that we have.  We are all for proper transition but not at the rate we are doing it and not completely blindfolded, with ears blocked &ndash; cluais d&uacute;inte - and no glasses or spectacles.  They are all voting cannon fodder for it.  They will get some voting cannon fodder when the people go in with their peann luaidhe into the ballot box.  The people will give them some rude awakening and they will want glasses to look at the number of papers to see where they figure on them - none of the above.<\/p> <p> This is because of what they do instead of protecting the people, which is their solemn duty, having been elected and gotten the seal of office in the Phoenix Park from Uachtar&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann.  That duty is to protect our citizens, not to perish them, not to destroy them, not to demoralise them and not to hurt them so much, as they are in so many ways by penal taxes, by punitive measures and by going blindly into different ways of energy, which we support, by the way, but they will not be here for maybe eight or ten years.  I was delighted to hear about the wonderful project of the solar farm out in Wicklow, and now we find it was another con job and it is not even connected to the grid yet.  What happened to all of the people who are retrofitting and who went into small microgeneration?  They cannot get onto the grid.<\/p> <p> The Ministers are fooling the people at every angle.  They are robbing them and pillaging them.  Cromwell did not do the likes of it.  We resisted them out of Clonmel and Tipperary; the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, has connections in Ardfinnan.  We kept them out but we cannot keep out the ravages of this trio here, the Taoiseach, Deputy Martin, the revolving Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, who is Deputy Brophy's leader, and the Minister, Deputy Ryan.  They all seem to be asleep at the wheel.  I am told there is r&iacute; r&aacute; agus ruaille buaille in the parliamentary parties.  That is little good to the people who cannot afford to fill their lunch boxes or cannot afford to fill the car to go to work.  What about the contractors and farmers who are trying to grow crops to produce the food with diesel at nearly &euro;1.60 a litre?  Then there is this nonsense with AdBlue, which has gone up fourfold in the past 12 months.  It is patent nonsense.  This is something we were supposed to buy into yet it has gone up four times due to the gouging that is going on.<\/p> <p> We will take no lectures from Deputies Whitmore and Bacik or the Government, or from Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, above anyone else, about her honesty and integrity.  We are entitled to put down our motion here and we put it down.  We do not work for any oil barons or oil oligarchs.  People would need to look closer to home to see who is funding them and whose support they have &ndash; Mr. Soros and others - and where the money is flowing from.  How dare they?  We are honest representatives of the people, elected by the people to this House, and we will continue to do so as long as we are elected and we have blood running in our veins.  We want to help the people.  We will see tonight how many more people are going to support us or not.  We stand proud of our record here.  We are not climate change deniers.  We are trying to look after our people because it is our primary duty as elected people to represent the people and to look after their interests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500018#Q00500","speaker":"1612","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655290320,"counter":98,"content":"<p>Thank you.

The truth is being spoken in a powerful way.  The cynical Government efforts to shut down and shut up those who stand up for the people are disgraceful.  The housing crisis is a decade of shame for Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  It has defined life in Ireland for far too long.  It has been profoundly damaging to the aspirations of an entire generation.  This generation is locked out of home ownership.  People are robbed of the ability to put an affordable roof over their heads.  The housing crisis is without doubt the great failure of successive Governments.  It is a sad reality that a home - a basic necessity of life &ndash; has become such a pipe-dream for so many.  This is not how things should be in a republic.  The coalition came to office two years ago and promised it would fix housing.  On the Minister&rsquo;s watch however things have gone from bad to worse.  People caught up in this crisis have had ringside seats as Government has recycled policies after policies that created the mess in the first place.<\/p>  <p>  All the Government has to do is look at the facts.  Rip-off rents continue to hit new record levels and the number of available properties has fallen to an all-time low.  House prices have soared beyond the reach of ordinary workers and families.  Homelessness has returned to pre-pandemic levels with more than 10,000 people in emergency accommodation.  In the Ireland of 2022 children are growing up in hotels and B&amp;Bs.  This flies in the face of the shared values of the Irish people.  It is the undeniable truth that Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have been the best voice in the class for the speculators.  They have turned housing, which is a basic human right, into a cash cow for private interests chasing as much profit as they can get.<\/p>  <p>  The policies of the Minister for Finance have always been about meeting the profit needs of the powerful developments, the landlords and the wealthy international investors and not the needs of ordinary families and workers.  Look at how Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have just used big tax advantage to roll out the red carpet for the cuckoo funds to bulk buy family homes.  Look at the litany of Government schemes that have lined the pockets of the speculators including the latest bonkers scheme where the Government gifts &euro;450 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money to developers to build homes that ordinary families will never ever be able to afford.  The charge being levelled at the Government is that it is a government of the top sticks.  To underscore the Government&rsquo;s failure this morning, the CSO published its figures which show house prices are out of control with property prices that have increased by 14.2% nationally in the past year.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Minister now accept that the housing crisis is a disaster?  Does he accept that the housing crisis is the great failure of his Government and successive Governments?

We accept this is a challenge to which we must rise and make progress on.  It is not just our language that will make a difference, but our efforts.  The efforts are showing clear signs of supplying improving.  It is only with more homes being built that we have the ability over time to see rents change and to make progress on affordability.  While I appreciate at all times the need for us to do more to get more homes built as quickly as we can, the figures in regard to supply are equally clear.  There have been 22,000 homes completed in our country over the past 12 months and 35,000 homes commenced.  For 2021, 43,000 have received planning permission.  They are just overall macro figures regarding what is happening in our economy, that is homes being built, houses and apartments, which are all about providing the additional supply which will make a difference to our country being able to ensure that we are delivering the homes that are needed for our people at the price levels we know are affordable.  We know we have to make more progress and do more.  That is why we have Housing for All.  I reject entirely the image and the tone that Deputy Doherty has suggested here to the House in regard to the intentions of this Government.  This Government is about delivering more homes for more people at different prices to meet the many needs we know exist within our society and our economy.<\/p>  <p>  Housing for All involves spending of up to &euro;4 billion per year to deliver the homes we know are needed, and yes, the Government believes that private supply has a role to play in delivering homes that are available to purchase for those who can afford to purchase them.  We also believe social, affordable and cost-rental homes are an equally necessary part of the solution that has to be delivered.  The progress we are looking to make on that is clear to see in the thousands of homes that are now being built throughout the country for social and public use.  I can see it across the city of Dublin.  In Dominick Street and in O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens I can see hundreds of homes now being delivered in that part of our capital city alone to respond to the housing needs that the Government knows are there.  That is why we have in Housing for All a plan that is not just looking to deliver this number of homes this year but is looking to deliver nearly 29,000 for next year and 30,000 homes per year for the years after that.  Yes, all of us in government accept the need to make more progress.  We understand the anxiety, stress and difficulty that this is causing to households all over our country.  The figures are there in the more homes that are being completed, the more planning permissions that are coming through and the more commencements that are now underway underpinned by this Government through local authorities all over the length and breadth of our country building thousands of homes for public and social use to respond to the need that the Government accepts is there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500020#S00300","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1655290920,"counter":114,"content":"<p>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has been a Minister for nine years now.

I hear from renters who are looking at unaffordable rents - rents are as high as &euro;4,000 per month for a house in my area - and renters who are facing eviction and cannot afford find another affordable home to rent.  I hear from young couples and individuals who cannot afford, or even aspire to afford, to buy their own homes.  This immense cost of housing is clearly contributing vastly to the cost-of-living crisis being faced across the country.  Yet, at the weekend, the Minister for Finance warned that there are limits to what the Government will do to ease the cost-of-living crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The pandemic has shown us that State intervention is the art of the possible and State investment and public intervention on housing and the cost-of-living crisis should now be a priority.  It is very disappointing to see the lack of action in this regard from the Government.  It is no wonder that President Michael D. Higgins has described the housing situation as a housing \"disaster\".  It is no wonder the President is referring to failures in Government policy.  It is deeply concerning in this context to see kite-flying from members of the Government about tax cuts being the priority, rather than the priority of spending on housing, childcare and public services such as schools and hospitals and on addressing what ICTU has rightly called the \"social wage\" measures.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday in the Seanad, we saw a disappointing indication from Government Senators who qualified their ambition for affordable public services with proposals on tax cuts.  That is not what is needed.  What we in the Labour Party have called for is a pay rise across public and private sectors to enable working families and individuals to see actual increases in their take-home pay and to see reductions in the costs they are facing in housing, childcare and health and proper Government investment in supports for people that will address the cost-of-living crisis and deliver housing to address the housing disaster we face.<\/p>  <p>  Pay increases are needed for the public and private sectors.  I welcome the public sector pay talks that are ongoing.  Being conscious that under the current pay agreement, workers are due to receive a 1% pay increase in October, with inflation now standing at 8%, this amounts to an effective pay cut for hardworking people.  I know that is understood and it is why the pay talks are under way.  I urge the Minister and Government members to take a generous approach to these talks, resist the conservative instinct not to be ambitious and not to trust people to spend wisely and take up the challenge and opportunity to see real investment in social wage measures, in childcare to ensure an equal early start for every child and in education and healthcare to reduce the enormous costs that are coming out of people's pay packets every week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500021#T01200","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1655291520,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Bacik for raising those two matters.  On the negotiations that are under way on public pay, it is precisely because the Government recognises and values so much the contribution that nurses, doctors, teachers and civil servants make to society and the economy that these public pay discussions are under way.  We believe an agreement on the future of public pay for the country is a just and needed recognition of the efforts of those who play such an important role, particularly during the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  On the Deputy's point on taxation, the views of the Government, including in the programme for Government, are very clear.  The Deputy made the point that if an increase in real pay happens, she wants that pay to feed through into take-home pay improving at the same rate.  That is the view of the Government in relation to indexation.  The point the Government is making is that if there is an increase in overall wages to respond to the great cost-of-living challenge we face, we simply want to ensure that as much as possible of that increase in overall wages feeds back into people's purses and wallets as opposed to being absorbed into unintentionally higher levels of taxation.  That is what we are looking to do.<\/p>  <p>  I would have thought there could be some common ground on this issue between the Deputy and me.  If she is making the point that she wants to see real pay increase, what the Government is doing is putting forward, as recognised in the programme for Government, a personal taxation strategy that is looking to do the same - no more and no less.  It is something that will be valued and needed at a time in which the cost of living is such a challenge and so many are under such pressure.<\/p>  <p>  In stating that there are limits to what a Government can do, I am simply making the point that the cost of borrowing is changing.  It is increasing.  It is quite remarkable how little this ever features in Opposition critiques and statements regarding what the Government will do.  At the start of this year, the interest rate on Irish Government debt was just above 0%.  Today, it is nearly 2.5%.  It is a change that is taking place around us, the consequences of which Ireland, the economy and the Government are well able to manage.  However, to indicate to the Oireachtas and the people of Ireland that there are no constraints on action the Government can take would plainly be dishonest and even dangerous.  Even within the constraints that are there, the Government's response in housing and the need to deliver more homes is an investment of &euro;4 billion and the thousands of homes being directly built by the Government via local authorities all over the country.  This is leading to higher numbers of planning approvals, commencements and homes being built.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500021#T01300","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1655291520,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  The Labour Party certainly believes in constructive and responsible opposition but we are a party of the left.  We believe in the need to ensure investment in public services for all.  We do not believe in tax cuts for some at the expense of public services for all.  That is our concern.  Our concern is that during the pandemic we saw, rightly, the State stepping up to deliver investment.  We need to see that level of ambition now in addressing the housing crisis and cost-of-living crisis.<\/p>  <p>  We have welcomed some Government measures but we have also been critical, rightly, when they do not go far enough.  For example, the Government's Sick Leave Bill 2021 will leave low-paid workers out of pocket and its flexible work legislation essentially offers employers a right to refuse flexible work options.  While we welcomed the Government's proposals on the living wage, they do not go as far as the Labour Party's Bill.  Our concern is that people have no more to give.<\/p>  <p>  I express solidarity with the striking Bausch + Lomb workers in Waterford.  One striking worker there stated that this winter they will be forced to leave the heat off and put on an extra jumper.  They are seeking a pay rise to tide them and their families over.

That was a unique period in our public and economic health, one that is thankfully coming to an end as the disease is put behind us.  Even though it is present, it is not posing the fundamental challenge to society and the economy that it did in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  I return to the point I made.<\/p> <p>If Deputy Bacik was looking for real wage growth for workers who need wage growth, surely she would support a personal tax approach that simply looks to move income tax credits and bonds in line with wage growth in our economy.  That is what we are looking to do.  If workers, particularly those on low to middle incomes, get the wage increase they deserve and will need given the rising cost of living we are now facing, they should not see too much of it absorbed in higher levels of taxation as they earn more.

These social homes are now being built across Dublin and many other cities to respond to the needs and issues we know so many are experiencing at the moment.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to where we are with homelessness.  We acknowledge that we are seeing an increase in homelessness levels.  Every family, child and person who is homeless at the moment is one too many.  We are doing all we can to respond to that and make a difference to it.  However, it is the reason we have set aside over &euro;100 million in Housing for All to make a difference and put in place the interventions to get families and children out of emergency accommodation and into their own homes and give them the accommodation they need.  It is the reason we are so committed to the public, social and affordable housing plans I have outlined in response to questions from Deputies today.  <\/p>  <p>  I appreciate that when Deputies are dealing with families who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless, it gives us an insight into the sheer worry, concern and anxiety they have about a future that is so uncertain.  The answer to that is to build more homes through our local authorities.  That is what is happening.  We will spare no effort in continuing to ensure that the local authority housing targets we have set are met.  We are seeing clear signs of progress being made.  More homes have commenced, more homes have secured planning permission and more homes were completed over the past 12 months.  These will provide a foundation, after the effects of a pandemic during which our construction sector was closed for so long, to make quicker and more effective progress on the housing needs the Deputy described.  While I accept these are real, I would argue to the Deputy that the Government is also making progress in responding to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500022#U02400","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1655292120,"counter":156,"content":"<p>There are talks, plans and promises but the reality is the situation just gets worse.

I want to raise a specific issue, which is that the cost of getting to and from work is rising, as the Minister well knows.  The Government has taken some steps to try to combat the cost of fuel but it has not been able to combat it adequately for the many people in the country who have to travel to work.  It is costing people more and more to get to work.  Obviously, it has to pay to be at work.  The Government has created economic conditions whereby a huge amount of employment has been created in the State, which is to be welcomed.  A very large amount of that employment is in low-paid work.  That is a problem, particularly when it is costing people money to get to work.<\/p>  <p>  There is a cohort I specifically want to raise, that is, those who drive as part of their work.  They not only have to drive to work but driving is a part of their job.  Public health nurses are one example but there are many others across the public and private sectors.  The Civil Service has set mileage rates for people who drive as part of their work, which give a certain amount per kilometre.  Those rates apply not just to everybody in the public sector, including HSE employees, Revenue employees and so on, but, in addition, many, if not all, employers in the private sector use the same rates.  In fact, Revenue references those rates.<\/p>  <p>  The rate at which people are paid for driving as part of their work dates from 1 April, April Fool's Day, 2017.  The Minister cannot but agree that the cost of driving has increased hugely since then.  In fact, the cost of driving has increased hugely since 1 April 2022.  While there is a broader issue around the cost of fuel and the cost of living generally, and we can address all of that if the Minister would like to, my specific question is whether he will change the mileage rate to enable people who drive not just to and from work but as part of their work to do so without it coming out of their pocket.  By doing so, they are subventing the employment they are engaged in for the benefit of their employers, whether that be the HSE, any other entity of the State or the private sector.  That type of work is becoming unaffordable for those who engage in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500023#V00700","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1655292720,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his very detailed question regarding the funding the State makes available to cover a share of the travel expenses of those who work on behalf of the State.  Perhaps this is a matter that will form part of the engagement in regard to public sector wages that is currently under way.  The Government hopes we will get to a point at which those negotiations will lead to a conclusion that is both fair and affordable.  It is a matter for which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is responsible.  I was involved in the setting of the mileage rate in 2017 and I remember some of the discussion around it.  I take the point that, obviously, the cost of travel and commuting has fundamentally changed in the past few months, let alone since 2017.  This may be a matter that can be dealt with in the discussions that are under way and which I hope will lead to a new agreement on public pay.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of all the measures we have put in place to try to reduce the price of commuting.  We know and accept that, for many, the price has still gone up by an awful lot.  Clearly, the reductions we have put in place in regard to excise duty will help.  The reductions in regard to gas and electricity do not relate directly to the price of fuel for cars but they are reductions from which all the people the Deputy referred to will benefit.

It absolutely needs to be addressed.  He talked about the general measures the Government has taken but he also spoke about the money that was spent earlier.  The increase in the cost of fuel is something that could not really be predicted because it is caused very directly by the conflict in Ukraine.  However, inflation is something that was very predictably driven by the monetary policies the Government, like many governments across the world, pursued throughout 2020 and 2021.  The US, in particular, is now bearing the brunt of the policies President Biden introduced.  I accept those policies were well intentioned but they have been catastrophic.  The reason the cost of fuel is hurting people so much is that it is mirrored by increases in costs right across the system.  That inflation includes food inflation, which the Government is doing nothing to combat in terms of the input costs, which will be passed on to consumers from next year, further driving inflation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500023#V00900","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1655292720,"counter":170,"content":"<p>The reference the Deputy made to monetary policy is interesting because it is the monetary policy that was in place which allowed the Government to put in place the huge support during the time of Covid, as referenced by Deputy Bacik.

Many who wish to switch to an EV cannot be facilitated in doing so because of the lack of publicly-accessible charging facilities.

We must see urgency.  We need to see the Government ramping up the installation of public charging points in urban and rural areas to enable the switch to EVs.

Climate change is one of the key challenges of this century and failure to address it effectively will result in major adverse impacts that will affect all countries.  The latest climate science has observed unprecedented changes in the climate system.  I am pleased to present this annual transition statement as provided for under section 14(1) of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.  This is the fifth annual transition statement and it is being presented to both Houses in line with the requirements of the 2015 Act.  The statement includes an overview of Ireland's climate change mitigation and adaptation policy measures, including specific updates for the various sectors designated in the 2015 Act.  The 2020 annual transition statement also sets out a record of our greenhouse gas emissions and projections from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, as well as a report on the State's compliance under EU law and international agreements.  While the 2020 annual transition statement must predominately contain information in respect of 2019, it also records more recent policy developments relating to climate mitigation and adaptation.  This strengthened climate governance framework provided for under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 means that annual transition statements are now replaced with climate action plans and long-term climate strategies and, therefore, this will be the final annual transition statement.<\/p><p>To give a brief overview of the various development and policy measures adopted to mitigate and reduce emissions, I will highlight some of the key items included within the 2020 annual transition statement.  The climate action (amendment) Bill was signed into law in July 2021.  It set Ireland on a legally binding path to net-zero emissions no later than 2050 and to a 51% reduction in emissions, relative to 2018 levels, by the end of this decade.  To deliver on the ambition set out in the Act, the Government published the Climate Action Plan 2021 last November.  It includes policies and measures in every sector to bring about the significant changes needed to transform our society and to meet our climate ambition for 2030 and beyond.  The 2021 Act established a system of carbon budgeting as a key element of a strengthened legislative framework.  In April, following an extensive consultation process, a programme of carbon budgets was approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas and thus came into effect.  <\/p><p>The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is currently preparing the sectoral emission ceilings for Government approval in the coming weeks.  This process has included extensive engagement with all relevant Departments and agencies.  Carbon pricing is a key pillar of Ireland's overall decarbonisation strategy.  The Finance Act 2020 sets a statutory trajectory for carbon prices in Ireland that will raise an additional &euro;9.5 billion by 2030.  This revenue is being allocated to programmes that support sustainability and those most vulnerable to rising costs, including &euro;5 billion for energy efficient retrofits, &euro;3 billion to address fuel poverty and a just transition, as well as &euro;1.5 billion to promote sustainable agriculture practices.<\/p><p>On the electricity generation sector, the 2020 annual transition statement highlights progress made while also noting our increasing ambitions for renewable energy.  This fundamental shift will require major changes to the electricity generation mix, transmission and distribution grids alongside significant changes to our national demand profiles and storage capacity.  The statement identifies measures adopted and progress made across a number of areas, including via the renewable electricity support scheme, RES; the enactment of the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021; ongoing work on a new offshore renewable energy development plan as well as efforts to support microgeneration and small-scale solar energy.  The 2020 statement also highlighted ongoing work to enhance our electricity interconnection and upgrade our electricity grid, with &euro;4 billion allocated for capital investment over the period 2021-2025.<\/p><p>The statement lists progress in the enterprise sector through a number of the measures to meet our 2030 targets.  These include the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment engaging with the cement sector to identify opportunities for further introduction of alternative fuel sources; Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland introducing strategies that focus on decarbonisation and sustainability; the launch of the <i>ClimateToolKit4Business<\/i>website; the extension of the accelerated capital allowance scheme for energy efficient equipment; and the introduction of the disruptive technologies innovation fund and the climate enterprise action fund.  <\/p><p>In our built environment, the statement provides updates on progress made to decarbonise our commercial buildings with a range of supports and funding.  In addition, support is provided to our SMEs through the excellence in energy efficiency design, EXEED, programme to provide energy savings and emissions reductions.  The public sector energy efficiency programme, led by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, is providing comprehensive support to public bodies to achieve their energy efficiency targets.  The annual statement also notes how Climate Action Plan 2021 supports measures to develop our district heating potential and to ensure our retrofit ambitions also align with the Housing for All strategy.<\/p> <p>The 2020 annual transition statement details how our transport sector is playing a significant role in the national mitigation effort.  The decarbonisation pathway in transport is multilayered and will primarily focus on shifting to more sustainable transport modes; reducing the overall distances driven by fossil-fuel-powered cars; accelerating the electrification of road transport and an increased use of biofuels.<\/p> <p> Measures to support this have included the delivery of 261 new buses in 2021, with progress also made on delivering BusConnects and the launch of the NTA's Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan.  A low-emission vehicle task force has been established and a national electric vehicle, EV, charging infrastructure strategy is in development to prioritise delivery of fast charge point infrastructure over the next five years.  An additional 248 staff were allocated across the 31 local authorities and national roads offices to assist with the delivery of the significantly increased number of projects to promote active travel.<\/p> <p> The launch of the sustainable mobility policy in April set out the framework to deliver at least 500,000 additional daily active travel and public transport journeys by 2030 and a 10% reduction in the distances driven by fossil-fuelled cars.  The Department of Transport is developing a ten-year strategy for the haulage sector that will be focused on improving efficiencies and standards and helping the sector move to a low-carbon future.<\/p> <p> The 2020 annual transition statement highlights a number of developments in how our agriculture and land use, land use change and forestry, LULUCF, sector is committing to reducing its emissions.  The sector will also contribute by reducing land-based emissions through managing our soils in a better way.  Food Vision, launched in August 2021, is a landmark for the agrifood sector and has the potential to transform the agriculture, food, forestry and marine sectors, with sustainability at its core.<\/p> <p> The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, DAFM, has overseen a number of programmes and initiatives to support the farming community to adopt and expand sustainable practices.  This has included collaboration with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the nitrates action programme to reduce chemical nitrogen use, establish a national fertiliser register, reduce the crude protein content of livestock feed and upskill farmers.<\/p> <p> Other initiatives and programmes to support cost savings and more efficient and sustainable farming have included the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, the young farmer capital investment scheme and the green, low-carbon, agri-environment scheme, GLAS.  Further work is also ongoing on the promotion of protected urea fertilisers.  There has also been significant improvement in grant and premium rates for the forestry for fibre scheme, which has been extended to the end of 2022.  The DAFM is currently preparing a new forest strategy and in 2020, &euro;79.2 million of capital expenditure was invested in forestry development.<\/p> <p> The 2020 annual transition statement also highlights our ongoing work on climate adaptation to address current and future risks posed by a changing climate.  Ireland's robust adaptation strategies will also have positive benefits through fostering green growth, innovation, jobs, ecosystem enhancement and improvements in water and air quality.  Ireland's first statutory national adaptation framework identified 12 key sectors requiring sectoral adaptation plans.  These plans were approved by Government and published in October 2019.<\/p> <p> The progress on implementation of the agriculture, forest and seafood adaptation plan has been made both within the DAFM and externally.  Work has continued to raise the profile of adaptation by aligning the mitigation and adaptation reporting processes together.  Actions within this biodiversity sectoral adaptation plan build on the foundations of the national biodiversity action plan.  These actions are aimed at improving sustainable agriculture and fisheries, better soil and land management and, most urgently, the restoration of natural systems.<\/p> <p> Climate change can also cause major infrastructural damage to transport networks, as well as disruptions to services and safety conditions.  The adaptation plan for transport infrastructure identifies key risks in the area and serves as a step towards building Ireland's long-term vision of a low-carbon and environmentally sustainable transport sector by 2050.  The energy and gas networks adaptation plan seeks to identify options that will help build resilience against the impacts of climate change and asses our vulnerability to likely climate impacts on our electricity and gas networks.  The adaptation plan for the water quality and water services infrastructure presents an assessment of future climate risks to the sectors.  The plan outlines the measures available to build resilience to the effects of climate change and weather-related events and other socio-economic developments in both sectors.<\/p> <p> The 2020 annual transition statement refers to the EPA's provisional greenhouse gases emissions report for 2019 emissions and projections for 2020 to 2040.  However, as there are now more up-to-date figures available, I will provide a brief overview of them.  In November 2021, the agency reported that for 2020, total emissions in Ireland were estimated to have declined by approximately 3.6% compared to 2019.  This reduction was driven by a drop in the use of peat for electricity generation and Covid-19's impact on transport.  This relatively small overall reduction, given the substantial impact Covid has had on our society, further highlights the transformative nature of the measures that are now required to meet our 2030 and 2050 targets.<\/p> <p> In May, the EPA released its emissions projections out to 2040.  These projections estimate that in 2021, Ireland's emissions rose by 6% compared to 2020.  In some part, this was driven by our emergence from Covid-19 and associated restrictions.  The agency also estimated that we were not on course to meet our 2030 targets, although its modelling could not fully factor in all actions and measures in our climate action plan, given further technical details are still to be developed.<\/p> <p> We must consider how to accelerate the delivery of measures and actions that can not only reduce our emissions, but also support new ways of conducting business and encouraging innovation.  As part of the process to deliver the next climate action plan, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications will engage with other Departments to identify opportunities for accelerating our climate action.<\/p> <p> The transition to a carbon-neutral economy will provide considerable opportunities to foster innovation, create new jobs and grow businesses in areas such as offshore wind, cutting-edge sustainable agriculture and low-carbon construction.  While we all must act together towards our climate objective, I realise that the costs of climate action will be more acutely felt by some than by others.  As a Government, we are committed to protecting those most vulnerable and to ensuring a just transition to a low-carbon economy.  I thank Members for their time and I welcome their comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500028#FF00200","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655296020,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  Although the annual transition statements framework was abolished and replaced with a new process under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, this gives us a good opportunity to reflect on the Government&rsquo;s progress to date on reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and take on board suggestions from the Opposition on actions that need to be taken.  I will pick up on one of the Minister of State's final comments that \"we must consider how to accelerate the delivery of measures and actions\".  We are really in a space in which we need implementation.  It is the number one word we heard from the EPA.  Let us get on with the considering but, more importantly, let us get on with the action.  There are many frameworks, plans and reports but there is an acute shortage of action.<\/p>  <p>  The Government committed in the programme for Government to cut emissions by an average of 7% per annum over its lifetime.  Unfortunately, what is coming to pass is very different.  I know the figure of 7% is contested but it is certainly the figure in the programme for Government, if not in the carbon budgets.  After a fall in emissions in 2020, due significantly to the shuttering of the economy and people being confined to their homes, we are back to business as usual with our national emissions increasing last year and almost certainly this year too.<\/p>  <p>  Total greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to have increased by 6% in 2021, as the Minister of State has indicated, rather than decreased by the required 4.8% as per the Climate Change Advisory Council&rsquo;s carbon budgets.  In addition, earlier this year, the head of the EPA said emissions are again unlikely to fall in 2022.  Either way, it is a long way off where we need to be.  I am not highlighting these failures to try to score political points.  We are serious about these matters.  We want to meet our targets because it is beyond party politics.  This is very important but, of course, there are huge wheels to turn and many component parts in making policy work and delivering on those objectives.  That is where the differences arise between my party and the Government.<\/p> <p> Missed climate targets are a loss for everyone, not least the climate, and make the 2030 target, for whoever is in government, even harder to reach.  The incoherent Government policy that is contributing to these missed emission targets needs to be called out.  Yesterday, it was announced that the State is set to spend &euro;350 million on new gas-powered generators, due entirely to the failure of this Government and previous Governments to appropriately balance our electricity demand and supply.  This means much-needed investment is being redirected from renewables and into fossil fuel infrastructure.  There is an opportunity cost with every ounce of energy and euro that we put into this infrastructure.<\/p> <p> Data centres drive the instability in our electricity system and place a massive burden on it.  The previous Fine Gael Government rolled out the red carpet for data centres and sought to make Ireland, especially Dublin, the data centre capital of the world, or certainly of Europe, with no thought given to the impact this would have on our electricity supply or carbon emissions.  There was certainly no tangible indication that any thought was given to it.  The current Government has not changed approach sufficiently, despite our more ambitious climate targets and the increased threat of electricity blackouts.  People are familiar with the term \"amber alert\" now in a way they never were before.  Data centres now use as much electricity as all the homes in rural Ireland combined.  Their consumption is set to at least double by 2030.  This is already putting severe pressure on our energy system and cannot be consistent with our emission reduction targets.  It is a policy choice that this Government made over our climate targets.<\/p> <p> The recent reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change further reinforce the need for urgent action to mitigate climate change.  Our energy sector has huge potential to deliver significant carbon savings.  Sinn F&eacute;in has called for an acceleration in the delivery of renewables, particularly offshore wind and green hydrogen.  The length of time it takes to deliver offshore wind, from concept to generation, is far too long.  We need to speed up this process.  We are happy to work with the Government to provide clear proposals in that regard and support constructive measures from the Government.  The Government can do this by fully resourcing the agencies involved, such as An Bord Plean&aacute;la, EirGrid and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.  I have repeatedly raised this with the Minister.<\/p> <p> Our island has significant potential relating to green hydrogen, but we still have no national plan in this area.  The price of renewables in the latest RESS auction is far too high.  Sinn F&eacute;in has called for the establishment of a cross-government high-level task force to bring forward recommendations on how to lower the price of renewable energy here.  Policy options can be implemented to reduce the cost of renewables.  EirGrid says the auction itself will do it, but it is not doing so.  That is another immediate move the Minister can make, but we see no action in this area.  The Government and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, are holding firm in their position.  Simple measures like removing the planning barriers for schools to install solar photovoltaics took two full years for this Government to begin to address.  We have now entered a public consultation phase on it.  This is the lowest of the low-hanging fruit.  I do not know of anybody who opposes this measure.  I know Departments and institutions have their way of working, but given the state of the crisis, it looks like a government-as-usual approach.  The Government needs to focus on unravelling those knots and getting through those processes immediately.  As another example, five years since Sinn F&eacute;in introduced a Bill on microgeneration in the D&aacute;il, people are still not getting paid for the clean energy they are exporting to the grid.<\/p> <p> There are many opportunities relating to transport.  I welcome the progress that has been made on fares.  Much more can be done by expanding Connecting Ireland.  Its funding needs to be increased.  There is significant opportunity for progress, but every time the Government designs schemes, they fail the equity test and the just transition test.  That acts as a barrier to progressive climate action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500029#GG00200","speaker":"1507","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655296620,"counter":260,"content":"<p>In his closing remarks, the Minister of State spoke about the need for a just transition for communities, which is crucial.  It is particularly important for communities that have been hardest hit.  I am thinking of those in Shannonbridge and Lough Ree and the severe economic blow that the closure of plants there has dealt to the local communities.  Generations of families have relied on these plants for employment.  The bottom line is that those jobs have not been replaced.  My colleague, Deputy Sorca Clarke, and I met community representatives in Lanesborough a couple of weeks ago.  We were right across the road from the now closed Lough Ree power station.  We discussed the recent feasibility study carried out on behalf of Roscommon County Council about the potential for a boardwalk on Lough Ree at Ballyleague.<\/p>  <p>  I will highlight the potential for this boardwalk.  It offers something unique that is really needed and can make a difference in Ballyleague and Lanesborough for tourism, the local economy and job creation.  Four options were outlined in the feasibility study.  The report concluded that the first option, at a cost of &euro;10 million, was the best.  I hope the Minister will give his backing to the project to ensure this investment is made.  The report concludes that it would be a key element of infrastructure necessary to promote economic development and the potential extension and opening of new tourism-related business.  It states it will help to offset negative social and economic impacts arising from the loss of employment in the area and that it will help to rank up Ballyleague as a premier water recreation and angling destination.  We need to invest in these communities that have been at the coalface.  This is a good project.  I hope it will receive backing and support.

It is no surprise because the three Government parties, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party, have met none of the climate targets they set.  Unfortunately, the Government is following a familiar trajectory.  To give some examples, the 2020 report that we are debating today refers to an afforestation target of 8,000 ha every year until 2030.  In fact, since this Government took office with a Green Party Minister of State at the helm of afforestation policy, the Government has overseen a 42% reduction in afforestation.  We reach about 25% of the targets.  The Minister keeps telling us we have turned a corner.  Even since the beginning of this year, the very soft forestry licensing targets that have been set have been missed almost the entire time.<\/p>  <p>  It is also the case for organics.  The EU average for organics stood at 7.5% in 2017 and a target of 25% has been set for 2030, but this Government has decided on a target of 7.5% conversion by 2025, which it has pushed out to 2027.  The only stated objective on climate action that this Government has been able to implement is to continuously increase carbon taxes at a time when ordinary workers, families, communities, businesses and farmers are absolutely begging for support.<\/p>  <p>  We have a Government that, instead of implementing measures to assist us all in achieving our climate targets, is continuously attacking ordinary communities which have no option but to use those things, for which they are charged.  It is not good enough.  A sea change in attitude is needed.  We need to recognise that if we are to meet our ambitious climate action targets, there needs to be leadership at Government level.

The cost-of-living crisis is bringing a new urgency and worry to the issue, not alone in terms of money and cost but by exposing the unsustainable way in which the global economic system encourages and depends on us to live.  We were reminded of the sheer scale and folly of this by young people from across the State who came to speak to us at the climate committee in the Seanad last Friday week.  They get all of it, the hell we are headed to without radical change.  We must change so as to use radically less energy and we must manufacture, buy and consume less stuff.  To give the impression they have the transition under control Governments, including our own, are peddling the narrative that tweaks will save us.  Electric vehicles, wind and solar are crucial for sure but in the real and burning world tweaks will not save us.  Less energy, production and consumption and less stuff has to be the premise from which a just transition flows.  Otherwise we are ignoring what the scientists at the climate committee are telling us is just dead ahead.<\/p>  <p>  The just transition that Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to must face the reality of where we are now, not the greenwash or the spin.  We are well ahead in milestones of heat, methane release and acidity of our oceans.  The current modelling has not even factored in the breaking up of the Antarctic ice or the atmosphere's sensitivity to carbon and methane.  We have to target retrofitting our homes.  We have to get clean public transport sorted.  We have to look after our biodiversity and keep our waterways pristine with tough sanctions on polluters.  In north Kildare last week we had our own biodiversity crisis in Leixlip with dangerous pollution of the River Rye, a salmon spawning site which is cherished by the community.  It really is unacceptable.  <\/p>  <p>  As we come to the end of our D&aacute;il term, let us be honest about where we are in our just transition.  No matter the extremes, we can and must make the necessary radical changes even though we have to start from where we are now.  We have to be honest with people.  Otherwise we are just whistling in the wind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500031#JJ00100","speaker":"1585"},{"type":"speech","time":1655297220,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to debate climate action and discuss the interdepartmental negotiations on sectoral targets.  We know that the deadline is drawing ever close as weeks pass coming up to the end of this term in mid-July.  Our global climate and biodiversity crises are existential and fundamental to our capacity to live and to the survival of our planet, but it is not all doom and gloom and we should never feel powerless.  That is always an important message.  We must ensure that there is always some optimism and grounds for hope.  Resisting despair does not mean ignoring the alarm bells, however.  Consecutive reports of the EPA and IPCC have provided us with a chilling prognosis but also a reminder that action is still possible to avoid a climate catastrophe.  We have many of the solutions before us.  Every day and every year we see positive changes with growing understanding of how we can roll out renewables, develop offshore wind energy and so on.  From agriculture to transport, we know what we have to do.  Today we reiterate our call for urgent action to be taken to ensure that we meet our ambitious but necessary climate targets.<\/p>  <p>  The first Bill I published when I was first elected to the Oireachtas 15 years ago, in the Seanad which seems a long time ago in some ways, sought to impose a cap on Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions.  It was the first Bill of its kind in Ireland.  Although that took place relatively recently, it seems a lifetime ago in terms of understanding the urgent need for action to combat the crisis.  Even 15 years ago, there was none of that sense of urgency at international level and there was a great deal more climate denial both here and elsewhere.  It is good that we are today in a place where sectoral caps are being made a reality and there is far greater consensus on the science of climate change and the necessity to move swiftly to avoid catastrophe.<\/p>  <p>  The IPCC is clear that we are currently on a path to exceed 2&deg;C warming worldwide, which could result in enormous loss of life, livelihoods, biodiversity and food security.  We hear chilling reports of the loss of species which is a wake-up call.  This debate today must serve to refocus our energy on the urgent need to ramp up drastic climate action and to call for more urgency from Government.  I will not waste this opportunity to express my frustration at continued attempts by some Members of the Opposition to derail climate action in Ireland.  We saw the most recent occurrence of that in the House this morning when we debated a backward-looking, regressive motion on fossil fuels which the Labour Party is opposing along with others.  I am glad that this is a more constructive debate this afternoon.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad we will have sight of the Government&rsquo;s sectoral pollution targets for electricity, transport, buildings, industry and agriculture before the D&aacute;il breaks for its recess in July.  However, I again express my frustration that, as was the situation before Christmas, we are right up against the deadline of a recess when it comes to scrutinising these important measures.  We saw this before Christmas with the long delays leading eventually to publication of the annexe to the climate action plan that I and many others had been looking for to enable us to have more time prior to the break.  I hope we will not see a repeat of the delays of the past and I look forward to engaging further with the Minister of State and his Department on this in the coming month.  Can the Minister of State provide a commitment that we will see this announcement made in a timely fashion and not just in the last week of the term?  In the spirit of constructive engagement, I ask that an open line of communication is maintained with Opposition politicians and other stakeholders in the NGO sector such as Friends of the Earth, even when the D&aacute;il is in recess.  <\/p>  <p>  Since our overall limits for the decade to 2030 were passed by the D&aacute;il in April, I am very grateful to activists, NGOs and others for commentary and support.  During that debate in April, I noted the degree of back-loading of our reductions between 2025 and 2030.  It underlines the need to ensure that between now and 2025, we meet those more moderate targets.  The IPCC has been very clear that a small window of three years exists to meet those necessary targets and avoid disaster.  During negotiations of our sectoral emissions, there must be an understanding that we are dealing not so much with targets but, more accurately, a floor beneath which we cannot fall.  It would be morally unconscionable to pass the clear tipping points the IPCC has identified, which would trigger larger scale changes in Earth's systems and a loss of biodiversity.  We know that only in the event that every sector meets the upper end of the ranges published last November will we meet the overall target in the climate law.  The concern is that we are not currently on target to achieve this.<\/p>  <p>  For example, we understand from recent media commentary that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is under intense pressure not to agree to pollution cuts of more than 22%.  We need to be careful about all sectors meeting the relevant targets.  The just transition that we in the Labour Party, as red greens, are calling for requires that those who are being asked to make the most onerous changes are aided and supported in doing so.  In advance of the final publication of overall objectives later in the year, I ask that the Minister of State consider the questions asked by Friends of the Earth: Will the sectoral ceilings add up to no more than the national carbon budget passed by this House previously?  Will the sectoral ceilings align with our 51% emissions reduction target for 2030?  Will every sector do its fair share to reduce emissions or are other sectors being penalised for the foot-dragging of others?  Will the Government ensure that any contingency fund of unallocated emissions budget is only used for sectors that are doing everything possible to cut emissions?<\/p>  <p>  We seek to offer constructive Opposition.  We support the ambitious but necessary climate targets and look to stand with the Government and all of those who wish to work seriously and genuinely and to engage on the necessary actions to achieve the survival of our planet.  We want to stand together and work together to ensure that we do right by people in Ireland, not only of our generation but generations to come.  We need to ensure that we do so by meeting our targets and working together collectively.  In that spirit I thank the Minister of State and his officials for engaging with us in this debate but I hope we will see further engagement outside of this House and beyond July.  I really look forward to seeing the publication of measures before the end of this term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500031#JJ00200","speaker":"1698"},{"type":"speech","time":1655297220,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Bruton.  There is an irony in how many young people live their lives these days.  They have no problem going online and ordering a pair of jeans manufactured in China or Asia which have to make four or five stops before being courier-delivered to their door.  However, the people who are prepared to shop like this are increasingly discouraged from travelling because of carbon shaming and the feeling that if they go on holidays, they are also a cause of the global warming phenomenon.  That has become a trend.  Aviation has responded and in the last years large aircraft manufacturers like Boeing and Airbus have gone into the exploration of hydrogen fuel and are now launching flights.<\/p> <p>This is very much where the sector is moving, and Ireland needs to position itself as a country that can really tap into this.  It will be a pioneering phase of global aviation, guided by the right and just principles associated with trying to save our planet and cut down on carbon emissions from international travel.<\/p> <p> A major development to be considered in Ireland, which I do not believe has been properly considered by the Government and its agencies yet, is the Green Atlantic wind farm off the wild Atlantic coast, or off the coast of Clare.  It is an offshore wind farm that will bring electricity onshore at the site of the former Moneypoint coal-burning power station.  It is a massive project.  It is the biggest wind energy project to be committed to in Ireland and one of the largest in Europe.  The most interesting aspect, on which construction has already started, is a synchronous compensator.  The cost is to be &euro;50 million.  Everyone who understands wind energy knows that when electricity is generated by wind, it cannot be stored.  If it is not used on the grid, it has to be grounded.  Every week, electricity worth millions of euro is grounded into the earth unused.  At Moneypoint, the electricity generated offshore will be brought to the sink compensator and stored as hydrogen, which can be used in many facets.<\/p> <p> This morning, another hydrogen vehicle was trialled in the streets of Dublin.  Aviation is very quickly moving in this direction.  Further into the Shannon Estuary, about 15 or 16 nautical miles from Moneypoint, is Shannon Airport, where there is the capacity to store 33,000 metric tonnes of aviation fuel at any given time.  Shannon Airport and its fuel farm, with its capacity, have great potential to be the stopping point for aircraft coming in from the United States and passing over from Europe.  When aircraft first convert to hydrogen fuel, which will happen in the next decade or so, they will not have the same capacity as on avgas.  They will have to touch down, refuel and take off again.  This is far more environmentally friendly, and we are positioned geographically as the unique stepping stone between the continents of North America and Europe.  It is an opportunity that has not yet been explored properly to any great extent from an Irish perspective.<\/p> <p> The wind energy guidelines are grossly outdated.  They are 16 years old.  On the eve of the last general election, the previous Government had a set of brand new draft guidelines that were to be signed off on.  Along came an election, Covid and a host of other issues and they seem to have got buried.  Those in the industry who want to build wind facilities and see more of them say the guidelines are totally outdated and do not reflect what they have in their workshops and want to construct, and those who live in communities surrounded by wind farms say the protective measures of the guidelines, relating to setback distance, flicker effect and such matters, do not give sufficient protection.  Therefore, it is lose&ndash;lose at the moment.  If we are serious as a country about greening our economy and grasping renewable energy, we should have a current, modern set of guidelines related to wind energy production.<\/p> <p> Many believe Moneypoint is closed but it still has coal-burning and electricity-generating capacity.  In a time of national fuel and energy crises, it makes sense for us to continue to use power stations like Moneypoint to fuel up and ensure that our country is lit up by night and that we have a sufficient supply of domestically generated electricity.  We have an east&ndash;west interconnector.  In Ireland, we are choosing to move away from fossil fuels, and rightly so.  I am not saying we should not, because we all want to get to that point, but that we should relinquish fuels only when we have developed replacement capacity through renewables.  Every time we buy electricity on the east&ndash;west interconnector, it comes from power stations in Britain, three of which, including Drax, produce electricity by burning coal.  If we are talking about global warming and a global problem, we are only putting our heads in the sand if we believe that by shutting down our facilities and buying from Britain, we have solved the problem.  I ask for a more holistic approach to this over the next two or three years.  When we have the offshore capacity, which is coming, we can then shut things down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500031#JJ00300","speaker":"1519","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655297820,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to address this.  These annual transition statements, as an exercise in assessing the impact of policy, comprise a very poor instrument.  I know it is a legacy from the previous legislation but it is dealing with the matter too late.  In the middle of 2022, we are dealing with figures from 2019.  When trying to look to the road ahead, looking so far out the back window is of little benefit.  It gives no insight into how individual policy measures are impacting the targets in various sectors and imposes no serious line responsibility on Ministers regarding performance in their sectors.  Therefore, the statements are very much an instrument of the past and are simply not fit for purpose.  As the Minister designs the mechanism for future accountability to the House, he will have to ensure it is radically different.  The legislation we have passed gives a framework for doing that, but I would like to see the Minister of State return to the House to tell us how it will be done and how we can have a genuine role in holding the Government to account.<\/p>  <p>  The annual transition statements provide some benchmarks on how we are doing.  Regarding the target for 2020 to 2025, we have done well on renewables and electricity, achieving minus 41% in our emissions.  We failed pretty miserably in all the other sectors, including the transport, agriculture and residential sectors, where we delivered a reduction of only 7%.  While I share absolutely the vision of renewables being a key and a very great opportunity for us, it is greenwashing somewhat to pretend they will save us.  We have heard the Opposition accusing the Government of greenwashing but it is greenwashing to pretend we will solve the problem with a renewables sector that will not impact on the way we live and without having carbon pricing.  There are those on the Opposition benches who say polluters must pay.  Carbon is the big polluter.  It is what is polluting our globe and making it burn up.  Despite this, there are those who say in the same breath that they want the polluters to pay but not the polluters who generate carbon.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has a genuine uphill struggle because, in trying to bring people with it on this challenging journey, there will be much cynicism in the political world.  We have seen this in the portrayal that rural Ireland can build a prosperous future by clinging to old practices.  That is the message we often hear in this House.  That is not a future that will deliver for rural Ireland.  We have to build a future for rural Ireland on modern practices.  That means sustainable food, broadband, the remote delivery of services and remote working.  I am referring to the many ways in which we can greatly transform the face of rural Ireland and create a very prosperous vision for it.  That is what we need to build.  My saying this is not to fault the effort going into all the planning and the sectoral allocation but I believe we do need to build a vision people can share.  That is where we will face the greatest challenge.<\/p>  <p>  I will repeat an appeal to the Minister of State that I know has fallen on deaf ears somewhat, that is, that we should adopt the circular economy as the central plank of our climate planning.  That is the way in which we can mobilise people.  At the heart of the circular economy idea is having the vision that we can produce food sustainably, meet our travel needs and deliver all the standards of living we enjoy but in a way that designs out the environmental damage.  It is not about a blame-and-shame approach, which unfortunately characterises some of the focus on greenhouse emissions alone.  It is about considering the whole supply chain and emphasising design change, the mobilisation of communities and consumers, and giving people information on what is happening in the various services they use.  The approach emphasises that future prosperity will arise from adapting now and that the early movers will be the successful and prosperous movers of the future.  The Minister of State needs to bring that back into the narrative about what we are doing because people want to know that in ten, 15 or 20 years, we will still have an agriculture sector that is prosperous and delivers income to the family farm.  The rewards will be different, however.  One would be rewarded for managing methane and environmental services as well as for one&rsquo;s food.  The reality is that we do not have the instruments in place that will give farmers the confidence that they will have a prosperous farm in ten years.  That is where we need to bring the emphasis.<\/p> <p>Yes, in the process we have to deliver these targets, but there is also the narrative around the story we are telling and why it is vital we take the environmental damage and design it out of our chain, including our buildings, where our neglect of timber versus concrete is embedding high carbon emissions into the way we build.  Every sector, be it construction, food or travel, has to look at this in that context.  That is the way the Minister can mobilise more support behind this, instead of the red mark on the copybook, saying, &ldquo;You did not hit your target this year.&rdquo;  The Government needs to get everyone sharing the targets and then have a more honest evaluation of whether we have the toolbox in place to deliver them.  That is where I hope the debate moves now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500032#KK00200","speaker":"1549","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655298420,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the statements.  I was reading down through the statement released last Friday and it is welcome to see the value of biodiversity given a somewhat more substantial standing, particularly when it referred to sustainable development to underpin our economy, given a loss of biodiversity that we have not seen since previous mass extinctions.  The conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity needs to be escalated as well as the restoration of natural systems for constituencies like mine, Longford-Westmeath, which is a critical piece of work.  There is a real and substantial opportunity to develop biodiversity in a sustainable manner that will benefit towns like Lanesborough, where the power plant was once the primary source of employment.  For generations, the identity of towns like Lanesborough was intertwined with either Bord na M&oacute;na or the ESB because, after all, it was those companies that paid the wage cheques that paid the mortgages and rent, put food on the table and contributed to local shops and the local economy.<\/p>  <p>  There is now a very ambitious plan to build a boardwalk on the Roscommon side of the River Shannon that would link to the islands and then, further on, on the Longford side, connect to another boardwalk on that side of the Shannon.  I understand the cost of this would be approximately &euro;10 million, including the cost of the land, but the huge economic benefit to the local economy of creating this cannot be overestimated, with the further creation of a potential hub as another driver for economic development.  I urge the Minister to work with the Department and the two local authorities to ensure this town benefits from a true just transition into the future.  I understand that at a meeting late last week, it was referred to as being a case of do or die because of the lack of other options.  There is a real need for success in this programme.<\/p>  <p>  It is plans like that - the positive plans, the plans that look to the future &ndash; that highlight the utter lack of forethought in regard to the Derryad Mid-Shannon Wilderness Park, which not only flies in the face of both preservation and development but will also have a serious negative consequence for the current and future biodiversity of the area.  Instead of viewing the potential of this area as being of benefit to the community for training, education, research and appropriate tourism, there is instead a brutal proposal to remove those habitats and the subsequent loss of biodiversity that is, quite frankly, mind-boggling.  We know there are regional, national and global assessments that show a decline in biodiversity, yet without the benefit of intervention or any form of interaction, this area flourished.  It did best when left alone.<\/p>  <p>  I specifically mentioned education because still today, in 2022, there is this flawed opinion that bogs are empty, barren places, that they are a wasteland, when in reality they are rich with flora and fauna and are a habitat to many creatures.  There is the opportunity also to create on that site a museum that recognises its history, a history that is disintegrating.  Huts that are still there, coats that are still hanging on hooks, are a snapshot of a part of our history that should not be lost through neglect.  They should be preserved.<\/p>  <p>  The threat to biodiversity in that instance is sadly replicated across my constituency, and Clonsura is another such area.  The Government needs to adopt a much more far-reaching, long-term and truly sustainable approach to these issues.  As referenced in the House before, part of that is the wind energy guidelines.  We need to see them produced because where there is a vacuum of information, there is a vacuum that can be exploited, often to the detriment of these communities who are reliant on the Government to come out with guidelines to give them this information that seems so slow in coming.<\/p>  <p>  It is very rare that what we do today in terms of biodiversity is something we will benefit from, but what we do today, our children, our grandchildren and future generations will absolutely benefit from.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500033#LL00200","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1655298420,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the statements.  I acknowledge and agree with the comments from Deputy Bruton that these transition statements are probably not the best mechanism for accountability because they refer to points so far in the past and this is such a dynamic and quickly changing policy environment we are dealing with.  However, it is always welcome to be able to stand here and talk about environmental issues, climate and biodiversity.<\/p><p>One of the major charges that is often made against politicians and Governments by scientists, NGOs and people who are passionate about this area is that there is a lot of talk but not the action that is required.  It is that issue of whether we are moving from the rhetoric to action.  I want to read from the speech by the Taoiseach, Deputy Martin, at the Dublin Climate Summit in May, where he said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe challenges facing us from climate change are stark ... The truth is that not acting is not an option ... The challenge is profound.  Genuine transformation is required ... we must do it quickly. <\/blockquote>  <p>He said the Government he leads is committed to providing this leadership.  I cannot disagree with a single word of what he said but the question for those in this Chamber is whether these are just words in a speech that was written for the Taoiseach or whether the Government has really taken this on board and is providing the leadership he said he is committed to, leadership not just in talking but leadership in doing.<\/p><p>I will first refer to the Climate Change Advisory Council review and the EPA report.  Both of these entities are the watchdogs that were installed by the Government to be that mirror that can be held up to Government to see whether it is doing what needs to be done.  The Climate Change Advisory Council&rsquo;s last annual review in 2021 identified a significant gap between climate action policy and climate action delivery.  The review emphasised the urgency of shifting from planning to action to reduce emissions and to put Ireland on track to achieve climate neutrality and resilience by 2050.  The chairperson of the council, Marie Donnelly, said Ireland's failure to meet its targets is due to not matching the ambitions with plans, that is, timely and complete delivery of actions.  It is clear the Government has not met, at least in the mind of the Climate Change Advisory Council, the move from rhetoric to action.<\/p><p>The EPA in recent weeks came out with a report that confirmed that Ireland is way off course when it comes to dealing with greenhouse gas emissions and that there is a huge gap between the ambitions of Ireland's legally binding climate Act and the actions needed to deliver on that ambition.  The report highlighted that even in the unlikely event that every planned climate policy and measure outlined in the climate action plan were fully implemented on time, Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions would only fall by 28% by 2030, which is a little over half of what is required.  The report states Ireland already looks to be in deep trouble.  It does not bode well for this Government but the reality is it does not bode well for our country because we need this to happen, and quickly.<\/p> <p>The EPA director general, Ms Laura Burke, was reported as saying the data shows that a step-up in both the implementation of actions already set out in plans and policies and the identification of new measures is needed.<\/p> <p> There we have two very well respected entities saying to the Government it is not doing enough.  The talk is there but the walk is not following it.  I understand that many of the measures that are in place and needed are very complex and will take some time to implement.  I can understand the rationale for backloading some of them.  I do not like it.  One of the things I said with the programme for Government was that actually it was not a programme for this Government.  What was written was actually a programme for the next Government because the majority of the actions, in particular the major ones, were actions that the next Government would be expected to implement and certainly complete.<\/p> <p> If we look at the simple things that Government can do and are in its remit, one of the most fundamental and simple things is the funding of staff within Government bodies.  I raise this because I was a councillor, as were many of my colleagues here in the D&aacute;il, and we know there has been underfunding of councils&rsquo; responsibilities over many governments.  In relation to climate and biodiversity challenges, however, the requirements being placed on councils are far greater than they have ever been before.  The climate action regional offices, CARO, estimates that each local authority requires nine staff members to undertake their climate role.  CARO talks about needing a senior executive, a liaison person, an energy person, a climate action officer, a biodiversity person, environmental officers and a green infrastructure person, so that is nine per council.  When I asked the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications how many staff had been funded in local authorities by that Department, I was told none - absolutely zero.  Not even a single person in any local authority has received funding from the Department to do the functions the Department is asking of them.  This comes back to the statement, &ldquo;Show me your budget and I will show you what your priorities are.&rdquo;  When I look at the priorities of Government at the moment, I do not believe, judging by where it is prioritising its spend, it is prioritising climate or biodiversity action.  If that budget is compared with the &euro;144,000 that is being given to developers to build a single apartment, that would pay for two staff members in each local authority.  I ask the Government to rethink its priorities and focus on the actions that can be simply achieved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500033#LL00300","speaker":"1627","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655299020,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak, even if briefly, on this issue.  Of course, one could not be expected to cover the whole gamut associated with the transition of the economy and the effort on the part of Government to meet its target in regard to emissions right up to 2030 and even beyond to 2050.  I will deal with a few issues that are pertinent to my own constituency and that have been greatly impacted, initially by the acceleration of decarbonisation long before the introduction of carbon budgets or the new targets that this Government set in its programme for Government.  The cessation of extraction of peat on a commercial and industrial basis by Bord na M&oacute;na and, of course, the closure of power plants were eight to ten years ahead of plan.  Thereafter, because such agencies as Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB could no longer fulfil the remit that was given to them when they were set up, which was to create jobs and allow that region and economy to flourish, that remit is now back with Government.  In its response, the Government, together with the EU, has created a &euro;170 million just transition fund for the midlands, predominantly County Offaly, which was most impacted by that acceleration over recent years.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact the national development plan has matched the EU funding and that the Eastern and Midland Regional Authority is the administrative body that will administer and deliver that fund.

I ask that that would be done as speedily as possible and that the Government would forward it to the EU for clearance so that, ultimately, the process can begin by which that fund does what it was originally intended to do, which is to engender new innovative entrepreneurial skills to allow that region respond in the way it can.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of that and, more recently, the debate about the turf issue and the clean air policy, which is primarily charged with the responsibility of extending the ban in regard to smoky coal, on foot of a response in this House by the Minister, Deputy Ryan, there was an intention on his part at least to extend that to turf usage throughout the country as well.  As I said in response to that, both publicly and in this House, that practice is no longer as prevalent as it was.  It is being replaced by new alternatives continually emerging.  The process is being addressed by a new retrofit programme, but it is only beginning to do so.  The turf cutting that we know, grew up with and acknowledge is something that will die organically.<\/p>  <p>  The retrofitting programme in its first guise this year, for example, contains an 80% grant up to about &euro;3,000 for the insulation of walls, ceilings and roofs, and the draught-proofing of doors and windows.  I have argued and will continue to do so, and I hope, on an initial review of that retrofit programme, the Government will ensure, that those dependent on solid fuels would have an opportunity to retrofit their heating systems on foot of and further to the insulation grant.  That would be a realistic option for those who are not in a position to do the deep retrofit that can cost many multiples of that figure, notwithstanding the ability of some households to do so, and more luck to them.  I am aware of many credit unions that have green loan offerings to help and augment the costs associated over and above the grant that is being made available.  I am sure that sort of product can only grow.  Post offices and many others could enter that market too because that is the path we want to see travelled by all.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of heat I caution against the wholesale electrification of it.  There are other means by which that can be addressed which can save on emissions and, it is hoped, save on cost too over time.  I am particularly conscious of hydrotreated vegetable oil and the opportunity that exists for oil pumps to be converted to cater for it.  Over a ten-year period that can bring up to 85% savings in emissions, which can and should be welcomed, and does not place the sort of strain there has been and will be on electrical provision.  I do not believe we have the capacity, unfortunately, to meet the demands being placed upon energy in this country.  Since the programme for Government and the detail associated with it in this regard was agreed by all parties and approved by the D&aacute;il in the formation of Government, we have seen the pandemic and an ongoing terrible war in Ukraine and the impact that is having on energy provision and, as a consequence, on the cost of living in households and in business.  The ambition that was contained within that might have been great initially but it does not meet the sort of ambition I believe can be harnessed in this country, especially in its offshore capabilities.  It is not realistic to aim for 5 GW by 2030.  It could be far more.<\/p>  <p>  Progress is being made in regard to the authority that has been put in place to help in driving that ambition but it needs to be far greater.  I am conscious for example of the work done by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority to ensure that area was developed and that the International Financial Services Centre materialised.  It materialised more quickly than would have been the case had it not been put in place.  It may have gone sour near the end, but lessons have to be learned from that.<\/p>  <p>It is that type of authority, drive, leadership and ambition that needs to be in place to drive the potential that we have offshore.  Our offshore capability can be to the forefront of the delivery of a pan-European pipe across Europe.  We have been at the back end of a pipe for too long.  We can be at the front end now.  I impressed upon the Taoiseach in recent months to ensure that is high on the agenda at EU Council meetings.<\/p> <p> There has to be a way in which we can devise mechanisms to deliver the capacity and the capabilities much quicker than at present.  Planning is taking far too long.  I note much talk in relation to housing on foot of the President's remarks yesterday.  Everybody shares that frustration at the inability to deal with this in a way which provides supply to meet demand.  Despite record levels of funding and despite record levels of different schemes and initiatives that help in relation to affordability in relation to cost rental, these are not yet delivering on the ground.  That is against the backdrop of a planning system that can take up to five years.  That is against a background through which funds have been made available from Europeans, for example, who wish to invest in this country and walked away from it when they saw the delays associated with An Bord Plean&aacute;la not having a statutory time period to make decision.  They see it regularly.  For example, one saw it with Glanbia in Kilkenny, where one had a judicial review system that can allow a planning application of that nature, importance and significance to take up to five years to deliver.  As a former councillor, I know the strides that have been made in relation to the background associated with the production of county development plans, regional development plans and national development plans.  All those are done in a way which is compatible with national and regional guidelines in relation to density, capacity, height, design etc.  Never was that the case back at the time when the planning laws were being flouted and disregarded, but they are there now.  There has to be something in the national interest - legislation that can be brought to bear - to weigh an objection where there is one objection against 30,000 who might not have objected, are agreeing to or participated in the process by which a development plan was arrived at.  Somebody can arrive and, at the stroke of a pen, put in a objection and hold something up for five years.  Such a delay is wrong and has to be corrected.  It is high time the D&aacute;il and all the heads within it got together in a way in which they recognise that there is a national interest here that has to be respected, and also respect the process by which development plans are put in place and all of this combined is brought to bear to ensure that they are in place.<\/p> <p> I see the same in relation to the provision of energy.  I ask that the ambition that is contained within the targets that have been set be revisited.  We have 15 GW available in offshore development on the south and east coast.  There is 30 GW on the west coast.  There is a potential 70 GW from wave energy there beyond.  Each gigawatt powers 750,000 homes.  There is an abundance that is available to us at our doorstep that is not being tapped into and we are told it is taking, in this country and beyond, seven years from inception to delivery.  There is no way we as legislators can sit on our hands and allow that to be the case in relation to that sector of the provision of energy, and also five years in relation to housing.<\/p> <p> The Government will bring forward proposals to amend the Planning and Development Act, we are told, in the autumn.  I look forward to that but it is time we were a bit more prescriptive about what we want amended.  Rather than allowing the Attorney General to give his opinion and bring forward his proposals and ideas, the Government and Members of the D&aacute;il need to be prescriptive and tell him what they expect him to do in order that they then respect the views, opinions and the wishes of the electorate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500034#MM00200","speaker":"1591","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655299620,"counter":273,"content":"<p>We have seen over the past number of decades, and especially in the recent past, the need for progressive climate action.  We hear it from our children and, for those of us lucky enough to have them, from our grandchildren.  Thankfully, the debate has largely shifted from one about personal responsibility to a whole-of-system approach.  The public at large are doing all that they can and more to tackle the climate crisis and that has to be matched, or even bettered, by the various sectors of the economy and businesses within it.<\/p>  <p>  Nobody said achieving these emissions targets would be easy but there is no other way.  Reducing our emissions and tackling the climate crisis is the only show in town.  Nevertheless, the State has a role to play, not only in setting the targets but in ensuring that businesses in each sector can reach them.  This means that people, businesses and the different sectors of the economy can transition in a fair and, indeed, fast manner.<\/p>  <p>  Ensuring that there are alternative fuels for sectors such as the concrete sector will help with decarbonisation of buildings, and supports and help for the SME sector are key.  Anyone who speaks to businesses in the SME sector will tell the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, that access to simplified information, time and definitive support from the State are key to helping them reach their targets.  In this way, the climate toolkit for business is a useful tool, and I welcome it.<\/p>  <p>  However, where businesses need to transition, they need greater support to do so, such as greater access to funding, facilities and renewables.  Businesses will transition if it is simplified for them and if they are supported and encouraged to do so but if the renewables are not there, if the support is not there and if the simplified information is not there, they will not or they will struggle and this will affect their ability to operate and will, indeed, cost jobs.<\/p>  <p>  As for the changes that are needed in the public sector, this is where the State has to be a leader.  We cannot have a situation of do as I say but not as I do.  In that regard, I reference the fact that local authorities have recently called all of their staff back to the office.  Central to achieving the targets in the public sector is remote and hybrid working.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, to speak with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, and to encourage him to bring forward remote working legislation that is fit for purpose and delivers for workers and to ensure the State is a leader in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500035#NN00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1655299620,"counter":274,"content":"<p>We are in a climate emergency.  Report after report highlights the escalating reality of global warming and the need for urgent mitigations.  As the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, stated last month, it is long past the time for climate rhetoric.  What we need is climate action.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the Government, like the previous one, is ignoring some of the small wins and the low-hanging fruit that would be a positive step in the right direction.  Two weeks ago, Sinn F&eacute;in moved legislation on solar panels for schools because we were frustrated at the lack of Government action on removing the current planning permission obstacles that exist for schools and community buildings which want to make use of solar energy.  I note that has gone to public consultation, potentially putting this beyond this D&aacute;il term, well into the next term and into the new school year.  To mitigate climate, these regulations could be changed overnight if the political will was there.  Far from solving the climate crisis, it would be a small step and a small win.  It would be a considerable benefit to schools but the Government has been dragging its heals.  I am glad to see some progress but, to be honest, we should be much further down the road in relation to that.  Four months ago, commitments were made by the Taoiseach that regulations would be introduced within three weeks to allow schools to erect panels and make use of solar energy and that still has not happened.  It will be the next D&aacute;il before it does.<\/p>  <p>  I also want to take the opportunity briefly to raise issues regarding the Cork metropolitan area transport strategy.  In my area, it has many positive elements.  I am glad that light rail, something that I have been raising for three or four years, has made its way into the strategy.  However, I have previously raised my fear that we are focusing too much on long-term and not enough on the short and medium-term benefits from that.  The issue of the potential for bus rapid transport in Cork is a significant one.  The success of the Glider in Belfast is a good demonstration of what is possible in the short term in terms of bus rapid transit.  Obviously, there is the BusConnects proposal, but we should look at what has been done in Belfast in terms of something eye-catching and creative that can encourage that modal shift in addition and complementary to the BusConnects proposal.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, agreed in November 2020 that this was a good idea but we have not seen any progress in relation to that.  That will be a crucial area in terms of reducing reliance on cars in the Cork area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500035#NN00300","speaker":"1460"},{"type":"speech","time":1655299620,"counter":275,"content":"<p>There is an old joke about the weather that everyone talks about it but no one ever does anything about it.<\/p> <p>It feels the same with the transition.  Everyone is in favour of it.  Even the usual climate denier Deputies in this House talk about how and when the transition should happen.  My main concern is that despite the rhetoric there is no actual transition taking place.  What progress there is in any area is akin to Sisyphus pushing the boulder up the hill.  For every step forward we see the boulder slip down again.  For every electric bus we purchase or every claim of a home that has been retrofitted, we see another data centre being permitted or we hear talk of a new airport runway or a spike in car sales.  <br\/><br\/>This is not just my impression.  Looking at the global picture, it is clear there is no real transition taking place away from fossil fuels.  The Global Carbon Project, GCP, estimated that fossil fuel emissions in 2021 will reach 36.4 billion tonnes of CO<sub>2<\/sub>.  That figure is only 0.8% below its pre-pandemic high in 2019.  Both coal and gas emissions have already surpassed their pre-pandemic levels, with a 2% increase in gas emissions and a 1% increase in coal emissions between 2019 and 2021.  Since the first Kyoto climate conference, global carbon emissions have continued to rise and they are 60% higher today than they were in 1990.  In April, we found out that just 20 of the world&rsquo;s biggest oil and gas companies, including Shell, Exxon Mobil and Gazprom, are projected to spend $932 billion by the end of 2030 to develop new oil and gas fields.  In May, we found out that the oil and gas industry took advantage of the war in Ukraine to spread misinformation about the causes of the energy crisis to apply political pressure and to pursue a long-standing wish list of policy changes.  This is according to a report by InfluenceMap.  The website <i>DeSmog.com<\/i>reported oil executives and lobbies conducing a public relations blitz in the days following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  <br\/><br\/>We see the same results to some extent in this House, with the clamour by some Deputies for LNG and their support for the Barryroe oil field.  These are the same voices that share the same contempt for the climate crisis and the same greed that informs these campaigns globally.  My question to the Minister of State is: Exactly what transition we are talking about?  <br\/><br\/>The EPA has made it clear that we are failing to meet the targets that the Government set out in the climate action plan.  A significant gap exists across all sectors in terms of planned cuts in emissions and those of transport, agriculture, energy, etc.  That is bad enough, but the targets themselves are inadequate and are not in line with the science or with the scale of the crisis we face.  We are not in a transition; we are in a war.  We are not in a transition when we think that it is okay to build more data centres, to build LNG platforms, to licence the extraction of 300 million barrels of oil at Barryroe or to implement carbon taxes on ordinary people whose sole purpose seems to be to pay for retrofitting for the already wealthier sections of society or to subsidise the purchase of EVs.<br\/><br\/>Radical and far-reaching policies were what the IPCCC report said were needed in 2018.  We are still awaiting those policies.  In the meantime, in India and North Africa, we see more record-breaking temperatures where the limits of human endurance, the so-called wet-bulb temperature, is now exceeded with alarming regularity.  These are temperatures and humidity where the body is unable to cool itself by sweating.  This was seen in 2003 in the European heatwave that killed thousands of people and it is now a regular occurrence on the planet.  What were once events that would occur within 100 or 1,000 years are now decade and sometimes yearly events.  <br\/><br\/>We will not get the transition we need until we begin to challenge the economic systems and its priorities that are driving this crisis.  That means challenging the very logic of capitalism and free markets.  There is no middle ground in this war.  Hoping that the market will deliver some magic new technology or that it will invest sufficiently in renewables is a child&rsquo;s hope.  It is time we grew up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500035#NN00400","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655300220,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I want to raise a specific issue in the climate transition, which is the situation facing our taxi and other public service vehicle drivers.  There are approximately 20,000 people whose livelihoods depend on cars.  They understand and they are quite happy that the future will be electric for taxi drivers but they have a big problem.  An electric vehicle costs a lot of money - between &euro;60,000 and &euro;80,000.  The maximum grants available offer between &euro;20,000 and &euro;25,000.  The same drivers have lost pretty much two years of income and opportunity to save because of Covid-19.  For thousands of them, their vehicles will no longer be licensable at the end of this year.  Some of them are not licensable already because they have gone over the ten-year limit.  They do not have the money to buy a new EV and because of the ten-year rule on taxis, they are out of business.  However, it is important to note that those cars will stay on the road, but just not as taxis.<\/p>  <p>  The ten-year rule does not do anything for the climate.  It does not do anything to reduce the number of polluting vehicles on the road.  It simply puts taxi drivers out of a livelihood.  They are asking for an extension of the ten-year rule because apart from anything else, and this is another critical point, there are no EVs for them to buy or very few that are suitable for taxis.<\/p>  <p>  They are asking for an extension of the ten-year rule to give them the time to accumulate savings to purchase the EVs and to make the transition to an electric taxi fleet.  Obviously, additional grants and support beyond what is currently available would also be helpful.  There should also be time for the EVs to come on stream, because at the moment they are not there.  That is a plea on behalf of the taxi drivers.  It is very real and tangible.  They deserve a just transition and that extension should be given.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500036#OO00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1655300220,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate, although I somewhat echo the comments of Deputy Bruton on the retrospective look being a little too far back.  I hope we can amend that in future years.<\/p>  <p>  I had the opportunity to attend a youth climate action debate in the Seanad Chamber.  It was a feature of climate action committee&rsquo;s outreach on the subject.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of it.  It was a reminder of the anxiety, worry and urgency that young people feel about climate change.  <\/p>  <p>   Throughout the debate they highlighted not only their fears of being the generation to bear the burden of our impact on the climate but also the hope, ingenuity, and ambition of young people to tackle this issue and to deliver sustainable change within our society.  It is a supreme task for every Member and we must deliver on it but to do so, we have to be willing to face the realities before us.  The Government is delivering progress in a range of areas with respect to climate action.  However, I believe that if we are to achieve our goals in the years ahead, we must remove some of the barriers that are still holding back our full potential. <\/p>  <p>  Wind and solar energy offer huge potential on this island and to all our communities.  We must ensure that our planning framework, our taxation system in respect of such projects and our capacity to have a fully modern electricity grid, matches our ambition.  To that end, I look forward to the development of the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, among other initiatives.  This agency will speed up the process of delivering critical offshore wind energy, or rather, it will speed up the administrative process that will allow offshore wind energy to be developed.  Solar power must not be forgotten in this debate either.  There are unintended taxation consequences on families, particularly on farming families, that act as a barrier to the installation of wind farms, which I sincerely hope will be addressed in the budget.<\/p>  <p>   I also eagerly await the development of the hydrogen sector in this country.  Many of our European counterparts, as I am sure the Minister of State will be aware, have developed extensive plans for the use of hydrogen and the role it will play in their countries in the coming years.  We are well behind them.  We, too, must ensure that we are at the forefront of this emerging energy sector.  It will allow us not only to store electricity in cases where battery technology is insufficient, but it will also make a considerable contribution in reducing emissions in sectors such as haulage and shipping.<\/p>  <p>  As we have seen in recent months, the security of energy supply is essential.  World events and, indeed, weather events have the ability to disrupt this most vital of services. The knock-on effects can impact on every home and every sector of the economy.  In this context there needs to be an honest and open conversation about alternative energy sources, such as nuclear power in Ireland.  The Celtic Interconnector, when it is operational, will link the electricity grids of Ireland and France, the latter of which derives approximately 78% of its electricity from nuclear power.<\/p> <p>This means that some of the energy used in Irish homes will eventually be powered by nuclear energy.<\/p> <p> This is a conversation we should have.  I do not suggest we jump feet first into the delivery of nuclear energy, but we should have that conversation in preparation for a potential decision in the future.  The subject of nuclear power has, at times in our history, been a controversial one.  However, a great deal has changed in the intervening time in terms of technology and safety and, indeed, when it comes to views within the political sphere.  It is a conversation worth having.  By engaging now, albeit in an exploratory way, we can begin to develop the potential for this type of energy in Ireland.  The need for such engagement is compounded by progress being made with nuclear fusion technology, notably under the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, ITER, programme, to which Ireland is a significant contributor.<\/p> <p> In addition to this conversation, we need concrete action on the use of biofuels and the role they can play in bridging the gap as we phase out fossil fuels.  We need to consider how we can use anaerobic digestion, biomethane, pyrolysis and other technologies to provide a cleaner way of powering our society in a fossil fuel-free world.  These technologies could form part of an overall rethink of how we approach the research and development sector in Ireland.  We are a small country but, over the decades, we have attracted some of the largest and most ambitious companies in the world to our shores.  This is in no small part a result of our skills, population demographics and education levels.  We must consider the future of sectors such as environmental technology, green technology, energy technology and others.  By supporting a thriving research and development sector in Ireland, we can develop the skills and expertise the world will not only need, but demand, for decades to come.  Other countries are moving in this space and seeking to capture the markets that will be a global revenue driver as we look to the future.  A redoubling of our efforts in this field could not only create jobs but grow our exports, bring new investment to Ireland and create a new level of wealth in our country.<\/p> <p> It is important to highlight the transition that is taking place within our transport sector.  Yesterday, there was a demonstration outside Leinster House of the new electric bus, 120 of which will be on our roads in the early part of next year.  In the next five years, 800 such buses will be on the road.  I am informed that some 20% of the vehicles will operate outside Dublin, which is to be welcomed.  These changes are most welcome and, together with the electrification of DART and other train services, will begin to reduce emissions from this sector.  The implementation of the BusConnects strategy must also be delivered without undue delay.  The changes to bus network in Dublin can provide a positive impact on commuter experiences if they are fully implemented in a timely manner.<\/p> <p> However, we still need to encourage passengers to use public transport.  I urge the Minister, as I have done previously, and as I urged the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, last night, to push for the extension of reduced fares, both for young people and across the board, beyond the end of 2022.  This will result in an even greater number of people leaving their cars at home.  We have had this debate in the House previously and I must admit I was sceptical about the provision of free public transport within the EU.  I certainly support greater levels of subvention for public transport if it means getting more people out of their cars.  It really will make a positive contribution towards our target of a 51% reduction in transport emissions by 2030.<\/p> <p> I appreciate the efforts being made to encourage greater use of private EVs, such as the planned deployment of fast charging points around the country.  This will remove a barrier to consumers choice as we aim to phase out the sale of diesel and petrol engines.  I particularly welcome the publication of an EV strategy by my local authority and three others, which are the first documents of their kind in the history of the State.  Under the strategy, 1,650 charging points will be installed around Fingal and Dublin city and county.  This will greatly benefit existing EV users and encourage prospective users, ultimately complementing the Government's aim of having 1 million electric vehicles on Irish roads by 2030.  This target is significant and will be hard to achieve.  I hope the ambition is there to realise it.  By working with local authorities, we can put our best foot forward in terms of the provision of public charging facilities.<\/p> <p> With regard to removing barriers to people, particularly those in middle-income brackets, moving away from older internal combustion engine, ICE, vehicles, a radical rethink of VRT for new electric vehicles should be considered.  I am not sure whether this has been suggested in the House.  Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to taxi drivers being given a &euro;25,000 grant towards the purchase of an EV.  This is a very generous grant considering the price of most of the vehicles used as taxis is &euro;50,000 to &euro;60,000.  Unfortunately, the entry price for EVs in Ireland is very high.  It is artificially high and much higher than elsewhere in Europe.  The Minister knows why that is.  We have the authority to change it and we should do so.<\/p> <p> With regard to enhancing our biodiversity, there is scope for cross-departmental co-operation on developing the skills necessary within the sector.  This extends to land use expertise as well as restoration and design of biodiversity areas.  I spoke to a person in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage yesterday who told me that only some local authorities have appointed biodiversity officers.  Fingal County Council is one of the fortunate ones but there are is a significant number of local authorities around the country in which this role has not been filled.  We need to develop the demand for that level of expertise, not just within our third level institutions but within the sector, if we are to bring the necessary expertise to these shores.<\/p> <p> I stress the need for continued stakeholder engagement across the board.  If we are to achieve a just transition, we must continue to engage with communities, civil society groups and industry stakeholders the length and breath of the country.  If we are to have any success in meeting our targets, we must bring people with us.  We need to respond to the demands of the communities that are discommoded by the removal of certain industries.  There will be changes required in our daily lives, whether we live in rural or urban areas.  However, there also will be opportunities for investment and growth for all communities throughout the country.  By talking to people in local communities, we can build the broad social coalition that is needed to tackle the issues that face us and the generation after us.<\/p> <p> I have been listening to this debate from the beginning in my office.  The broad criticism of the Government for anything and everything serves very little purpose in the context of climate action.  The only truly positive, meaningful and thought-provoking contribution from the Opposition benches this afternoon was from Deputy Bacik.  Perhaps this is something the electorate needs to think about in the context of climate action and the policies this House and the Oireachtas committee of which I am a proud member have delivered.  That committee has made a significant contribution to the overall debate.  We have a monumental challenge ahead of us.  Our children will not thank us for engaging in the pointless bickering that takes place in these Houses.  They will only remember the consequences of our actions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500036#OO00300","speaker":"1562","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655300820,"counter":280,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Martin Browne.  Last Monday night, I attended a meeting organised by the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, in the mart in Ballymote, County Sligo.  Climate action was one of the issues discussed.  Of course, farmers are very exercised by the increase in the cost of inputs, including diesel, and all of the issues that make up the bigger problem we are facing.  However, a couple of farmers made the point that the farming community has no problem playing its role in delivering the transition we want to happen and that they know must happen.  The real problem they have is that they do not see a commitment to providing them with alternatives.  I take my colleague's point that we are not here to bicker.  We are here to try to find solutions and we must all do so.<\/p>  <p>  However, a farmer at the meeting made the point that it is six or seven years since he considered putting solar panels on his sheds and there still is no proper means of doing it.  There are no grant facilities available and no means by which he can sell the electricity generated back to the grid.  There is nothing in place.  A few weeks ago, I attended a meeting of the OECD at which I spoke to parliamentarians from other countries in Europe.  Speaking to some of them, I learned that there are solar panels on every house in countries in eastern Europe that we might consider to be very backward.  The governments in all those countries are paying for that to be done and for the electricity to be put back into their grids until such time as the homeowners have paid for the installation, at which point they will generate a profit from it.  This usually happens within seven to eight years.  Why on earth can we not do that?  Why can we not do the simple and easy things?  We are here to find solutions and I believe there are solutions to be found.<\/p> <p>Going back to the farmers, they have also made the point that they want to change the way they farm.  Biodiversity has been mentioned.  It is a big part of this endeavour and the farmers are the custodians of the land.  Unfortunately, though, they are not being provided with the incentives to farm in that way and to move to a model of farming that is low intensity and has a high nature value.  This is what we need to see happening.  The transitions we want to see being put in place must be put in place by the Government.  The Government must lead on this and it must provide the financial packages that will make it easy for people to sign up to this mode of farming.  It has not been doing that up to now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500037#PP00200","speaker":"1607","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655301420,"counter":282,"content":"<p>While reading through this annual transition statement, I went to the section on forestry because I have represented many foresters during my time in Leinster House.  One of the first things I read was that \"Forests will play an important role in meeting EU emissions reductions targets during the 2021 to 2030 period\".  The statement goes on to note, as we all know, \"The Climate Action Plan 2021 sets an afforestation target of 8,000 hectares per year.\"  Unfortunately, despite the expense that has gone into hiring new ecologists for the licensing system, we are still at a stage where the annual target I spoke of is being missed.  This is due to years spent disregarding the sector and a licensing system that is dysfunctional.  This is a key reason the annual transition statement notes that, \"This target is ambitious when compared to recent afforestation rates and will be challenging to meet in the next decade.\"<\/p>  <p>  The number of afforestation licences being issued is erratic.  The largest number of licences issued in May was 18 in a week.  At the end of the first week of June, it was a mere five.  For the service to reach its target of issuing 1,040 afforestation licences in 2022, an average of 28 licences would need to be issued weekly.  We are still falling far short in this regard.  It is also noted in the annual transition statement that \"key to the success of increasing afforestation rates is to build confidence among landowners of the benefits of forestry\".  How on earth is confidence in forestry going to be built when foresters are struggling to get the licences they need?  What message does this give to potential foresters?  We have an ash dieback scheme that foresters continue to tell us is not fit for purpose, but the Government remains wedded to it and the lengthy delays and bureaucratic nightmares that go along with it.<\/p>  <p>  In future, we will see individual Ministers being answerable to their communities annually.  I appreciate that when it comes to forestry Ministers have appeared before the relevant joint committee on several occasions, but they must act on what they hear to release the potential forestry has to meet our targets.  Unfortunately, we are struggling with a series of setbacks, the legacy of which will remain with us for years.  Regarding a comment made by a Deputy who has now left the Chamber, we are not here to bicker.  We are an Opposition party and we tell the Government where we feel it is going wrong.  We listen to the sector.  It would be more in line for the Deputy concerned to listen to the sector as well instead of worrying about what is going on over on this side of the House.  It is his job to listen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500038#QQ00200","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1655301420,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his opening statement.  I welcome the publication of the annual transition statement for 2020.  It is 18 months late, but it is still a very useful piece of evidence and information.  Given it is the last one, I also welcome the opportunity to contribute in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  In my limited time, my comments will focus on the concept of energy security, or, more accurately, that of energy independence, which is a bit more of an ambitious goal and something we should aim for.  We all recognise what is happening in Ukraine now.  Putin's strategy is clear.  He wants to wait for about four months and the arrival of winter in the northern hemisphere.  He wants to squeeze the northern hemisphere as much as possible from an energy cost and energy supply point of view.  Anything we can do between now and then will certainly improve our resilience and ensure the EU stays united to face down the aggression in Ukraine from Russia.  <\/p>  <p>  In the context of offshore wind energy, I welcome the recent developments in respect of MARA being established, the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021 having been enacted last December and planning permission having been granted for the interconnector between Cork and Brittany.  Those are all good things, but they are all just plans.  People need to see action.  As things stand, there are only seven wind turbines off our coasts.  Most people are in favour of offshore wind generation.  In phase 1 of the Arklow Bank development there are only seven wind turbines and those have been there for 20 years.  There is potential for 4,000 wind turbines off the east and west coasts.  Those would be tethered off the east coast and floating off the west coast.  We have a great opportunity here not only to improve our own resilience but also to ensure that the EU is resilient from an energy security and energy independence perspective.  <\/p>  <p>  Other Deputies mentioned the importance of farming.  This country is already feeding the world.  We may as well power the world too while we are at it.  If we think back to what our grandparents did, they electrified the land with the establishment of the national grid.  It falls to our generation now to electrify the sea.  We must increase our ambition and accelerate our implementation regarding offshore wind generation.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to solar power, I welcome the recent development, in April, of the Minister going to Ashford in Wicklow to open the solar power farm there.  It is a good development.  Every residential housing estate in the country, however, has the potential to be its own solar farm.  It is very much the case because there is a great deal of south-facing roof space on every housing estate and this would also be a great source of income for residents' committees to allow them to maintain and fund the upkeep of those estates.  It is a good goal to aim for.  <\/p>  <p>  Moving to my questions, in theory, a rebate or a tariff paid will be paid to domestic solar panel users who have surplus energy and sell it back to the grid.  I am aware of the tariff, but has an individual domestic supplier been paid yet in this regard?  Has money changed hands?  We also know that the tariffs were established approximately six months ago but there has been a massive explosion in energy costs, particularly concerning electricity, since then and in the past three months especially.  Will there be a concurrent increase in the tariff that the energy companies will pay to domestic suppliers as a result?  We cannot have a situation where the large suppliers are paying X amount per kilowatt hour, kWh, while domestic producers are getting a fraction of that price.  What is good for the goose is good for the gander and there should be a similar kWh price for the supplier and the user.  <\/p>  <p>  Coming from Kildare, which is a commuter county, along with Laois and Offaly, I welcome the 20% reduction in the pricing of public transport in the past few months.  This is a good thing.  The Minister of State holds a portfolio not only at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, but also at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I would support any measure in the budget in October that would put further downward pressure on the cost of public transport.  <\/p>  <p>  In summary then, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I agree with many of the plans, but we need to see implementation.  We have no time to lose.  The sooner we do this, the better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500038#QQ00300","speaker":"1587"},{"type":"speech","time":1655301420,"counter":284,"content":"<p>Our approach to climate action is wrong.  It is being highlighted more clearly with each passing day.  We cannot discuss climate action unless we look at it in the context of the cost-of-living crisis and the way in which our approach to climate action is exacerbating that crisis.  I do not expect the Government to be able to provide solutions to all problems or to those problems over which it has no control.  The imposition of carbon taxes, however, is one area in which the Government does have full control.  On Monday, I read with dismay an<i>Irish Independent <\/i>article with the headline, &quot;Taoiseach vows crackdown on 'reprehensible' energy crisis profiteering and warns Government is monitoring price trends&quot;.  The hypocrisy of the statement is almost beyond belief.  How dare any Government politician complain about the very small profit margins made by fuel retailers as long as the Government is responsible for adding approximately 50% to the retail price.  The biggest culprit when it comes to fuel profiteering is the Government.  The Government's profiteering is going to continue until at least 2030, at which point the carbon tax on fuel will have more than doubled from what it is today.<\/p><p>In the article I mentioned, the Taoiseach was quoted as having used the word &quot;reprehensible&quot; to describe the profiteering by retailers.  When it comes to fuel prices, I think what is reprehensible is the practice of charging tax on tax.  I have highlighted this aspect before.  VAT is charged on excise duty and carbon tax and, therefore, not only is the Government taxing people into fuel poverty, but it is even charging them VAT for the pleasure of paying their excise duty.  This is what is reprehensible in my opinion and, I am sure, in the opinion of hundreds of thousands of people who are being scammed by this every day.  A few weeks ago, the Government became less greedy and reduced the excise duty by 15 cent a litre, at which time petrol could be bought at &euro;1.80 per litre in some places.  The price is now around &euro;2.20 per litre in many places.  This is an increase of 40 cent per litre in the pump price in a matter of weeks.  Out of that increase of 40 cent, approximately 8 cent is in the form of extra VAT for this Government.  Even ending the disgusting practice of charging tax on tax would be a start for the hard-pressed taxpayer.  <\/p><p>The invasion of Ukraine and the decision to impose sanctions on Russian products has also been a contributing factor.  In fairness to the Government, this is a factor outside its control.  It should, though, bring into sharp focus the folly of curtailing or abandoning indigenous energy production and gas exploration<\/p> <p>Through these short-sighted climate policies, we have come to rely far too much on supplies which are now proven to be on shaky ground.  <\/p> <p> I saw the delight of Deputy Higgins a few weeks ago about her successful campaign to change the name of the passport service to reflect the fact that it is not an express service.  This Government, rather than addressing the key problem of the poor service, found it easier to change the name.  Perhaps, in the spirit of naming things accurately, the Minister of State and others will consider joining me when I urge the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to remove all references to a just transition and instead use the more accurate term of unjust transition.  We need to remember that in April 2022, the Government, which does not have a money tree and says it cannot do any more, collected an extra &euro;35 million in tax compared with April 2021.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500038#QQ00400","speaker":"1622","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655302020,"counter":286,"content":"<p>Having observed and listened to the debate, it is becoming very clear why meeting our targets is at risk.  On the one hand, there is a group of people in this House and the Seanad which is saying that we should take our foot off the pedal and not do too much too fast, start drilling for oil and gas and do everything that has led us to the situation in which we are in.  On the other hand, there is criticism and some have said we are not moving fast enough or doing enough and we need to move faster.<\/p>  <p>  The reality is that the Government has done more than any previous Government or administration to tackle climate action.  Of course, more can always be done but we are putting the right measures in place to allow us to finally tackle this crisis which will have an impact not just on future generations but on us.  We will see the impacts unless we act now, and we have done that  We have introduced the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act and climate targets.  We introduced a target to reduce emissions by 51% by 2030 and achieve climate neutrality by 2050.<\/p>  <p>  We have introduced a new climate action plan and retrofitting and microgeneration schemes.  We have done far more than any other Government, yet we are hearing a tug-of-war between those who think we are doing too much and those who think we are doing too little.  That has to stop.  If we really want to make an impact, we all have to be on board on this journey.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent action has been the RESS 2 auction.  Communities own the movement towards a more carbon-neutral economy and are leading on projects to generate their own energy.  A perfect example of that is in my home town of Clonakilty.  A solar farm, owned, built and run by the community, will generate enough energy to essentially take Clonakilty off grid.  In other words, the energy generated by the solar farm will meet Clonakilty's energy demands, in particular in the summer months.  That is proper leadership.  People should look to towns like Clonakilty for an example of how to tackle climate change.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, the rate and pace of change have to increase and we have to accelerate our actions in order to reach the targets.  The school solar panel scheme was mentioned.  We need to increase public transport provision, in particular in rural areas where we need to give people viable alternatives to cars because they are not there at the moment.  We all see in front of our eyes that electric vehicles are becoming more and more common on the roads, but they could become even more common if proper charging infrastructure was put in place.  Local authorities need to be dragged, kicking and screaming, along this journey.  We need to ensure electric chargers are installed, in particular in tourist and peripheral areas, because that is important for people who take journeys by electric car.  That needs to happen quicker.<\/p>  <p>  No sector can get off scot-free, and agriculture is willing to play its role.  Like many other rural Deputies, my office has been inundated with calls from farmers who want to participate in the microgeneration scheme and install solar panels, but they are being sent mixed messages.  If they installed solar panels under TAMS, they would not get the rate for generation put back into the grid.  They can avail of the microgeneration scheme.  We need to be clear what the right option is for the farming sector in terms of energy needs.<\/p>  <p>  A vital way in which agriculture can be involved in the decarbonisation journey is anaerobic digestion.  It is important, but we have no strategy.  All we do is put obstacles, including paperwork, in the way.  We have no strategy on anaerobic digestion.  It is a way for the farming community to come together in a co-operative manner.  Waste products, including slurry, waste feed stocks from piggeries and chicken houses or whatever, can generate energy, reduce emissions and carbon and generate renewable energy.  We need to start putting that strategy in place.  <\/p>  <p>  We have done a lot as a Government.  I ask all Members of the House to be on the same page.  We only have one shot at this, but we have more to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500039#RR00200","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speech","time":1655302020,"counter":287,"content":"<p>Two weeks ago, the EPA presented its report on greenhouse gas predictions for the next two decades, the conclusions of which were no surprise to most of us.  We have done a lot on climate, but there is still a significant challenge ahead.  We have set up the legislative framework, are close to meeting our green targets across all sectors of the economy to reduce emissions and have an ambitious roadmap in place.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Bruton that we have a lot more to do.  I also agree with his statement that the message that we can build a prosperous future by clinging to old practices and behaviours is false and we need to embrace the reality that we must fundamentally change how we do transport, agriculture, heating and electricity generation.  It is one thing to have targets in place, but it is an entirely different matter to implement these targets in bringing about the systemic change that is necessary.<\/p>  <p>  We cannot afford to get distracted and play politics.  We need all of the Government, the Opposition, State agencies, local government and the public sector to realise their role in this transition, internalise the concept of sustainability in every walk of life and start delivering climate action every day.  We also need the private sector, including businesses, communities and individuals, to play their part and step up to achieve the ambition.<\/p>  <p>  While we face a significant challenge, we have made solid progress in many areas.  Our national retrofit plan looks to be one of the best home energy upgrade schemes in Europe and will create thousands of jobs.  Upgrading 500,000 homes over the next decade to B2 standard or higher will ensure that people are living in comfortable and healthy homes that they can afford to heat.<\/p>  <p>  We are making immense strides in the renewable energy sector.  We currently generate over 40% of our electricity from renewable sources.  I studied renewable energy systems 20 years ago.  Back then, it was deemed impossible to get to 20% renewable generation within this or any timeframe.  The belief was that the grid could not do that.  We not only got there but doubled the figure because of the policies the Green Party put in place when it was in government the last time.  <\/p>  <p>  We have great ambition for the offshore wind sector in the Maritime Area Planning Act, which was passed at the end of last year.  It established for the first time a consenting process for offshore wind energy and the first grid scale solar farm was connected in Wicklow in response, as previous Deputies mentioned.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, as Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned, the results of the renewable energy support scheme were announced which gives the green light to almost 2,000 MW of onshore wind and solar farms.  We are removing the barriers and making way for climate action to take place.  I agree with Deputy Cowen's remarks that we need to look at planning, but we need to be careful that when we reform the planning and development Acts we maintain the right of stakeholders to have a meaningful input into the planning process.<\/p>  <p>  We have to be realistic.  We are not on track to reduce emissions in Ireland at a level anywhere close to our fair share globally.  We are at risk of not meeting the targets we set, namely, the 51% reduction by 2030, unless we manage to do everything that is in our current climate action plan and more.<\/p>  <p>  Agriculture is a big emitter of greenhouse emissions and in Ireland we need to focus our efforts on supporting farmers to continue to grow healthy nutritious food to feed our people.<\/p> <p>I am afraid we are not doing that just yet.  We need a proper and nuanced conversation about food.  Often the debate is reduced to herd numbers.  I see plans from the agriculture industry to increase the number of dairy cattle and to decrease the number of suckler cows, leaving herd numbers slightly lower than they are now.  The EPA notes that dairy cows produce more methane per annum than any other cattle, so such an overall decline in animal numbers will not lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.<\/p> <p> Transport is another sector we really need to get more serious about.  We need to reorient our thinking to a \"if you build it, they will come\" mentality.  Just last week the consultation on the revised draft Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area transport strategy ended.  It is a great improvement on the original draft, which was almost unanimously rejected.  The ambition of the new strategy, however, is nowhere close to where we need to be.  It is acknowledged in the strategy that all the proposed elements in it will result in just a 35% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.  We need to get to 50% or greater.  We need a fundamental change in transport over the next decade.  I have said it before and I need to keep saying it: we need an extremely ambitious plan for our public transport, rail in particular.  I was working on a submission for the strategy last week.  While it is much improved, it just is not enough to meet our targets.  We can have a new train station in Raheen, Limerick, where there are already more than the Project Ireland 2040 employment projections in the industrial estate at 5,000.  We will be at 8,000 within this decade.  That necessitates a public transport plan.  Similarly, as for the Waterford-Limerick train line, we see that a report recently showed that, despite improving services, there will be just a 0.3% increase in demand.  Something is terribly wrong there.  We need to induce public transport demand rather than waiting for it to come.  Local authorities often cannot build cycle lanes and walking infrastructure because of opposition in favour of continued unfettered access for private cars.  We have seen that in Galway and Dublin, where there are plenty of examples of it.<\/p> <p> Moving from local politics to national politics, if I may echo Deputy Alan Farrell's and Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan's comments, we have seen political point scoring undermining climate action, from Bills that would ban wind turbines to motions calling for drilling for oil in Irish waters and maintaining industrial-scale turf cutting to agitation around critical enabling infrastructure and opposition to the polluter-pays principle in action.  We see point scoring here today.  We see the politicisation of climate action, with Members barking up the wrong tree for solutions.  Climate change is the biggest challenge of our time.  If we are to solve it, we need to change how we do politics and work together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500039#RR00300","speaker":"1594","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655302620,"counter":289,"content":"<p>My position on the unjust transition has been very clear ever since the process was announced.  The reason I maintain that it is an unjust transition is that it is absolutely reckless to initiate and to escalate a process in the absence of basic alternatives.  People have no alternatives in respect of jobs in the midlands.  There are very few job creation opportunities there.  I welcome the apprenticeships, but that is only one area and is long overdue.  We are dictated to by the Government while it misses its own afforestation targets.  I will take no lectures from any Government Deputy who comes in here.  We are entitled to call this out on behalf of our constituents and to ask questions.  If the Government does like it, tough.  There are serious problems in the midlands and Laois-Offaly.  There are very legitimate concerns.  We hear about the fabled &euro;84 million but not its delivery.  Will the Government escalate the delivery in the same way it escalated the process?  Will it escalate the job creation in the same way it escalated a very unjust process which is imposed on people?  It is one thing the Government missing its own targets, but it then expects everybody else to dance to its tune without asking questions.  We will continue to ask questions of the Government.<\/p>  <p>  I was deeply alarmed today by a reply I received from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in respect of turbary rights.  I had sought clarification from the Minister as to whether persons in possession of folio numbers for bog plots would have their turbary rights removed or infringed by the State, a private company or a semi-State company.  I am alarmed by the tone and emphasis of the Minister's reply.  It is just over two months since the Government almost tore itself apart on the very same issue.  On a statutory basis, it has been absolutely clear since at least 1951 that turbary rights in respect of bogland mean the right to cut and to carry away turf from the bogland and include the right to prepare and to store on the bogland any turf cut therefrom.  Now the Minister is unable or unwilling to provide basic assurances that all persons in possession of folio numbers for bog plots with associated turbary rights will have their rights protected.  The Minister states in his reply to me that, as a general principle, it is a matter of settled law that private property rights are not absolute in nature and may be delimited in law.

They are very important in holding the Government to account for its climate action commitments.  Without this information we cannot accurately determine how the country is performing on climate policies and it can be hard for us to determine properly how to improve our impact going forward.<\/p>  <p>  Having followed the debate on the Rural Independent Group motion, it is clear that the publication of annual transition statements is more important than ever.  I am very afraid that we will go backward rather than forward.  We cannot even afford to stay put at this stage.  We need to move forward much more quickly than this Government intends, unfortunately.  The truth, as this report shows, is that we are failing to move forward on climate change.  We are at a defining moment, with rising sea levels, increasing temperatures, shifting weather patterns and threats to food production.  The impacts of climate change are truly unprecedented in scale.<\/p>  <p>  This Government's policies do not reflect the emergency in which we find ourselves.  The ideas coming from the Government are, unfortunately, old, tired and not nearly strong enough.

Based on the current trajectory, the sea level will rise by between 2 ft and 6 ft by 2100.

None of these cities is an island.  Some Members of this House may say that is great because it has nothing to do with us.  It has everything to do with us.

We must try to prevent this from happening through some of the actions we take.  Unfortunately, things do not look very promising.<\/p>  <p>  I was inspired by the ideas put forward by the young people who debated climate action in the Seanad last week.  They have shown such strong leadership and innovation on the climate discussion.  Interestingly, they do not have a vote so we do not have to listen to them in this House.  That is a problem and it just proves how important young voices are, especially when discussing climate change.  They are the ones who will be most affected by it and, sadly, they are the ones who will be left to solve it. <\/p>  <p>  If I may get a wee plug in, my Thirty-ninth Amendment of the Constitution (Right to Vote at 16) Bill 2021 will move to Second Stage in the House next Thursday.  The Bill proposes to reduce the voting age in Ireland to 16.  We need to ensure that young voices are included in discussions such as this one.  Giving them a vote would be a great step forward.  The only way to ensure young people's voices are heard to give them a vote because the only thing politicians respond to is voters.  We are ignoring a large number of people who need this change to take place because they do not have voice.  It is their future we are talking about.<\/p>  <p>  An annual transition statement is supposed to be an overview of climate change mitigation and adaptation policy measures adopted to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.  It is supposed to suggest how to adapt to the effects of climate change in order to enable the achievement of the national transition objective.  How are we to have conversations about what and how to adapt without the inclusion of the people this will affect?  We need to ensure that young people are included in these conversations and significantly increase our climate funding.  We also need to ensure we do not let the publication of the annual transition statement slip again.<\/p>  <p>  It is important in respect of a just transition that we have a genuine and real just transition.  People who are being affected are being left behind by the inaction of the Government.  We cannot let the Government away with that because public buy-in and acceptance of the measures are necessary because they will become more rather than less onerous.  They will also have to be done more urgently, so we must keep the public on board.  The job of the Government should be to do this and the only way this can be done is to ensure people are treated justly and are not left behind or to wallow.  That is very important.<\/p>  <p>  I will put a series of questions to the Minister of State on behalf of Friends of the Earth.  I ask him to answer them in his response.  Will the sectoral ceilings add up to more than the national carbon budget passed by the D&aacute;il?  Will they align with Ireland's 51% emissions reduction target for 2030?  Will every sector of the economy do its fair share to reduce emissions or are other sectors being penalised because agriculture may be dragging its feet, if that is the case?  Will the Government ensure that any contingency fund or unallocated emissions budget is only used for sectors that are doing everything possible to cut emissions?  I would be grateful if the Minister of State would respond to those queries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500041#TT00100","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1655303220,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle and all of the Members for their contributions to this debate.  I will address some of the points raised, starting with Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke who is the last survivor in the Chamber.  The Deputy said he wanted to see this debate done on a non-party political basis and some other Deputies also raised that issue.  The Deputy's contribution was very constructive and he made a number of suggestions to make matters better.  He is correct that we need to go further.  The next climate action plan, which will come later this year, will have an emphasis on implementation and acceleration.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Kerrane, in common with Deputy Clarke, raised a particular project, namely, a boardwalk in Lough Ree and noted that it could be very beneficial to the area.  I am happy to engage with her on that issue.  I would also be happy to discuss with any Senator or Deputy who may wish to raise with me a particular concern or perhaps a project he or she would like to advance.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Bacik specifically asked for an open line of communication with Opposition parties on climate action measures.  I am specifically agreeing with that suggestion.   <\/p>  <p>  Shannon Airport is probably in Deputy Crowe's constituency.  Two weeks ago, I was in Luxembourg discussing sustainable airline fuel which, believe it or not, is a real thing.  It was a very contentious discussion but the transport ministers managed to agree an approved general approach on this and how we will move forward towards having clean fuel for airlines in future.  I am happy that there is a route out of this, albeit in the medium rather than short term.  Deputy Crowe also referred to the need for wind area guidelines, which are antiquated at this stage.  I am happy to revert to him on that particular issue.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Bruton asked about how the accountability structures will work for climate in the future.  The document we are discussing, the annual transition statement for 2020, is the last of the annual transition statements and dates back to earlier legislation from 2015, which required an annual statement.  Under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, we now have annual climate action plans and the facility to have every Minister appear before the joint committee to discuss progress in his or her sector and be cross-examined by members.  That is, I expect, the new accountability mechanism.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Clarke was very keen on biodiversity and how it can be advanced.  There is a clear link between biodiversity and climate action and the Deputy referred to specific areas in her constituency that are affected by this.  I reassure her that the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is working with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on how to help local authorities to develop their climate action plans.  These plans will emphasise biodiversity, just transition, sustainable enterprise and transport.<\/p> <p>There is a biodiversity officer in my local authority as there is in Fingal and in other local authorities, although I do not know how many have them.  Biodiversity and all aspects of the local environment are areas that local authorities very much focus on, something that can be seen in their various functions.<\/p> <p> Deputy Whitmore mentioned the EPA report that indicated much more needed to be done and that it was likely we would not meet the 2030 targets based on the measures in place.  We take the report very seriously but it did not assess the measures in the climate action plan on the basis they were not detailed enough.  That is why the new climate action plan will be much more detailed this year.<\/p> <p> Deputy Cowen is in a constituency in the midlands that is greatly affected by the loss of jobs in Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB.  I have to give him credit that two years ago he successfully negotiated compensation, I suppose, for just transition funds to be targeted towards the midlands and obtained EU funds to help with that.  He said he did not feel the 5 GW of offshore wind power was ambitious enough and that the target could be more ambitious.  The EU, in response to the Ukraine crisis, has also said it wants to increase the ambition for renewable energy by 2030.  A number of countries have announced increased ambition levels which they are doing under a project called REPowerEU, which will allow for new means of financing, using green bonds to finance this kind of energy, and for new common rules to accelerate planning times across the EU.  Deputy Cowen also mentioned planning as a particular problem that needs to be addressed.  I see that Bord na M&oacute;na is saying planning is not a problem for its wind farms but the ease with which judicial reviews can be taken against it is, so the legal challenges are a separate problem from the planning challenges.<\/p> <p> Deputies Boyd Barrett and Alan Farrell spoke about taxis.  Taxis have a very significant effect on emissions and pollution.  They drive for much longer periods than private cars and in densely populated areas so the pollution they create has a greater effect than a single vehicle in a rural area.  That is why it is most important taxis are converted to be electric vehicles as soon as possible.  The same goes for buses, which for many years have been pumping out diesel fumes into populated areas of our cities.  Therefore there is a &euro;20,000 to &euro;25,000 grant for taxi drivers to convert to an electric vehicle.  If Deputy Boyd Barrett or taxi drivers feel it is not working out, I am willing to discuss that with them.<\/p> <p> Deputy Stanley said farmers could not sell their power back to the grid or get photovoltaic, PV, grants.  Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan also raised the difficultly of farmers getting solar power and he said he wanted more clarity.  There are grants of 40% for farmers for PV under the targeted agriculture modernisation scheme, TAMS, and there is a VAT refund for PV for farmers.  It is possible to sell power back to the grid and the first payments should come in July.  That was something Deputy Berry asked about.  If more clarity is needed, I will see if we can produce a document to explain it better and I can discuss it with Deputies Stanley and Berry.<\/p> <p> Deputy Pringle mentioned the need for more young voices.  Young people are those who are most affected by climate change.  They have a larger stake in what happens in the future and they are not responsible for what happened.  They did not take those decisions.  Deputy Pringle is absolutely right.  He pointed out that people should be able to vote at a younger age.  I think people in Scotland voted at 16 years in the Brexit referendum, for example.  It is something that should be looked at and we should find ways to bring in young people, even if they cannot vote in the short term, and listen to their opinions.  There are people who have been protesting outside the D&aacute;il for years.  A group of young climate activists has been outside the D&aacute;il every Friday - a non-sitting day - at noon for the past two or three years.  We should bring them in and discuss it with them in whatever forum we can, not to convert them from being activists to being parliamentarians but to get their views, listen to them and treat them with respect.  I absolutely take that point.<\/p> <p> I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  I think it was a useful exercise.  It is historic because it is the last of its kind but we will have other means of accountability and debates on how climate action should proceed.  I am looking forward to the climate action plan coming out this year and to the sectoral ceilings being agreed before the recess.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500041#TT00200","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655303820,"counter":295,"content":"<p>Cuireadh an D&aacute;il ar fionra&iacute; ag 4.36 p.m. agus cuireadh t&uacute;s leis ar&iacute;s ag 5 p.m.<br \/><br \/>Sitting suspended at 4.36 p.m. and resumed at  5 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (Amendment) Bill 2022: Committee and Remaining Stages","time":1655304420,"counter":296,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500043#XX00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655304420,"counter":297,"content":"<p>Section 1 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655304420,"counter":298,"content":"<p>SECTION 2<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655304420,"counter":299,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 3, line 17, after &ldquo;member&rdquo; where it secondly occurs to insert &ldquo;not below the rank of Sergeant&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>  <p>The amendment ensures that the person who would be a court presenter would not be below the rank of sergeant.

The garda may not have the necessary experience and may make a mistake about which a judge takes a dim view and a negative precedent is set.  In that context, it is important to ensure that the person who carries out this work be a garda of sergeant rank or above.  I ask the Minister to consider that amendment in the spirit in which it is intended.  It is not to try to negate the importance of the legislation.

Many summary decisions are being made in a court of first instance but experience is important in presenting a case.  I had the pleasure of visiting the Garda Training College in Templemore and I know there are specific training modules for presenting a case.  It seems, however, that like everything else, there is a knack and a specialty to presenting cases.  It would probably require a specialist approach, rather than a more haphazard approach.  Whether confining it to a particular rank will meet that requirement, I do not know.  It seems it is probably not a job for somebody who is newly minted as a garda, but for someone who has some experience of the courts operate in order that prosecution cases are properly presented, even at this level.

I very much appreciate Deputies' support and assistance in making sure that happens.  There has probably been insufficient time to look at amendments, as is suggested, but I will point to a way in which we can look at this at a later date.  We have the general scheme of the policing security and community safety Bill, which has been published.  That Bill, when enacted, will repeal the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  Today, we are trying to keep that Act in place, but there is a report of a high-level group on the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the public prosecution system and that will be considered overall in the proposed Bill.  It will be a matter of weeks when I get that report and we will be able to reflect on that.  Members will be able to reflect on it and we will come back to the points the Deputies have made.  They could then be reflected in the wider Bill, which we hope to have moving after the summer.  It is more a matter of timing.

I agreed to consider changes to the Long Title to explore the relevant part of the director's functions and to consider whether the description of the post-recovery analysis report could make an explicit reference to the matter of evidence of a violent or unnatural death being shared with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the coroner.  I have tabled amendment No. 1 in response to the issues the Deputies raised.  Amendment No. 1 incorporates an explicit reference to post-recovery analysis in the Long Title, highlighting the significance of that part of the intervention.  While the reference does not explicitly refer to the cause and circumstances of a death, this is because the matter is explicitly encompassed within the definition of post-recovery analysis.  The definition in the body of the legislation places a clear obligation on the director to identify the causes and circumstances of death where possible as part of the post-recovery analysis.<\/p> <p> Amendments Nos. 42, 43 and 44 provide that the director's post-recovery analysis report must document whether notifications of evidence of violent or unnatural death, or deaths of persons who were not resident at the institution concerned, have been made to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the coroner.  I also considered whether it would be possible to amend the director's functions to include an explicit reference to identifying the circumstances and cause of death.  However, the Office of Parliamentary Counsel advises that this is not possible from a drafting perspective as the term \"post-recovery analysis\" and the specific function to which this reference would need to be added is a defined term and part of the meaning should not be incorporated after using the term itself.  I can clarify that the definition of post-recovery analysis in section 35(2) makes it clear that the post-recovery analysis includes establishing the circumstances and cause of death if possible.  In other words, this is already covered in the director's functions, which were amended in response to the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  I hope this goes a significant way to dealing with the issues Deputies Funchion and Ward raised on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500043#XX01600","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655305020,"counter":311,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The published Bill took account of the pre-legislative scrutiny, PLS, recommendations and provided for participation by a child, parent, sibling, half-sibling, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece or nephew of a person who is buried in the intervention site.  I indicated on Committee Stage, in response to an amendment proposed by Deputy Canney, which we were not able to discuss on the day, that I would look at what he and Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n had brought forward.  On foot of that, I have tabled amendment No. 3, to consider expanding the range of relatives who can participate in a DNA identification programme to include grandnieces or grandnephews.

All our decisions about what family members can participate in the DNA programme are based on the scientific ability to get usable samples of DNA.  As people become more distant relations, the amount of usable DNA will decrease.  It is solely on that basis that we have made calls.  It splits each time, from 50% to 25% then to 12.5%.  We engaged with Forensic Science Ireland and it stated there is a scientific justification for the inclusion of half-nieces and half-nephews as well as grandnieces and grandnephews.  The technology that Forensic Science Ireland will invest in to detect second order relatives is also capable of identifying this group of relatives, so I believe it is prudent to expand the list of family members in line with the scientific advice.  I hope we will be seen to have been taking on board the points made by Deputies.  I think Deputy Canney's original amendment included cousins too.  That is a different situation because one is going down a different line of the family, so the amount of DNA is lower than with direct family.  We were told by Forensic Science Ireland that the amount in cousins would probably be too small to undertake a successful DNA analysis.

Their concern is that if they want to give their DNA, if there are improvements in forensic science in a number of years to such an extent that identification could be possible, we should not exclude anybody who may have a desire to find out whether their cousin is buried here.  There is no other living relation for this person.  While the inclusion of a grandniece or grandnephew is welcomed, it does not sort out a case where the only living relative is a first cousin, who might have been on a journey for 20 years to find his or her cousin.  I ask the Minister to consider it on the basis that if a cousin wants to voluntarily give a DNA sample, it should be accepted.  Even if the chances are very slight, the particular person I am speaking with would love the opportunity.  Even a 12.5% opportunity is better than no opportunity to find his cousin.

Of course, people can get their own DNA taken and undertake a process to preserve that as well.  We can give DNA at any point in our lives.

Given the sensitive data to be processed and the risks associated with any potential breach, it is prudent to provide for a specific oversight structure with reference to the DNA analysis that will be carried out under this Act.  I believe the provisions will strengthen the legislation and its operation.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 4, 55, 56, 63 and 64 provide for an oversight committee to perform this assurance role.  The DNA database system oversight committee was established under the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014.  The amendments provide that where the function of a director includes carrying out the identification programme and where that programme is continuing, the relevant Minister will, with the prior consent of the Minister for Justice, direct the oversight committee to oversee the management and operation of the databases established under the Act for the purposes of maintaining the integrity and security of the database.  To simplify, there is an existing structure put in place for the monitoring of DNA databases recognising the acutely sensitive nature of that information.  We are looking to ensure the databases for DNA that will be constructed in seeking to link relatives to children or remains found in these sites will be overseen in the context of the existing structures that are working and operating well.  We have had significant engagement with the chairperson of the existing DNA database oversight committee.<\/p><p>Where the committee is performing its function, it will meet as the historic remains databases oversight committee.  The amendments recognise that this is a distinct and temporary function which is best managed in a distinct and stand-alone way by the committee.  They set out the functions of the committee in this regard as well as the arrangements for remuneration, expenses and secretarial support.  The committee can review any matter related to the operation of the DNA databases and prepare a report on the review which will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and published.  The committee will prepare a final report within six months of the conclusion of the identification programme and provide a copy to the relevant Minister, the Minister for Justice and the director.  The relevant Minister must then lay the report before the Oireachtas and publish it.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 37 and 39 are consequential amendments regarding the disclosure of confidential information.  They specify that members of the oversight committee as well as contractors, consultants or advisers the committee has engaged cannot disclose confidential information at any time unless required or permitted by law or duly authorised in writing to do so by the oversight committee.  Amendments Nos. 33 and 36 clarify that confidential information obtained by a specified person or members of staff of Forensic Science Ireland, FSI, shall not be disclosed at any time and not just while performing functions under the Act, unless such disclosures are required or permitted by law or authorised in writing by a director or the director for FSI.  These technical amendments reflect the wording used in amendment No. 37 in respect of disclosure of confidential information by members of the oversight committee.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 73 is a further consequential amendment that provides for the oversight committee's functions to be performed by a suitably qualified person in situations where regulations are made to allow for further forensic testing in circumstances where there are developments in forensic testing after an identification programme is completed and the office of a director is dissolved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500045#ZZ00500","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655305620,"counter":327,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655305620,"counter":328,"content":"<p>Bill reported with amendment.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655305620,"counter":329,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 5, 10 and 46 are related and may be taken together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500045#ZZ00800","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1655305620,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 5:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 10, line 36, to delete &ldquo;ordinarily&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>  <p>This set of amendments is being brought in in response to amendments proposed by Deputy Cairns on Committee Stage that sought to delete the word &quot;ordinarily&quot; from the phrase &quot;ordinarily resident at the institution&quot; in the context of defining principal burial land.

The Bill currently only allows for interventions at sites in instances of manifestly inappropriate burials.  This means that even though young women or children may have died in unnatural, unknown or suspicious circumstances, this is not in itself a reason for an examination.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties recommended the use of the UN special rapporteur's definition of mass grave sites as including any burial site where the circumstances surrounding the death and-or body disposal method warrant an investigation as to their lawfulness.  Similarly, the Adoption Rights Alliance noted the current imbalance in the Bill, with interventions based on the existence of inappropriate burials rather than suspicious or unlawful deaths.  Witnesses such as representatives from the Tuam Home Survivors Network and the Guernica Group pointed out that we know about the practices of neglect, malnutrition and malpractice in these institutions.  All deaths associated with these homes are already suspicious and need to be investigated.  The international standard for transitional justice in this area is clear.  The State should intervene in cases where either the cause of death or the method of burial is in question.  This Bill falls short of reaching that standard and therefore fails to provide the justice the deceased, the survivors and their relatives deserve.<\/p> <p>The Minister will probably repeat the objections he raised on Committee Stage regarding this amendment, particularly that any intervention or investigation in respect of violent or unnatural death should clearly come under the remit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the coroner.  It posits a false dichotomy to state these amendments represent an interference with the jurisdiction of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the coroner, and it is blatantly false.  My amendment, following international human rights standards, alters the reasons to intervene, not what happens thereafter.  The Bill has a clear architecture for how the director interacts with other relevant State bodies.<br\/><br\/>More significantly, however, this is the last chance for so many to obtain justice.  For decades, known burial grounds have not been examined.  Unless this Bill is changed, that will remain the case.  Historically, State systems overlooked and even colluded in the human rights abuses and crimes in mother and baby homes and other institutions.  More recently, under-resourcing and a lack of sufficient evidence are cited as reasons for non-intervention.  Unless this Bill is amended, the <i>status quo<\/i>will remain, and given the age profile of survivors, mothers and living witnesses, including State officials and members of the religious orders, any hope of a rationale for intervention by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or a coroner will simply fade away.  Today, when faced with those realities and when my colleague Deputy Cairns and I know inaction perpetuates decades of injustice, we feel we must respond.  Unless an intervention can be established because of suspected unlawful death, many sites of potentially horrific crimes and abuses will remain covered up or buried.  For too long, this has been the State&rsquo;s de facto policy.  This Bill must align with international human rights and transitional justice standards.  It must provide justice for the deceased, the survivors and their relatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500045#ZZ01400","speaker":"1627","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655306220,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I am going to speak to amendment No. 45 because it is also in this grouping.

For the reasons I outlined then, I am not in a position to accept those under discussion.  The purpose of this legislation is to provide for the excavation, recovery, analysis, identification and dignified reinterment of human remains buried in a manifestly inappropriate manner.  This is the legislative gap that the Bill seeks to address so interventions can take place, initially at Tuam and subsequently at any other site should a similar set of circumstances come to light.<\/p>  <p>  Amendments Nos. 6 and 11 seek to alter the definition of principal burial land and the conditions for making a Government order so that an intervention can take place that does not relate to burials that are inappropriate but, rather, to burials of persons whose deaths may have occurred in a violent or unnatural manner or suddenly and of unknown causes.  As I outlined previously, this approach would fundamentally alter the scope of the Bill and would ultimately change the underlying objective of the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I disagree with Deputy Whitmore in that I believe these amendments would represent strong interference with the jurisdiction of both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the coroner.  After the pre-legislative scrutiny, I took significant action to ensure the jurisdiction of the coroner would be maintained.  That had been asked of the Government through the pre-legislative scrutiny process and directly of me by survivors I met.  We were able to secure that.  Any intervention or investigation in respect of violent or unnatural death should clearly come under the remit of the Garda or the coroner.  This is why the Bill rightly provides upfront that an order may not be made if an investigation or inquest is already under way and the Garda Commissioner is of the view that it would be premature to make an order for intervention pending the outcome of the investigation.  Similarly, the Bill rightly provides that where an intervention under this legislation is under way, a director of the agency must notify An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the coroner of any evidence of a violent or unnatural death that comes to light during the intervention and then follow their directions.  Moreover, it is unclear how, within this specific legislation, it would be established prior to an intervention that a death occurred in a violent, unnatural, sudden and unknown manner.  This legislation seeks to complement existing law, including the Coroners Act.  It is not seeking to replace it.  By way of a major change to the general scheme, I have removed all restrictions on the jurisdiction of the coroner.  Under the legislation, the director will have to try to identify the circumstances and causes of death of recovered remains and, if evidence of violent or natural death emerges, notify the coroner and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na immediately.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Funchion's amendment, No. 45, is related to changing the description of the type of death that must be notified to the coroner and a member An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As I outlined on Committee Stage, the current wording, namely, &ldquo;violent or unnatural&rdquo;, would cover any suspicious death where there is potential evidence of same, including homicide.  It is necessary to keep the wording aligned with the basis of exhumation in the Coroners Act.  More broadly, the director will publish a full post-recovery analysis report in respect of all recovered remains, which will include the cause and circumstances of death where it is possible to identify them.  The director will ensure it is brought to the attention of the relevant coroner.  Amendments Nos.  42 and 44, which were discussed under the first grouping, will ensure that the post-recovery analysis report will document whether notifications of evidence of violent or unnatural death have been made to An Garda and the coroner.  It is for those reasons that I am not in a position to support these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500046#AAA00300","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1655306220,"counter":339,"content":"<p>When the Minister first responded, he stated he was not in a position to accept the amendments.  I took that to mean that he might consider accepting them at some point down the road, but his latest response would indicate they are not under consideration at all.<\/p>  <p>  The mother and baby homes commission reported that at least 9,000 children died while in the State's care.  Many causes of death are largely unknown, as are the locations of the remains.  However, it is clear that the death rate was way higher than among the rest of the population.  The children's relatives and the wider public want justice for the lost lives.  From what we know of the conditions and treatment of babies, children and mothers in the institutions, a portion of the deaths were unnatural.  However, that is not a reason for intervention under this Bill.  Instead, the Government will act only in cases where there are substantially inappropriate burials.  Therefore, I cannot conceive why the Government is doing what it is doing.  The Bill allows for examinations only on the basis of inappropriate burial rather than the question of whether there is any suspected or alleged violent or unnatural death.  References to other State bodies that usually deal with investigations are immaterial when what I describe has not happened, is not happening and will likely never happen, as we have seen across the country to date.  The Government is clinging to technicalities when there are known sites with potential mass graves that will never be examined under this law.

This Bill gives us the opportunity to do so.

It is impossible to memorialise something if we do not know or agree on what we are acknowledging.  The report of the expert technical group states that in order to memorialise, it is essential to know what and whom are being acknowledged.  Further investigation on behalf of the Government would be required in order to memorialise effectively in the absence of specifying what the substantive reasons are for not engaging or for intervention.  It is impossible for this provision to be proportionate engagement with the rights and preferences of victims and survivors, including former residents of institutions and their families.  I note Ireland's international obligations under relevant EU and UN conventions.<\/p><p>In regard to memorialisation, measures in lieu of a proper investigation as suggested would appear to allow any Government to basically go with memorialisation over an actual investigation.

It is impossible to memorialise something if we do not know or agree what we are acknowledging and it is not possible to properly memorialise a site if we do not know what happened there.  On Sunday, I attended a commemoration at the site of the former mother and baby home in Bessborough in Cork.  It was a very moving and emotional event.  It was also a very insightful event and an excellent oration was given by Professor Conor O&rsquo;Mahony, the special rapporteur on children's rights.  He clearly and clear-sightedly identified the manner in which human rights were dealt with in the evidence gathered in the very flawed report and how there was clear evidence of human rights breaches that were very considerable.<\/p>  <p>  I met many of the mothers and some of those who were born in Bessborough and their relatives.  There is still a lot of anger, concern and uncertainty.  Many people believe, not without basis - far from it - that some of the many children who died in Bessborough may be buried on the grounds in a site that is yet to be located.  The report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes found that 31 women died at Bessborough between 1922 and 1988, as well as 923 infants.  The commission could find burial records for only 12 women and 64 infants, and the burial places of 19 women and 859 infants remain unknown.  Their story needs to be told.  The Government has a key role in establishing what happened at Bessborough.  The Minister's Department has a key role in ensuring that the site is adequately investigated to find out where these mothers and children are buried.<\/p>  <p>  There have been planning applications, which has stirred up a lot of emotion and anger due to the possibility there could be development on a site where children and women are buried.  I want to put on record my own view that that should never happen.  We must ensure such burial sites do not exist before anything like that is touched.<\/p> <p>The recent applications were inappropriate and were rightly rejected by Cork City Council and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  However, it is not enough to leave this to the planning system.  The Minister's Department needs to take a role here and establish what happened.  The Government should commission a thorough investigation of the grounds at Bessborough.  Survivors and relatives of those who lived and died at Bessborough deserve to have their concerns listened to.  They must not be cast aside or ignored.

I have met many families and survivors and, as I said, some of them regard these sites as a grave site and do not wish to see them disturbed at this stage.  They would see it as a violation of the sanctity of the remains of their loved ones.  In some circumstances, and I acknowledge that on certain sites the preferences are different among survivors, but in some circumstances the preference is a memorial recognising and marking the burial site.  This legislation, which as we know is not site specific, has to be sufficiently flexible to allow Government to take account of different circumstances and differing views which may arise in the future.  I have considered the pre-legislative scrutiny recommendations on this specific issue, and in light of these, the provision in the legislation has been amended to specify the Government must have substantive reasons to form the view that memorialisation of the burials on the land without further intervention is the more appropriate route to take.  This provision is not designed to allow the Government to refrain from intervention.  The Government will have to set out clearly the reasons for choosing memorialisation, and the rationale has to be sufficient with reference to some technical difficulties that would be such as to justify adequately the decision not to make an order.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to amendments Nos. 15 and 16, section 7 specifies that the Government may establish the office for a specific period to allow it intervene at a site associated with an institution that contains manifestly inappropriate burials.  To help ensure the office's effective operation and to adjust to the evolving situation at a particular site, the relevant Minister may need to alter the functions of the director.  As such those proposals would need to be approved by Government.<\/p>  <p>  I reiterate that the provision is not designed to prevent the director from undertaking a certain activity.  In fact, any such proposal is based on information provided by the director himself or herself, which must be taken into account by the Minister.  The provision. in effect, allows for adapting the work of the office in line with a request from the director.  This in turn reflects the reality that, at the outset of an intervention, there is likely to be a high degree of uncertainty as to what the director and his or her office will encounter.  If the provisions were removed as suggested the director may be legally required to perform a function that cannot in reality be implemented.  For example, it is possible that the function of an identification programme is assigned to the director at the outset, but if there were no living relatives willing to come forward to participate in that programme, that programme would have no function.  In this case an identification programme might no longer be feasible.  However, if we had not the capacity to amend the range of functions that could take place, the director would still be legally obliged to undertake the DNA identification programme, even if it was no longer practically feasible to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500048#CCC00900","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655307420,"counter":373,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655307420,"counter":374,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655307420,"counter":375,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 17 and 18 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500048#CCC01200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1655307420,"counter":376,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 17:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 16, line 7, to delete &ldquo;at the time of such burial,&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>  <p>These amendments are linked.  The rationale is the same.  The crux of what we are trying to get at is that there is no principal reason to specify that contemporary burial practices from the 1940s, 1950s and either earlier or later should apply to any potential burial lands.  An example of this would be that, in certain situations the practice at times was that babies, particularly if they had not been baptised at the time, had died in childbirth or were stillborn, were possibly buried in a different situation than would be acceptable now.  We do not want any situation to arise whereby those burials might be seen as being acceptable for the time.  I hope I am explaining that as I mean it and not in any disrespectful way to anyone who at the time felt that was appropriate.  What we are trying to do is ensure that, if there is a suspicious situation, it would not be left undiscovered because somebody might say it was appropriate at the time.  Obviously, that would not be appropriate and nobody would accept that now in the modern age.  That is why we want to make these two amendments, to delete &ldquo;at the time of such burial&rdquo; and, in amendment No. 18, to delete &ldquo;and would reasonably have been so considered at the time the burials took place&rdquo;, to ensure there are no grey areas in that situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500048#CCC01300","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1655307420,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I will set out the full section as it is useful for understanding the position here.  This is deciding on the issue of manifestly inappropriate burials:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe matters referred to in <i>section 7(3)(a)(ii)<\/i>are whether, in relation to the burials concerned, the human remains&mdash;  \t(a) are uncoffined,<br \/><br \/>(b) are buried in such a manner that they would not have complied with the requirements, at the time of such burial, specified in the Burial Grounds Regulations,<br \/><br \/>(c) are buried in a way that would not reasonably be considered to provide a dignified interment, or<br \/><br \/>(d) are buried collectively and in a manner or in a location that is repugnant to common decency and would reasonably have been so considered at the time the burials took place.  <\/blockquote>  <p>Those are the criteria under which that important determination of &quot;manifestly inappropriate&quot; is determined.  Amendment No. 17 seeks to remove the phrase &quot;at the time of such burial&quot; from section 8(1)(b) of the legislation.  In doing so it would undermine one of the criteria used to assess whether there were manifestly inappropriate burials at a burial site.  It is important that the assessment of burials relates to the time when such burials took place and the agreed custom, practice and requirements of that time.<\/p> <p>It is difficult to justify assessing burials with reference to requirements that were not applicable or perhaps did not exist at the time of such burials.  Burial ground regulations have changed since 1922, which is the start of the period to which this legislation is applicable.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 18 aims to delete all words from and including \"and\" in line 12 down to and including \"place\" in line 13 from section 8(1)(d).  One of the criteria that the Government must try to assess before deciding whether a burial site associated with an institution has manifestly inappropriate burials is whether most people at the time of the burials would have found the burial at a site, such as Tuam, acceptable.  Without the phrase, \"and would reasonably have been so considered at the time the burials took place\", it is much more difficult to interpret what \"repugnant to common decency\" means.  I do not believe we should undermine the rigour of the legislation by reducing clarity on this important and sensitive criterion.  To do so would undermine what we are seeking to achieve here.<\/p> <p> Everybody in this House agrees that the manner in which the remains of children were interred in the chambers at Tuam was and is not acceptable.  That is patently clear.  However, future circumstances cannot be ruled out in which the interpretation of \"common decency\" is more specific to the time when burials took place.  The phrases the Deputies wish to have deleted support the clear interpretation of the respective criteria that define \"manifestly inappropriate burials\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500048#CCC01500","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655308020,"counter":379,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655308020,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 18:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 16, lines 12 and 13, to delete &quot;and would reasonably have been so considered at the time the burials took place&quot;. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500049#DDD00300","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655308020,"counter":381,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655308020,"counter":382,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 19:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 16, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:  \t <blockquote> \t <blockquote> \t&quot;(c) any reliable evidence from a third party with knowledge of the circumstances and location of the burials concerned.&quot;. <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>The amendment seeks to expand the list of people who can provide evidence that the director will be obliged to take into consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500049#DDD00500","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1655308020,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I am not proposing to accept this amendment because I believe what the Deputy is seeking to achieve is already covered within the provisions of the Bill.

Forensic anthropologists would be essential in the analysis of the human remains and in co-ordination with forensic geneticists to re-associate the human remains recovered.

It is clear that the work needs input from a range of disciplines.  Only a multidisciplinary approach can meet international standards and can deliver specifically on the Government&rsquo;s commitments in respect of the Tuam site.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding amendment No. 41, it is not clear why excavation and post-recovery analysis under this legislation needs to be implemented in accordance with the Coroners Act, given that the Act does not regulate excavation.  The Bill does provide that if evidence of violent and unnatural death emerges, the coroner will be notified.  <\/p>  <p>  I again highlight the definition at the beginning of the Bill, which specifies that forensic excavation and recovery means excavation and recovery in the manner sufficient to satisfy legal requirements regarding the use and storage of evidence in connection with the identification of remains, including in criminal proceedings.  It is clear, therefore, that the legislation explicitly commits to applying forensic standards to ensure that any evidence gathered through the process can be used in proceedings, including criminal ones.

These technical amendments are proposed on foot of advice we received from Forensic Science Ireland, FSI.  Amendment No. 57 provides that certain information can be retained by FSI to show how the process of obtaining samples and profiles complied with the provisions of the legislation.  This amendment aligns the approach taken to the deletion of related information in situations where samples are destroyed and profiles are deleted with that which is in place under the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014, which FSI advised has worked well.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 58 to 61, inclusive, will facilitate a more direct way of linking a second or subsequent bone from a deceased person to a family member.  The provisions authorise the retention of DNA profiles from relevant persons after there has been a notification of a familial link in order that any further remains from a deceased person who has already been linked to a family member can be more easily linked to that person again.  This is important in a site like Tuam where individualising remains may be challenging and it is possible that more than one bone from the same person will be sent for analysis.  The amendments will enable FSI to use the most direct way of comparing the DNA profile of such bones with the DNA profiles of family members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500051#FFF02800","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1655309220,"counter":468,"content":"<p>These amendments do not seem to be included in the list of amendments I have to hand.

This was an aspect we discussed in some detail on Committee Stage.  As we know, a report will be coming from an agency set up under this legislation and will be published.  Deputies wished to ensure that the director of the agency would be able to come before an Oireachtas joint committee to discuss the report.  Specifically, the concern was to ensure that the dissolution of the agency coinciding with the publication of the report would not mean that there was no director to come before a joint committee.  I refer to a measure to enhance accountability.  Therefore, we engaged with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and we have brought forward a mechanism we believe addresses this aspect.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 77 and 78 address Deputies' concerns by providing that a director will be required to submit a final report to the relevant Minister at least 12 weeks before the day on which the agency is dissolved.  The relevant Minister will then be required to lay the report before the D&aacute;il within six weeks of receiving it.  This timeline will, at a minimum, provide for a guaranteed six-week window during which a director could be called before an Oireachtas joint committee to discuss the report prior to dissolution day.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 76 is a consequential amendment that provides that the relevant Minister must notify a director at least six months in advance of the day proposed to be the dissolution day.  This will ensure the director will be given sufficient notice to prepare the final report.

The issue around the 20% of recruitment and of the 20% of the board will obviously be dealt with when the board of the coimisi&uacute;n is appointed.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the amendments have come from Conradh na Gaeilge and some have come on the suggestion of the senior Minister.  It is interesting that some of those amendments are the ones that have not been accepted.  Given where we are with the Official Languages (Amendment) Act, which has not been commenced at this stage, it is good that the Minister took these amendments on board to address the lacuna, or whatever one may call it, that we are in at the moment by giving effect to the Government's intent that any future commission would have the effect as set down in the Official Languages (Amendment) Act.  I hope other Ministers will take heed of this in other Bills that will be before the House on Report Stage next week, one of which was supposed to be before us today.

That is now reflected in the Minister&rsquo;s amendments.  They do not go as far as I would have liked but the situation is a great deal better now.  When the members of an coimisi&uacute;n are being appointed, we must ensure this issue is to the forefront.  It must be understood that their ability to speak Irish, or have an understanding of the Irish language, is an aid.  This would be a welcome criterion for such members, if possible, in the future.

The insertion of a new section 172 into the Bill, the consequential amendments to the Bill&rsquo;s Long Title and the amendments to sections 2 and 5 of the Bill are intended to address this issue.<\/p><p>At the outset I would like to clarify that this amendment is intended to provide that registered political parties may apply to the District Court for a licence to run periodical lotteries to support their fundraising activities and may do so under the provisions of this Bill when enacted as an alternative to applying under section 28 of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts 1956 to 2019.  For the avoidance of doubt, these provisions do not specifically propose to introduce a new source or sources of funding for political parties but are intended to provide that any lotteries previously operated by political parties, whether referred to as draws, raffles, sweepstakes or otherwise, can continue to be run, subject to the requirements of the new Part 8.<\/p><p>This amendment is largely modelled on section 28 of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts 1956 to 2019.  It is intended to be broadly consistent with the approach set out in the Act insofar as it relates to the operation of licensed lotteries specifically by registered political parties rather than by organisations solely with a charitable or philanthropic purpose.  Under the Gaming and Lotteries Acts, a lottery is very broadly defined to include all competitions, for money or money&rsquo;s worth, involving guesses or estimates of future events or past events, the results of which are not yet ascertained or generally known.  Deputies may wish to note that this definition is clarified in an information leaflet issued by the Department of Justice, &quot;Applying for a Lottery Licence&quot;, which advises that the types of lotteries licence under the Acts include raffles, draws, sweepstakes and bingo events.<\/p><p>I would like to clarify that paragraph 7 of the definition of &quot;donation&quot; is provided for in section 22(2)(a) of the Electoral Act 1997, which provides that the net value of a contribution made by a person in connection with an event organised for the purpose of raising funds for a political party falls within the meaning of a political donation.  In practical terms, this means that the donations regime and the threshold set out therein applies to fundraising events organised by political parties.  Further, the Standards in Public Office Commission has published guidelines for political parties on the steps to be taken concerning donations and prohibited donations.  These guidelines are set out in the context of fundraising events and how the net value of contributions is calculated for the purposes of the donations regime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500055#KKK00500","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1655311320,"counter":535,"content":"<p>I must say that these amendments are deeply disappointing.  This is legislation of great importance, as we made clear on Second and Committee Stages.  There was a very collegial nature in the committee's dealing with this Bill, with strong cross-party consensus to ensure the legislation on the modernisation of our electoral system and our electoral register, and the creation of an electoral commission, was something we all wanted to do.  We have collectively produced a very good Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The amendments the Minister brought forward on Committee Stage with regard to party financing were directly related to the electoral reform legislation because they were about ensuring the integrity of our electoral system was not in any way undermined or jeopardised by party financing.  This amendment has nothing to do with any of that.  I am genuinely surprised that the Green Party is allowing this set of amendments to be inserted at this point.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of these amendments is very clear.  They will allow Fianna F&aacute;il to do something that it did once last year and got away with, and tried to do a second time but did not get away with because it was in breach of the law.  We know very clearly that Fianna F&aacute;il sought to apply to the High Court for a lottery licence on charitable donation grounds.  A legal objection was raised and a legal threat was issued, and that lottery was cancelled and the money was refunded.  This set of amendments is attempting to retrospectively legalise something that is currently not permissible.  It runs completely contrary to the spirit of all of our discussions with respect to this Bill but also to the content of the Bill itself.  <\/p>  <p>  I have said to the Minister of State on many occasions that I have an enormous amount of respect for him.  We have worked very well on a range of issues.  It seems that when the Minister of State's line Minister is doing something that is politically controversial or unpopular, or when there are Private Members' Bills from our party, from the Social Democrats or from the Labour Party that are unpopular for the Government and to which it is opposed, unfortunately the Minister of State is sent in to defend the Bill.  I am sure Deputy McAuliffe will defend the line Minister's honour.<\/p>  <p>  This measure is unacceptable.  It is not what the Bill is for.  It is unacceptable that this has been brought in by way of a motion for non-consequential amendments without debate, where we will only have a limited time for discussion.  My colleagues and other Deputies will have other questions, but I ask the Minister of State to tell the House who asked for this.  It was not discussed or debated at any of the multiple sessions of pre-legislative scrutiny we held.  Who requested this?  Why is this here?  What has this got to do with modernising electoral reform?  I cannot see on the face of everything in front of us that this has anything to do with anything other than allowing Fianna F&aacute;il to do things which it tried to do illegally last year, but did not get away with.  It is now trying to change the law to suit itself in order to get away with it into the future.  That is entirely unacceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500055#KKK00600","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1655311920,"counter":536,"content":"<p>It is extremely disappointing that the amendments have been brought in on Report Stage that were not part of the Bill or the process before.

There were a lot of different requests, very legitimate ones, to improve and strengthen the Bill.  Many have not been accepted, unfortunately.  I put down amendments that would have strengthened our democracy yet somehow, at the very end of the process, these amendments were tabled to introduce a new form of fundraising for political parties without any proper prior debate or scrutiny.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State said that this would not introduce a new form of fundraising for political parties.  However, he then said that it would allow political parties to apply for a licence to operate a weekly lottery.  I am not aware of any political parties that are operating a weekly lottery or which have ever done fundraising of that nature at a national level.  These amendments will specifically allow for this new form of fundraising by political parties.  Will the Minister of State clarify why he and the Minister both feel that this is not a new form of fundraising yet the Minister of State has given further explanation and detail which very much suggests that it is?  I am not aware of any parties doing it and there is no legal basis for it.  <\/p>  <p>  I also seek clarity on the definition of lotteries as there are contradictions in what the Minister of State said.

He also gave a very specific definition of the lottery which is that it relates to any guessing of a future event where the outcome is not known.  A draw or raffle, if it is not around guessing numbers of predicting outcomes at sporting events or other unknowns in the future, does not fit that definition.  In the briefing provided earlier in the week no clarity was provided on that point.  Will the Minister of State give clarity on that?  How is a draw or raffle that is not about predicting a future event, in terms of numbers etc., in the definition?  Is it considered to be in the definition on the basis that one does not know who will be pulled from the draw?  Is that the future event?  Is that what he is relying on?  Why does he take the view that this is not a new form of fundraising for political parties?  Will he explain this in detail and give some examples of legislation up tp now that has allowed political parties to run lotteries?  Will he give some examples where political parties are specifically mentioned? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500056#LLL00100","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1655311920,"counter":537,"content":"<p>I am very surprised at the Minister of State being sucked into this stroke and I am shocked at his statement because this is a new avenue of funding for political parties and he should acknowledge that.  Lottery permits are allowed.  Indeed, individuals and businesses can apply for lottery permits but the key difference is that to get a lottery permit you do not go to court.  You get it through the Garda.  The maximum value of a ticket is &euro;10 and the maximum prize fund is &euro;5,000.  This is where Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, but Fianna F&aacute;il in particular, were snookered because they sell their tickets for &euro;75 and &euro;80.  The Minister of State should acknowledge that the Government's amendment to allow a political party to apply to the District Court for a lottery licence is a new avenue because that is exclusively held for charitable bodies and philanthropic bodies.  He knows that, we know that; that is what the law says.  He is changing the law to allow for political parties to be able to apply to the courts.  That brings us to the unlawful fundraising that Fianna F&aacute;il was involved in last year, raising over &euro;0.5 million that will be spent on influencing the electoral process.  As Minister of State with responsibility for the matter, I ask him to comment.  Fianna F&aacute;il applied to the court on two occasions, once in April and then September.  They received a lottery licence on both occasions from the court.  They applied to the District Court.  Fianna F&aacute;il knows well because in 1980 it was brought to the High Court by the Garda when the Garda objected saying that it was neither a charity nor a philanthropic body.  It went to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court judgment of Gurhy <i>v.<\/i>Goff made it clear that Fianna F&aacute;il is neither a philanthropic body nor a charity.  For Fianna F&aacute;il to fill in an application before the courts &ndash; and  I have a sample of the application form - and state that the proceeds will go to Fianna F&aacute;il, that is, a charitable body, is the very definition of misleading the court and is indeed a crime.<\/p><p>Thankfully, a citizen last year took a case against Fianna F&aacute;il.  As a result of their writing to Fianna F&aacute;il and putting it on notice it did the right thing - it refunded all the money that had been raised until that point and cancelled the lottery so the September licence had no impact.  However, what happened about the licence of April-May and the &euro;500,000-plus that was raised in relation to that licence?  We know that a lottery licence for a political party is unlawful.  How do we know that?  We know it because the Minister of State is bringing forward amendment No. 101 to make it lawful in the future.  It was unlawful previously.We also know that the form states two things.  One is that at least 25% of all proceeds shall be retained to the holder and not less shall than 25% shall be allocated to charitable or philanthropic purposes.  That is a requirement on the dodgy licence that Fianna F&aacute;il got at the time.  To our knowledge it has not paid a penny to a charity which again is in breach of the law.  If this was Sinn F&eacute;in which had raised &euro;500,000 through a licence that went to the court, having been taken to the courts during the 1980s by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to say that it was neither a charity nor a philanthropic body so it could not get the licence and then it did it again, there would be &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; specials about it.  That is the reality.  <\/p><p>The Minister of State has responsibility for political spending and all the rest.  I am asking him to make a statement on this because it is a very serious charge.  The only reason that this measure is before this House today, let us be clear, is because Fianna F&aacute;il got caught out when it tried to do it a second time.  It broke the law; it raised &euro;500,000 through an unlawful mechanism and it will use that money for political discourse in elections and whatnot.  This is a stroke.  It has not come out of campaigning and all the rest.  It cannot raise money at the level that it wants to.  It cannot sell &euro;75 tickets.  It cannot have prize funds of more than &euro;5,000.  Therefore the Minister of State has a responsibility to acknowledge that this is a new source of funding for political parties.  For lottery permits, we can apply to the Garda but there are limits - &euro;10 is the maximum we can charge for a ticket and &euro;5,000 is the maximum weekly prize.  Political parties cannot go near lottery licences.  There is a very serious issue that the Taoiseach dodged yesterday but he will not get away with this.  Huge amounts of money were raised by a political party in this State unlawfully.  Now the Minister of State is coming forward to do the dirty work to make it lawful in the future for them to have their national draws.  The Minister of State should be asking questions.  If he wants to bring forward legislation with proper scrutiny then that is not a problem.  Let us scrutinise it.  However, he also has a responsibility to ask why he is being used in this way.  Why is he being asked to clean up the mess of Fianna F&aacute;il?  Furthermore, as Minister of State with responsibility for this, can he tell us what happened to the &euro;500,000 that was supposed to go to charitable causes?  Has Fianna F&aacute;il provided that to charitable causes?  Has it handed it over?  The reason it cancelled and refunded all of its national draw events for Christmas was that if it had gone to the court, the licence would have been rescinded.  It knew that it was caught hook, line and sinker.  It was breaking the law; it was caught.  The problem is that the April licence had too long of a timeframe before the citizen was aware of the issue.  That should not absolve the Taoiseach, the party in government, the Green Party which shares Government with it and the Minister of State having responsibility in this issue from dealing with this matter.<\/p> <p>As I said, if the shoe was on the other foot, many column inches would be written about this and many questions would rightly be asked of ourselves and others, but we hear a deafening silence from the Green Party and the Minister of State on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500056#LLL00200","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655312520,"counter":539,"content":"<p>This is not some kind of a performative routine from Opposition parties that have decided that we do not like this and we will ritually condemn it because it happens to be an amendment from a Government party and that is what we do.  I am genuinely horrified that a measure such as this has been proposed at the last minute, without having been properly signalled to the D&aacute;il, and without it having had the opportunity to properly interrogate and ventilate all of the issues that arose here over the past few weeks.<\/p>  <p>  I will give a potted history of this.  We had Second Stage a number of months ago, when there was no reference whatsoever to this proposition.  We had Committee Stage in the Select Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage just two short weeks ago.  We all spent an extensive period of time in the committee rooms debating what is very necessary legislation that will improve our democracy and help run our elections independently of Government - a demand we have all had over the past 25 to 30 years.<\/p>  <p>  We learned at the weekend, because of a press statement from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, that the Cabinet agreed to sign off on this measure on 24 May.  We had an explanation of sorts from the Department that it took a little while to draft the amendment and that is why it did not appear before us on Committee Stage.  It is not a complicated amendment but it is a controversial one.  It is controversial for all of the right reasons, for anybody who believes in transparency or political reform.<\/p>  <p>  Our track record shows that the Labour Party believes in transparency and political reform as do I.  We took big money out of politics in 2015.  There is no demand for this.  It is a retrograde, backward step and it could potentially herald the return of big money into politics through the back door.  We know about the toxic, corrupting, poisonous influence that big money has had on politics and on faith and trust in democracy in this country going back many years.  That is why the reforms restricting corporate donations were introduced back in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  I see the problems associated with this.  How will we be sure beyond all doubt that moneys raised through these kinds of lotteries are coming through the system legitimately?  An organisation could have every capability to exceed the corporate donation limits by signing off on a number of tickets under different names in order to make a contribution to a political party and thereby circumvent the very transparent and rigid rules that are in place at present and have served our democracy well.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach referred yesterday, in response a point I raised on the Order of Business on this very issue, to my party, the Labour Party, having benefitted from democratic resources from our sisters and brothers in the trade union movement since our foundation.  The party was founded by the trade union movement.  We were legitimately receiving support through SIPTU and other trade unions, but we decided that if serious corporate donations were to be eliminated in this country, we would have to stand up and say that included support from trade unions as well.  We took that hit and we did that for the benefit of transparency and political reform.<\/p>  <p>  The truth is that the only demand here was because the Fianna F&aacute;il Party was rumbled in its efforts to operate a lottery, through a licence that it obtained through the court system in recent times.  I believe Fianna F&aacute;il feared that the last decision would be judicially reviewed and it would have a series of other problems on that front.  This amendment is designed to get one particular political party off the hook and allow it to compete in what I would describe as a financial arms race with other parties that it describes as wealthier than it.<\/p>  <p>  Rather than doing that, we should ensure that we continue to have a level playing pitch apply to all political parties in this country.  This measure is a bad day for transparency and political reform in this democracy.  It is disappointing that it is coming before us.  One of the most interesting emails I received on this issue over the past few days was from a high-profile NGO.  I know Deputies &Oacute; Broin and O'Callaghan have received it and perhaps other members of the Select Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage have also received it.  It relates to our collective and individual efforts over the past few years to try to ensure that the funding laws for NGOs that are caught up, inadvertently, in the legislation that we have in place are amended in order to allow them to play the full role and participate in this democratic society in the way that they should.  There have been soundings from the Department and indications from the Minister that they acknowledge that this is a problem and that it could be resolved.  However, it has not been resolved and no efforts have been made to reach out to me, Deputy &Oacute; Broin or Deputy O'Callaghan, who have proposed amendments to fix this long-running sore in our democracy.  No efforts have been made to do that.  This has not been prioritised.<\/p>  <p>  As that email said, it is very telling what this Government's priority is.  This is an eleventh hour, last-minute amendment, which was not properly signalled to us.  It is about enabling political parties to have a new way of raising money, while the long-standing issue of the treatment of donations to NGOs remains unresolved.  That is revealing about the priorities of this Government and it saddens me to have to say so.  We will vehemently oppose this measure.  It is bad for democracy, for the financing of political parties and for openness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500057#MMM00200","speaker":"1599"},{"type":"speech","time":1655312520,"counter":540,"content":"<p>The worst aspect of what is going on here this evening is the sleight of hand way in which it is happening.

The word \"performative\", used by Deputy Nash is exactly it.  We have had every slur one could possibly put in a contribution, such as stroke and backhanded, and attempts to talk about illegal donations.  Hyperbole has been used in the Chamber.  Let me speak to the amendment.<\/p>  <p>  The amendment allows political parties to hold raffles and draws to raise funds.  That is what it does.  There are different ways.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin said that I might defend the Minister's honour.  I am not defending his honour.  I am defending the ability for us to have an open and transparent political system in which citizens can engage.<\/p>  <p>  There are different ways one might fund political parties.  As Deputy Nash said, having special sectoral interests do that is accepted as wrong.<\/p>  <p>We know that corporate donations are incorrect.  We have long since moved on in that regard and there is now only a small limit of &euro;101 for corporate donations.<\/p> <p> How do we fund political activity?  Politics is not some dirty activity.  It is what we do in this House and how we are elected to this House.  It is how we represent the constituents who elect us.  Political activity should be funded in some way.  There is significant State support for political parties, depending on representation, for Independents, party leaders and different political parties.  It is lower for those in government than the Opposition.  We were the beneficiaries of that when we were in opposition.<\/p> <p> The other way of funding political parties is by means of a sizable number of small donations coming from across the country, whether it is &euro;10 or &euro;50, with people making a donation to a political party that contributes to what they believe in.  That is not a super political action committee - super PAC - dirty or a stroke.  It is people making a small contribution to their ideas being progressed in this House.  That is what this amendment does.  It allows political parties to hold a draw or raffle, with small amounts of money being paid for tickets.  All of the amounts submitted are subject to the other limits, including personal and corporate limits, that are in place.  We have had significant reform, progressed by Deputy Nash's party and many others, in the area of political activity.  Let us not pretend to the public that dirty, illegal money is washing around this Chamber; it is not.  Deputies are doing a disservice to all of us here if they are pretending that is the case for a 30-second Facebook clip.<\/p> <p> This Bill contains significant changes relating to foreign donations.  Perhaps the restrictions that we put in place on foreign donations sting, because some parties take donations above individual limits and above the limits from corporate entities.  Sinn F&eacute;in does that at the moment.  It takes corporate donations above the limits allowed in Ireland and individual donations above the allowed limits, which Deputies Nash, Cian O'Callaghan, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and I are subject to.  We do not take sizable corporate or individual donations.  Sinn F&eacute;in does.  That is perfectly legal because it is done in another jurisdiction.  Partition obviously suits on some occasions.  It should not pretend that it is not doing it.  Sinn F&eacute;in takes corporate and individuals donations above the limit that we are allowed in the Republic.<\/p> <p> The Greens are not whipping boys for anybody.  The Minister is well able to say whatever he believes, and has long experience in politics.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party are proposing that political parties will be able to hold prize draws.  Is the Opposition really saying that it is against raffles?  Are Deputies saying that they are against my mother and father each putting &euro;50 into a Fianna F&aacute;il raffle?  We are from an area which does not have many people who go into politics.  Somebody from that area might be able to benefit from the resources a political party has to be elected to represent those people.  Sinn F&eacute;in is trying to stop individuals from buying tickets for raffles.  That is not actually what it is doing, though.  It is distracting from what it does as a party and it is trying to label all of us as dirty, stroke-ridden and so on.  I cannot put up with that.  I cannot let people say that about my party now, because my party does not have that kind of activity or money.  The vast majority of parties in this Chamber do not have it.  We should not pretend to the public, for the sake of a 30-second clip, that Irish politics is awash with dirty money, because it is not, and we know it is not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500057#MMM00400","speaker":"1568","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655313120,"counter":543,"content":"<p>If I welcome anything from Deputy McAuliffe, it is his acknowledgement that everything Sinn F&eacute;in does related to fundraising is within the law and is done legally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500058#NNN00200","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1655313120,"counter":544,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in still does it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500058#NNN00300","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1655313120,"counter":545,"content":"<p>We do it because it is legal.  That is what Deputy McAuliffe is so antagonised about.  Fianna F&aacute;il was exposed as breaking the law in the fundraising activities it engaged in last year.  Of course it is legitimate for political parties to raise money through legal means and of course it is legitimate for people to support a political party they share the views and beliefs of.  All of that is entirely legitimate.  The difficulties in Irish politics and the fundamental problems that we face to this day with how our housing crisis, health system, public services, the privatisation agenda and so on are managed have their roots in the past, with the scandals relating to <i>The Irish Press<\/i>, the sweepstakes, the Galway tents, the money going into wives' bank accounts and the countless tribunals.<\/p><p>Some Fianna F&aacute;il representatives have been keen to talk about historical matters this week.  Any one of those issues is open for discussion, but this is about the here and now.  It is about the amendment that has been tabled for one reason alone.  As Deputy Doherty rightly stated, Fianna F&aacute;il decided to run a national draw in the spring of last year.  It raised &euro;500,000 through that draw.  In the autumn, it decided to try to raise another &euro;500,000 until the proposed action for a second draw was exposed as being illegal.  Fianna F&aacute;il had to throw the tickets in the bin and refund the money that had already been collected because it knew that if the matter had been brought to court, it would have lost.<\/p><p>There is a question which has not been answered and which Deputy McAuliffe did not refer to at all.  It will be incumbent on the Minister of State to respond to the questions that have been posed.  It is a legitimate question, because it is an absolute fact that Fianna F&aacute;il raised &euro;500,000 last year through illicit means.  Regardless of what the law says next week, next month or next year, that was the law at the time.  Where has that money gone?  Was it passed on to a charity in line with the legislation, which would provide some ameliorating circumstances that Fianna F&aacute;il could rely on?  Did it simply go into the coffers of Fianna F&aacute;il?  Deputy McAuliffe said we are uncomfortable talking about issues relating to fundraising in the USA or the mechanisms in place in the North.  I have answered countless questions in respect of those issues on different occasions, on radio programmes, on doorsteps and outside this House.  I find it bizarre that the Taoiseach was challenged about that yesterday, yet he has been involved in media engagements in the 24 hours since, and, to my knowledge, no journalist has put that question to him.  What did Fianna F&aacute;il do with the &euro;500,000 that it raised illegally?  That is legitimate question which has to be answered.  It has been raised several times in this House and no Minister has stood up and accounted for it.<\/p><p>The reason this amendment has been tabled at all is because Fianna F&aacute;il wants to organise another draw in the autumn.  There is no other reason for it.  The Minister of State has received many commendations.

That is what the Bill is about.  That is what establishing the electoral commission is about.  As the Ceann Comhairle stated, I am not going to get into any issues in respect of any political party.  What this amendment does is for all political parties to be able to participate in our electoral system and our political process.  In response to the point Deputy Doherty made around money being raised to influence the political process, moneys that political parties raised are moneys raised to participate in our political system on an equal footing and to be able to do that.  It is important that, collectively, we have an ability to do that.  I am a member of a very small political party, as are Deputies Nash and Cian O'Callaghan.  We run fundraisers, table quizzes and events for our elections campaigns.  Families and members of the community donate.  That helps us to get to where we are, into D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann or council chambers.  This amendment is intended to enable political parties to participate, to be able to raise funds legitimately under the gaming and lotteries legislation, including raffles, draws, sweepstakes and bingo events.  Those are legitimate events.  The point was raised that this is a new source.  The amendment does not specifically propose to introduce a new source or source of funding for political parties.  It is intended to provide that lotteries previously operated by political parties which were referred to as draws, raffles, sweepstakes or otherwise can continue to run subject to requirements of the new Part 8.<\/p>  <p>  A point was raised by Deputy Nash in respect of NGOs and civil society organisations.  I have met with the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, and the coalition of civil liberty organisations.  We have given a firm commitment to the ICCL that we will address the issue of the political purposes under the 1997 Act under a broad, comprehensive review.  I gave that commitment on Committee Stage and I am giving it again this evening.  We will task the commission to carry out that work early on.  We do want to address the matter.  It is critically important that we do so.<\/p>  <p>  The amendment relates to part of our political system and process.  There are no strokes being pulled.  There is nothing untoward about it.  My colleague has articulated that better than I could.  It is not for one particular political party but for all political parties to participate in our political system.  I emphasise that the amendment we are bringing forward will simply allow registered political parties to fundraise legitimately by means of draws, raffles and so on.  The proposed amendment will remove any doubt that currently exists around the legitimacy of such fundraising events.  It is also important to note that the donations regime in the Electoral Act 1997 and the thresholds set out therein will apply to fundraising events organised by political parties.  This will not be a way to circumvent those rules.  In this context, it will be incumbent on any political party that might engage in fundraising activities under the new Part 8 to ensure that it is in compliance with the requirements under Part 4 of the Electoral Act 1997.<\/p>  <p>  It is unfortunate that Deputies have chosen to see this as a stroke or something untoward.

It is reasonable, however, for the Opposition to ask Government to explain why it is changing certain laws, to clarify the changes it is making, the origins of those changes, who asked for them, when they asked for them, for what purposes and what the consequences would be.  That is what Deputy Carthy was doing, and I fully support him in that.<\/p>  <p>  I also agree with the Ceann Comhairle that we have a very limited amount of time to do this and that is deeply regrettable.  It is not the Ceann Comhairle's fault at all.  We probably spent as much time on this Bill as almost any other Bill in our committee, bar the maritime area planning legislation.  At no stage did the Government say it wanted to reform general party financing.  If Government approached the Opposition and said it would like to do that, I think we would all be open to having it as a separate, stand-alone matter.  We did ask for the motion that was presented earlier for the non-consequential amendments to be taken with debate and that was not possible.  We are left in a position of having to have a debate, not because we have chosen to but because Government has tabled amendments that have nothing to do with this legislation and this is our only opportunity to tease it out.<\/p>  <p>  I will respond very briefly to the Minister of State and to Deputy McAuliffe.  I asked the Minister of State some very reasonable questions about these amendments.  Who asked for them?  What is the origin of these amendments?  A lot of the debate we have had around the Bill is due to the fact that for many years many people have asked for reasonable modernising reforms to the legislation.  We spent lots of time talking about that yet the Minister of State was not willing to tell us who asked for this, when they asked for it, or why.<\/p>  <p>  I also asked in my initial comments why something that has nothing to do with electoral reform or the integrity of our electoral systems is being added in at the last minute.  Non-consequential amendments, as I generally understand them from my limited number of years in the Oireachtas, are generally proposed when something of an emergency nature comes up, not when it is just a standard, general reform or change on some other matter.  For example, we are going to be dealing with changes to the fair deal scheme tagged on to the construction industry register legislation because we have to try to accelerate the acquisition of private rental properties.  We have all agreed that is a sensible thing.  I do not believe the intention of non-consequential amendments is to simply tag on other, more general reforms that are not time-bound by anything.  There is no urgency around this particular change.  It does not have to happen now.  It could happen in six months or a year.  In view, the Government is misusing the non-consequential amendment procedure and that is very regrettable.<\/p>  <p>  I always speak sincerely on these matters.  The Minister of State does himself no favours when he tries to present the very legitimate criticisms of our party and the other Opposition parties in a dismissive manner or as anything other than deeply sincere.  I am disappointed by his separate but related comments on NGO funding.  Lumping it into a comprehensive review of that other legislation will mean that we will not see light of it for quite some time.  We will work with the Minister of State on it and I take him at his word.  I want to put it on record that I always get nervous when we are told something is part of a more comprehensive review.  The Bill before us was part of a comprehensive review.  The Ceann Comhairle probably has more knowledge of the longevity of that debate than most of us.  It goes back several decades but we will deal with that separately.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to Deputy McAuliffe, I think he missed the core point of what we are saying.  We accepted, warmly and enthusiastically, all the amendments in relation to party financing that the Government brought forward.<\/p> <p>We even engaged with the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, on one particular aspect of them.  He tabled a very sensible amendment on the &euro;100 threshold as a result of concerns we raised.  Therefore, there is no difficulty in our party supporting the maximum level of transparency and accountability when it comes to party financing and funding in this State and the North, or anywhere else for that matter.<\/p> <p> The problem is that this amendment under discussion is trying to retrospectively make a change to the law to cover up for the fact that, on two occasions, one political party broke that law.  My question to Deputy McAuliffe is on whether he benefited from the licence that in my strong view was obtained in contravention of the law in April and May of last year.  Did he benefit from moneys raised from that, moneys that I believe were raised outside the scope of the lotteries Act as it currently operates?  That is a reasonable question because it is directly related to the question of why one would or would not support this Bill.<\/p> <p> I am quite proud of the fact that my colleague Deputy Ward and I are probably two of the cheapest Deputies in the House.  I am not referring to our expenditure in our personal lives but to the fact that we spend far less money getting ourselves elected than most other Deputies.  Every single penny we raise in my constituency, as is the case in Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and Dublin South-Central, is raised in full accordance with the laws of this State.  I am sure that when other members of the Opposition speak, they will confirm that, but there is a question mark over Deputy McAuliffe and his colleagues if &euro;500,000-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500059#OOO00500","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655314320,"counter":555,"content":"<p>That is an alarming statement: &quot;there is a question mark over Deputy McAuliffe&quot;.

On the lack of time, I vehemently opposed the use of the guillotine and the restriction of the debate to 90 minutes.  We did so on multiple occasions, from meetings of the Business Committee to the Order of Business.  Shoehorning more than 100 amendments into 90 minutes is not a way to deal with this.  It is bad process and it is bad for democracy.  I do not support it at all.  It means we are not getting sufficient time to go through these amendments at all.  I have made that point before.<\/p>  <p>  On the amendments, it is clear that the Bill seeks to introduce a new form of fundraising for political parties, specifically to apply for lottery licences.  Let us be very clear: this is not about small donations or raffles.  Without these amendments, everybody involved in politics would be absolutely free under law to seek and receive small donations and have small fundraising events.  That is not what these amendments are about.  Specifically, they would allow one to apply for a licence for a lottery with a prize fund of &euro;360,000.  Let us not kid ourselves because none of the smaller parties in this D&aacute;il or democracy will be looking for licences for lotteries with prize funds of &euro;360,000.  This is not about getting small donations from friends, family, communities and neighbours, which is a healthy part of democracy; it is to introduce a new form of fundraising.  It is absolutely legitimate, given the proposal of the Government, to have proper scrutiny and debate so we can discuss subjects such as the safeguards that will be put in place for this new form of fundraising.  That is what should have happened on Committee Stage.  There should have been a genuine, rigorous debate on the safeguards needed and why such large lottery funds are needed if the object is to get small donations.  You do not need a large prize fund to accept, receive or seek small donations; you actually do not need any.  Fundraising can be done using a prize such as a bottle of wine, as many of us have used in the past.  With regard to fundraising I have been involved in, with me as a candidate or otherwise, the extent of any prize fund was something like a bottle of wine or a couple of books.  We are not talking about the types of prize funds in question.  The latter are on a totally different scale.  Let us not kid ourselves about that.<\/p>  <p>  Not having the debate or discussion on safeguards or on why the Government feels it is necessary to have such large prize funds is an issue.  How is it that the political system and democracy can exist at the moment without such large prize funds?  There is no scrutiny, debate or explanation whatsoever, so I ask the Minister of State to explain his position.  The answers we have got have all been about small fundraising efforts, but these do not require large prize funds like those in question.  Large prize funds are geared specifically towards what the larger political parties could do.  There is a range of dangers associated with how donations made could be misused or abused.  We have had no discussion on the safeguards.  Let us hear about the safeguards that are planned.  <\/p>  <p>  Given the history in this country of political donations, their impact on our planning system and how they have led to planning corruption, resulting in lengthy tribunals at a huge cost and findings against elected representatives from what have traditionally been the two larger political parties, in particular, we cannot brush aside major changes to the law and the political fundraising process as not worthy of proper scrutiny and debate, or as something that can just be rammed through at the last minute, without proper time.  <\/p> <p>As others have said, there are other issues that people, including those from civil society and NGOs, have been looking to resolve for years.  They have not been resolved in this Bill, despite people looking for that to happen.  There is a disparity between how that is being treated and the absolute priority the Government has given to this matter, while not allowing proper time for scrutiny and debate.  It is not in any way acceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500060#PPP01700","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655314920,"counter":572,"content":"<p>There are a couple of things that need to be said.  We heard a defence from our Fianna F&aacute;il colleague, asking what is wrong with his &quot;mother and father each putting &euro;50 into a Fianna F&aacute;il raffle&quot;.  He suggested that this is about raffles, draws and all the rest.  That is fine and there is nothing wrong with that.  If someone's mum wants to give them &euro;50, first, she does not need to buy a ticket - she can give it as a donation in the first instance.  The second thing is that all political parties operate under lottery permits.  However, the limit for a ticket under a lottery permit is &euro;10, and someone&rsquo;s mum can buy five or ten of them if she wants.  She can actually buy up to &euro;2,500 worth if she wants to donate to the party.  This measure is about allowing prize tickets of an unlimited nature and prize funds of an unlimited nature.  I just want to make that point.<\/p><p>I want to pick up on something the Minister of State said which is wrong.  This is a new source of funding.  This goes to the core of the issue.  Let me be clear.  The only political party that went for a lottery licence last year, which is not currently allowed under law but the Government is now going to make it legal, was Fianna F&aacute;il.  Fine Gael operated under a lottery permit, with a &euro;10 ticket and a weekly prize fund of no more than &euro;5,000.  Sinn F&eacute;in operated under a lottery permit.  I am sure that if the Labour Party raised money last year, it operated under a lottery permit, and the same for the Social Democrats.  It is not as if that creates huge limitations.  Fine Gael under lottery permits raised over &euro;1 million in its draw, and it had a lottery permit last year.  Fianna F&aacute;il went twice to the courts for a lottery licence.  In the 1980s, a superintendent in Enniscorthy, County Wexford objected to the Fianna F&aacute;il Enniscorthy cumann and took the case to the Supreme Court, and was proved right.  The Gurhy <i>v<\/i>. Goff judgment in the Supreme Court held.  Fianna F&aacute;il knew all about it because not many political parties were taken to the Supreme Court by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Fianna F&aacute;il was applying to raise money by pretending to be a charity, but that was found not to be true.  The Supreme Court overturned the District Court decision to grant the licence at that time.  It was a significant ruling.<\/p><p>There are massive questions here because somebody filled out an application form that is only available for charities or philanthropic groups, and claimed to be one of those.  One could argue that people should know this but if they go to the District Court, they may not know what happened 30 or 40 years ago.  The person presenting that document to the court has an obligation not to mislead the court so there is a serious issue there.  That is the first point.<\/p><p>The second point is that the second Fianna F&aacute;il draw - the early bird Christmas draw, as it was called - was to be held on 16 December, but it was called off and money was refunded.  That is not an easy task but we are told that money was refunded to everybody who bought tickets.  It was called off, but why?  It was because Chay Bowes took legal action against Fianna F&aacute;il.  The same Chay Bowes made the complaint against the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar, on which those in the DPP are doing their job to assess whether they will prosecute at the current time, which is up to them.  As he was corresponding with Fianna F&aacute;il and informing them he was taking legal action, they had no option.  They could have had an option.  They could have said what the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, said on the floor of the D&aacute;il, namely, &ldquo;Everything we are doing is legal.&rdquo;  If it was legal, why would they cancel the draw and refund all the money that they made?  It was not legal.  They misled the court.  They were raising money illegally.  That is why they took the drastic measure in December of immediately saying, once they got the letter, &ldquo;We are caught folks, cancel the draw and refund every penny that was paid.&rdquo;  That is what happened.  I am sure Deputies in this House all sold tickets, or at least the majority of them did.<\/p><p>The core issue is this.  What happened to the draw that took place on 24 June last year?  That was their super-draw.  If we look at it, Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies all had their own pieces on their webpages promoting the super-draw, where we were told by Fianna F&aacute;il that they got a licence through the courts.  Again, as I said earlier, it could only be by misleading the court because a lottery licence cannot be given to a political party, and there are conditions even if it is given to the political party.  Let me clarify that.  Sinn F&eacute;in can go into court and apply for a lottery licence and say we want a lottery licence and we are giving the money to the Irish Cancer Society, and that is fine.  The licence will be granted and we give the money to the Irish Cancer Society, but we could not use it for our own means.  The conditions are very clear in that regard.  On 24 June, they had their super-draw and it is estimated they raised over &euro;500,000.<\/p><p>Deputy McAuliffe might brush it off and say it is not an issue for him but I ask him to imagine if a criminal went before the courts, as any individual is allowed to do, to apply for a lottery licence, saying he wanted to raise money and was going to give the money to charity, thereby complying with the conditions.  If we found out that person who misled the courts actually did not give a bob to charity and kept all the money for themselves, what would we say?  Would we just turn a blind eye or would we say that needs to be prosecuted, that needs to be dealt with?<\/p><p>The reason I raise this issue in terms of the Taoiseach is not just because he is the Taoiseach and leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, but because he is the trustee of the party.  He is more than just the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il.  He is the trustee of Fianna F&aacute;il, which is a very significant issue in terms of fundraising for the party.  Indeed, their audited accounts will have his signature on them.  It is a serious issue of massive magnitude that we have the leader of this State actively promoting at Christmas a draw which had to be cancelled and money refunded, and that he actively promoted, as trustee and leader of his party, a draw which raised over &euro;500,000, which we know could only have happened by illegal means because a political party could not get a lottery licence.<\/p><p>That brings us back to the point about the licence.  We know Fianna F&aacute;il had a licence for their Christmas draw that they had to refund.  How do we know it?  It is because the courts have to hold a register of licences and, indeed, amendment No. 101 states very clearly that the District Court will have to keep a register of lottery licences that can be inspected by the public.  Therefore, anyone can go into the court system and see the licence that was granted to them in September that, again, they had to withdraw.  However, there is no record anywhere in the District Court of the licence that was granted for their super-draw for June.  It does not exist.  We are only taking the word of Fianna F&aacute;il that they had a licence.<\/p><p>Why is that significant?  Fianna F&aacute;il can clear this up straightaway by publishing the licence and the application, first, to clarify that they had a licence.  Then, if they are to comply with the legislation, which means the money has to go to charity, the only way they can comply with section 28A of the Gaming and Lotteries Act is by giving that money to charity.  Why is it significant if they did not have a licence or this licence is not to be found?  All of the licences are there in the Dublin Circuit Court but this Fianna F&aacute;il one is not there.  When people went to the court, they could not find it.  It is not online, it is not physical, it is nowhere to be got.  Why is it significant?  It is because, as was mentioned earlier, members of that political party had their own page on the website promoting this draw.  It is quite significant because section 26 of the Act states:<\/p> <blockquote> \t(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, a person shall not promote a lottery unless he or she is, or is the employee or agent acting as such of, a person who is the holder of a lottery permit or a lottery licence that is for the time being in force and the lottery is conducted in accordance with the permit or licence.<br \/><br \/>(2) A person who contravenes this section shall be guilty of an offence. <\/blockquote>  <p>What does that mean?  It means that as bad as it was that Fianna F&aacute;il raised &euro;500,000 illegally, they need to do something with that money.  It is not going to be brushed under the carpet because this is a massive scandal.  <\/p> <p>If members of the party, maybe unknowingly, were promoting that draw and it was a draw without a licence, they were also committing an offence.  This is extremely significant.  The Minister of State may get to his feet again and say the core of this legislation is about transparency and that it is about this and that.  We accept that.  We are supporting this legislation and we supported the Government amendments but this is different.  As I said, Fine Gael raised &euro;1 million on a lottery permit.  It did not go for a lottery licence.  This only benefits one political party.  In a way, it gives a semblance that what happened last year, which was of such significance, was somehow okay because we are going to make it legal in the future.  If the Minister of State believes he can sit there and accept that a political party in this State, now that he knows all the facts, raised more than &euro;500,000 that will be spent on influencing the electoral process and trying to put its own party ahead, then that is fine if that is his view and that of the Green Party.  However, he should not stand here and tell me this Bill is about transparency and accountability.  Where is the accountability in terms of what has happened?  Has the Minister of State even raised it with Fianna F&aacute;il?  Who came to the Minister of State and asked for this amendment?  We all know.  Will the Minister of State tell us?  I will give way under Standing Orders if he wants to tell us who asked for this amendment because it was not Sinn F&eacute;in and I am sure it was not the other parties here.  If this happened in other jurisdictions, we would be talking about it but this is happening right here, right now.<\/p> <p> It is unfortunate for the Minister of State that his coalition colleagues are involved in this.  I spoke earlier about the shoe being on the other foot.  Deputy McAuliffe said what it is doing is legal and that we might not accept but that it is playing by the rules, whatever rules exist.  However, what happened here with Fianna F&aacute;il was downright illegal.  It was so illegal that the Supreme Court told it so in the 1990s when it tried it at that time.  However, it proceeded to do it in 2011 and it got away with it.  It tried it again but Chay Bowes stood in its way and it took immediate and drastic action.  Within 24 hours of that letter being issued, it cancelled the draw, pushed the button and sent cheques out to everybody because it knew it was illegal.  It was caught out.  The leader of that party is our Taoiseach.  He is the trustee of the party and there are massive questions.  <\/p> <p> In terms of whether the Minister of State thinks it is okay for political parties to raise money illegally, there is no problem with any political party raising money legally, within the donation limits and under the lotteries and gaming legislation, but when political parties raise it illegally, it is a different matter.  It is over to the Minister of State and to Fianna F&aacute;il, but this issue is not going away because it is of such significance that accountability has to happen.  If the Minister of State is bringing forward legislation which is about transparency and accountability, he should first bring accountability and transparency to what happened last year before trying to bring in an amendment which is about covering up the stroke and the nature of what happened last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500061#QQQ00200","speaker":"1462","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655315520,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was not here for the portion of the debate to which I am going to refer.

I will be guided by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, because as a new Member of the House I am unfamiliar as to what happens in these circumstances, but I am deeply uncomfortable with the contribution of Deputy &Oacute; Broin who said there were question marks over me.  He alluded that I had benefited in some way financially from activities that were inappropriate.  As a Member, I do not know how to respond to that because if I do that in this forum, we will get into a debate about everybody's SIPO returns.  I am quite happy to comment on my SIPO in an appropriate forum.  However, my worry is that my good name has been taken by Deputy &Oacute; Broin and I wish to have that dealt with in a fair way in the Chamber.  I do not know the procedure, so I am asking the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Given that we are debating amendments, if she rules me out of order I will accept that but, as a new Member, a very significant charge has been put before me in the House that is deeply unfair-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500062#RRR00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1655315520,"counter":575,"content":"<p>The Ceann Comhairle dealt with it, in fairness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500062#RRR00300","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1655315520,"counter":576,"content":"<p>I would benefit from the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's advice as to how to ensure my good name is not damaged in the way Deputy &Oacute; Broin did.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500062#RRR00400","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1655315520,"counter":577,"content":"<p>I was not in the Chair.

The charge was put that this amendment was being brought forward in order to facilitate Fianna F&aacute;il to hold a draw which the party could not do in the autumn of last year.  He did not dispute that and did not suggest there was another reason for bringing forward that amendment.  I take it the agreed position of this House is that this amendment has been brought forward at the behest of one political party in order to make legal what was previously illegal.<\/p> <p>The result of the party's illegal activities in that regard was that the party made somewhere in the region of &euro;500,000 last year.<\/p> <p> It is legitimate to say that any person who benefited from that illegal activity has questions to answer.  Whether they knowing were aware that this was illegal or not, that is not the way the law acts.<\/p> <p> Quite a number of specific questions were put to the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, ranging from the simple, such as where did this come from and who asked him, to why did this come in at this point in time.  Why was it brought to Cabinet on 24 May?  Why was it subsequently only made public after the committee had finished its deliberations?  Why, at essentially the final Stage of what was good and agreed legislation, was this brought in?  As I say, the Minister of State did not answer that question and we can only take it that the charge was put.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State was asked whether he stands over this because what happened was a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister approached him, instructed him or whatever the case may be to bring forward and stand over this amendment and legislation from his Department.  There are amendments, as I understand it, amendments Nos. 2 and 101, that are being brought forward specifically to financially benefit that Minister's political party.<\/p> <p> Deputy Noonan is the Minister of State who is here representing the Government tonight.  As a representative of the Government, the Minister of State has an opportunity to do the honourable thing.  In my view, the only honourable thing the Government can do tonight, considering the questions that have been raised and those that have not been answered, is to withdraw the relevant amendment in respect of that.  If the Minister of State does that, we will have unanimous agreement to this Bill.  The Minister of State can then bring forward legislation on political party financing in which he can address whatever anomalies different parties may have, because there are anomalies in political financing that possibly all political parties will have come across and would like to see addressed.  We do not have the option of the Minister to put forward an amendment at the last minute and get the nod of all three parties at Cabinet to bring forward an amendment.  Apparently, it was a nod that they signed off on.  Every member of Cabinet signed off on this without even seeing the final text on it but that is neither here nor there.<\/p> <p> The honourable thing tonight is for the Minister of State to withdraw this amendment.  I do not see how the Minister of State can have any credibility if he does not do that considering the serious challenge and question that has been put in respect of what was the illegal financing of a political party that involved the misleading of courts and the contravention of the law as it currently stands.<\/p> <p> The attempt by that same political party to use its political office to change the law to make legal what was previously illegal and in which it was involved in legal is scandalous; there is no other word for it. That is Charlie Haughey-era stuff at its most evident.  The Minister of State is part of the Government that is attempting to pull that stroke.  My question is whether the Minister of State will do the honourable thing and withdraw this amendment because there is no other course.  There is no other way that the Minister of State can justify his actions personally and those of his party, in terms of its position at Cabinet, if he stands over this amendment being forced through the House tonight and using the Government's majority to force it through when he knows that the only reason it is being done is to allow Fianna F&aacute;il to provide some political cover to what was its illegal financial acts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500062#RRR04700","speaker":"1451","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1655316120,"counter":622,"content":"<p>As nobody is offering, I call the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500063#SSS00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1655316120,"counter":623,"content":"<p>I have no comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500063#SSS00300","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1655316120,"counter":624,"content":"<p>No comment?

It is also uncomfortable for how we deal with democracy and how political parties are raising funds.  The rules should apply equally to everybody.  The same rules apply everywhere - we will play by those rules in this jurisdictions and other jurisdictions where we are in - but the fact is that Fianna F&aacute;il broke those rules.  No other political party in this House did so because it was illegal.  It is unlawful.<\/p>  <p>  This amendment is being rushed through.  This is at the core of it.  There is no way we can discuss this amendment without dealing with the Fianna F&aacute;il issue because the rationale for this amendment is Fianna F&aacute;il's unlawful raising of over &euro;500,000.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State satisfy himself as to how he is being used as a Minister of State?  Will he tell this House where this amendment came from and the background to it?  Will the Minister of State publish the communications and the correspondence?  Will the Minister of State assure himself that Fianna F&aacute;il had a licence in April for its June draw?  Will the Minister of State satisfy himself about the conditions, particularly condition 10(f), which states that that money has to go to charity?  It will probably be reported next month in its SIPO annual accounts signed by the party's trustee, the Taoiseach, that it is in the party coffers and that it did not go to charity.  Will the Minister of State do any of that or will he merely tell us, \"See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil?\"  Deputy Noonan is the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500063#SSS01400","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"vote","time":1655316720,"counter":635,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 65; N\u00edl, 51; Staon, 0.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Jack Chambers and Brendan Griffin; N\u00edl, Deputies P\u00e1draig Mac Lochlainn and Denise Mitchell.<\/p><p>Amendment declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500064#TTT00100","aye":["1573","1618","1549","1523","1595","1503","1611","1602","1483","1517","1475","1570","1591","1454","1519","1481","1601","1623","1574","1584","1562","1597","1590","1581","1624","1552","1586","1566","1450","1619","1572","1583","1594","1472","1471","1626","1568","1546","1502","1459","1496","1548","1455","1511","1578","1512","1563","1553","1492","1593","1494","1477","1545","1521","1617","1575","1510","1484","1473","1500","1556","1557","1479","1515","1474"],"nay":["1555","1698","1625","1613","1452","1482","1451","1495","1461","1585","1571","1615","1462","1476","1470","1579","1600","1449","1560","1453","1506","1580","1487","1620","1607","1604","1463","1612","1464","1497","1489","1621","1599","1592","1550","1499","1467","1507","1468","1460","1498","1551","1485","1588","1514","1486","1564","1491","1513","1469","1627"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655316720,"counter":636,"content":"<p>Bill reported with amendment.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655317320,"counter":637,"content":"<p>The time permitted for this debate having expired, I am required to put the following question in accordance with an order of the D&aacute;il of 14 June 2022: \"That the amendments set down by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and not disposed of are hereby made to the Bill, Fourth Stage is hereby completed and the Bill is hereby passed.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500065#UUU00100","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655317320,"counter":638,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs School Places: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]","time":1655317320,"counter":639,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022061500065#UUU00300"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655317320,"counter":640,"content":"<p>The following motion was moved by Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire on Tuesday, 14 June 2022:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1655317320,"counter":641,"content":"<p>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:<\/p><p>- (Minister for Education)<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1655317320,"counter":642,"content":"<p>I must now deal with a postponed division relating to the motion regarding special educational needs school places.
