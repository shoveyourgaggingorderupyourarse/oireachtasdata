It provides that where a flight is cancelled then the air carrier must offer the passenger the choice of re-routing as soon as possible after the original departure time, re-routing at a later date or a refund of the cost of the unused flight ticket. The regulation provides that the refund must be paid within seven days of the cancellation. The passenger  may also be entitled to compensation under certain conditions unless the air carrier can prove the cancellation was caused by extraordinary circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  If the passenger chooses to be re-routed as soon as possible then the airline must provide the passenger with care and assistance while they wait for the alternative flight. Care and assistance comprises of:<\/p>  <p>  - meals and refreshments in reasonable relation to the waiting time;<\/p>  <p>  - hotel accommodation where an overnight stay becomes necessary;<\/p>  <p>  - transport between the hotel accommodation and the airport;<\/p>  <p>  - two free telephone calls\/access to email.<\/p>  <p>  If the passengers airline does not provide the care and assistance described above, passengers should make their own reasonable arrangements and retain all receipts in the process.

The pre-pandemic target of having a national average wait of ten weeks was once again achieved by the end of 2021.

The expense should apply to all employees in that category and not be discretionary. Revenue has advised me that it will consider FRE applications where a large number of employees incur broadly identical qualifying expenses which are not reimbursed by their employer. <\/p>  <p>  Applications are generally made by the representative bodies in the employment sectors concerned and are considered by Revenue based on the specific commonality of expenses within the employment category and compliance with the strictly applied statutory requirement for a tax deduction.  <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that Veterinary Nurses have an existing FRE valued at &euro;400 where the individual supplies and launders their work uniforms and &euro;150 where the work uniforms are supplied by their employer and the individual incurs only laundry costs. This current FRE for veterinary nurses does not incorporate the yearly statutory registration fee with The Veterinary Council of Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  In recent years Revenue conducted a comprehensive review of the administratively based FRE regime which involved engagement with relevant representative bodies, to ensure that the expenses granted to each employment category remain justified and appropriate to modern day. Each category of FRE allowance was examined separately in the light of the legislative requirements of section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997, which as stated above,  provides that expenses are tax deductible only if they are wholly, exclusively, and necessarily incurred by the employee in the performance of the duties of his or her employment and are not reimbursed by the employer.   <\/p>  <p>  I understand that, on foot of the comprehensive review carried out of the FRE rates, Revenue advised the representative body for veterinary nurses that, in their case, it is intended that the statutory registration fee will be included as part of an updated FRE rate when implemented.  Revenue advises me that it remains committed to the FRE regime and encourages all taxpayers to avail of their full tax relief entitlements.  <\/p>  <p>  Pending the implementation of the revised FRE rates, as for all employees, veterinary nurses retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the TCA 1997 in respect of an expense incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment, to the extent to which the expenses are not reimbursed by the employer or not already included in the relevant FRE amount. <\/p>  <p>  The quickest and easiest way to claim tax relief for qualifying employment expenses (including any FRE) is to complete an online Income Tax Return.

The unique characteristics and bespoke nature of many cloud services, such as data protection requirements and the commercial models, are such that the establishment of a central arrangement will not alleviate the need for PSBs to procure cloud services on an individual basis. <\/p>  <p>  Cloud services is a generic term and encompasses a broad range of services (e.g. a service category such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), discrete services such as video conferencing or specialist services such as payroll services) and deployment models (public\/ private\/ hybrid). Each type of cloud service presents specific challenges in relation to contractual terms and conditions and commercial models depending on the nature and attributes of the service. Thus the reference to a single cloud services procurement framework is overly simplistic as it implies that a single solution can unlock all of the benefits of cloud while failing to recognise the complexity of the cloud services market.

Over 13,000 projects, including many football developments, have now benefited from funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to over &euro;1.15 billion.   The Programme for Government commits to continuing the SCEP and to prioritising the investment in disadvantaged areas.<\/p>  <p>  The 2020 round of the SCEP closed for applications on Monday 1 March 2021 and by the deadline a record 3,106 applications were submitted. The final allocations under this latest round were announced in May of this year and the total allocation of over &euro;166 million represented the highest level of allocation ever made under the SCEP.  <\/p>  <p>  The priority in the short term is to advance the successful applications under the 2020 round to \"formal approval\" and grant drawdown stage which requires detailed engagement with all grantees. My Department is now undertaking a full review of all aspects of the 2020 round of the SCEP and any recommendations arising will be reflected in the terms and conditions of the next round.  Following the completion of the review, I will announce the exact timing of the next round but it is hoped to have it open for applications early in the new year.<\/p>  <p>  Funding is also provided by my Department for sports facilities under the Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF), designed for projects where the grant sought is greater than the maximum available under the SCEP.

When finalised, the SCSG&rsquo;s will supersede current Section 28 ministerial guidelines for planning authorities on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas (the &lsquo;Sustainable Residential Development Guidelines&rsquo;) last issued in 2009. The SCSG will also supplement other relevant Guidelines such as the Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments Guidelines for Planning Authorities and the Urban Development and Building Heights Guidelines for Planning Authorities.  <\/p>  <p>  A preliminary draft of the Guidelines has been prepared. However, recent legal judgements in relation to Strategic Housing Development decisions have had implications for the preliminary draft and the draft is being further reviewed as a result. A working group was also convened with representation from the construction industry, private built environment practitioners, professional bodies and the public sector. The group, via a series of three workshops in June, August and September 2022 discussed key issues in relation to density and viability, land use and transportation and place-making and quality design. This also included discussions related to the design and application of compact &lsquo;own door&rsquo; housing typologies both internationally and within Ireland.  <\/p>  <p>  Following completion, the Draft Guidelines will be placed on display for a focused period of public consultation. This is targeted for Q4 2022. All interested parties will have an opportunity to make submissions on the guidelines at that stage. Submissions made during the public consultation period will be reviewed and where appropriate and necessary, amendments will be made to the published Draft.

The School Inclusion Model (SIM) is based on policy advice from the National Council for Special Education, based on the principle of providing the right support at the right time, delivered by a range of personnel with relevant qualifications and skill-sets.  Its purpose is to help students achieve better outcomes.  Independent evaluation is a central part of the project and the outcome will inform future policy on the potential to extend SIM to other schools.  <\/p><p>The project includes a number of elements:<\/p><p>- Availability of therapists (speech and language, occupational) to schools to build teacher capacity<\/p><p>- Allocation of SNAs on a front-loaded basis<\/p><p>- Additional professional supports for the school including psychology, behavioural and professional development<\/p><p>- Training of SNAs<\/p><p>In February 2019, the Government approved the trialling of the Model for the 2019\/20 school year. Initially designed as a one year pilot involving up to 75 participating schools in the CHO 7 region, it was interrupted by Covid-19 with the closure of schools and the diversion of HSE therapists from the project to Covid related work. It was then extended to the 2020\/21 school year which was also interrupted by Covid.  Progress has been made on aspects of the Model but much remains to be done in terms of in-school implementation and evaluation.  The Pilot recommenced in November 2021 in CHO7. <\/p><p>There are a number of challenges and barriers to continuing the roll-out of SIM in CH07 and expanding SIM to other areas at this time. The single biggest challenge is the availability of therapists.  While the Department&rsquo;s initial intention was to expand SIM to other areas, pressures relating to workforce supply (therapists and psychologists) have resulted in SIM being limited to one CHO area.

This will enable more childminders to access Government subsidies, making their services more affordable to parents. It will also enable them to access a variety of supports to assist them in meeting regulatory and quality requirements. In achieving this overall objective, the Action Plan will contribute to the aims of supporting parental choice, and increasing access to affordable early learning and care and school-age childcare places. It will help support labour market participation for parents, and offer more flexibility for parents who work irregular hours.

Its primary purpose is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and improve affordability for parents as well as ensuring a stable income to providers.  <\/p><p>Core Funding is designed specifically as a funding stream related to the costs of delivery. Core Funding is based on operating hours, number of places offered by services, and the age group of children for whom the places are offered, given the staffing requirements determined by the regulatory ratios for different care categories. It follows that services opening for longer hours or offering more places will receive a higher value of Core Funding than other services. This is because their costs of operation are higher.  <\/p><p>For example, ECCE is 15 hours per week over 38 weeks of the year. This amounts to 570 hours per year and is equivalent to 23% of the annual hours of a full day service operating from 8am to 6pm for 50 weeks of the year. ECCE ratio requirements are 11 children to one adult. Services offering places for 1-2 year olds can have a maximum of 5 children to one adult.  ECCE therefore has less than half the hourly staffing requirement of a service for 1-2 year olds.<\/p><p>Core Funding allows for an estimated 19% increase in the total cost base for the sector. The vast majority of services will see substantial increases in funding. No service will see a decrease in funding. For any service that does experience financial difficulties, a Sustainability Fund will be put in place. This new strand of the Sustainability Fund, linked to Core Funding, will be designed to provide an extra safety net for providers.  This will be open to both private and community providers. <\/p><p>Together for Better, the new funding model being implemented, aims to transform the sector with a higher degree of public investment and public management. This transformation starts with Core Funding and the new approach will entail a shift in the relationship between the State and providers in relation to delivering ELC and SAC, with new responsibilities on both sides.  <\/p><p>Core Funding is open to all registered providers subject to their agreement to the terms and conditions of the funding, including financial transparency and fee management. Some providers take the view that the autonomy of their business is of greater value to them than committing to offering services under the conditions and investment levels on offer through Core Funding, ECCE and NCS.<\/p><p>Participation in Core Funding is, of course, optional. Of the 90% participation country wide, this currently ranges from 82% uptake in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown.  148 services Partner Services in Dun Laoghaire  have joined the scheme and the remaining 30 may choose to do so at a later point.

I will continue to work closely with my colleague Minister McEntee and other ministers; to ensure a coordinated approach that will deliver on the intent of the new strategy to create a culture of zero tolerance to any form of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100073#WRG02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Education","counter":308,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100073#WRG02600"},{"type":"question","counter":309,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[46115\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100073#WRG02700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the work he and his Department are undertaking, if any, to ensure all students have fair and equitable online access to further and higher education in light of the ongoing student accommodation crisis; if he agrees that high-level institutions must be proactive and flexible in providing online and remote opportunities to students where possible in view of the fact that the difficulties students have in securing appropriate accommodation; his plans, if any, to issue updated guidance to higher level institutions regarding remote learning; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":310,"content":"<p>Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are autonomous institutions within the meaning of the Universities Act 1997, the Institutions of Technology Acts 1992 to 2006 and the Technological Universities Act 2018. Under this legislation the institutions are academically independent and are entitled to regulate their own academic affairs and administrative processes, including the mode of delivery of programmes of study. HEIs have taken significant steps to ensure that teaching and learning is enhanced by the integrated use of digital technologies, both on-campus and remotely.<\/p><p>Many HEIs are and will be developing new blended learning programmes for validation. Such programmes need to be designed, delivered and assessed within an approved quality assurance framework developed by HEIs with reference to the Statutory Quality Assurance Guidelines for Providers of Blended Learning Programmes. <\/p><p>Programmes that are delivered partially or fully online, need to be developed with that mode of delivery in mind rather than merely being translated or transferred from the original face-to-face programme model.<\/p><p>In 2021, key stakeholders from across the higher education sector worked collaboratively to reflect on the sudden move to online\/remote learning in higher education, gather related evidence and to agree a way forward post-pandemic. Partners included the National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning, QQI, USI, representative bodies of HEIs, and others. The resulting report, &lsquo;Next Steps for Teaching and Learning: Moving Forward Together&rsquo; was launched in November 2021. The report includes recommendations for the sector with regard to blended\/remote teaching and learning and the use of technology to ensure that higher education is as flexible, resilient and equitable as possible for all who learn, all who teach, all who support and lead, and our wider communities.<\/p><p>In June 2022, the HEA announced &euro;37.62m in funding for the &lsquo;National Technological University Transformation for Recovery and Resilience' (NTUTORR) programme. The programme was informed by the Next Steps report and this funding will enable the technological sector to systematise the learnings from the experience of digitally enabled education and support the provision of digitally enhanced teaching, learning and assessment to meet the needs of staff, students, and enterprise in the regions.<\/p><p>The fourth National Access Plan, 2022 to 2028, which launched last month, places an emphasis on student- centred goals, including flexibility. It aims to support students to study on a flexible basis including part-time and blended learning, and identify connectivity supports for remote learning. This is a seven-year plan with an additional dedicated investment of &euro;35 million over the course of the plan. <\/p><p>Regarding student accommodation I am conscious that some students are struggling to find affordable accommodation but fundamentally the challenge is one of supply of housing supply more generally. As a country, we know that we need to dramatically increase the supply of all types of housing and accommodation, including student accommodation. That is why the Government launched Housing for All, led by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage setting out a series of actions which will be delivered to address the housing crisis. The plan is backed by the largest housing budget in the history of the State to transform our housing system, in excess of &euro;20 billion. <\/p><p>Since taking up office, both my Department officials and I have engaged and continue to engage on as ongoing basis with the Minister and Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the wider higher education sector and relevant stakeholders on student accommodation issues including within the context of the advancement of the Government's Housing for All policy.<\/p><p>Specifically, in June this year I met with the presidents and chairs of all the traditional universities and technological universities to discuss any immediate proposals they may have identified or be able to identify in relation to any additional student accommodation provision that may be pursued in the short to medium terms and the Department is continuing to liaise with the higher education institutions in this regard. In a welcome development hundreds of additional bed spaces have been made available by higher education institutions this academic year and an additional 674 beds at the University of Galway are due to open later next year.<\/p><p>I am also pursuing a new policy on student accommodation. For the first time, this policy would see the State assist with the cost of building student accommodation beds in return for affordable rents for students. Progressing this policy was agreed at the Cabinet Committee on Housing in July and detailed work is currently being advanced with a section dedicated to student accommodation having been established in my Department. Department Officials have met with the HEA and further meetings are taking place with representative bodies and stakeholders this week as well as with individual Higher Education Institutes with a view to developing pathways to accommodation and accelerating their delivery. Meetings with students and stakeholders are also being arranged.  My Department is also ready to work with any of the new technological universities to support them to borrow to build student accommodation.<\/p><p>On rent affordability, restrictions have also been put in place to limit the amount that students can be required to pay up-front for their accommodation, ending the practice whereby students were required to pay a lump sum up-front each term. The total amount that anyone is required to pay to a landlord by way of a deposit or an advance rent payment to secure a tenancy is now no more than the equivalent of 2 months&rsquo; rent &ndash; that is one month&rsquo;s rent, and one month&rsquo;s deposit.<\/p><p>Student accommodation is subject to rent pressure zone caps and students now have recourse to the Residential Tenancies Board for dispute resolution. In addition to the extra accommodation which is being put in place this year, amounting to hundreds of beds, I am encouraging homeowners to consider renting out a room in their house for students. A homeowner can rent a room, retain their social welfare entitlements where applicable and earn up to &euro;14,000 in rental income before having to pay tax.<\/p><p>All higher education institutions continue to support their students to find accommodation in the private rental sector through, for example, the encouragement of room rental or &lsquo;student digs&rsquo; in family homes and many also maintain online databases where students can search for and check out accommodation, advertisements for room rentals can be placed and advice on sample rental agreements provided. Institutions are actively promoting this option in their localities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100073#WRG02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Technological Universities","counter":311,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100073#WRG02900"},{"type":"question","counter":312,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[46171\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100073#WRG03000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the dates on which each of the five stages that he referenced with respect to the administrative process in a higher-education policy debate concerning the aspiration to expand the footprint of South East Technological University Waterford in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 14 September 2022, were met with respect to the past 10 such projects that have completed all stages in his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1616","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":313,"content":"<p>All capital projects advanced by publicly funded Higher Education Institutions must comply with the provisions of the Public Spending Code, while site acquisitions must also be conducted in accordance with relevant guidance from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  <\/p>  <p>  There can be considerable variation in the time it takes to move a property acquisition through the approval stages, taking account of complexity, cost, valuation, identified risks and other site-specific issues and developments.<\/p>  <p>  Since the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science was established in 2020, there has been one site acquisition completed in the technological sector.

The paper &ldquo;Funding the Future, an annual options paper on reducing the cost of higher education can be found here: www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/28c9d-funding-the-future-an-annual-options-paper-on-reducing-the-cost-of-higher-education\/<\/p>  <p>  This paper is further step in deepening my commitment to the progressive consideration and implementation of measures to address costs as a barrier to education, within the overall context of Government policy towards costs of living and other relevant strategies including those related to access and participation in education.  <\/p>  <p>  I have already taken a number of significant steps in this regard, including major changes to the SUSI student support scheme and the elimination of participation fees for PLC courses from this September.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, fee levels vary across the institutions, disciplines and mode of delivery. Publicly funded Higher Education Institutions are autonomous bodies and are responsible for their own day-to-day management and operational affairs, including the management of academic affairs. They retain the right to determine their own policies and procedures. The level of registration fees and tuition fees to be charged are therefore a matter for the relevant institution to determine in line with its own criteria.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Department&rsquo;s Free Fees Initiative (FFI), the Exchequer provides funding toward the tuition fee costs of eligible undergraduate higher education students. All students eligible for the scheme receive state support whereby the Exchequer pays the cost of tuition fees exclusive of the student contribution.  Any proposal to amend EU undergraduate tuition fees rates of eligible courses and charged to eligible students would have a budgetary impact on the exchequer and any change would require prior agreement between the sector, HEA, my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. In this regard the last agreed amendment was in 2008\/2009.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to highlight the very substantial financial support provided for students by Government.  This is currently well in excess of half a billion euro, provided by the taxpayer towards tuition fees and the student contribution for students in higher education. This includes State funding of tuition costs amounting to &euro;357m per annum for 146,000 eligible higher education students and &euro;190m paid by the Exchequer under the Student Grant Scheme in respect of all or some of the &euro;3,000 student contribution which benefits over 65,000 eligible students. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that the overall funding provided by the student contribution, which is shared between the students and families and the State, is a significant element of the income of our higher education institutions. The student contribution rate therefore requires consideration not just in the context of costs of education for families but also in terms of implications for the sustainable model of funding higher education.<\/p>  <p>  I have, however, been clear and consistent in stating that I believe the value of the student contribution share, as paid by students and families compared to the states contribution, is too high and that a priority for me in the forthcoming Estimates process will be to seek a reduction for student and families with an increase in the funding provided by the state, particularly in the context of the cost of living challenges being experienced by families. <\/p>  <p>  My policy position in this regard was articulated in Funding our Future, the Government's policy response to the Cassells and DG Reform Reviews on the future funding of higher education.  Sustainable funding for the sector and measures to address the cost of education must proceed in tandem if we are to meet our ambition of improved outcomes for learners and the system as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  As I look towards the next budgetary cycle, I will be examining all the levers I have to address the cost of education in a way that has impact for students and families and that applies broadly and fairly across society.

These include young people; migrants; gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men; sex workers; people living with addiction issues and people living with HIV. Since 2017, the number of organisations ordering from the NCDS has doubled. <\/p><p>The service was extended to 3rd level institutions in late 2019.

The information leaflets direct students to HSE - led and HSE-funded websites for further information about sexual health and well-being; www.sexualwellbeing.ie and www.man2man.ie.<\/p><p>Since its establishment, the NCDS has distributed 2.6 million condoms and 1.5 million lubricant sachets. <\/p><p>The 2021 NCDS Report was published recently, highlights include the following:<\/p><p>70 organisations ordered over 439,400 condoms.

The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) has been liaising with stakeholders, including the Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU), on efforts being taken within the sector to understand and address the issue <\/p>  <p>  You raise a number of concerns in your question and I will address these holistically in the context of detailing specific actions being carried out by a number of stakeholders to try and mitigate current concerns in the sector. The issues raised are symptomatic of a complex problem with many contributing factors and multiple stakeholders. Workforce challenges are being experienced in other sectors nationally, and in the pharmacy sector in a range of other countries.  This re-enforces the need for robust data for Ireland to be best able to determine the current landscape, assess future health system needs and understand existing sectoral challenges now and into the future.<\/p>  <p>  In February 2022, PSI met with a number of superintendent pharmacists and the IPU. The PSI also circulated a survey on behalf of the IPU to all registrants to support efforts to understand and address the issue in the short term. The fieldwork on the research was undertaken online by the IPU between 22 March and 8 April 2022. The results of which have just been finalised and recommendations have been prepared by the IPU based on their findings.  The report is currently under review by the Department of Health who will continue to liaise with relevant stakeholders on this matter. <\/p>  <p>  In developing its Corporate Strategy 2021-2023, the PSI was aware, through its role as the pharmacy regulator as well as through reports from stakeholders, of an increasing risk to the continued availability of a pharmacist workforce. This highlighted a need to focus on community and hospital pharmacy, with a concern being that the issue might be exacerbated into the future. The PSI are currently undertaking a project, due to run across 2022-&rsquo;23,  titled &lsquo;Emerging Risks to the Future Pharmacy Workforce&rsquo;. This project is set to &ldquo;assess emerging risks to the continued availability of a professional pharmacy workforce within community and hospital pharmacy in Ireland&rdquo;. <\/p>  <p>  As part of this project, PSI have committed to share any relevant data emerging with relevant Government departments particularly if trends are identified that indicate a future deficit. The PSI has also committed in its Service Plan 2022 to complete a review of the Third Country Qualification Route (TCQR) and propose changes to the Council. <\/p>  <p>  The European Commission is also currently supporting a health and social care workforce planning strategy and action plan, a health and social care workforce planning model, health and social care workforce projections and gap analysis project. Support includes recommendations for health and social care workforce reforms.<\/p>  <p>  It will be on the basis of gathering and analysing up-to-date, robust and relevant data, that recommendations can be proposed to address Ireland&rsquo;s needs for a pharmacist workforce in the future, as Ireland&rsquo;s healthcare system evolves, and in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare implementation.

As you will be aware the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) is the statutory agency who maintains the Registers of Pharmacist and Pharmacies. As of the 19 September 2022, there are 1,981 pharmacies registered with the PSI, and of this number, there are currently 133 pharmacies that have vacancies for supervising pharmacists, or 6.7% of all registered pharmacies. <\/p><p>All such pharmacies are involved in a recruitment process to fill the vacancies that have arisen. The PSI monitors the situation and vacancies on an ongoing basis. It is also worth pointing out that from a patient safety perspective, a pharmacy may only be open if there is a registered pharmacist present on the premises at that time.<\/p><p>The requirement for all pharmacies to nominate a &lsquo;supervising pharmacist&rsquo; is provided for in section 28(b) of the Pharmacy Act 2007. This section requires that where the business is carried on by a corporate body &ldquo;(<i>b<\/i>) that, at the premises where the business is carried on or, if there are two or more of those premises, at each of them, there is a registered pharmacist who has a 3 years minimum post-registration experience in whole-time charge of the carrying on of the business there.&rsquo; This registered pharmacist is referred to as the supervising pharmacist. All pharmacies are also required to have in place a &lsquo;superintendent pharmacist&rsquo;, who must also have three years of post-registration experience.<\/p><p>While PSI is not involved in the recruitment of pharmacists, as the pharmacy regulator, they are examining the topic of the pharmacist workforce so that pharmacy can play a full role in the development of an integrated healthcare system.  They are aware through their work and through reports from stakeholders, of an increasing risk to the continued availability of a pharmacist workforce, with the concern being that the issue may be exacerbated into the future. In response, the PSI is undertaking a project, due to run across 2022-&rsquo;23, &lsquo;Emerging Risks to the Future Pharmacy Workforce&rsquo;. In 2022, this project is set to assess emerging risks to the continued availability of a professional pharmacy workforce within community and hospital pharmacy in Ireland. <\/p><p>This is a complex problem with many contributing factors and multiple stakeholders. Workforce challenges are being experienced in other sectors nationally, and in the pharmacy sector in a range of other countries.  However, robust data for Ireland are needed to be able to determine the current landscape, assess future health system needs and understand existing sectoral challenges now and into the future.  It will be on the basis of gathering and analysing this up-to-date, robust and relevant data, that recommendations can be proposed to address Ireland&rsquo;s needs for a pharmacist workforce in the future, as Ireland&rsquo;s healthcare system evolves, and in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare implementation.<\/p><p>While the PSI strategic project referenced above will be important to understand the emerging risks, and support workforce planning and pharmacist availability into the future, it is apparent that there is a current acute workforce issue, particularly in relation to community pharmacy. Reports to the PSI indicate that this is being driven in part by an increasing number of pharmacists choosing to work in a locum capacity.  This has a knock-on impact on pharmacist vacancies, and potentially on continuity and consistency of service. ?While this is an acute issue, and separate to their strategic workforce project, they have been liaising with other stakeholders, including the Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU), on efforts being taken within the sector to understand and address this current problem. In June of this year, pharmacists were added to the Critical Skills Occupations List by the Minister of State for Business Employment and Retail.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100075#WRJ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":382,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100075#WRJ00800"},{"type":"question","counter":383,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[46175\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100075#WRJ00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reasons for the planned closure of all clinical sexual health services in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, and in Louth County Hospital, Dundalk; the expected closure dates; his plans for sexual health services in the north east once these services close; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":384,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100075#WRJ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1608"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":385,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100075#WRJ01100"},{"type":"question","counter":386,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[46178\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100075#WRJ01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of claims that have been taken against the State in respect of Covid-19 that the State Claims Agency is processing as of 15 September 2022; the number of claims accepted; and the number rejected and or not accepted as valid.","asker":"1489","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":387,"content":"<p>The State Claims Agency (SCA) has a statutory remit to manage personal injury claims on behalf of Delegated State Authorities including the Health Service Executive.

My Department supports the development of the biomass sector by providing a range of supports for the growing of biomass supply and wood mobilisation.<\/p>  <p>  The Afforestation Scheme 2014-2020 provides financial support to encourage the planting of trees on land and in turn supports the provision of biomass for energy production. The Woodland Improvement Scheme provides financial support to forest owners to encourage the generation of woody biomass by supporting the thinning of broad-leaved forests, including supports for continuous cover forestry. <\/p>  <p>  The Forest Road Scheme also provides grants to help cover the cost of building forest roads and facilitates land owners mobilising forest biomass to markets.<\/p>  <p>  The current forestry programme has encouraged a significant number of land owners to plant forests and Ireland now has over 23,500 different forest owners, all of whom are now invested in the future of our forest industry. As a result of increased private forest ownership, the national forest estate is set to become an increasing source of wood over the next 20 years. The annual potential supply of wood fibre for energy in Ireland is predicted to increase from 0.89 million cubic metres in 2021 to over 2 million cubic metres between 2031 and 2035. <\/p>  <p>   An estimated total of just under 35 million cubic metres of wood fibre will be available out to the year 2040. As a result, forests and forest biomass will play an increasingly important role in both adaptation and mitigation to the impacts of climate change in the years ahead. A new Forestry Programme will launch in 2023 focusing on the importance of forests for climate change, including wood biomass for energy.<\/p>  <p>  My Department also provides financial assistance to the Wood Fuel Quality Assurance Scheme which is an all-island scheme established to increase consumer confidence in wood fuel products sold in Ireland. Forest owners and forestry contractors, through sustainable forest management practices, produce renewable fuels such as firewood, wood chip, wood pellets, and wood briquettes. These fuels are certified to ISO and EU standards through the scheme. As the Wood Fuel Quality Assurance Scheme continues to grow, members will provide consumers with a greater degree of confidence in providing  quality certified wood fuel products available in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  My Department ensures that harvested areas are managed sustainably, and environmental requirements apply. Harvested products such as wood fuels and solid biomass provide low cost, continuous, high temperature heat at small, medium and large scales. The production of such indigenous biomass has a crucial role to play in helping Ireland meet renewable energy targets through fossil fuel substitution to generate heat and electricity. <\/p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan 2021 acknowledges the need for the solid biomass resource capacity to double in the next decade, and the need to support the mobilisation of timber for utilisation in the processing and biomass sector. DAFM will continue to encourage policies, steps and measures to increase the use of wood and wood products in climate change mitigation and adaptation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100077#WRL01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Common Agricultural Policy","counter":482,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100077#WRL01700"},{"type":"question","counter":483,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[46181\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100077#WRL01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the commitments that he has secured or obtained in the review of the CAP regarding fishers and the fishing process industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1621","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":484,"content":"<p>The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) Regulation (Regulation EU 380\/2013) provides that the European Commission will report to the European Parliament and the Council on the functioning of the CFP by the end of 2022. <\/p>  <p>  In December 2021, as the first step in the consultation process, the Commission launched online questionnaires relating to the review of both the CFP and the Regulation on the Common Organisation of Markets.  In April 2022, the Commission published an analysis of the results of the online surveys.  Meetings of regional groups of Member States and Advisory Councils have also taken place.  The Commission closed the consultation process with a stakeholder event on 10 June.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission has recently indicated that its report on the functioning of the CFP will take the form of a Communication, analysing the dimensions of the CFP (including governance, conservation measures, fleet management, landing obligation, data collection, control and the external dimension of the CFP).  The Commission's Communication will look at the interaction between fisheries management and the objectives of the European Green Deal.  In addition, the Communication will also address the social dimension of the CFP and consider how to improve the delivery of the CFP policy objectives.  The Commission has indicated that the results of its consultation process will be factored into the preparation of the Communication.  <\/p>  <p>  I have consistently made clear over the past year the Irish Government&rsquo;s assessment that the substantial changes brought about in fisheries policy as a result of the adoption of the EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement requires that internally within the EU, a comprehensive review be carried out of the CFP that would support changes to deliver a fair and equitable policy.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I established a national Common Fisheries Policy Review group of relevant stakeholders to examine the issues that arise for Ireland in the context of the CFP Review, to advise me on priorities for the negotiations and to identify strategies most likely to influence the outcome of the review.  The Group was chaired by Mr. John Malone, former Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, and assisted by a steering committee comprising Mr. Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Cinneide, former Director of the MI and EPA and Mr. Donal Maguire, former Director in BIM.  The Group involved representatives of key stakeholders, including industry representative groups and the environmental NGOs.   <\/p>  <p>  To clarify the update I provided to the House in response to a previous question on this issue, the CFP Review Group submitted its final report to me on 5th August.  The stakeholders have set out a number of recommendations on aspects of the CFP which need to be addressed in order to adapt to the monumental changes of recent years and ensure a sustainable future for the sector. <\/p>  <p>  I have forwarded a copy of the report to the Fisheries Commissioner, Virginijus Sinkevicius.  I have made clear that I am fully satisfied that this report demonstrates that there is need for legislative changes in the current policy to address the disproportionate impacts of the TCA and in the context of the new environmental challenges we are all facing.   I have asked him  to review the report's findings and recommendations and consider how these can be taken forward to support a fair and balanced CFP.  I will also be bringing the report to Government for its information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100077#WRL01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Sector","counter":485,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100077#WRL02000"},{"type":"question","counter":486,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[46215\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100077#WRL02100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 647 of 14 September 2022, in stating that removing lop and top or brash from site is not described in the standards for felling and reforestation, if harvesting lop and top and brash from forestry harvesting sites is outside of the scope of the standards for felling and reforestation of October 2019 and that the standards for felling and reforestation do not apply to such standards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1609","askee":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":487,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[46216\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100077#WRL02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 647 of 14 September 2022, in stating that there is no licence requirement if a landowner wishes to remove some of this material from a site, if this is an unlicensed activity and that harvesting lop and top or brash from forestry harvesting sites is outside the scope of the felling licence system and requirements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1609","askee":"1546"},{"type":"question","counter":488,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[46217\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022092100077#WRL02300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 647 of 14 September 2022, if he will confirm the Department's standard or guideline or guidance document that forest owners should review when harvesting lop and top or brash from harvesting sites; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1609","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":489,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 160 to 162, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>Lop-and-top or brash are terms given to the side branches and tops of trees that are normally cut from the main stem and left on site during harvesting operations.
