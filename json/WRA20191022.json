In recognition of the whole of government approach required, the Taoiseach launched the Action Plan for Online Safety in July 2018. The Action Plan involves a wide range of actions, across six Government Departments - Communications, Climate Action and Environment; Education and Skills; Justice and Equality; Children and Youth Affairs; Health; and Business Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan recognises that online safety is not the responsibility of just one Department, and it deals with the full\u00a0range and breadth of the issues involved. A Sponsors Group, involving the six Departments and chaired by the Department of Education and Skills, has been established to drive implementation of the Action Plan.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to my own Department, Children First operates on the premise that child protection issues are the responsibility of all, and that child safety and welfare concerns must be dealt with as and where they arise. This responsibility includes keeping children safe from harm online. As part of the Action Plan for Online Safety, my Department committed to amending the Children First Guidance to include a specific reference to the need to consider online safety in the completion of a Child Safeguarding Statement.<\/p>  <p>  An addendum to the Guidance, clarifying the need to consider online safety in the preparation of risk assessments and Child Safeguarding Statements, was finalised and published on my Department&rsquo;s website in January. In addition, Tusla has revised its template for the completion of Child Safeguarding Statements to refer to the need to consider online risks to children if a service provides access to the internet.<\/p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy that self-regulation will not be sufficient, and that as a society we need to take action, including legislation.

Low pay and poor working conditions in the sector remain a serious concern and impact on the quality of provision to children through their effect on the recruitment and retention of qualified staff. The lack of consistency of care caused by high staff turnover impacts directly on quality, while low wages are a constraint on plans to upskill and professionalise the workforce. My support for improved pay and conditions for early learning and care professionals has been explicit, as their role is critical to supporting children&rsquo;s development and delivering better outcomes for children and families.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2020 saw a 9% increase in investment in early learning and care and school age childcare. Additional investment of &euro;54.5m will bring spending to &euro;628m in 2020, a 138% increase in investment over five budgets. The very welcome level of investment needs to continue if we are to offer services that are of high quality, affordable and accessible. However, increased investment by itself will not ensure that staff wages and conditions will improve.<\/p>  <p>  As the State is not the employer, my Department does not pay the wages of staff working in early learning and care settings, and I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for these staff.<\/p>  <p>  I am, however, doing all that is in my power to improve wages and working conditions in the\u00a0sector. I have repeatedly called for the\u00a0sector\u00a0to pursue a\u00a0Sectoral Employment Order. My Department will readily co-operate with such a process when it is under way. <\/p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme will launch in November 2020. This will represent a landmark moment for the early learning and care and school age childcare sector in this country. The new scheme will provide the necessary infrastructure, for the first time, to enable increased State investment be funnelled into the sector, not only targeted at low income families, but, as increased investment becomes available, to middle income families also. It will enable us move away from being one of the most expensive countries in the OECD for childcare. <\/p>  <p>  The NCS is based on hourly subsidies for different age groups. These subsidies were calculated to reflect the cost of provision and the higher costs associated with certain quality measures, eg. the highest subsidy is paid for babies where the regulatory requirement is one staff member to 3 children. The subsidies can be increased to respond to higher costs that may be linked to, for example, better terms and conditions of staff. In this way, the sophistication of the design of the scheme will allow it respond, over time, to policy development to support improved pay and conditions.<\/p>  <p>  Alongside increased funding for the National Childcare Scheme in Budget 2020, I secured increased funding for the\u00a0sustainability fund for the sector. This will see funding to support sustainability rising from &euro;1.7m to &euro;2.2m per annum.\u00a0The fund will assist high quality services which are experiencing financial difficulties to transition themselves to a sustainable footing, and will also assist with needs arising in the event that the Labour Court introduces a Sectoral Employment Order. <\/p>  <p>  Other recent measures I have also taken to assist employers to improve the pay and conditions of their staff include: a 7% increase in ECCE capitation in 2018; higher capitation payments for graduates and Inclusion Coordinators; annual Programme Support Payments to recognise administrative demands; support for school-age childcare which will make it easier to offer full-time, full year employment contracts; and a pilot measure to fund participation in CPD. <\/p>  <p>  I have set out my vision for the sector, and a roadmap to achieve it, in First 5, which contains a commitment to develop a Workforce Development Plan. This Plan, work on which began in recent months, will identify measures to ensure appropriate numbers of early learning and care and school-age childcare staff at all levels in the sector, to achieve a graduate-led workforce by 2028, to ensure an appropriate focus on both centre based and home based services and to raise the profile of careers in the sector. As part of this work, a series of public consultations will be carried out involving those working in the sector ( centre based and home based) and other stakeholders. Plans for the consultation process will be finalised in the coming weeks. First 5 also commits to develop a new funding model for the sector, which may open up new mechanisms to influence pay and conditions in the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200066#WRD01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Safety","counter":52,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200066#WRD01200"},{"type":"question","counter":53,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[43270\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200066#WRD01300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extent to which she remains satisfied regarding the availability of sufficient placements for children deemed to be at risk; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":54,"content":"<p>I would like to thank the Deputy for this important question especially as last week Tusla undertook a very successful national awareness campaign about foster care.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Once a child has been received into care, the most crucial task for a child protection social worker is to find a placement that matches that child's needs.

To this end, it is vital the age and health profile of personnel be such as to ensure that operational capability and effectiveness are not compromised in any way.<\/p>  <p>  The age and fitness profile of the Permanent Defence Force was an issue of serious concern during the 1990's and was the subject of severe criticism in a series of external reports. One of the key areas identified for urgent action was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel. As a result, new terms and conditions were introduced for personnel enlisting after 1 January 1994 and new contracts for enlisted personnel were for a period of five years&rsquo; service. Since that time, the maximum period of service has been extended out to twenty-one years for line Privates and Corporals. Following an adjudication Corporals and Privates in receipt of Tech Pay Group 3 or higher may be extended to age 50 subject to meeting certain criteria for continuance in service. <\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, following further discussions with PDFORRA and in light of the adjudication, agreement was reached with PDFORRA that all Privates and Corporals recruited post 1994, will be allowed to continue in service to 31 December 2022 (or until they reach the age of 50), provided these personnel meet certain criteria during this interim period, including medical grades and fitness tests.

This Update, published on 9 July, takes forward the approach of the Contingency Action Plan published in December 2018, and reflects extensive work on a whole-of-Government basis and at EU level on no deal contingency planning. <\/p>  <p>  Key elements of these preparations  include  the Brexit Omnibus Act passed by the Oireachtas and signed into law in March 2019. The last four budgets have all contained dedicated measures to get Ireland Brexit ready. Budget 2020 makes more than &euro;1 billion available in the event of a no deal Brexit to help the people and businesses most affected, if and when they need it. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has put in place a range of contingency and mitigation measures across different sectors. The coordination and robustness of these measures continues to be reviewed and tested including through scenario planning, some of which has involved external expertise, and this continues to inform Government&rsquo;s ongoing preparations and plans.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is acutely conscious of the particular needs and vulnerabilities of the border region in the context of Brexit and particularly in the event of a no deal outcome. Mitigating the potential impact of Brexit, and the importance of avoiding a hard border, for people living in all the border counties is a key priority.  The measures provided for in Budget 2020 for a no deal scenario provide for funding to allow for further specific initiatives, targeting the most affected parts of the country &ndash; for example the border region &ndash; should that prove necessary.<\/p>  <p>  Throughout the Brexit process there has been a strong understanding from our EU partners of the need to address these unique circumstances on the island of Ireland.  Ireland and our EU partners are united in our determination to do all we can, deal or no deal, to protect our citizens, our businesses, including those in border counties, and our peace. <\/p>  <p>  On 8 May the Irish and British Governments entered into a Memorandum of Understanding reaffirming our joint commitment to the Common Travel Area, and to maintaining this long-standing reciprocal arrangement under which Irish and British citizens can live, work, study, and access healthcare, social security and public services in each other&rsquo;s jurisdictions.  This strong reassurance that the CTA will continue in all Brexit scenarios is an important one for our citizens, in particular in border areas, and has been a focus of recent Brexit communications.<\/p>  <p>  Cross border bus and rail transport services will continue to operate in the usual way and cross border health services are managed by service level agreements. Even in a no deal Brexit situation, these services and others like them will continue.<\/p>  <p>  Government has put in place a range of measures to support businesses, including those in the border counties, to prepare for Brexit in all scenarios.  These measures include financial supports for businesses, and an intensified and individual business-focused outreach and engagement programme by Revenue designed to support and assist businesses in understanding the potential impact of Brexit and how to prepare for and mitigate the risks, including by being prepared for new customs requirements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200067#WRE07000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Negotiations","counter":146,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200068#WRF00300"},{"type":"question","counter":147,"qnumday":116,"qnumall":"[43225\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200068#WRF00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the details that were agreed or partially agreed regarding the withdrawal treaty at the General Affairs Council and Foreign Affairs Council meetings in October 2019.","asker":"1224","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":148,"content":"<p>Negotiations on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union were not on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council meeting on 14 October.\u00a0<\/p><p>I attended the meeting of the GAC in Article 50 format held on the morning of 15 October, during which the EU&rsquo;s Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier briefed Ministers on the status of the then ongoing negotiations between the Taskforce and the UK Government.\u00a0 <\/p><p>On 17 October, the European Council unanimously endorsed the revised Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration agreed between the EU and UK negotiating teams earlier that day.<\/p><p>Both sets of negotiators have worked long and hard to achieve this decisive progress, with compromises on all sides.

I am informed that the De Souzas intend to appeal the decision of the Tribunal. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is keeping in regular contact with Emma and Jake De Souza on behalf of the Government. <\/p>  <p>  In December 2018, I wrote to the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to raise the case of Emma De Souza, the concerns in relation to the Citizenship and Identity provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, and to ask for a review of the issues.<\/p>  <p>  In February, then Prime Minister Theresa May acknowledged the serious concerns in this area and pledged to &ldquo;review the issues around citizenship urgently to deliver a long term solution consistent with the letter and spirit&rdquo; of the Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  In this context, the decision of the Tribunal in the De Souza case on Monday does not define the extent of the British Government&rsquo;s obligations under the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  In the Good Friday Agreement, the Governments &ldquo;recognise the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both&rdquo; and &ldquo;confirm that their right to hold both British and Irish citizenship is accepted by both Governments&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  The Good Friday Agreement therefore includes an explicit right to both Irish and British citizenship, and an explicit right of people to identify and be accepted as Irish or British or both.<\/p>  <p>  It is imperative that people in Northern Ireland have confidence in these provisions of the Agreement, in letter and in spirit. To provide for that, a positive outcome to the review mandated by the British Government is now urgently needed.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is actively engaged in seeking that, in our bilateral contacts with the British Government at the highest levels and through the framework of the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference, where the two Governments are also discussing Citizenship and Identity issues under the Agreement more broadly.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach raised the De Souza case with Prime Minister May and has confirmed that he will also raise it with Prime Minister Johnson. I raised the case with the current Secretary of State for Northern Ireland again at our meeting on Tuesday 15 October, underlining the pressing need for a positive outcome to the review by the British Government. <\/p>  <p>  Sensitive and generous approaches by the British Government are needed to ensure that the right of people in Northern Ireland to identify as Irish, or British, or both is meaningfully provided for in all relevant policy areas.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to strongly pursue this with the British Government, as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200068#WRF01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Policy","counter":154,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200068#WRF01200"},{"type":"question","counter":155,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[42971\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200068#WRF01300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will address a matter raised in correspondence by a person (details supplied) in County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":156,"content":"<p>Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with China is broad and wide-ranging, covering political, trade, education, and people to people links.

The seizure is believed to be in response to a pastoral letter issued on 29 April in which Eritrea&rsquo;s four Catholic bishops called on the authorities to adopt a comprehensive truth and reconciliation plan to promote dialogue and strengthen peacebuilding, and urged the authorities to implement reforms. <\/p>  <p>  The Special Rapporteur has urged the Eritrean Government to allow the Eritrean people to exercise their right to freedom of religion or belief and to release those who have been imprisoned for their religious beliefs.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland strongly condemns all forms of persecution on the basis of religion or belief, irrespective of where they occur or who the victims are. \u00a0 We are committed to promoting freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as well as the rights of persons belonging to religious minorities.\u00a0 This commitment to promoting freedom of religion or belief is reaffirmed in the Global Island: Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing World. <\/p>  <p>Ireland consistently raises the issues of intolerance and advocates for inclusive societies at the UN&rsquo;s Human Rights Council, including during the Council&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review of the human rights records of UN Member States.

I understand that this is a process that will involve engagement with a number of stakeholders and bodies, including local groups, NGOs, the Governor of Antioquia, the project owners and the Unit for the Search of Disappeared Persons (UBPD). This matter demonstrates the crucial importance of the JEP, the UBPD, and the other bodies established under the peace agreement to ensure justice and reconciliation for those affected by the conflict which lasted for more than 50 years.  <\/p>  <p>  I am also aware of the worrying levels of violence, threats and intimidation against a number of groups in Colombia, particularly human rights defenders, members of civil society organisations, former combatants and those engaged in political activity. I wholeheartedly condemn such threats or attacks and would like to reiterate Ireland's strong conviction that everyone's right to freedom of expression, to defend their rights and to participate in public life must be respected. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is a long-standing and deeply committed supporter of the Colombian peace process. I firmly believe that Colombia&rsquo;s peace accord provides the framework in which the endemic violence and impunity which has afflicted Colombian society for decades can successfully be addressed. <\/p>  <p>  I am concerned by any developments that might undermine the significant progress that has been made in securing peace in Colombia but, as we know from our own experience on the island of Ireland, peacebuilding is an ongoing process that will encounter many obstacles and setbacks along the way.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland remains committed to supporting the Colombian Government in its efforts to overcome these challenges, something which I emphasised in my meeting with Minister of Foreign Affairs of Colombia, H.E. Carlos Holmes Trujillo, during his visit to Dublin last month. I assured Minister Trujillo that we see our partnership with Colombia in sharing experience of peacebuilding as a long term commitment. We agreed that we had much to learn from each other as we strive to build and maintain peace in our two countries. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has provided over &euro;14 million in funding to Colombia since 2007, focusing on the areas of human rights, conflict prevention, peacebuilding and supporting livelihoods for rural populations. The Department provides funding directly to the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia to support its important work in promoting and protecting human rights, including in some of Colombia&rsquo;s most isolated and challenging regions, as well as to the Inter American Commission on Human Rights, which provides protection measures to community leaders and activists operating in Colombia and elsewhere in Latin America. <\/p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding to the UN Multi-Partner Trust Fund for Colombia, which works to support stabilisation in areas affected by the conflict, towards reincorporation of former combatants, and to support victims and systems of transitional justice, including by working to strengthen the Special Jurisdiction for Peace. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland was a founding member of the EU Trust Fund for Colombia, and will contribute &euro;3 million over the five-year lifespan of the Fund. The Fund finances projects targeted at the marginalised rural areas of Colombia which have been most affected by conflict, and all projects incorporate a human rights and gender perspective.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland also provides support to the Colombian Government through a series of lesson sharing programmes based on our experience of peacebuilding and reconciliation on the island of Ireland. In June, my Department supported the provision of technical inputs to the office of Dr. Emilio Archila, Presidential Counsellor for Stabilisation and Consolidation of Colombia, who is responsible for the implementation of the peace accords. Officials at my Department were also pleased to meet with him last month when he travelled to Dublin for a series of meetings. <\/p>  <p>  The peace process is fundamental to improving the human rights situation in the country, which I am aware is difficult for many human rights defenders across Colombia. During the recent visits of Minister Trujillo and Presidential Counsellor Archilla, I understand that civil society organisations supporting the work of human rights defenders in the country had the opportunity to engage directly on these issues and on measures the Government is taking to protect human rights defenders.      <\/p>  <p>  Officials at my Department in Dublin and at our Embassy in Bogot&aacute; engage regularly with human rights defenders in Colombia. Last week officials in Dublin met with Christian Aid and representatives of Sisma Mujer, a partner organisation of women human rights defenders active in Colombia. Ireland welcomes engagement with these groups and we are pleased to support the valuable work that they do in defence of human rights and in support of the implementation of the peace accords in Colombia. <\/p>  <p>  I will continue to monitor developments on this issue closely. My officials in Dublin and Bogot&aacute; will continue Ireland's regular engagement with relevant stakeholders across Colombia, including the Colombian government, human rights defenders, multilateral organisations and our EU partners, in support of human rights and the full implementation of the peace agreement in the country. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200068#WRF03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":175,"content":"<p>Question No. 129 answered with Question No. 127.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":176,"content":"<p>Question No. 130 answered with Question No. 128.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":177,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200068#WRF03700"},{"type":"question","counter":178,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[43247\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200068#WRF03800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the steps being taken in respect of prisoners of conscience who are imprisoned in Bahrain; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":179,"content":"<p>The human rights situation in Bahrain remains a matter of concern. Although Bahrain has repeatedly stated its commitment to improving its human rights record and safeguarding human rights as enshrined in the Bahraini Constitution, there are ongoing instances of violations of fundamental freedoms there, including violations of freedom of opinion and expression, as well as the targeting of human rights defenders. Ireland attaches a high priority to safeguarding human rights defenders, and continually advocates for freedom for civil society actors to operate in a safe and enabling environment, without repression.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I am aware of reports of inhumane detention conditions as well as allegations that political prisoners in Bahrain have been tortured. Ireland urges all States to safeguard the human rights of prisoners and detainees and is committed to the prevention and eradication of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.<\/p>  <p>  Respect for human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and we consistently seek to raise our concerns on human rights issues through the most appropriate and effective channels. Our active participation at the UN Human Rights Council is particularly important in that regard. Ireland regularly raises the case of human rights in Bahrain at that forum, in the form of national statements and its support to EU Statements. For example, in September 2018, Ireland expressed concerns about the ongoing restrictions on civil society space and the treatment of human rights defenders, and called on Bahrain to respect freedom of opinion and expression. In February 2019, Ireland reiterated concern at the ongoing detention of human rights defenders. In our Item 4 statement at the Human Rights Council in July 2019, Ireland called on Bahrain to ensure respect for freedom of opinion and expression, and the right to a fair trial. Ireland also took the opportunity at the most recent Council in September 2019 to reiterate its opposition to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has signed five Human Rights Council joint statements on the human rights situation in Bahrain, which expressed concern on a number of fronts including the mistreatment of detainees, repression of demonstrations, and the arbitrary deprivation of nationality without due process. <\/p>  <p>  Our principled stance on human rights also feeds into our bilateral dialogue and we raise our human rights concerns directly with the Bahraini authorities at every opportunity. When I met the Bahraini Foreign Minister in New York last month I made a point of raising the human rights situation directly with him, expressing the hope that we can have an open and honest discussion on these issues. In addition, officials from my Department meet regularly with advocacy groups and Bahraini human rights defenders to discuss the situation in Bahrain. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the rights of prisoners and detainees in general, Ireland co-sponsored HRC Resolution 36\/16, which calls upon States to &lsquo;investigate promptly, effectively and impartially all alleged human rights violations and abuses suffered by persons deprived of their liberty, in particular cases involving death, torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, to provide effective remedies to the victims, and to ensure that detention administrations cooperate fully with the investigating authority and preserve all evidence&rsquo;. Ireland has also co-sponsored; Resolution 30\/7, concerning human rights in the administration of justice; Resolution 31\/31, concerning torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; and UN General Assembly Resolution 71\/188, also concerning human rights in the administration of justice.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor developments in Bahrain, and to call on the Bahraini Government to deliver on its stated commitment to make progress in relation to human rights. We shall do so both directly with Bahraini officials, as well as at EU and international level, whenever opportunities arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200068#WRF03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Value for Money Reviews","counter":180,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200068#WRF04000"},{"type":"question","counter":181,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[43315\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200068#WRF04100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the consultancy service providers engaged by his Department from 1 January 2018 to 1 January 2019; the costs associated with each (details supplied); the reason for each service engagement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":182,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[43332\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200068#WRF04200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the details of each value for money and policy review conducted by his Department from 1 January 2018 to 1 January 2019; the cost of each exercise; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":183,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 and 133 together.<\/p><p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is responsible for two Votes - Vote 27 (International Co-operation) and Vote 28 (Foreign Affairs and Trade).<\/p><p>The Department seeks to minimize expenditure on consultants.

They will continue to be able to rely on EU law in the courts of the Member States and to seek, for example, a preliminary reference to the European Court of Justice. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, however, the courts in Northern Ireland will no longer make such preliminary references. The rules governing the standing for individuals to bring a direct form of action &ndash; such as an action under Article 263 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union challenging the legality of an EU legal act &ndash; are very strict. An individual may institute such proceedings against an EU act that is addressed to that person or which is of direct and individual concern to them, or against a regulatory act which is of direct concern to them and does not entail implementing measures. If these conditions were fulfilled, an Irish citizen living in Northern Ireland would be able to institute proceedings before the European Court of Justice.

I am particularly concerned about the humanitarian impact of the action and the further displacements of civilian populations that are occurring as a result.  <\/p><p>While we understand Turkey&rsquo;s security concerns about its own territory<i>,<\/i>these concerns should be addressed through political and diplomatic means. I have stressed that the protection of civilians and respect for international humanitarian law must be paramount.  <\/p><p>At the EU Foreign Affairs Council on 14 October, my colleagues and I condemned this action, and Member States agreed to halt arms export licensing to Turkey. The Conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Council were endorsed by the European Council on 17 October. <\/p><p>Officials from my Department met the Turkish Ambassador on 11 October, and made Ireland&rsquo;s views on the situation clear. We emphasised our belief that these hostilities will undermine stability and threaten progress achieved in the fight against ISIS. <\/p><p>The rights of local populations in north-east Syria, including the Kurdish population, must be respected. The EU has been clear that any attempt at demographic change would be unacceptable, and that no stabilisation assistance will be provided in areas where the rights of local populations are ignored. Ireland and the EU have maintained that returns of refugees and internally-displaced people to their places of origin must be voluntary, dignified and safe. It is unlikely that the so-called &lsquo;safe zone&rsquo; in north-east Syria, as envisaged by Turkey, would satisfy international criteria for refugee return as laid down by UNHCR.  <\/p><p>Ireland is a strong and consistent humanitarian donor to the Syria crisis response. In March 2019, Ireland pledged a further &euro;25 million to the crisis, bringing the total amount of humanitarian assistance committed to the Syria crisis to over &euro;143 million since 2012 &ndash; our largest ever response to any single crisis. This funding is provided on the basis of humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence, and therefore is not targeted at any one ethnic group. <\/p><p>However, it does include cross-border funding into northern Syria, and Ireland has been in contact with partners in recent days about their response in response to the upsurge in displacements and increased humanitarian need in north-east Syria as a result of the military offensive. A number of Ireland's humanitarian partners work in north-east Syria, including the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). For example, WFP is currently assisting over 100,000 people with emergency food assistance in north-east Syria. <\/p><p>All military action in Syria risks undermining the work of the UN in attempting to facilitate a negotiated end to the conflict, and a political transition which meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people. I take this opportunity to reiterate Ireland&rsquo;s strong support for the work of the UN Special Envoy and urge all parties to engage with the UN-led process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200068#WRF05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":196,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200069#WRG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":197,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[43371\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200069#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to plans in Uganda to introduce laws that would make homosexual acts punishable by law; his plans to convey to Ugandan authorities opposition to such laws; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":198,"content":"<p>I am aware of the disturbing reports from Uganda regarding support for the re-tabling of a bill which would impose the death penalty on LGBTI individuals.

These guidelines will be reviewed at least once in every three year period following the completion of the first review.<\/p>  <p>  Other steps taken to date to address the spiralling cost of insurance include the following: <\/p>  <p>  - The establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance.\u00a0 The CBI is due to make its first report by the end of 2019, and will make recommendations to me regarding potentially expanding its scope to include employer and public liability insurance;<\/p>  <p>  - Reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019 to strengthen the powers of PIAB around compliance with its procedures;<\/p>  <p>  - Commencement of the amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to align the timeframes by which claims should be notified to businesses with GDPR time limits on the keeping of CCTV footage to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;<\/p>  <p>  - The reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers, resulting from the failure of Setanta Insurance; <\/p>  <p>  - Various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as the recent decision by the Garda Commissioner to develop a divisional focus on insurance fraud which will be guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) which will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud, and the recent raids under Operation Coatee, which targets insurance-related criminality, and;<\/p>  <p>  - The commencement and prioritisation by the Law Reform Commission (LRC) of its work to undertake a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from September 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24% lower than the July 2016 peak).\u00a0 The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, particularly those relevant to businesses.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputy that important reforms are taking place and that I am confident that if the level of awards are reduced as a result of the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee, then the insurance premium and coverage issues that are being experienced by the leisure, sports and tourism sectors and many businesses more generally should recede.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200069#WRG01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":213,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200069#WRG01900"},{"type":"question","counter":214,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[43214\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200069#WRG02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider introducing a long paying tax credit for PAYE taxpayers who have been consistently paying tax for over 30 years or more as a gesture of gratitude for their contribution to the State; if such tax payers are recognised in the tax code at present; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1360","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":215,"content":"<p>I am satisfied that, in the context of limited resources, the tax code already recognises those who have\u00a0contributed to the State for a long period through measures that reduce the amount of tax that such persons pay in retirement.<\/p>  <p>  For example, a person aged 65 and over is fully exempt from income tax where his or her total income from all sources is less than the relevant exemption limit of &euro;36,000 in the case of a married couple or civil partners and &euro;18,000 for a single individual. \u00a0Where a couple have dependent children, the exemption limit is increased by &euro;575 per child for the first 2 children and &euro;830 for each child thereafter.

Income gains were largest for the first decile, followed by the second and third which indicates that the tax and welfare measures in Budget 2020 were broadly progressive.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As with any model, the SWITCH analysis has limitations, and cannot take into account other targetted expenditure measures such as increased expenditure that will benefit rural communities. As I outlined on Budget Day, the Government is investing nearly &euro;2 billion in rural Ireland in 2020. This includes an additional &euro;51 million for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and &euro;17 million for the Department of Rural and Community Development. This reflects the fact that agriculture and rural development are cornerstones of our economy, supporting thousands of jobs across the country. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, a number of targeted provisions for rural communities were introduced in Budget 2020 to provide supports for rural households to transition to a low carbon economy. These include funding for the Just Transition Fund targeted at the Midlands to aide in the retraining of Bord na M&oacute;na workers in adjusting to the low carbon transition. The Just Transition Fund also provides for the restoration of the bogs to their original state as natural absorbers of carbon, creating 70 jobs in its first year, rising to 100 as the programme progresses. A group housing retrofitting programme geared towards social housing in the Midlands will commence in 2020, supporting 400 jobs directly and indirectly. The aforementioned measures will be spearheaded by the Just Transition Commissioner who will engage with all relevant stakeholders to ensure timely and efficient implementation of these measures. <\/p>  <p>  I have also made provision for the biggest ever allocation of funds to the Warmer Homes Scheme which is targeted towards the most vulnerable in our society. &euro;52.8 million is being made available for the retrofitting of homes of those living in energy poverty or those at risk of entering energy poverty. I believe that this measure combined with the increase in the fuel allowance of &euro;2 per week will be of particular assistance to those low-income rural households who currently rely on fossil fuels to heat their homes.<\/p>  <p>  Ring-fencing of funds for investment in sustainable transport is a crucial aspect of the transition to a low carbon economy and is of particular importance to rural communities who might have limited access to public transport. &euro;14 million of additional funding for electric vehicle grants has been granted as part of Budget 2020 of which &euro;8 million will be sourced from ring-fenced carbon tax revenue. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, as part of the National Broadband Plan, which is committed to bringing high-speed broadband to the &ndash; largely rural &ndash;1.1 million people who currently do not have access to broadband, the Government has provided for &euro;119 million in Budget 2020.

The document is available at the following link: <\/p><p><b>Expenditure<\/b><\/p><p>As set out in Expenditure Report 2020, the focus of the core element of Budget 2020 is on providing for sustainable increases in public expenditure. This is in recognition of the key role of public services and infrastructure in supporting our citizens and promoting the resilience of our economy, particularly in light of the increasing risks in the global economic environment. Particular focus was placed on maintaining and improving supports for children and families, as well as for elderly people. <\/p><p>In order to protect the most vulnerable in society, Budget 2020 provides an allocation of over &euro;21 billion for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. The significant provision of supports provided through the Social Protection system represents an important strand of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling poverty and social inequality in Ireland. <\/p><p>Gross current expenditure for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will see an increase of over 6% in 2020, rising to almost &euro;1.6 billion. As well as increased funding for Early Years Care and Education, central to this allocation is funding for the continued roll-out of the National Childcare Scheme.<\/p><p>&euro;17.4 billion in current expenditure will be allocated to the Health sector in 2020, a year on year increase of over 6%. This investment reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to create a more responsive, integrated and people-centred Health system. New measures such as a reduction of prescription charges for over 70&rsquo;s, the expansion of free GP care to all children under 8 and free dental care for children under 6 will all contribute to improving access to health and social services across the country. <\/p><p>The Housing programme in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government will see an increase of 11% compared with 2019, bringing the total allocation to almost &euro;2.6 billion (including current and capital expenditure). This allocation will support the Social Housing needs of over 27,500 households in 2020. This includes the delivery of 11,167 new social homes through build, acquisition and leasing programmes as well as supporting 16,350 new households under the HAP and RAS schemes.<\/p><p>Further details of these measures and all Budget 2020 allocations can be found in Expenditure Report 2020, which can be found on budget.gov.ie.<\/p><p><b>Carbon Tax<\/b><\/p><p>Budget 2020 included an increase in carbon tax of &euro;6 per tonne, which is expected to raise &euro;90 million in 2020. The funding raised is to be directed to support increases to existing climate related schemes or new schemes that would not have been provided in the absence of this increase. Government has been clear that the importance of clear action in this regard must be balanced with measures to promote equity during the transition. The revenue raised in 2020 will support: <\/p><p>- &euro;34 million in funding to\u00a0protect the vulnerable through an increase in the fuel allowance and energy efficiency upgrades;<\/p><p>- &euro;31 million for schemes to ensure a just transition to a low carbon economy, including measures with\u00a0a particular focus on the midlands;<\/p><p>- &euro;25 million for programmes\u00a0that can help all citizens to reduce their carbon footprint. <\/p><p>These measures are set out in more detail in the paper published alongside the Budget on October 8<sup>th<\/sup>, &lsquo;The Carbon Tax Increase &ndash; What it Will be Spent On&rsquo;. This paper can be found on the Budget website:   <\/p><p><b>Equality Budgeting<\/b><\/p><p>An Equality Budgeting pilot was adopted for the 2018 budgetary cycle, built on the existing performance budgeting framework. Equality Budgeting aims to provide greater information on the likely impacts of proposed and ongoing budgetary measures, which, in turn, enhances the potential to better facilitate the integration of equality concerns into the budgetary process, avoid unintended adverse outcomes and enhance the Government&rsquo;s decision making framework. It involves Departments setting concrete measurable targets for equality objectives in the Revised Estimates Volume and reporting on progress in the Public Service Performance Report. For the pilot exercise, a number of diverse policy areas were selected with associated objectives and indicators. The learnings from the pilot were used to inform the expansion of the equality budgeting initiative to further develop the gender budgeting elements, and to broaden its scope to other dimensions of equality including poverty, socioeconomic inequality and disability. An Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group has also been established. This group is comprised of a broad range of relevant stakeholders and policy experts to provide advice on the most effective way to advance Equality Budgeting policy and progress the initiative.<\/p><p>Future direction will now be assisted by the recent publication of the OECD Scan of Equality Budgeting in Ireland which sets out a path forward with a number of recommendations for consideration. This work was commissioned by both the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform and the Department of Justice &amp;amp; Equality. \u00a0The scan recommendations\u00a0are aligned with international experiences of best practice in this field. Implementation of the Report&rsquo;s recommendations will be carried forward in close consultation with the Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group. The OECD report can be found at .<\/p><p><b>Social Impact Assessment<\/b><\/p><p>The Social Impact Assessment (SIA) series of papers aims to provide an evidence based methodology to examine the impact of public expenditure on households. This framework is designed to examine the demographic profile of public service users, and how they are impacted by budgetary policy decisions. This approach complements the budgetary impact assessments carried out using the SWITCH (Simulating Welfare and Income Tax Changes) model by the Department of Finance and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and externally by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI). SIA papers published with Budget 2020 focused on topics such as the Domiciliary Care Allowance and Public Service Obligation (PSO) funding for Public Transport. More information about the SIA series is available at .<\/p><p><b>National Childcare Scheme<\/b><\/p><p>The importance and value of quality early years care and education is well-documented. The international evidence shows a wide range of benefits for children, families and society at large. High quality services provide long-lasting cognitive, social and emotional benefits for children, supporting children to enjoy their childhood and realise the full potential of their future. However, affordability and accessibility of quality childcare is a major concern for many parents and can act as a barrier to employment which, in turn, increases the risk of poverty. The National Childcare Scheme (NCS) aims to improve children's outcomes, support lifelong learning, make work pay, reduce child poverty and tangibly reduce the cost of quality childcare for thousands

","asker":"1215","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":349,"content":"<p>My Department promotes the quality of teaching and learning through the provision of quality teacher training programmes and continuing professional development and support for principals and teachers in a range of pedagogical, curricular and educational areas. This is done through initial teacher education programmes, education centres and support services for teachers at primary and post-primary level.<\/p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Education Act 1998, the Board of Management is the body charged with the direct governance of a school. <\/p>  <p>  The Board of Management of each school is responsible for the care and safety of all of the students in their school and care and safety should be at the centre of all policy and practices. Schools are required to take all reasonable precautions to provide training for teachers to ensure the safety and welfare of their pupils.<\/p>  <p>  The Health and Safety Authority (HSA) advise that, by law, employers and those who control workplaces to any extent, must identify hazards in the workplaces under their control and assess the risk presented by the hazards.<\/p>  <p>  Employers must write down the risks and what to do about them. This is known as Risk Assessment. The aim of Risk Assessment is to reduce the risk of injury and illness associated with work. The Risk Assessment(s) will form part of\u00a0the employer's\u00a0Safety Statement.<\/p>  <p>  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007 set out the First-Aid requirements for workplaces as follows: \"Employers have a duty to provide first-aid equipment at all places at work where working conditions require it. Depending on the size or specific hazard (or both) of the place of work, trained occupational first-aiders must also be provided. Apart from some exceptions, first-aid rooms must be provided where appropriate. Information must also be provided to employees as regards the first-aid facilities and arrangements in place.\"<\/p>  <p>  It is important that the school management authority requests parents to ensure that the school is made aware of any medical condition suffered by any student attending. Where the school is aware of potential difficulties that may arise as a consequence of a medical condition suffered by one or more students, it may be possible for the management authorities, working in conjunction with parents, teachers and children to put preventative measures in place to lessen the possibility of any difficulties arising or to ensure that, if a student suffers from an illness requiring, for example, the administration of medication, that appropriate treatment is available.<\/p>  <p>  The administration of medicines in primary schools is the subject of an agreement between the Irish National Teachers Organisation and the organisation representing school management at primary level. While this agreement specifies that no teacher can be required to administer medicine or drugs to pupils, it also sets out procedures that must be followed where a teacher or teachers agree to do so. The position is that either the parents of the child should make themselves available to administer medication as required, or where they wish the staff in the school to administer it, they should indemnify the school.<\/p>  <p>  My Department cannot direct any member of the Board of Management or the teaching staff of the school to administer medical treatment to pupils, action and procedures which are normally carried out by medical professionals such as doctors and nurses.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The organisation of training in the administration of medicines is a matter for the Board of Management and my Department has no plans for future training programmes in this area.<\/p>  <p>  Where a child requires adult assistance to assist in the administration of medicine and where the extent of assistance required would overly disrupt normal teaching time, SNA support may be allocated for this purpose.<\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management to ensure that SNAs are in a position to effectively meet the care needs of students for whom SNA support has been allocated in the school, when appointing an SNA. <\/p>  <p>  Where specific training is required, the Board of Management should liaise with the Health Service Executive (HSE) in order to ensure that the HSE provides guidance and training that enables the SNA to meet the care needs of the pupil in an appropriate manner. It is a matter for individual school authorities to make such arrangements locally. <\/p>  <p>  It is my Department's experience that once the matter has been discussed in detail with the Board of Management and staff of a school, and once all parties are clear as to the procedures to be followed, arrangements can normally be made to assist the administration of first aid or medicine.<\/p>  <p>  In September 2016, I requested the NCSE to lead a comprehensive review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme to identify and recommend\u00a0how, in the future, the additional care needs of students, over and above those needs that could be reasonably expected to be managed by teaching staff, should be met and to identify and recommend the most appropriate form of support options to provide better outcomes for students with Special Educational Needs who have additional care needs, having regard to the significant amount of State investment in this area.<\/p>  <p>  The administration of medication and other such issues in schools, was raised with the NCSE as part of the consultation process of this review.<\/p>  <p>  The Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme was\u00a0published by the NCSE on 30 May 2018 and\u00a0my Department is developing proposals to implement the recommendations of the Review. <\/p>  <p>  On the 27 March 2019,\u00a0I announced the trialling of the School Inclusion Model &ndash; a new model of support for students with special educational and additional care needs. This new research-based package of education and health supports will be piloted and evaluated in the 2019\/20 school year.<\/p>  <p>  One of the key features of the School Inclusion Model pilot is a\u00a0national training programme for SNAs. The design and roll out , on a pilot basis, of a national training programme for SNAs is being prioritised and work is ongoing in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200071#WRJ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":350,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200071#WRJ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":351,"qnumday":194,"qnumall":"[43100\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200071#WRJ01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason a limited additional accommodation grant was provided to a school (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1369","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":352,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that a review of an\u00a0application for additional accommodation under the 'Additional School Accommodation Scheme' has\u00a0been received from the school in question.\u00a0 The\u00a0review is currently under assessment,\u00a0as soon as this process is completed\u00a0a decision will be conveyed directly\u00a0to the school authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200071#WRJ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":353,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200071#WRJ01700"},{"type":"question","counter":354,"qnumday":195,"qnumall":"[43119\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200071#WRJ01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the timeline to sign required documents in the case of a school (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":355,"content":"<p>I can confirm that officials in my Department are progressing this matter and the document referred to by the Deputy will be signed and sealed\u00a0as soon as possible, and returned to\u00a0the Department's\u00a0legal representatives to finalise the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200071#WRJ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education and Training Boards","counter":356,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200071#WRJ02000"},{"type":"question","counter":357,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[43135\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200071#WRJ02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding the educational services provided at a centre (details supplied); if planning is under way to provide a location for services to be provided in another location; if the location has been identified; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1225","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":358,"content":"<p>Cork Education\u00a0and Training Board (CETB)\u00a0currently provides\u00a0two thousand &lsquo;co-operation hours' annually\u00a0to the Sacred Heart House located in the Bessborough\u00a0Centre in Cork.\u00a0\u00a0 The co-operation hours scheme is a longstanding arrangement under which Education and Training Boards (ETBs)\u00a0provide teaching hours for settings run by a range of organisations.\u00a0\u00a0In this case\u00a0CETB employs 3 teachers who deliver\u00a0education and training to early school leavers\u00a0in the Bessborough Centre.\u00a0 No funding is provided by my Department or CETB to the centre for its early school leaver provision.<\/p>  <p>  I understand from CETB\u00a0that they are aware that the Sacret Heart Order wishes to dispose of the property and\u00a0that a sale is being pursued.

Garda&iacute; are achieving significant successes in a range of crime categories and should be commended for their efforts.  <\/p>  <p>  There has been a decrease of over 40% in the number of recorded homicide incidents in the second quarter of 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018.  The CSO figures also identify a decrease of 9.8% in burglary and related offences at the end of Q2 2019, when compared to the same period last year.  While the figures in relation to Theft offences were similar to the same period last year, incidents of &lsquo;theft from person&rsquo; offences have decreased by 11%. <\/p>  <p>  In regard to the increase in recorded incidents of fraud, deception and related incidents of 34.4% in Q2 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018, a range of measures are being taken to prevent and combat fraud, including insurance fraud.  Garda&iacute; are taking steps to ensure consistency in how reports of fraud are received, recorded and disseminated for investigation.  Changes have also been made to the Pulse system to improve the quality and consistency of recording of insurance related crime.<\/p>  <p>  Incidents of controlled drugs offences were up 16.5% when compared to the same period last year, continuing a trend seen in the CSO figures for Q1 2019. The upward trend in recorded incidents of controlled drug offences remains a cause for concern. The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau leads in tackling all forms of drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs in Ireland. Collaboration at an inter-agency and international level remain key in tackling this issue. <\/p>  <p>  There has been an increase of 9.2% in the number of reported sexual offences, representing a total of 3,286 incidents.  This continues a trend seen since Q1 2015, where reported incidents have risen 54.9% from 2,086 incidents in Q1 2015 to 3,231 incidents in the year to Q1 2019.  The Government is committed to preventing and addressing sexual crime in all its forms and we are working hard, on a whole-of-Government basis, to do so. I very much welcome the fact  hat more victims are coming forward to Garda&iacute; and I urge victims to continue to do so. <\/p>  <p>  The laws surrounding sexual offences have been significantly strengthened in recent years and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is continuously improving its specialist services to respond to the needs of victims.  Ten Divisional Protective Service Units have already been established and similar units are being rolled out nationwide, with specially trained officers responsible for engagement with and interviewing of victims.  These Units will support the delivery of a consistent, professional and sensitive approach to the investigation of sexual crime.<\/p>  <p>  It is also incumbent on all of society to continue to examine behaviour and attitudes in relation to sexual crime.  I launched &lsquo;No Excuses&rsquo;, a 3-year national awareness raising campaign on sexual harassment and sexual violence in May of this year, with the aim of increasing awareness of sexual violence and to bring about changes in societal attitudes.  <\/p>  <p>  The statistics released by the CSO further support the independent assessment of Garda performance by the Policing Authority, released in September 2019, which found that &ldquo;almost all of the commitments in the policing plan aimed at reducing crime and the fear of crime are on target&rdquo;.  That report also pointed to a &lsquo;clear sense of pace, effort and direction&rsquo; in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  And finally, I would note that these results are being achieved at a time of record investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. &euro;1.76 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2019, as well as capital investment amounting to &euro; 92 million this year. Furthermore, the allocation for 2020 is increasing by &euro;122 million to an unprecedented total of &euro;1.88 billion. The capital allocation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also increasing by 26% to a total of &euro;116.5 million.<\/p>  <p>  We now have over 14,200 Garda&iacute; nationwide, supported by over 2,800 Garda staff.  And the organisation is continuing to grow - a programme of accelerated recruitment is ongoing with a view to reaching 15,000 Garda&iacute; in an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 by 2021.

The ongoing recruitment will provide the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; to deliver a visible, effective and responsive policing service nationwide.<\/p><p>The continued disruption of the supply of all illicit drugs remains a priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the other state agencies tasked with responsibilities in this regard. <\/p><p>The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau leads in tackling all forms of drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs in Ireland. Collaboration at an inter-agency and international level remain key in tackling this issue.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also continues to work closely with communities to address any drug-related issues, including through high-visibility patrolling by uniformed personnel and through intelligence-led operations targeting known criminals. <\/p><p>Further and as the Deputy will appreciate, there is a need to address drug-related offending in a strategic multi-agency way. In addition to the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in co-operation with international agencies, it is important to remember that other state agencies are tasked with important responsibilities in this regard. Government policy in relation to drug and alcohol misuse is set out in Ireland&rsquo;s National Drug Strategy, &lsquo;Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery&rsquo;, a health led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025. <\/p><p>The Strategy represents a whole-of-Government response to the problem of drug and alcohol use in Ireland. It draws upon a range of Government policy frameworks in order to reduce the risk factors for substance misuse. It also commits to addressing the harms of drugs markets and reduce access to drugs for harmful use. Responsibility for overseeing the overall implementation of the strategy rests with the Department of Health. My own Department has responsibility as the lead agency or partner in a number of actions, including keeping drugs legislation under review as the joint lead agency with the Department of Health. <\/p><p>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following table shows the number of Youth Referrals for Simple Possession in County Galway for the dates requested by the Deputy.<\/p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year <\/th>       <th>Youth Referrals Galway - Simple Possession <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2014<\/td>       <td>30<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2015<\/td>       <td>17<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2016<\/td>       <td>31<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2017<\/td>       <td>49<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2018<\/td>       <td>34<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 (correct as of 17 October) <\/td>       <td>27<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>The Garda authorities have further informed me that the number of underage persons arrested for Possession of Drugs for Sale or Supply was less than 10 per year for the years 2014 &ndash; to date in 2019 in County Galway. As the Deputy may be aware, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Analysis Service does not typically report on details where there are less than 10 incidents in a given area. <\/p><p>I can also inform the Deputy that an expert Steering Group is currently developing a new Youth Justice Strategy, including a review of the Children Act. The Steering Group commenced its work in February and has had a series of meetings which will continue into next year. <\/p><p>The Group is tasked with advising and guiding the development of the new Strategy, including consideration of the full range of issues connected to children and young people at risk of coming into contact with the criminal justice system, from early intervention and preventative work, including family support, diversion from crime, through to court processes and facilities, supervision of offenders, detention and reintegration and support post release.  The intention is that we will have a draft Strategy for publication for public consultation by the end of this year, and that the Strategy will be finalised in the first half of 2020.<\/p><p>Strengthening and expanding the role of the Garda Youth Diversion projects and other community-based initiatives, including those working with the Probation Service, and bringing the full range of relevant interventions together in a coherent and holistic response to youth crime and as a support to diverting young people from crime and anti-social behaviour is a key priority for the new Strategy.  The Deputy will also be aware of the health diversion approach to drug possession  recently approved by the Government.  My Department is working closely with the Department of Health in the development of operational protocols in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200073#WRL02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Refugee Resettlement Programme","counter":507,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200073#WRL02300"},{"type":"question","counter":508,"qnumday":247,"qnumall":"[43070\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200073#WRL02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when the commitment to admit 4,000 persons under the relocation and resettlement programmes will be met; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":509,"content":"<p>In\u00a02015, as part of Ireland's response to the migration crisis in central and southern Europe, the Government established the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP).\u00a0Under this programme, the Government committed to accepting up to 4,000 people into the State, primarily through a combination of the EU Relocation Programme and the UNHCR's Refugee Resettlement Programme.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Government Decision to accept 4,000 persons into the State did not contain a deadline.\u00a0 However, the relocation mechanism did carry a time limit of approximately two years to end on 31 December 2017.

I am satisfied that the pay determinations are the most appropriate in the current circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200073#WRL03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consultancy Contracts Data","counter":523,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200073#WRL04000"},{"type":"question","counter":524,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[43318\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200073#WRL04100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the consultancy service providers engaged by his Department from 1 January 2018 to 1 January 2019; the costs associated with each (details supplied); the reason for each service engagement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":525,"content":"<p>The details of the expenditure incurred by my Department under the specified heading (Administration 7 - Consultancy Services) during 2018 is set out in the following table. <table>    <tr>       <th>Provider<\/th>       <th>Amount (Euro)<\/th>       <th>Services Provided<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Royal College of Physicians of Ireland <\/td>       <td><div>15,000<\/div><\/td>       <td>Review of the organisational structure of the Office of the State Pathologist<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Athr&uacute; Consultancy<\/td>       <td><div>5,535<\/div><\/td>       <td>HR consultancy services<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mazars <\/td>       <td><div>69,372<\/div><\/td>       <td>Specialist ICT audit services to support the Internal Audit function<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>KW Research &amp;amp; Associates<\/td>       <td><div>6,894<\/div><\/td>       <td>Facilitation of consultation workshops on development of LGBTI+ Strategy<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Grainne Healy<\/td>       <td><div>6,718<\/div><\/td>       <td>Facilitation of consultation workshops on development of LGBTI+ Strategy<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total<\/td>       <td><div>103,519<\/div><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200073#WRL04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Value for Money Reviews","counter":526,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200073#WRL04300"},{"type":"question","counter":527,"qnumday":254,"qnumall":"[43335\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200073#WRL04400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the details of each value for money and policy review conducted by his Department from 1 January 2018 to 1 January 2019; the cost of each exercise; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":528,"content":"<p>Value for money reviews are part of an ongoing process of expenditure evaluation and are carried out under the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s Public Spending Code.<\/p><p>The purpose of these reviews is to examine spending in specific areas to provide a strong evidential basis on which more informed decisions can be made.

the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":669,"content":"<p>The National Service Plan 2019 set a target to deliver 18.26 million hours to over 53,000 people, including 360,000 hours as part of an Intensive Home care Package. \u00a0By the end of July more than 10 million hours of home support had been delivered nationally and almost 52,000 people were in receipt of the service.\u00a0\u00a0 The latest preliminary data available to me indicates that this has increased to over 11.8 million hours by the end of August.<\/p>  <p>  Despite this significant level of provision, demand for home support continues to grow and nationally over 7,000 people have been assessed and are waiting for either new or additional services.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Arrangements for home supports have developed over the years with a significant local focus and it is acknowledged by the HSE that there may be a considerable variation in access to services in different parts of the country.\u00a0\u00a0 The recent report from the ESRI, published in July of this year, &ldquo;Geographic Profile of Healthcare Needs and Non-Acute Healthcare Supply in Ireland&rdquo; highlighted this variation across counties and regions.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge that in some cases access to the service may take longer than we would like. However, the HSE has assured the Department that people on the waiting list are reviewed, as funding becomes available, to ensure that individual cases continue to be dealt with on a priority basis within the available resources and as determined by the local front line staff who know and understand the clients&rsquo; needs, and who undertake regular reviews of those care needs to ensure that the services being provided remain appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  In line with commitments given in the Programme for Government we have made improved access to home support services a priority in Budget 2020. An additional investment of &euro;52 million is being made in 2020 which will provide over 19.2 million hours of home support.\u00a0This is 1 million hours more than the 2019 target and represents a substantial increase in service provision.\u00a0 This investment is focused on enabling older people to remain at home and, as appropriate, provision of hours will also be targeted at times of peak demand, at the beginning and end of the year, to ensure more timely egress from hospital for older people.<\/p>  <p>  While the existing home support service is delivering crucial support to many people across the country, it needs to be improved to better meet the changing needs of our citizens.\u00a0\u00a0 The Department of Health is currently developing plans for a new statutory scheme and system of regulation for home support services for older people and adults with a disability. Included in this investment is dedicated funding for the testing of the new statutory home-support scheme in 2020.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The design of the new scheme will involve the establishment of a model of service with a streamlined central system of administration to improve and simplify how people access home-support services. While the administration of the scheme will be centralised, the delivery of services will be co-ordinated at local level in line with a person&rsquo;s assessed need. A core component of the Scheme and the testing phase will be the implementation of InterRAI, as the standardised assessment tool for determining need under the new scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200075#WRN04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres Provision","counter":670,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200075#WRN04500"},{"type":"question","counter":671,"qnumday":307,"qnumall":"[43079\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200075#WRN04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans for the Drimnagh, Dublin 12, primary healthcare centre; if it is provided for in the 2020 HSE capital budget; if planning permission will expire in November 2019 should the project not commence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":672,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of public healthcare services and infrastructure projects.

The report covers the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both:<\/p><p>1. the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and<\/p><p>2. an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures.<\/p><p>This report was published on the Department of Health website on 21 November 2018. <\/p><p>The CMO&rsquo;s Report identifies that for many women, surgical procedures using synthetic mesh devices have provided a more effective and less invasive form of treatment than traditional SUI and POP procedures. However, mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women. These are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.<\/p><p>The Report makes 19 recommendations including:<\/p><p>- the development of patient information and informed consent materials;<\/p><p>- surgical professional training and multidisciplinary expertise in units carrying out mesh procedures;<\/p><p>- the development of clinical guidance;<\/p><p>- the development of information systems to monitor the ongoing use of mesh devices;<\/p><p>- ensuring the reporting of mesh related complications; and<\/p><p>- ensuring timely, appropriate and accessible care pathways for the management of women with complications.<\/p><p>In advance of the report&rsquo;s completion, the HSE was requested in May 2018 to begin work immediately on the development of national standardised patient information and informed consent materials and the\u00a0clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering serious complications. <\/p><p>The HSE was also asked by the Chief Medical Officer on 24 July 2018 to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so, pending confirmation by the HSE of the implementation of recommendations relating to (i) professional training requirements, (ii) patient information and consent and (iii) the development and maintenance of a national data set for all mesh procedures carried out in HSE funded hospitals.<\/p><p>A Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group was convened by the HSE, to advise on and progress all of the recommendations which included three patient representatives, as well as representatives of the HPRA, the IOG, the RCSI, the CFI and all Hospital Groups to advise on and action all of the recommendations above. <\/p><p>I am informed that\u00a0an ongoing work programme for the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications\u00a0is being progressed by the HSE. This work includes identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally to provide comprehensive aftercare services.\u00a0<\/p><p>I am pleased to note that funding has been identified within the HSE in 2019 to provide a package of care for women already identified with urgent or immediate needs. I understand that the Department of Health and the HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme will continue to engage in relation to the ongoing care needs of women impacted by mesh complications. <\/p><p>As was requested by the Secretary General of my Department in November 2018, the HSE prepared an Implementation Plan for the complete set of recommendations set out in the CMO&rsquo;s Report, which was approved by the Leadership Team in the HSE and published on the HSE website on 26 April 2019. I am informed that the HSE has advised that a further detailed progress report on implementation of the recommendations will be provided to my Department in the coming weeks.\u00a0<\/p><p>The HSE has published a dedicated webpage about vaginal mesh implants, including contact information for women suffering complications, which I hope is a useful resource.\u00a0This can be found on the HSE website. <\/p><p>I would strongly encourage all women affected by mesh to engage with the relevant HSE contact points provided, to ensure that their service needs can be identified and provided for.<\/p><p>At my meeting with the Mesh Survivors Ireland Group on 7 March 2019 I agreed to continue engagement with them on a pathway forward, to ensure that\u00a0the ongoing clinical management of this patient group is in line with international best practice and emerging evidence.

the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":903,"content":"<p>My Department and I were kept informed of an external review commissioned in 2017 by University of Limerick Hospitals Group (ULHG), regarding patients with CPE and concerns regarding whether CPE was a factor in the deaths of a number of these patients. An internal review was also conducted. The final report, 'Report on the death of patients in whom CPE had been detected', combines the two review findings and was published in October 2018. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware that the final Report was produced on foot of concerns raised under Protected Disclosures procedures and also concern by ULHG about the increase in detection of CPE in UHL in recent years. <\/p>  <p>  I note that the Report found that out of a final group of 73 patients in which CPE was detected from February 2009 to May 2017, 8 patient deaths were identified in whom CPE was considered to be a contributory factor. The conclusion of the external review, however, which ULHG has accepted, was that no deaths were a direct result of CPE acquisition. All 8 patients had serious underlying diseases and co-morbidity factors. In addition, of the remaining 65 deceased patients, the external reviewer concluded that CPE was found not to have been an associative factor in their deaths. This is an important finding and will inform the work already ongoing in my Department and the HSE to tackle healthcare associated infections and antimicrobial resistance (HCAI\/AMR). <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that since the first outbreak of CPE in a group of patients at UHL in 2011, the Hospital Group has been active in screening for CPE. ULHG have advised that they limited its spread within the hospital through enhanced 'cohorting' or isolating of patients known to be carriers of or those infected with this bacteria. Screening protocols have been in place at UHL for a number of years and indeed have been used as a template for the development of the national screening policy for CPE, published in February 2018. Measures taken by the ULHG over the past three years include the refurbishment of an inpatient ward at UHL to facilitate an Infection Prevention and Control (IP&amp;C) isolation ward; a second ward at UHL has also been refurbished. The new Emergency Department which opened at UHL in May 2017 was designed with IP&amp;C in mind and has facilitated the management of relevant patients in en-suite isolation rooms. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has provided funding to expand the HSE HCAI\/AMR National Team to progress work on HCAIs\/AMR across the HSE, including Hospital Groups and Community Healthcare Organisations. My Department has also provided funding for additional capacity in IP&amp;C and laboratory services. This includes new posts for University Hospital Limerick. <\/p>  <p>  I have been previously assured that ULHG have measures in place to appropriately support and manage patient care needs in line with national and international best practice. <\/p>  <p>  The challenges of CPE are not unique to UHL. In October 2017, I convened the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) as a result of the activation of the Public Health Emergency Plan, as a public health response to CPE in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together on this important issue. This is also in line with the priorities identified under Ireland's National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance 2017-2020. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the enhanced surveillance of CPE established via the National Public Health Emergency Team, the HPSC now publishes a monthly CPE surveillance report. This surveillance report includes national data on rates of CPE infection and colonisation as well as data on outbreaks, screening and other related information. The information is available for all hospitals including UHL. Data are available from December 2017 and all reports are available on the HPSC&rsquo;s website hpsc.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200078#WRQ07100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":904,"content":"<p>Question No. 389 answered with Question No. 279.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospitals Capital Programme","counter":906,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200079#WRR00200"},{"type":"question","counter":907,"qnumday":390,"qnumall":"[43401\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200079#WRR00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the capital works programmes planned for Beaumont Hospital, Dublin 9 for the remainder of 2019 and 2020;

Ireland has a binding EU target of 12% by 2020. The 2019 Climate Action Plan recognises the need to lift our ambition in regards to the use of renewable energy. The Plan contains a range of actions across different sectors of society in relation to the use of renewable energy, together with clear timelines for completion.   The Support Scheme for Renewable Heat has been developed to financially support the adoption of renewable heating systems by commercial, industrial, agricultural, district heating and other non-domestic heat users not covered by the EU Emissions Trading System.The first phase of the scheme, an installation grant for heat pumps, opened for applications in September 2018. Following EU State aid approval, the second phase of the scheme, an operational support for biomass boilers and anaerobic digestion heating systems, opened for applications in June of this year. Under this phase of the scheme, eligible renewable energy technologies will be supported through a multi-annual payment, for a period of up to 15 years, on the basis of prescribed tariffs. Under Project Ireland 2040, the National Development Plan sets out an allocation of &euro;300 million for the roll-out of the scheme for the period up to 2027. A capital allocation of &euro;5 million was provided for the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat in 2019. As part of Budget 2020, a similar allocation of &euro;5 million has been allocated for 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Applications received are evaluated by SEAI, who administer the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat. To date a total of 53 applications have been received by SEAI.

This is a financial safeguard that was included in the Government decision approving the scheme. It places an overall limit on the State's annual expenditure in any given year and is one of a number of measures put in place based on lessons learned from similar schemes in other jurisdictions. Following Budget 2020, the Annual Budget Cap was set at &euro;5 million. <\/p>  <p>  The first Letters of Offer under the second phase of the scheme were issued, by SEAI, on 16 October.

While the NTA assimilated most of the functions of the previous Dublin Transportation Office (DTO), it also took on a deeper and wider remit under the terms of the 2008 and 2009 Acts, and subsequent legislation.  The NTA&rsquo;s main focus is on planning, development, regulation and funding of public transport &ndash; e.g. through securing the provision of Public Service Obligation (PSO) bus and rail services nationally, licensing commercial bus operations, and regulating the taxi industry &ndash; and it also has an important role in relation to active travel.  The NTA also has particular statutory responsibilities in relation to the planning and development of transport throughout the Greater Dublin Area.  On relevant matters, it works closely with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, which has responsibility relating to infrastructure procurement and operation.<\/p><p>On establishment, the budget for the NTA&rsquo;s operation comprised the allocation previously provided for the DTO:  Exchequer funds of &euro;1.012 million directly, plus &euro;1.3 million via a range of transport agency sources.

Low pay and poor working conditions in the sector remain a serious concern and impact on the quality of provision to children through their effect on the recruitment and retention of qualified staff. The lack of consistency of care caused by high staff turnover impacts directly on quality, while low wages are a constraint on plans to upskill and professionalise the workforce. My support for improved pay and conditions for early learning and care professionals has been explicit, as their role is critical to supporting children&rsquo;s development and delivering better outcomes for children and families.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2020 saw a 9% increase in investment in early learning and care and school age childcare. Additional investment of &euro;54.5m will bring spending to &euro;628m in 2020, a 138% increase in investment over five budgets. The very welcome level of investment needs to continue if we are to offer services that are of high quality, affordable and accessible. However, increased investment by itself will not ensure that staff wages and conditions will improve.<\/p>  <p>  As the State is not the employer, my Department does not pay the wages of staff working in early learning and care settings, and I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for these staff.<\/p>  <p>  I am, however, doing all that is in my power to improve wages and working conditions in the\u00a0sector. I have repeatedly called for the\u00a0sector\u00a0to pursue a\u00a0Sectoral Employment Order. My Department will readily co-operate with such a process when it is under way.<\/p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme will launch in November 2020. This will represent a landmark moment for the early learning and care and school age childcare sector in this country. The new scheme will provide the necessary infrastructure, for the first time, to enable increased State investment be funnelled into the sector, not only targeted at low income families, but, as increased investment becomes available, to middle income families also. It will enable us move away from being one of the most expensive countries in the OECD for childcare.<\/p>  <p>  The NCS is based on hourly subsidies for different age groups. These subsidies were calculated to reflect the cost of provision and the higher costs associated with certain quality measures, eg. the highest subsidy is paid for babies where the regulatory requirement is one staff member to 3 children. The subsidies can be increased to respond to higher costs that may be linked to, for example, better terms and conditions of staff. In this way, the sophistication of the design of the scheme will allow it respond, over time, to policy development to support improved pay and conditions.<\/p>  <p>  Alongside increased funding for the National Childcare Scheme in Budget 2020, I secured increased funding for the\u00a0sustainability fund for the sector. This will see funding to support sustainability rising from &euro;1.7m to &euro;2.2m per annum.\u00a0The fund will assist high quality services which are experiencing financial difficulties to transition themselves to a sustainable footing, and will also assist with needs arising in the event that the Labour Court introduces a Sectoral Employment Order.<\/p>  <p>  Other recent measures I have also taken to assist employers to improve the pay and conditions of their staff whilst also addressing administrative demands include: a 7% increase in ECCE capitation in 2018; higher capitation payments for graduates and Inclusion Coordinators; annual Programme Support Payments to recognise administrative demands; support for school-age childcare which will make it easier to offer full-time, full year employment contracts; and a pilot measure to fund participation in CPD. In April I announced capital funding for service providers who sign up to the National Childcare Scheme. This funding allowed service providers to purchase ICT support which will assist them in recording and reporting children&rsquo;s attendance.<\/p>  <p>  I have set out my vision for the sector, and a roadmap to achieve it, in\u00a0First 5, which contains a commitment to develop a Workforce Development Plan. This Plan, work on which began in recent months, will identify measures to ensure appropriate numbers of early learning and care and school-age childcare staff at all levels in the sector, to achieve a graduate-led workforce by 2028, to ensure an appropriate focus on both centre based and home based services, and to raise the profile of careers in the sector.

International  research suggests that long-term harms may result from chronic, 'toxic' stress  during childhood. The research indicates that stress arises when children are routinely exposed to factors  such as physical abuse, neglect, substance abuse in the home, or other negative  experiences. Such childhood stressors are known as Adverse Childhood Experiences  (ACEs). Pilot work on ACE application is ongoing in five cross border projects. <\/p>  <p>  However, while ACEs may be a useful research tool, it is  important to acknowledge that the chief object of prevention and early  intervention approaches is to build sustainable, resilient communities for all.  The role of prevention and early intervention within the continuum of care is  not merely to combat risk and emerging issues, but to heighten the positives in  the lives of children and young people. This includes educational engagement,  positive health behaviours and confident\u00a0parenting.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department has  developed a robust suite of structures which support such high-quality, evidence  informed prevention and early intervention approaches. The Area Based Childhood  (ABC) Programme, delivered as part of Tusla&rsquo;s wider Prevention, Partnership and  Family Support (PPFS) Programme, aims to test and evaluate prevention and early  intervention approaches to improve outcomes for children, young people and  families living in poverty in 13 areas of disadvantage across Ireland. It  complements the work of Tusla under PPFS to support a paradigm shift towards  prevention and earlier intervention support.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  At a county level, Children  and Young People&rsquo;s Services Committees (CYPSC) act as a driver of inter-agency  working and collaboration to improve outcomes for children and young people.  CYPSC bring together a diverse group of agencies in their local areas to engage  in joint planning of services for children and young people.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  'What  Works' is my Department&rsquo;s initiative to support high quality, evidence-informed  prevention and early intervention approaches across the system of policy,  provision and practice. What Works is designed to nurture, grow and champion  evidence-informed prevention and early intervention approaches. What Works aims  to enhance the use and availability of data and evidence; support capacity  development; and ensure quality at the levels of policy, service and  provision.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  What Works is designed not merely to address challenging  areas, but to recognise the good work parents, practitioners, providers, and  policymakers are already doing and support them to keep doing it. It aims to  secure the best possible return on the State&rsquo;s significant investment in  prevention and early intervention services in the past  decade.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Considerable work has gone into raising the profile and practice  of prevention and early intervention in the recent past. My Department ensured  that earlier intervention and prevention was included as a transformation goal  in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children  and Young People 2014 &ndash; 2020. I am pleased that continued emphasis on this area  has stimulated development with supportive partners in Tusla PPFS and the  community and voluntary sector. I will ensure prevention and early intervention  continues to be foregrounded in future policy statements published by my  Department and developments in this area\u00a0will in due course take into account the evaluation of the pilot work on ACE projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200085#WRX07500","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Abuse","counter":1408,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200086#WRY00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1409,"qnumday":566,"qnumall":"[43580\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200086#WRY00300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extent to which she remains satisfied that sufficient staff with the appropriate qualifications remain available to her Department to address such issues as child abuse; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1410,"content":"<p>I am informed by Tusla that as of the end of June 2019, the most recent verified figures available, there were 5,759 cases awaiting allocation of a social worker.<\/p><p>Tusla has confirmed that of these cases, 991\u00a0(17.2%) were categorised as high priority; 1,868\u00a0(32.4%)\u00a0cases were low priority; and 2,900\u00a0(50.4%)\u00a0were medium\u00a0priority.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The priority level assigned to the case is based on the resources required to address the case, rather than on risk to the child.\u00a0\u00a0I am informed that all urgent and emergency cases receive immediate attention by the local duty social work team.  <\/p><p>It is important to note that CORU is required to accredit courses for the education and training of all social workers, as well as registering individual social workers.

The Action Plan involves a wide range of actions, across six Government Departments &ndash; Communications, Climate Action and Environment; Education and Skills; Justice and Equality; Children and Youth Affairs; Health; and Business Enterprise and Innovation, recognising that online safety is not the responsibility of just one Department and signifying the range and breadth of the issues involved. A Sponsors Group, involving the six Departments and chaired by the Department of Education and Skills, has been established to drive implementation of the Action Plan.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the Action Plan for Online Safety, my Department committed to amending the Children First Guidance to include a specific reference to the need to consider online safety in the completion of a Child Safeguarding Statement. An addendum to the Guidance, clarifying the need to consider online safety in the preparation of risk assessments and Child Safeguarding Statements, was finalised and published on my Department&rsquo;s website in January.\u00a0 In addition, Tusla has revised its template for the completion of Child Safeguarding Statements to refer to the need to consider online risks to children if a service provides access to the internet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200086#WRY00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Abuse","counter":1414,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200086#WRY00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1415,"qnumday":568,"qnumall":"[43582\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200086#WRY00900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the degree to which her Department or bodies under her aegis can quickly respond to and take appropriate action in response to reports of suspected child abuse; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":1416,"qnumday":569,"qnumall":"[43583\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200086#WRY01000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the extent to which she has available to her Department the adequate resources to respond to and treat children that may be the subject of physical, mental or sexual abuse; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":1417,"qnumday":573,"qnumall":"[43588\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200086#WRY01100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the degree to which her Department remains alert to and can respond quickly to all forms of child abuse; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1418,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 568, 569 and 573 together.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is the statutory body with responsibility for child protection and welfare services.\u00a0 If I, or my officials, become aware of a situation in which a child is considered to be\u00a0 at risk, that concern is communicated to Tusla as a matter of urgency.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  If a child appears to be at risk of harm or neglect,\u00a0 the concerns should be reported to Tusla. Anyone can report a concern about a child to Tusla, and information on how to do so is available on the Tusla website. \u00a0If a child is at immediate risk or in danger, the Garda&iacute; should be alerted without delay.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Tusla act urgently on notification of\u00a0an immediate risk to a child. Children who are in a situation of immediate risk\u00a0may initially be dealt with\u00a0by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or by\u00a0Tusla, but in the main both\u00a0agencies work together in such cases.\u00a0 Tusla, when alerted to a child at immediate risk, for instance a young child left alone at home or abandoned, will contact\u00a0AGS if the child needs to be removed from that situation.<\/p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; have specific powers under Section 12 of the Child Care Act to remove a child from a situation of danger, and under Section 13 of that same act to deliver that child into the custody of Tusla. Tusla will at that point carry out an assessment to determine the child's needs. This may in some cases include applying for an Emergency Care Order. \u00a0In all cases, a plan will be put in place to ensure that the child is safe from harm.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla\u00a0have implemented\u00a0Signs of Safety, a child protection methodology which has at its core the involvement of the child in any assessment and decision making process.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Timely response to reported concerns is a key objective for Tusla, and my Departments officials work closely with the senior management team to reduce waiting times, including through investment in partnership, prevention and family support services that provide for a community-led response to referrals that do not reach the threshold for a child protection or social-work led intervention.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In 2015, the Children First Act placed key elements of the Children First National Guidance on a statutory basis. The Act provides for a number of key child protection required measures including mandated reporting of child protection concerns to the Child and Family Agency by designated persons, compliance with best practice in child protection as set out in the Children First Guidance, and development of\u00a0an organisation-specific Child Safeguarding Statement. Organisations providing service to children are obliged to identify areas of risk to children\u00a0 in their services and to set out mitigating factors. The Safeguarding Statement is to be\u00a0 made available publicly.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Tusla also\u00a0has a dedicated Quality Assurance Team. This team produces monthly, quarterly and annual reports in respect of Tusla's functions, including detailed reporting on child safety and protection services. Tusla provides monthly, quarterly and annual information on children in care, their placement type, care status and allocation of social workers and these are published on their website. My officials scrutinise these reports and brief me and the Secretary General on issues of note. The reports provide statistical evidence of improvements to child welfare and protection services and highlights challenges and areas where further improvement is required, such as the recruitment of additional social workers.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department meet Tusla management on a regular basis to review the level of service provision, including areas in need of improvement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200086#WRY01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bullying in the Workplace","counter":1419,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200086#WRY01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1420,"qnumday":570,"qnumall":"[43585\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200086#WRY01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of reports of bullying reported to her Department in the past 12 months;

payment of social security if they wish to continue to enjoy benefits here and in other member states in the event of a no-deal Brexit or with a Brexit deal (details supplied).","asker":"1336","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1464,"content":"<p>In the context of Brexit, it is important to underline that, under any scenario, Irish citizens will continue to have EU citizenship wherever they reside. They will continue to enjoy the right to live and work throughout the EU and the right not to be discriminated against on the grounds of nationality.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, in any scenario the Government will continue to work with the UK to underline that the rights and entitlements of Irish citizens living in Northern Ireland are of fundamental importance and must be protected in accordance with the Good Friday Agreement. There is also an onus on the UK government to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and it should ensure that these issues, including possible future UK participation in EU funds and programmes, are part of its position for the detailed discussions on the EU-UK future relationship. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to be clear that the Common Travel Area will also be maintained in all circumstances, and this allows Irish citizens and British citizens to access a range of similar rights in each other&rsquo;s countries on a reciprocal basis, including access to healthcare and education. This is particularly important for the ways in which people live on the island of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In the event of a no deal Brexit, under the Common Travel Area, Irish citizens and British citizens in each other&rsquo;s state have the right to access social security benefits on the same basis as citizens of that state. This includes reciprocal arrangements for social insurance schemes, social assistance schemes and child benefit. The Government is committed to ensuring that the reciprocity of social welfare rights and entitlements, which currently exist for Irish and British citizens within the Common Travel Area, are safeguarded and maintained.<\/p>  <p>  Because of the unique nature of the Common Travel Area and the associated rights and privileges which it provides and will continue to provide for Irish and British citizens in each other&rsquo;s countries, Ireland and the United Kingdom have formalised the pre-existing Common Travel Area social security\u00a0arrangements in a legally binding agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, all existing arrangements regarding social insurance entitlements will be maintained in Ireland and the UK. This means that Irish citizens living in Ireland maintain the right to benefit from social insurance contributions made when working in the UK and to access social insurance payments if living in the UK and vice versa.\u00a0\u00a0This is in keeping with the current EU social security coordination practices, whereby\u00a0a person ordinarily pays social security contributions in the\u00a0country in which they work (rather than reside).<\/p>  <p>  The Protocol on Ireland\/Northern Ireland (that is an integral part of the Agreement on the Withdrawal of the UK from the EU, and which has now been endorsed by the European Council and agreed with the UK Government) confirms the Union citizenship of Irish citizens in Northern Ireland. The Protocol also confirms that Irish citizens in Northern Ireland, &ldquo;will continue to enjoy, exercise and have access to rights opportunities and benefits&rdquo; that come with EU citizenship.<\/p>  <p>  How best to ensure the access of those entitled to Irish citizenship in Northern Ireland to specific EU benefits - such as in the areas of social security - will be addressed as appropriate during the period of transition and in the context of the future relationship. To this end, the Government will continue to proactively engage to ensure that people in Northern Ireland enjoy access to EU rights, opportunities and benefits into the future. Ireland will continue to seek - to the greatest extent possible - the maintenance of the status quo. <\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to proactively engage to ensure that people in Northern Ireland continue to enjoy access to EU rights, opportunities, and benefits in to the future.\u00a0 The Government has made commitments in respect of access to the benefits of the European Health Insurance Card and the Erasmus+ programme in the context of a no deal scenario and the Government is committed to achieving the outcome that the people of Northern Ireland can access these entitlements in any circumstance. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that in the event of an orderly Brexit, under Article 18 of the Withdrawal Agreement, the transition period would ensure no change in terms of access under EU law until December 2020 at the earliest.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200086#WRY05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals","counter":1465,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200086#WRY06000"},{"type":"question","counter":1466,"qnumday":586,"qnumall":"[42968\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200086#WRY06100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of an application by a person (details supplied);

A number of Architectural Technologists have already succeeded in gaining inclusion on the statutory registers to date and are thus in a position to act as Design Certifiers and Assigned Certifiers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200088#WRAA07300","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Bodies","counter":1628,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200088#WRAA07400"},{"type":"question","counter":1629,"qnumday":640,"qnumall":"[43175\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200088#WRAA07500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the engagement he has had on the Cork Events Centre now responsibility has been transferred to his Department.","asker":"1276","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1630,"content":"<p>Responsibility for the advancement of proposals for the development of the Cork Events Centre remains, in the first instance, a matter for Cork City Council.\u00a0 It was agreed in the context of Budget 2020 that responsibility at central government level would transfer to my Department.\u00a0 Discussions in relation to the transfer\u00a0process are underway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200088#WRAA07600","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Adaptation Grant","counter":1632,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200089#WRBB00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1633,"qnumday":641,"qnumall":"[43252\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019102200089#WRBB00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"when the additional funding request of &euro;500,000 for Kildare County Council to fund housing adaptations for social housing tenants under category A (category 1) and category B (category 2) will be approved (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1324","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1634,"content":"<p>The Disabled Persons Grants (DPG) Scheme applies to\u00a0works\u00a0that are necessary to address the needs of older people or people with a disability in local authority housing.\u00a0This may involve minor adaptations such as stair-lifts, grabs-rails, showers, wet-rooms, ramps etc.\u00a0It also provides funding for more major adaptations such as extensions,\u00a0for example in the case of overcrowding,\u00a0or the\u00a0installation of a downstairs bedroom or bathroom.<\/p>  <p>  Some &euro;15 million has been made available under the scheme in 2019, an increase of over &euro;1 million on 2018 levels.\u00a0 On top of this exchequer funding, the local authority makes a further 10% contribution in respect of these grants.

Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018-2027 sets out the Government&rsquo;s objectives for capital investment in Ireland&rsquo;s culture, language and heritage. The plan includes a total of &euro;40 million, or &euro;4 million in each of the 10 years from 2018 to 2027 to secure existing investment in arts and culture infrastructure nationwide and ensure a regional balance.  A total of &euro;3.9m was spent on arts and culture infrastructure in 2018.   This level of investment will ensure the upkeep of regional infrastructure right across the country.<\/p>  <p>  The recent Arts and Culture Capital Scheme allocated &euro;10.214m to 134 projects under three complementary grant streams for the refurbishment and enhancement of the existing arts and culture facilities throughout the country.  Over &euro;2.5m of this was drawn down in 2018 and to date in 2019 and over &euro;7.2m remains to be paid out over the coming years.  This is the most significant investment in cultural infrastructure in a decade with funding provided to arts centres, theatres, galleries and museums, artists&rsquo; studios and creative spaces. The list of these projects with the amounts of their allocations is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p>  <p>  The Arts and Culture Capital Scheme is making a huge difference to many individual organisations and my Department is already seeing good outcomes and receiving positive feedback. <\/p>  <p>  The Arts Council in conjunction with local government through the County and City Management Association recently commissioned CHL Consulting Company to undertake an independent, strategic review of the network of venues and arts centres across the country.  The review focused on the infrastructure of professionally-managed arts buildings that are open to the public throughout the year.  A consultation phase was incorporated into the study and stakeholders had an opportunity to participate.  The resulting Review of Arts Centres and Venues provided a valuable input to develop a coordinated, spatially-informed strategy to support and develop the built infrastructure for the arts.  The Review was published in June 2019.  The Arts Council subsequently published its Arts Centre Policy which sets out its funding criteria for arts centres from 2020 onwards.  <\/p>  <p>   My Department is currently giving consideration to a new round of grant funding for Arts and Cultural Capital and the reviews have informed the Department's framing for the next round of arts and culture capital funding.
