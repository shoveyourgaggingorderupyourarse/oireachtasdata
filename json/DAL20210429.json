These may persist for months or years afterwards, perhaps compounded by economic impacts.  Surveys have shown an increased number of people reporting symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression during the pandemic. <\/p><p>Many people are experiencing emotional difficulties, including boredom, sadness and loneliness.  In anticipation of this, and early in the pandemic, a range of psychosocial responses was introduced, including self-help supports, which promote positive physical and mental health.  The Keep Well campaign provides practical advice, empowering individuals to maintain and improve their overall well-being.  <\/p><p>Digital initiatives were rapidly enhanced to enable services to meet not only current demand but new and emerging need.  Technology has aided the provision of seven-day tele-mental health supports, including <i>YourMentalHealth.ie<\/i>, the information line 1800 111 888, the crisis text line 50808 and NGO online supports.  These include one-to-one counselling and group and peer supports delivered through MyMind and SilverCloud.  MyMind provides free online counselling in 15 languages to people in communities nationwide.  Online activity has increased and there is capacity for upsurges in demand.<\/p><p>The HSE already has a range of proactive responses for any increase in service need, including online and other telehealth and psychosocial supports.  The HSE&rsquo;s psychosocial framework, published in January 2021, recognises the impact of Covid on mental health and provides for five key levels of support, from mental health promotion to specialist services. The framework provides a co-ordinated, consistent and collaborative approach to the provision of mental health services and supports during and beyond the pandemic.<\/p><p>HSE mental health services have continued to operate throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.  Early in the pandemic, the HSE moved rapidly, under public health guidelines, to deliver community mental health services where possible, with digital health models adopted for service user and staff safety.  High support residential placements have continued.<\/p><p>Overall, specialist mental health services, community and acute, are operating at between 85% and 90% of pre-pandemic levels.  While referral rates are below normal, the level of appointments offered and waiting times to access community services have remained consistent with previous years.  This is despite adaptations to service delivery due to the considerable challenges posed by Covid.<\/p><p>There is no doubt that this shows the ongoing dedication of mental health staff to ensuring service continuity.  I express my sincere thanks to all those working across the services for their hard work and dedication during what has been an incredibly challenging and difficult time.<\/p><p>In anticipation of a surge in requirement for mental health hospital beds, the HSE has worked with private hospitals on additional acute and longer term beds to free up public capacity.  Some &euro;13.65 million has been allocated for this specific purpose.<\/p><p>Underlining the Government&rsquo;s commitment to mental health, budget 2021 saw an increase of &euro;50 million, bringing the total mental health budget to over 1.1 billion.  This is the largest budget on record.  Furthermore, it does not take account of additional funding allocated to mental health in other areas of the health system or through other Departments such as justice, education and social protection.<\/p><p>Of the additional funding for 2021, &euro;23 million is for implementation of many of the short-term recommendations of Sharing the Vision - A Mental Health Policy for Everyone.  This will fund 153 new staff in community mental health services, including 29 posts for child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, teams and telehealth hubs, bereavement counselling, employment supports and crisis resolution teams.  It will also fund development of the national clinical programmes and models of care, including the Talking Therapies model of care, which I launched last week.<\/p><p>I have also secured the availability of &euro;3.94 million for the national clinical programme on eating disorders this year.  This will fund the establishment of three new specialist eating disorder teams and complete the three existing teams.  I am aware of the increase in numbers and acuity of people presenting with eating disorders and I am fully committed to ensuring this funding is invested in full in 2021 and that we also see a continuation of the funding until we have all 16 teams in post.<\/p><p>I am also actively working with the Department and the HSE to develop a targeted initiative to significantly reduce the number of children and young people under 18 waiting more than 12 months for psychology in primary care.  To supplement this, an additional &euro;150 million is being provided for the enhanced community care programme, which will include recruitment of over 2,000 front-line primary care staff, to support a new community health network model.<\/p><p>It would be remiss of me not to provide some assurances about the range of processes that have been put in place to review the care received by children and young people who attended south Kerry CAMHS between 2016 and 2020.  In light of concerns raised about the care given in some cases, the HSE will review the details of a very large number of young people, 1,500, who engaged with the service during this time.  A CAMHS consultant has been in direct contact with all young persons or their families where concerns have been raised to date, and this process will continue as the review is undertaken.  As the team reviews cases and files, any urgent issues will be dealt with immediately.<\/p><p>It is expected that the look-back review process will take in the region of 16 weeks.  The HSE will share the findings and recommendations once the process is completed.  A helpline has been put in place until 30  April.  However, demand has been low.  I am keeping this matter under close review in consultation, as appropriate, with other relevant areas in the Department and the HSE.<\/p><p>While a range of post-pandemic mental health and psychosocial challenges are likely to arise, a negative mental health outcome for our population from the pandemic is avoidable if we respond to the challenge in a cohesive manner.  As Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, I assure the House of my full dedication to addressing the challenges that this represents.  <\/p><p>The pandemic has posed the biggest challenges for those most at risk, including our older people.  We recognise that there is still a long road ahead.  However, there is much cause for us to feel optimistic.  The Government will continue to make every effort to ensure the vaccine roll-out is successful so that we can all look forward to the restrictions being lifted as we move into summer.<\/p><p>Administration of the vaccine is well advanced as the programme continues to prioritise those who are most at risk of severe illness and death from Covid-19.  The positive impact of the vaccine roll-out to date has been significant.<\/p><p>Between January and last week, there had been a 98% reduction in cases among healthcare workers, a 99% reduction of incidence in those aged over 85 and a 100% reduction in the incidence in nursing homes.  For the third week in a row, there have been no cases associated with outbreaks in nursing homes.<\/p> <p>In recognition of the positive impact of the vaccine across nursing homes, new guidance on visiting will come into effect on 4 May allowing residents to receive four visits every week.<\/p> <p> Work to progress the implementation of the expert panel report will continue as it provides an important framework for the ongoing response to Covid-19 and longer term reform.  The availability of supports to all nursing homes continues, including financial assistance, staff accommodation, personal protective equipment, PPE, serial testing and HSE Covid-19 response teams, where needed.  <\/p> <p> A dedicated system has been established to ensure all those awaiting a vaccination at home will be contacted in the coming days.  This has been ongoing all week.  The National Ambulance Service has been working hard to process referrals received for the programme.  It is currently undertaking approximately 400 appointments per week.  Over 3,500 referrals have been received as part of the housebound programme.  To date, there have been 1,800 first doses and 500 second doses of vaccine administered.  Of the more than 3,500 people referred, not all may be deemed suitable for a vaccine on assessment.  I reassure those who are still awaiting a vaccination that the HSE will make direct contact with them and will administer the vaccine within a three-week period.  This is week one.  Of note, there has been considerable progress on the vaccine roll-out among the over-70s, with more than 95% of this age cohort having received a first dose of the vaccine.  <\/p> <p> This year, an additional &euro;150 million has been provided to deliver on the Government's commitment to increase home care hours.  This includes &euro;17 million to progress the development of a statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home support services.  This brings the total investment in home support, including winter funding, to &euro;666.5 million in 2021.<\/p> <p> I am pleased to advise the House that, on 27 April, the Government approved the drafting of a general scheme and heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for publicly funded, for-profit and not-for-profit home support providers.  As part of the wider reform of the model of service delivery for home support, the Department is finalising business cases with the HSE on the key enablers of the statutory scheme.<\/p> <p> A key priority for me currently is the resumption of day care services, and I will continue to engage with senior officials within the Department and HSE to ensure that as many services as possible can reopen as soon as it is safe.  The HSE is focused on delivering on this priority, and a dedicated focus group is in place to drive and oversee a plan to resume these services as soon as possible.<\/p> <p> The nursing homes support scheme continues to deliver affordable and accessible nursing home care for citizens with long-term care needs.  Notwithstanding this, the programme for Government commits to introducing an amendment to the scheme to cap the financial assessment of family-owned and family-operated farms or businesses at three years when calculating the means to pay for nursing home care.<\/p> <p> A finalised draft of the Bill has now been signed by the Attorney General and I expect to bring the Bill to the Cabinet for approval next week.  I hope it will be before the House in four to six weeks. <\/p> <p> A range of initiatives and resources is available through the Understand Together campaign to ensure that people living with dementia stay safe, well and connected.  Primary care teams are referring people with dementia to community supports such as the local authority community response forums and the Alzheimer Society of Ireland dementia adviser service.  I am particularly pleased that additional funding for 2021 will ensure the recruitment of 11 new dementia advisers, bringing the expected total to 29 by the end of this year.  In line with the national dementia strategy, &euro;5 million has been allocated to support those with dementia this year, with a focus on six key initiatives.  A minimum of 5% of the 5 million home support hours for this year are allocated for people with dementia.  Taking into account the increased investment in the dementia adviser service and the national dementia strategy, this brings the total investment in dementia services to &euro;12.9 million this year.<\/p> <p> I am fully committed to further enhancing mental health and older people's services and look forward to Members' contributions today on these important areas of work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900003#A00200","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619687400,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  I welcome many of the initiatives she announced in her opening statement, particularly regarding surge capacity.  We have been calling for an initiative on surge capacity for a while.  It is very welcome.  I acknowledge the Minister of State's commitment to addressing eating disorder services but I wonder whether surge capacity can be used for people who are currently suffering from eating disorders while services are being put in place.  That would be very welcome.<\/p>  <p>  I have three further questions.  I will leave the Minister of State time at the end to get back to me.  She mentioned Kerry.  Recent disclosures that young people may have been prescribed adult doses of medication at a CAMH service in south Kerry are extremely concerning.  The gravity of the alleged breaches of clinical guidelines in Kerry is such that a national review should be mandated.  It should not just be a local review, as indicated in the Minister of State's opening statement.  How could this have gone undetected for four years?  Immense distress has been caused among the children and families directly involved but there is concern right across the State over whether this has happened in other areas.  That is why a national review is needed to determine whether the incident was isolated or is systemic right across the State.  Is the Minister of State going to institute an independent national review into this matter under her authority under the Mental Health Act 2001, which empowers her to direct the Inspector of Mental Health Services to take on such a task?<\/p>  <p>  Last week, we had a good debate on the Sinn F&eacute;in motion on mental health.  It was passed.  One of our asks, which was not mentioned in the Minister of State's opening statement, was for the Government to introduce a crisis de-escalation team.  This would involve a multi-agency approach that would include a mental health nurse and specially trained garda&iacute;.  They would call to persons having mental health difficulties in the community, triage them, treat them, refer them and bring them to the appropriate service where they can get the care they need when they need it.  Could I have an update on whether, or when, the Minister of State will be introducing this service?  Will it be a pilot?  Has she considered any locations?<\/p>  <p>  My last question is also on the motion last week.  Another objective of the motion was to ease access to talk therapy for people who need to talk about their mental health circumstances.  Especially because of Covid, many people are experiencing mental health difficulties for the very first time.  It is imperative that people have access to supports when and where they need them.  One of the barriers that general practitioners are telling me they face when referring patients to counsellors and psychotherapists is the Government's failure to regulate.  The therapists are fully qualified and accredited but they are waiting on CORU, which stated it will be at least five years before the counselling and psychotherapy professions will see any advance at all in the registration process.  Does the Minister of State have any update on the CORU registration process?  Will it just be put on the long finger?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900004#B00200","speaker":"1469"},{"type":"speech","time":1619687400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his continued interest in mental health and his constructive approach.  He welcomed the surge capacity, especially in regard to eating disorders.  There is no doubt but that, in respect of these disorders, we have seen an increase in referrals over the past year.  Four out of every five of those referred are young girls.  There are major issues with eating disorders and self-harm of which I have become aware.  I was delighted to reinstate the funding of &euro;3.94 million to populate the three existing teams and put three new teams in place this year.  We cannot stop there, however, as we have to make sure the full roll-out agreed in 2018 happens.<\/p>  <p>  On Kerry CAMHS, as referred to by the Deputy, it is important that we wait for the results of the review.  We can certainly consider whether a national review is required but the most important thing we can do is await the outcome of the review, which will take 16 weeks.  We will certainly consider it when it is issued.  I was very concerned when I heard of the scale, that there had to be a look-back in respect of 1,500 children and that what occurred went on for four years.  I look forward to seeing the results of the review.  We can discuss this matter again when the results are available.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the issues raised by Sinn F&eacute;in in its motion last week on the crisis teams and a pilot, we have not considered the matter since.

If something could be done, it would be fantastic.<\/p>  <p>  On the crisis de-escalation service, I attended a meeting of the Sub-Committee on Mental Health last week.

All the groups raised the issue of funding, not just in regard to the amount available but also the consistency and reliability of funding.  The lack of multi-annual funding is a major obstacle to their planning.  When will we be in a position to commit multi-annual funding for these groups?  The groups also raised the issue of the significant degree of red tape that their organisations have to navigate to achieve even small sums of funding.  I am all for accountability but there is too much red tape for small pockets of money.  We need to make the process easier for repeat applicants who have had prior approval.  These groups are saving lives.  One older person told me their self-isolation during Covid was spent looking out the window, waiting to die.  The groups have given older people some hope and a reason to live.  Will the Minister of State commit that something will be done about the red tape for repeat applicants please?<\/p>  <p>  Another issue that arose was that of housing for older people.  I know from personal experience that when someone's housing circumstances are precarious, his or her mental health will suffer.  I commend my colleagues Councillor Aidan Mullins in Laois and Councillor Noel Connolly in Kildare on recent motions they brought to their respective councils relating to housing for older people.  The Government needs to do more to provide suitable homes for older people.  Will the Minister of State support or bring forward proposals to deal with the provision of housing for older people?<\/p>  <p>  On the final issue, the completion of works on the Monasterevin day care centre, the Minister of State might be able to find out the answer or she might already know it herself.

On the first question, on mental health supports for older people, there are 1,000 mental health organisations throughout the country.  We work closely with many such NGOs and fund them to provide supports for us.  Nevertheless, it will always be the case that funding is made available at different times.  We have to ensure that anybody who applies for funding ticks the boxes because this is taxpayers' money.  There are so many different organisations and we want to avoid a duplication of services in different areas.  I will take on board the Deputy's comments on the red tape in the case of organisations that apply every year.<\/p>  <p>  On housing for older people, I had a meeting on the issue only a couple of weeks ago with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, while the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, has met the Minister at that Department, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  There are considerable opportunities to provide suitable housing for older people.  Many older people's families have grown up and there might be one older person living in perhaps a three-bedroom semi-detached home.  If such people had the opportunity to downsize to a small ground-floor home with the correct wraparound supports, they would give that consideration.

It is quite timely, on the day that is in it and also because of the volume of older people who have been vaccinated.  I will run through a few issues and, as I have little time, the Minister of State might respond to me separately.  I have direct experience of this issue, with very elderly parents in their 80s.  The past year and a half has been the worst of their lives, although they have been through tough times in the past.  My mother, who is my hero, turned 80 last March but, obviously, could not celebrate that.  A few weeks later, she was meant to complete her 15th year in a row working at the orphanages in Belarus but, obviously, that did not materialise.<\/p>  <p>  I had the misfortune to lose my mother-in-law suddenly a few months ago - not from Covid but suddenly.  I always remember what she said to me.  We were messing with her about her 80th birthday approaching, and she said she would not celebrate it until the time was right because she felt she was really only 79 years old because the previous year had not counted.  That is a summary of how many elderly people feel because the past year has been so difficult and did not count.<\/p>  <p>  We talk an awful lot in this country about catch-up programmes for this, that and the other.  We need some such programme for the elderly towards the end of this year to reignite social interactions, to celebrate what they have come through and to plot a way forward for reintegration or resocialisation.  I do not even know how we will do it but I know we have to, and I will work with the Minister of State on that.  We should set aside a month, perhaps December or January, in which we put in place a programme that all communities and society work towards.  It will bring together elderly people and reignite all they do, with opportunities in communities.  Sporting and community organisations can help out.  It will almost be a restart.  I hope the Minister of State will support that because it is critical.  I echo what the CEO of Alone, Se&aacute;n Moynihan, has said about setting up a high-level, cross-society group to devise a new strategy for older people.  In advance of that, I do not think it would be beyond the bounds of possibility in this House to come up with a strategy for one month to reignite how elderly people can interact in society.  They have lost so much.<\/p>  <p>  Communities have helped.  I come from the little village of Portroe, where the local shop and the Gleeson family have been amazing.  The shop has been almost a social outlet, delivering food to people and helping them out.  A local publican, James Seymour, is doing the same and visiting people because he has spare time.  All communities have helped elderly people throughout all this but collectively, we need to ensure there will be a period in which we put forward a plan to reintegrate and restimulate the elderly.<\/p>  <p>  I raise the issue of those who are over the age of 60, in the context of the vaccine roll-out.  I am concerned that 220,000 people in the 60 to 69 age group, who are not old but are going in that direction, have not registered for vaccination.  How will we ensure they do so?  It is a huge number, and while it will decrease all the time, there is obviously a quantity of people who are not going to register for some reason.  I do not know why that is but we need to do something about it because it is a real issue.<\/p>  <p>  Over-70s are getting the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, with the second jabs in four weeks, while over-50s are going to get the Janssen vaccine, so they will be vaccinated.  In between, the 60 to 69 group are getting the AstraZeneca vaccine, with a 12-week gap between doses, and we all know there is a plan for a green certificate to enable travel.  The group in their 50s and the plus-70s, therefore, will be able to travel, but the group in their 60s will not.<\/p> <p>Other conditions may be introduced as this is rolled out.  It may not be anyone's fault but it is an issue.  It is discriminatory.  How are we going to deal with that and ensure that this cohort is treated fairly?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900005#C00500","speaker":"1610","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619688600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Moving back to the Government, there are a number of speakers.

That is really good and I congratulate both of them.<\/p>  <p>  Today gives us great hope.  Restrictions on inter-county travel, masses, hospitality, click-and-collect services, barbers and hairdressers are to be loosened soon.  This is really positive.  For people's mental health, it is important that we now look forward.  From listening to the radio as I drove here this morning, things seem to be really positive.  It is to be hoped that the Taoiseach will announce all these measures this evening.  I also welcome the fact that, from next Tuesday, families will be able to schedule four visits to a nursing home per week.<\/p>  <p>  People's mental health has been significantly impacted by this pandemic.  As the number of people vaccinated increases, are we going to see the reopening of day services in the mental health sector?  There have been virtual sessions and some one-to-one visits but it is very important to get back to services in person.  I commend Alone, its staff and volunteers and those who operate its national support line, which was set up in collaboration with the Department and the HSE.  Alone reports that, in the past year, the helpline has received 49,000 calls and that the service has made more than 138,000 phone calls to older people who needed support.  Alone highlights the negative impacts of this pandemic on the mental and physical health of older people.  It has called for a stakeholder group of older adults to inform the Government on ways to support older people now as we have supported them during the pandemic.  Is this something into which the Minister of State is looking?<\/p>  <p>  As we cautiously reopen - and I know we have to be very cautious - what are we doing to support those older people who report continued anxiety?  When will the messaging tell them that they are safe?  Many community services for older people are still closed and, in some cases, home care has been stopped while families have been unable to visit because of continued restrictions.

I was given figures at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health three weeks ago which indicated that 1,600 bed bound people had received vaccination and that a further 300 were awaiting vaccination.  Those figures seem to be totally incorrect.  How did we arrive at those misinformed figures?  We are now talking about 3,500 people.  Surely the HSE should have had a serious idea of what it was expecting in this area.  Even if the figure of 3,500 the Minister of State has mentioned is correct, we should be given a detailed statement as to why this earlier figure was so out of synch with what was really happening on the ground.<\/p>  <p>  I published the Health (Amendment) (Professional Home Care) Bill 2020 last July.  It was debate in the D&aacute;il in September but the Second Reading was adjourned for 12 months.  I understand that proposals were made to Cabinet in the last week as regards how we intend to register those who provide home care.  Will the Minister of State provide a detailed update in writing at to how we intend to progress on this issue?  This ties in the with the issue I raised earlier, the need for a really comprehensive set of guidelines, rules and information with regard to the provision of home care, because the number of people who require home care will continue to increase.<\/p>  <p>  The final issue I will raise relates to ophthalmology and cataract services, especially in the southern region.  In excess of &euro;10 million has now been made available for outpatient facilities in the South Infirmary-Victoria University Hospital and a new theatre.  There will, however, be a waiting period.  What additional work can be done to help those who are on the waiting list?  My understanding is that those who are on the waiting list will wait a maximum of a six months but there is the matter of getting on the waiting list.  How can we assist the professionals providing this service, the nurses and doctors, and ensure that people can get on the waiting list in a timely manner rather than having to wait two or three years?  Will the Minister of State provide an update on that issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900006#D00400","speaker":"1523"},{"type":"speech","time":1619688600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I will respond as briefly as I can.

She comes from the small west Clare village of Kilmurry McMahon.  She had not received her Covid vaccination.  She is bed bound.  The Minister of State was very engaged, both in the Chamber and afterwards, and told me that the capacity of the National Ambulance Service to call out to such households had been doubled.

I spoke to two yesterday and asked them for permission to use their cases to highlight the isolation caused by Covid.  Families are in desperate need, older people have never been so isolated, which has a knock-on effect, and people with disabilities have practically been written off.<\/p> <p> I wish to raise a specific case.  Obviously, I have edited it.  Mrs. X has been a carer for her 81-year-old mother for a number of years.  She also has a brother in his 50s who was in appropriate day care for five days per week, but when Covid arrived, that service closed down.  She took it upon herself to assume caring responsibilities for him as well.  After a number of months, she wrote to the Department - she was inquiring more than anything else - to see whether she would be entitled to additional financial or physical supports.  Unfortunately, the Department wrote back and docked &euro;34 per week from her payment for looking after her mother.  The Ministers of State can imagine the stress that can cause for people who are at the pin of their collar trying to do the best they can.<\/p> <p> A second case involves a family of a child with severe autism.  Since Covid started, the family has received no respite care, speech and language therapy or just about any other support.  They are taking it in shifts.  The husband normally gets three hours of sleep per night.  When I spoke to him, I said that we could bring their case directly to a Minister.  He said that what was happening was not fair and that, as a principle, people in such circumstances &ndash; he knows many families in the same situation or worse &ndash; should be treated fairly.  He wanted me to bring that point to the floor today.  He also told me that, last weekend, he met a couple of his friends who were in a similar situation and that, although they started the conversation, they had to stop because it was so depressing.  Unfortunately, some parents in this situation were not strong enough and took their own lives.  The pressures are enormous.  He told me that he and his friends were still here to help where others had found it too much and had taken their own lives because they could not cope.  He told me that that was the conversation he and his friends had and that they had to stop because it was getting so depressing.  Those were his words, not mine.<\/p> <p> I welcome any progress in mental health services, but let us not forget anyone.  We must remember that, when we come out of Covid, we will still have a health problem, a mental health problem, a housing problem, people losing their jobs and a problem with disability services.  Let us plan for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900006#D00900","speaker":"1452","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619689200,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I join others in congratulating the Minister, Deputy McEntee.<\/p><p>I am seeking an update, albeit not on the funding that is to be allocated for the treatment of eating disorders.  That has already been announced and is funding that was not spent previously.  Rather, I am seeking an update on the number of beds for inpatient care.  There are only three currently.  Has there been any work on addressing this situation?<\/p><p>The challenge of Covid-19 has reminded us that personal health and well-being are no longer solo pursuits, but ones that require cohesion, collective effort and mutual respect across all life stages.  In his submission to the health committee last October, Mr. Martin Rogan, CEO of Mental Health Ireland, highlighted that mental health issues affected people of all ages.  I welcome this session focused on the mental well-being of older adults, who are often overlooked in these conversations.  The elderly have been identified as a group especially impacted by the pandemic.  Although necessary, cocooning and the closure of social outlets have increased isolation.  A volunteer on ALONE's support line reported to RT&Eacute; that &quot;A lot of the issues that people would ring with, would stem from loneliness.&quot;  The difficulty of bereavement at this time has taken its toll and the clusters of Covid in nursing homes was a major source of distress.<\/p><p>While the vaccine roll-out and safe reopening of society will make a significant difference, we cannot let the lessons of Covid slip away.  First, we need to fund mental health.  The World Health Organization recommends that countries dedicate 12% of health spending to mental health care.  In Ireland, the figure is less than 7%.  Not only must the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, ensure adequate resources are allocated, but she must also secure special interventions to treat the pandemic's legacies.  For example, reduced activities for older adults living with dementia has caused distress and exacerbated behavioural and psychological symptoms, and nursing home residents have experienced relapses in their mental health due to restrictions on visitors and therapies.  While these measures were necessary to save lives, we must act quickly to alleviate any regression.<\/p><p>Now that increasing numbers of older people and healthcare professionals are vaccinated, we need safe ways for them to interact as soon as possible.  A multidisciplinary approach needs to be at the centre of this response.  Increases in depression and anxiety are strongly related to declines in activity - this is a crucial factor in the well-being of older adults - as well as sleep quality and cognitive functioning.  Geriatric psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses and psychologists can drive medical treatments, but we also need occupational therapists, physiotherapists and other therapists to help provide holistic care.  I know from community hospitals in west Cork that music and art therapists have a positive effect.  We need to ensure that these professionals are facilitated in getting into hospitals and nursing homes as soon as possible.<\/p><p>Second, who cares for the carers?  The difficulties faced by our older cohort are also experienced by their carers and families.  Carers are consistently undervalued by Governments.  The amount of supports and payments offered to them compared to the work they do and care they give is disgraceful.  They receive plaudits from Ministers, but they need much more.  Family Carers Ireland's budget submission, entitled &quot;Life After Lockdown&quot;, outlines the measures they need, such as an increase in the carer's support grant and increased home care hours.  We need the Government to implement these proposals.  An holistic response to the mental health of older people will recognise the vital role that carers play.<\/p><p>Third, the Mental Health Commission's report on services for older people, released in December, is sombre reading.  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tDespite the increasing elderly population, we are currently not providing a nation-wide, comprehensive mental health service for older people.  We have highly-trained and committed specialist clinicians, yet we have only 66% of the recommended number of specialist teams, which themselves are only staffed at an overall level of 54%. <\/blockquote>  <p>The report's author, Dr. Susan Finnerty, highlighted an &quot;alarming&quot; underprovision of acute mental health beds for the elderly and &quot;serious under-resourcing&quot; of community mental health services for the same population.  She also explained that &quot;Older people's mental health is an increasingly important area of public policy that does not get the attention it deserves.&quot;  This needs to change now.  The Government must vigorously address the issues raised in that report.<\/p><p>The World Health Organization has stressed two interconnected elements to help improve the mental health of older people by alleviating feelings of anxiousness, anger, stress, agitation and withdrawal.  The first element is practical and emotional support through connections with family and community and the second is the role of healthcare professionals in providing the expert help that individuals need.  Over the past year, we have seen families, neighbours, volunteers and whole communities provide this first type of support.  Now we need the State to deploy all of its resources to address the second.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900007#E00200","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1619689200,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I join colleagues in extending my heartiest congratulations to the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and her husband.<\/p>  <p>  As we know, Covid has presented myriad challenges and difficulties for the past 15 months.  Once the virus is suppressed, there will be many other problems and legacy issues to be addressed.  We must now put in place the necessary supports.  People of all age groups losing their routines, be those work, learning, sport or social contact, has had a damaging impact on the mental health of many.  Supporting positive mental health must be a continuing priority for the Government.  We need much-improved State services and additional supports for voluntary organisations that provide professional services.  I know from speaking to a number of GPs that there is a large amount of anxiety and panic disorders in all age groups, especially among teenagers.  Some GPs have outlined to me that some young people are presenting with physical symptoms that turn out to be manifestations of stress.<\/p> <p>We need adequate psychological assessments and follow-up support.  Far too often, families need to source that support privately, imposing unnecessary financial burdens on people.  <br\/><br\/>I welcome the continued roll-out of the vaccine programme but there are still difficulties for some GPs.  I ask the two Ministers of State to provide more certainty and clarity on the roll-out.  Overall, it is a very successful programme with people working very hard, but whenever there is lack of clarity, it presents difficulties for everybody.  <br\/><br\/>As we work through this pandemic, we have an opportunity for further co-operation between North and South on a public health basis.

Although the date for opening the centre has been delayed, that is completely outside the Minister of State's control; unfortunately, Covid has played a large part in that.

In a year filled with so much isolation, how could our mental health not be affected?  In a year of restricted funerals, how could there not be a tailback of grief?  The <i>Irish Medical Journal<\/i>recently reported on an Irish study that found significant increases in depression, anxiety and stress among Irish people between March and June of last year.  That was just a couple of months into restrictions.  Sadly, we are now a year into this pandemic, and I have no doubt that the number of people struggling with their mental health has only increased.  The past year has tested us like no other and it has been a very dark time for many people.  That is why it is so important to remember the reasons for hope.  We all expect good news and hope later today from the Government.  With the vaccine roll-out reaching more people every day and normal life gradually resuming, I truly believe there are many reasons to hope.  <\/p><p>I am part of a volunteer-led Corkagh Park Darkness Into Light committee, a group of amazing volunteers.

We will turn all our volunteers' villages, Lucan, Clondalkin and Rathcoole, yellow to mark the occasion to and to spread the message that after darkness comes light, a message more apt today than ever before.  I take this opportunity to reassure all those who are suffering now that this will end.  We are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.  It is okay not to be okay, but the most important thing is to ask for help.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900008#F00300","speaker":"1566"},{"type":"speech","time":1619689800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I also add my congratulations to the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and her family on the birth of her baby this morning.<\/p>  <p>  I want to talk about isolation and to put two issues to the Minister of State.  Since the restrictions came into effect last year, for many older people, particularly those in rural areas, their existing sense of isolation has increased, and their mental health has suffered.  Some of them are suffering in silence.  For some, their only contact with the outside world in the past year has been HSE workers, home helps or the volunteers who have dedicated themselves to bring medication and groceries to them.  Those volunteers have spoken about how some older people who live with isolation in rural areas every day are less likely to present with any mental health issues they may have.  There is a real danger that this will not just be an issue during this pandemic but may become a habit that will be hard to break.  If they were to seek help, where would they go?  <\/p>  <p>  I was involved in a survey which showed that 40% of respondents believed that a lack of available mental health services was the main obstacle in seeking support for mental health problems.  A further 38% believed that the lack of information was a contributory factor, while 23% said it was because of a difficulty in travelling.  What is the Minister of State doing to address rural isolation and to reach those who feel they cannot reach out?  <\/p>  <p>  I also want to hear the Minister of State's thoughts on the following matters.  The Government used the Covid crisis as an opportunity to close St. Brigid's in Carrick-on-Suir, which provided palliative respite care for people in the local community.  In March 2020, it was designated as a step-down unit for recovering Covid-19 patients in south Tipperary, but that was a pretext for closure.  We have since been given flimsy reasons as to why it should not reopen.  Elderly and infirm people who are at their most vulnerable now face the prospect of no longer being able to stay within their community as they once could.  What impact is that having on their mental health and that of their families?  <\/p>  <p>  At the other end of the county, in Roscrea, long-stay beds will no longer be available in the Dean Maxwell facility.  Instead the HSE wants people to start travelling to Nenagh.  At a meeting on the matter with the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, local Deputies were told that this was part of the HSE's plan to improve care in the community.  How on earth can moving someone, who is at their most vulnerable, out of their own locality to somewhere where they have no family be seen as care within the community, especially at a time when there are limitations on how far people can travel?  <\/p>  <p>  I also seek an update on the Jigsaw centre for Thurles and the hubs in Nenagh and Clonmel.  Services online have been suggested, but they do not work which comes across when talking to people.  Will the Minister of State admit that the policy is more damaging than progressive?  Our older people are being failed here.  They have fallen victim to a campaign of centralisation that the Department of Health and the HSE seem intent on pursuing.  This shows little regard for the mental well-being of older and infirm people, who need specific care and who would like to spend their days near the people they love.  This disastrous policy must stop immediately, or we will be facing a situation where families become fractured, the elderly will become isolated from the people and places they know, and their sense of togetherness will be irreparably damaged.  We must learn from Covid and we must learn about isolation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900008#F00400","speaker":"1613"},{"type":"speech","time":1619690400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, will agree that older people have paid a terrible price over the past 14 months.

We will all meet again very soon.<\/p>  <p>  My question is in regard to a call from the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists, ISCP.  The pandemic has impacted on older people's routine and knocked it out of kilter.  According to the ISCP, isolation and inactivity leads to a deterioration in bone and muscle strength and, thus, older people are at greater risk of falling and so on.

The four-visits-per-week rule comes into force next Tuesday.  Under the restrictions in place for the last while, two visits per week were permitted.  The organisation, Care Champions, says it is aware that at least 70 of the 580 nursing homes in this State, more than 10%, have not applied the two-visits-per-week rule.  In many cases, this was not done for strictly public health reasons.  The stated reason was staff shortages in the nursing home.  I can only imagine how a husband who has not seen his wife who has been in a nursing home for some time or a wife who has not seen her husband who has been in a nursing home for some time would feel if told that they could not have their visits because of staff shortages in a nursing home.

In my area, namely, the Cork-Kerry area, 190 died, which was the highest of all of the regions in the State.  There are some who are scratching their heads and asking how it can be that almost as many nursing home residents died in the recent third wave as died in the first and second waves, despite all the lessons that were there to be learned from both.

We surveyed various healthcare professionals, including general practitioners, psychotherapists, garda&iacute;, coroners, student unions, charities involved in the sector and so on.  I will give some of the headlines of that research: 91% agreed that Covid has had a detrimental impact on the mental health and well-being of Irish society; 86% believe that the pandemic will have along-term impact on mental health, 88% feel that the Government has not done enough on the mental health side during the pandemic - this is not the fault of the Minister of State, who, as I said, is starved of the resources she requires; 91% agree that mental health services will require more funding and, among garda&iacute; specifically, 100% of respondents reported an increase in calls relating to mental health issues and domestic violence and 80% reported an increase in calls relating to suicide.  The average for all of these increases was around 30%.  Particular criticisms in terms of additional comments included woefully underfunded mental health service nationwide, a lack of long-term consideration of the Covid-19 mental health impact in Government policy to date - a point I have made to the Minister for Health many times - lip service being paid to mental health workers and charities with little in the way of actual Government support.  Another point raised, which we can perhaps discuss another day, was the relentless media coverage of bad news stories.  I am not shooting the messengers, I am focusing on how we portray the facts.<\/p><p>This research is consistent with findings from other research.  In 2020, Burke <i>et al<\/i>found that Covid-19 lockdowns are associated with marked increases in depression, anxiety and stress across all demographics.  Maynooth and Trinity universities found that one in four Irish people are current experiencing clinically, meaningful levels of depression, with close to one in five experiencing anxiety or PTSD-related issues.  In the 1980s, 16% of the overall health budget was devoted to the mental health services.  This year, unfortunately, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is expected to put up with 5.2%.  I do not doubt her commitment to the task at hand, but, unfortunately, as with so many consecutive Governments, the Departments of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Health and their senior Ministers are starving her of the resources she requires to really tackle the issue of mental health nationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900009#G00400","speaker":"1606"},{"type":"speech","time":1619690400,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Covid has affected many people, but the pandemic has affected many more.

There is a saying, &quot;<i>mens sano in corpore sano<\/i>&quot;.  Being unable to get out and about, be that dancing, sports or exercise, and being housebound put pressure on people's minds.

There was good support in the earliest stages of the pandemic, with efforts to get people online and sports clubs delivering people's shopping.  There is a different need now.

Specialist mental health services have continued to operate at 85% to 90% of pre-Covid levels.  While that continuation of service is welcome, it is undeniable that the impact of the Covid-19 crisis will be felt for many years to come.  Recent analysis in the UK found that those who suffered most throughout the pandemic in financial terms were also most likely to suffer some form of mental illness.  On the other hand, those whose incomes increased or remained the same were noted to have suffered less.  There are two points to be taken from that research.  First, as the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has assured us, there can be no cliff-edge removal of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and other Covid-related supports.  The second point is that getting people back to work as quickly and safely as possible is likely to yield positive mental health impacts.<\/p>  <p>  In that context, I welcome much of the leaked news today about different industries being reopened.  Listening to the radio this morning, one could hear the relief in people's voices, in some cases, and, in others, the excitement.  If all the reports we are hearing are true, the reopening plans are very welcome.  How quickly will all mental health support services resume in person and in safe environments?

She was released from hospital on two previous occasions.

What sometimes happens is that commitments are given in the House that we will get replies but no such replies are forthcoming.  I have three specific issues I want to raise, two of which, sadly, relate to bureaucracy.<\/p>  <p>  First, patients who are undergoing hospital procedures must have a negative Covid test in advance of going into hospital.  That is completely understandable.  However, in some instances, hospitals are not accepting a negative PCR test result from the HSE's community testing service.  Instead, patients are being asked to make a preliminary journey into the acute hospital for a pre-Covid test, which exposes those hospitals to additional and unnecessary risk in regard to Covid infection.<\/p> <p>I have already raised this with some hospital managers.  The justification is that the computer systems are not talking to each other.  Since the test carried out in the community by the HSE is not accessible by the hospital, the hospital is insisting on a separate test being carried out.  Hospitals will not accept the text message that comes back from the HSE.  This is a procedural bureaucratic issue that is putting additional hardship on patients in advance of going in for a hospital procedure.  It is exposing our acute hospitals to unnecessary and additional risk in the context of Covid-19 infection.  I want to see this issue addressed.<\/p> <p> I have another comment on the issue of bureaucracy.  On 21 April, the Minister for Health replied to Parliamentary Question No. 2083 with a the list of vaccines that would mean people who are fully vaccinated have an exemption from mandatory hotel quarantine.  Included in that list is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.  If a person has it in advance of coming into the country, then 15 days after the second dose the person is exempt from mandatory hotel quarantine.  Nowhere in the reply to which I refer is there a reference to where the vaccine is manufactured.  It is only when we get into the detail that we find out.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has informed an Irish citizen that four versions of European Medicines Agency approved vaccines are manufactured under licence by other companies and that these do not qualify for exemption in the context of the mandatory quarantine.  We are saying that these vaccines are good enough to be used in this country to inoculate people.  However, versions that are manufactured in facilities elsewhere will not be accepted for the purposes of mandatory quarantine.  For example, the manufacture of the AstraZeneca vaccine by the Serum Institute will not be accepted as exempt in the context of mandatory quarantine, even though anyone inoculated with it is considered fully vaccinated against Covid-19.  As a result of the location in which the vaccine is manufactured, it is not being accepted.  That needs to be changed in the context of mandatory quarantine.<\/p> <p> There is a third issue I want to raise.  On Friday night last, a constituent of mine who was in mandatory quarantine was in unbearable pain.  The person contacted reception at the quarantine facility seeking medical help.  A nurse called to the room but told the person she would be unable to issue any medicine, including paracetamol.  The person was informed that a nurse would call the following morning to facilitate the ordering of pain relief.  Eventually, after contacting reception again on Saturday morning, the medicine was ordered at 2 p.m.  It was only after further calls to reception seeking the assistance of a doctor that the medicine arrived at 9.40 p.m.  That was 24 hours after the person first reported being in unbearable pain.  No doctor ever arrived and no vital signs were checked.  The person was told that the nurse would be back later that night to check the vital signs.  It is 110 hours since the commitment was given but no doctor has arrived and no vital signs have been checked.  What medical service is available to people who are being quarantined?  The constituent in question came here from quarantine in New Zealand, where they were checked on every day by nursing staff.  The person's temperature was checked every day.  Yet, this person could not access paracetamol or get access to a doctor in quarantine here and their vital signs were not checked.  There is something wrong with the system.<\/p> <p> There is a final point that I would like to bring to the attention of the Government.  It relates to the trauma report approved this week by Cabinet designating the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital as the major trauma centre in this country, something I very much welcome.  However, there is a fundamental issue here.  How do we get patients to the trauma centres in the Mater Hospital or in Cork?  We have not been investing in our ambulance service.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has already said that ten ambulances are involved in the vaccination of the housebound.  That number is being doubled to 20.  This means 20 ambulances are being taken off our roads.  We do not have an effective air ambulance service.  We are centralising the trauma services but not figuring out how we are going to get ill patients into those hospitals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900010#H00900","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619691600,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Can I have a few minutes to respond?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900011#J00200","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1619691600,"counter":47,"content":"<p>The Minister of State will have time at the end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900011#J00300","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1619691600,"counter":48,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, the Deputies are asking many questions and I will have no time to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900011#J00400","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1619691600,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I know that but the Minister of State will have time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900011#J00500","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1619691600,"counter":50,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, the senior Minister is not here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900011#J00600","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1619691600,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I wish to make a point of order.

If a person is over 60 years of age and is offered the AstraZeneca vaccine and the person&rsquo;s family has a history of clotting - so many people in the Minister of State&rsquo;s constituency as well as my own are seriously concerned about this - the person may refuse to take the vaccine.  He or she may genuinely want a vaccine but refuse to take the AstraZeneca one.  The T&aacute;naiste said that such people will be put at the bottom of the list.  Is this a fact or not?<\/p>  <p>  Second, as to people with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, in a zoom call with the Parkinson&rsquo;s Association of Ireland, it stated that it is greatly worried and upset that this illness is not categorised in a more serious manner.  Many of these sufferers are young.  Can these sufferers be brought up the list for vaccines?<\/p>  <p>  Regarding those over 60 years who are accepting that they have no choice but to use the AstraZeneca vaccine, some will be able to get it in the next number of days but will have to wait 16 weeks for the second jab.  Some of these people have not seen their grandchildren for well over a year and are very upset as they were hoping, like those getting the Pfizer vaccine, they might be vaccinated within a month.  Is it possible to push that 16 weeks into a five, six, seven or eight week period?  I ask that the Minister of State might answer those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900012#K00600","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1619692200,"counter":65,"content":"<p>In answering the Deputy, some of those questions fall under the remit of the senior Minister, Deputy Donnelly.  My remit is more for older people and mental health.<\/p>  <p>  As to the over 60-year-old people, as the Deputy is aware, this was changed again yesterday or the day before.  Now, for example, anybody over 50 years of age will be able to receive AstraZeneca or the new Janssen vaccine that was passed by the European Medicines Agency, EMA, and the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, here.  My understanding is that it is under 50-year-old people who would have received the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine who have now gone to 16 weeks because the younger people may be more averse and have a bad outcome from it.  My understanding is, and I stand open to correction on this and I will reply to the Deputy in writing with the proper answer, that those over 60 years of age will have a 12 week wait for the AstraZeneca dose.<\/p>  <p>  As to Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, I worked very closely with the Parkinson&rsquo;s Association of Ireland in Waterford and I will bring the Deputy&rsquo;s request forward.

I wish to raise a number of issues and would be grateful for any consideration that the Minister of State can give to these issues.<\/p>  <p>  All of us here know and accept that the entire Covid-19 experience has been traumatic and disproportionately burdensome for our older people.  Last year, Dr. Martin Feeley, former clinical director of the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group, which includes the hospitals in Portlaoise and Tullamore, described many of the Covid-19 measures around the elderly as draconian.  Professor Ronan Collins, the director of stroke services in Tallaght University Hospital, has also previously called for pubs to be reopened as they are a lifeline for many elderly people in rural communities.  Professor Collins also said that cocooning was a mistake that left many older people feeling like life was not worth living any longer.  I am also aware that researchers at the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing in Trinity College Dublin are analysing the Covid-19 outbreak and subsequent measures to flatten the curve and how these measures have impacted on adults over 50 years of age in Ireland.  I am further aware that the analysis of confirmed deaths by the Central Statistics Office shows that Covid-19 has the greatest impact on people aged 65 years of age or over.  This age group accounted for almost 92% of confirmed deaths between 11 March and 15 May 2020.  People aged 70 years of age and over were directed to stay indoors, curtail social visits from friends and family and to halt outdoor exercise, activities that shape everyday routine and indeed their quality of life.  Ageist terminology was sometimes employed by the media and others.<\/p>  <p>  There is also the issue of ongoing restrictions around physical access to Mass which I hope will be eased and that we will hear announcements to that effect.  The sacraments are extremely important for many older people in particular.<\/p>  <p>  Older people are one of the most responsible groups in our society.  They respect the law but has the law respected them?<\/p>  <p>  My last question relates to the fair deal scheme.  Will we have the fair deal reforms in place before the summer recess or will it be in the autumn?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900012#K00800","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speech","time":1619692200,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I have two and half minutes as I am sharing time.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State for her detailed speech and I thank both Ministers of State for sitting through this debate which is a very important issue and which I appreciate.<\/p><p>Last week or the week before I had more time and I went into detail on the Mental Health Commission and where I stand on mental health which I will not repeat.  The importance of the independent monitoring body is crucial for me.<\/p> <p>I ask that the Minister of State look at the report of the Mental Health Commission and come back to me on it.<\/p> <p> There are a number of practical issues I wish to highlight.  The Ministers of State may not have time to respond on them.  Last week, I raised the issue of respite service.  No respite service is being provided by Merlin Park University Hospital, Galway.  I do not think it is the job of the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, to respond to me on an individual case.  In the end, Deputies go to the Minister with cases.  However, it is his responsibility to tell the House when respite services will recommence, more than a year after the pandemic was declared.  It is simply unacceptable.  We are talking about mental health and carers.  I do not know how they are surviving.<\/p> <p> The next issue to which I wish to draw to the attention of the Ministers of State is the number of late discharges of those in psychiatric hospitals.  I have the details of one such case but I will certainly not go into it.  However, I know that case is not unique.  The person in question has been in the psychiatric hospital for many years.  I am not exaggerating by saying that.  I followed up on it.  I will probably eventually come back to the Minister on that case if I do not get anywhere with it.  It involves a person who, years after admission to a psychiatric hospital, should not be in there.  <\/p> <p> I also wish to highlight the issue of wards of court.  Very little progress is being made on it.<\/p> <p> I refer to the issue raised earlier by Deputy Alan Kelly and relating to people aged between 60 and 69 and the number of vaccines not being taken up.  The comments by two senior politicians regarding that group of people were absolutely shameful.  Those politicians should come back and apologise.  If we wish to build confidence, politicians should not be telling people in that age group that if they do not do what they are told to do, they will go to the bottom of the list.  It is simply unacceptable to do so.  I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900012#K00900","speaker":"1577","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619692800,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I am happy to start my contribution by wishing the very best to the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and her lovely new family.<\/p>  <p>  My time is brief and I have a specific question for the Minister of State but I will first make a brief comment.  I am really pleased to hear of the new investments and allocations in mental health provision.  They are all very welcome.  However, all Members recognise that mental health provision has been chronically underfunded for many years.  The report of the Mental Health Commission on older people, which was published last year, was clear that mental health services for older people are seriously under-resourced.  We do not have a comprehensive service for older people.  This week, the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists warned of a tsunami of health problems facing older people.<\/p>  <p>  In that context, my question relates to the Covid-19 nursing homes expert panel report.

We received short, medium and long-term recommendations and we took all 86 of them on board.  The short-term recommendations have been implemented.  They relate to infection prevention and control, staffing levels and avoiding the cross-over of staff between nursing homes to prevent Covid.  We are currently working towards implementing the medium-term recommendations and the long-term recommendations are being costed.  The work that has happened in nursing homes in the past few weeks has been phenomenal.  There have not been any Covid cases in nursing homes in the past three weeks.  From next Monday, 4 May, residents will be able to receive four visits in their nursing home, which is very positive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900013#L00500","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1619692800,"counter":73,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for their contributions on such a wide-ranging topic.  Several significant issues have been raised.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, for her response.  I am sure she wishes to respond to as many more of the issues that were raised as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The physical and mental health well-being of people has been a Government priority throughout the pandemic.  The Government has funded a range of Covid-specific responses to allow specialist community and residential mental health services to remain open and operating near capacity while ensuring the safety of service users and staff, including &euro;15 million in budget 2021 specifically to meet these challenges.<\/p>  <p>  Mental health services have been particularly active in response to the pandemic and we have sought to be proactive through the cross-government well-being campaign entitled Keep Well, which has been promoting and supporting resilience and minding our physical and mental health.  We are also supporting a range of telehealth and psychosocial support services which provide advice, help, reassurance and contact for people in what are very challenging times. <\/p>  <p>  Within mental services, while we have acted to safeguard the well-being of the whole population, we have also targeted initiatives for priority groups.  Measures include infection prevention and control measures in residential settings, the sole aim of which is to keep infection rates as low as possible and thereby save lives.  In specialist community services, there has been a significant shift to online and telehealth provision to ensure that as much service delivery as possible can be maintained as safely as possible for everyone involved.<\/p>  <p>  The spread of Covid-19 in communities has posed significant challenges for many areas of our services.  We continue to progress through the pre-recovery phase of the Covid-19 pandemic with the planned easing of restrictions during March and April now complete.  Through our collective efforts, we are keeping the virus under control as the vaccine programme is gaining momentum.  It is vital that we ensure our overall approach continues to be cautious and sustainable over the immediate, medium and longer terms.  However, our clear message is that the vaccine programme is a key enabler to the reopening of society and the economy.  It is continuing to progress well, with more than 1 million people now having received the first dose of the vaccine and more than 1.4 million doses administered overall.   Our continued focus must be to protect the most vulnerable through an efficient roll-out of the vaccination programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900013#L00600","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"speech","time":1619692800,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I thank Members for their valuable contributions and will reflect closely on all statements relating to mental health and older people.  Many of the issues highlighted are already being addressed through programme for Government commitments, our national policies and strategies and the HSE national service plan.  We have achieved much in recent years through new developments and improvements to existing services.  We are fully committed to a broad programme of reform to enhance both mental health and older people&rsquo;s services into the future.<\/p>  <p>  I will try to answer some of the questions raised.  As the Acting Chairman will be aware, some Members decide to make statements and ask quite a lot of questions, so it is difficult to come back in.  Deputy Kelly raised the issue of the vaccination of those aged over 60.  The Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine, as well as the AstraZeneca vaccine, will be available to those aged over 60 and those aged over 50.  Deputy Kelly stated that he was concerned that those aged 50 to 59 may receive a vaccine before those aged 60 to 69.  It all depends on supply and delivery.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Cairns made several statements.  She stated that home care was suspended for many people.  It is fair to say that while 2,846 home care packages were suspended, 2,446 of those suspensions were requested by the clients or their families as they did not want a person coming into their house during Covid.  It is only fair to put that on the record.  An additional &euro;150 million was allocated, resulting in 500 million extra home care support hours being in place at the moment.  Some Members may remember that I raised this issue constantly in the previous D&aacute;il.  I am delighted that we are able to put in place 23 million home care supports, which is really important.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Cairns also raised the issue of the dementia budget.<\/p> <p>That issue was close to my heart in the previous D&aacute;il.  I worked with Senator Colette Kelleher at the time.  We co-chaired the all-party Oireachtas group on dementia.  For the first time in the history of the State, &euro;12.9 million was allocated for dementia services this year.  By the end of this year, we will have 29 dementia advisers.  It is only a short couple of years ago that we had only eight dementia advisers in the whole country.  By the end of this year, we will have 29 of them.  There will be a dementia adviser in every county, which is great to see, and more than one in some big counties.  <\/p> <p> Deputies Cahill and Martin Browne raised the issue of Jigsaw.  Jigsaw has been in touch with stakeholders in the local areas and has confirmed a date for referrals once building works are confirmed.<\/p> <p> A question was raised on mental health acute beds in the Tipperary area.  As I said previously, there will be a review of mental health bed capacity throughout the country and its recommendations will be put in place.<\/p> <p> Deputy Denis Naughten made a few points on specific issues related to mandatory hotel quarantine.  I am not in a position to answer his questions, especially those relating to individual cases.  The Deputy also raised the issue of the housebound and those receiving vaccines.  He stated during the week that there seemed to be a discrepancy in the figures, as 600 people who were on the list no longer seemed to be on it.  More than 3,500 referrals have been received.  GPs refer to the HSE certain patients who they believe are housebound and would like the vaccine.  As part of the housebound programme, to date 1,800 people have received the first dose and 500 people have received the second dose of the vaccine.  The HSE is currently contacting everybody on the list who has requested a vaccine.  <\/p> <p>Last week, Deputy Naughten expressed criticism that the ambulance service was reaching people who are housebound fast enough.  We have decided to double the number of ambulances visiting people at home.  The vehicles are not ambulances but ambulance jeeps.  These ambulance jeeps will continue to go to people's homes to allow people to be vaccinated.  It is hard to win in this instance.  Last week, we were criticised for not having enough ambulances; this week, I am criticised because we have too many ambulances.  My priority is to make sure that every elderly person who requires a vaccine will get one in a timely manner and no older person will be left behind.  The most important message today is that anyone who wants a vaccine will receive it in a timely manner.<\/p> <p> I thank the Cathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach for his time and patience.  I thank colleagues and Members of both Houses for their continued support and suggestions for improving our mental health and older persons services.  By working together, identifying problems and, most important, providing solutions, we can and will improve our services.  <\/p> <p> I welcome the news that the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and her husband Paul had a baby today.  We have broken the glass ceiling.  The Minister is the first Minister in the history of the State to have a baby while serving in office and the first to be able to take maternity leave.

As my grandmother used to say, a baby brings their own luck.  I wish the Minister, her husband and their new baby all of the luck in the world.  I remind the T&aacute;naiste that the Minister herself said before she left that the measures put in place are a sticking plaster, so we have work to do, but this is a very good and historic day, as she is the first full Minister to give birth in office.  We wish her all the very best.<\/p>  <p>  Today, the Government will set out the plan for reopening in the coming months.  This is a very positive day, and it is due to the dedication of the public and front-line health workers, who never wavered in the fight against this virus.  The positivity of easing restrictions and reopening our economy also brings with it some worry for businesses and workers.  I am very happy that tens of thousands of workers - many of whom have not seen a day's work for more than a year - will be able to return to their workplaces in the coming weeks and months.  However, we know that public health advice means than many others will not be able to do so.  I think about workers in aviation, tourism-dependent industries, travel agents and many people who will not be able to find work in their partially reopened industries.  They will continue to be out of work through no fault of their own and those workers must be supported.<\/p>  <p>  While the Government has continuously said there will be no cliff edge when it comes to income supports, it is unfair that it would not put some shape on what that means and give those words some meaning for the workers and business owners.  The Taoiseach yesterday refused to give concrete assurance to workers and businesses who may be out of work beyond June due to Covid-19.  The very least they deserve is certainty that the supports on which they depend will not be cut while public health restrictions remain in place.  Workers and businesses in sectors that have not reopened, and may not reopen as quickly as others, need to know that they are not facing cuts or reductions of any sort come July.  It is only fair that as long as people cannot go to work, or businesses cannot reopen due to public health advice, that those workers, business and families will retain the full support afforded to them.  I urge the T&aacute;naiste to set that out.<\/p>  <p>  Businesses too need a lifeline.  Chambers Ireland set out its view today.  It said that businesses must be given certainty on how long wage supports, grant aid, waivers and debt warehousing will be available.  So too have the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, restaurateurs, vintners, retailers and many more.  They are looking for as much certainty as can be given and I share their view.  In respect of the wage subsidy scheme, I believe it is incumbent on the Government to articulate a firm commitment to maintaining support until such time as businesses are not only reopened, but properly established, up and running and fully trading.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, many businesses that have been closed for months now fear that if they are allowed reopen and trade, their trade could bring them just over the threshold to qualify - but they would still be well out of pocket compared to what we refer to as normal times.  They are looking for the qualification point for the CRSS to be flexible in light of this, and I urge the T&aacute;naiste to support that.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the position.  The simple fact of the matter is that easing the restrictions and getting business back up and running will not turn the clock back to March 2020.  In the past 14 months, SMEs and family-run businesses have warehoused more than &euro;1 billion worth of tax debt with Revenue, many have commercial rent arrears, and others have bank debt.  These are all significant issues that require solutions.  Unless they are addressed, many businesses will not survive and thousands of jobs could potentially be lost.  We cannot allow that to happen.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to set out that the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and the wage subsidy scheme will remain in place for the length of time that public health restrictions are in place.  Will the qualifying restrictions for the CRSS be examined and will a flexible arrangement be agreed with Revenue regarding the continued warehousing of tax debt for SMEs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900015#N00300","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1619693700,"counter":82,"content":"<p>I join with you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, by offering my sincere and heartfelt congratulations to Helen McEntee who delivered a baby boy last night, and to her husband, Paul Hickey.  They have made history.  This is the first time that a serving member of the Government in Ireland has given birth.  When it comes to equality and diversity it is often said that people need to see it before they know they can be it.  I hope that young women and girls will see today that in Ireland one can hold high office, take maternity leave, raise a family and be supported to do so.  I accept we have more work to do in this area, but it is a positive day and history is being made today by the McEntee and Hickey family.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding Covid, the process is as follows: yesterday the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, met and issued a letter of advice to the Government.  Last night, the Covid sub-committee met and we developed a proposal late last night that will be put to the Cabinet this afternoon.  Should the Cabinet agree to that proposal, the Taoiseach will make a full announcement around 6 p.m. this evening.  It is a day of hope for Ireland.  All things going to plan, over the course of May, June and July most businesses will reopen.  Hundreds of thousands of people currently on the pandemic unemployment payment will be able to return to work and we will see a lot of our personal freedoms restored.  In May alone, we could see as many as 15,000 businesses reopen and as many as 200,000 people being offered their jobs back.<\/p>  <p>  I join with Deputy O'Reilly in thanking the Irish people for their resilience, co-operation and adherence to the regulations and restrictions.  I know it has not been easy but it has made a big difference and it has put us in a much better place than many of our peer countries.  I especially want to thank the HSE and the staff of our public health service.  One of the untold stories of this pandemic is how well the health service performed.  The health service often gets a lot of bad press, sometimes deservedly, but it really stood up to the challenge.  We never ran out of ICU capacity, beds, oxygen or ventilators.  We are able to do same-day tests with next-day results for a virus that did not exist almost a year or so ago.  We have seen an extraordinary performance from the health service in that regard, not least when it comes to vaccines.  Once they get into the country, in 95% of cases they are administered to people within a week.<\/p> <p>Keeping that is going to be difficult but that is what we intend to do.<\/p> <p> On financial supports, such as the pandemic unemployment payment, the wage subsidy scheme, the weekly CRSS payment and the rates holiday, I can confirm that they will remain in place until the end of June.  By the end of May, we will set out a clear plan for people and businesses as to what will happen from July onwards.  The Government fully appreciates that there are certain sectors that are going to need additional and ongoing financial support because of the difficulties they will face in reopening and recovering.  These include the hospitality, tourism, aviation and events and arts sectors.  The latter will need ongoing financial support for quite some time.  We will set out a plan to do that before the end of May.  The existing financial supports will stay in place, as they are, until at least the end of June.<\/p> <p> When the restrictions are eased we will see a bounce in consumer spending.  There is a lot of pent-up demand and money in savings accounts.  There will be a bounce but we need to make sure that it is not a dead cat bounce.  The last thing we want to see is a boom in consumer spending that falls off in a few months' time when we are withdrawing the financial supports that people and businesses need.  That would be a mistake.  We need to get this right.<\/p> <p> We need to be honest in this House.  This is all borrowed money.  It is not money that we generated ourselves through our labour or taxes.  This is money that has been borrowed from banks and bondholders, with the help of the ECB.

We should bear in mind that many of these workers were doing the kind of work, facilitated by the Government, that meant they were not in a position to have savings.

We look forward to early action from the Government in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  A new relationships and sexuality education, RSE, programme for Catholic primary schools was published this week, as the T&aacute;naiste knows.  It was developed by the Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference.  The programme, in its introduction, states that when discussing LGBTQ+ plus issues with children, \"the Church's teaching in relation to marriage between a man and a woman cannot be omitted\".  We know what that teaching is.  Relationships between men and women are natural.  LGBTQ+ relationships are \"intrinsically disordered\".  <\/p>  <p>  As recently as last month, incredibly, the Vatican reaffirmed that the Catholic Church cannot bless same-sex unions because God \"cannot bless sin\".  That is the church's position.  Let us not pretend otherwise.  However, it is not the State's position or the public's position.  We had a marriage equality referendum in this country in 2015 which passed by a huge majority.  Same-sex marriage is every bit as valid as a heterosexual marriage.<\/p>  <p>  Teaching children that relationships can be placed in a hierarchy depending on sexual orientation should be an anathema in any modern republic.  Do we really want LGBTQ+ children, who may be struggling with their sexual orientation, to be taught in schools that their relationships are in any way less worthy, meaningful, loving or deserving of respect than their heterosexual peers?  That is the inference of this programme.<\/p>  <p>  This is an issue that does not just affect children.  Speaking at the INTO's annual conference at the start of the month, its vice president Joe McKeown said that up to 4,000 LGBTQ+ teachers are hiding their sexual orientation because they feared their jobs or promotion prospects would be harmed if their school patrons discovered their true identity.<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste may say that Catholic schools have an ethos, but sex education needs to be fact-based.  Facts do not have an ethos.  Can he tell me why, in 2021, RSE for Irish children is being developed by Catholic bishops and not the National Council for Curriculum Assessment?  Why has the Minister for Education remained silent on this?

The programme for Government is explicit on this and  states that the Government will develop inclusive and age-appropriate curricula for RSE and social, personal and health education, SPHE, across primary and post-primary schools, including an inclusive programme on LGBTI+ relationships.  That is the Government's policy and position, and it is what we expect to be upheld in publicly funded schools.<\/p>  <p>  As things stand, all schools have to have an RSE policy and that has to be developed in consultation with school management, parents, teachers and students, as appropriate.  A school's programme for RSE is developed and taught in the context of the school's RSE policy.  The ethos of the school should never preclude learners from acquiring knowledge about the issues involved, but may influence how the content is treated.<\/p>  <p>  Access to sexual and health education is an important right for students and is a mandatory part of the curriculum in all primary and post-primary schools for junior cycle.  RSE is required at all levels from primary through senior cycle and the Department has set out the content for each of these programmes in SPHE syllabuses and guidelines.  The primary level SPHE curriculum currently used in schools was published in 1999.  Its purpose is to foster the personal development, health and well-being of the individual child to help him or her to create and maintain supportive relationships and to enable children to make safe and healthy decisions now and into the future.  All schools are required to have an RSE policy that is developed in consultation with the school community, including management, parents, teachers and students, as appropriate.  A school's programme for RSE is developed and taught in the context of its RSE policy.  It is important to note that the ethos of the school should never preclude learners from acquiring knowledge about the issues, but ethos may influence how it is treated, as I have said.<\/p> <p> In April 2018, a review of RSE in schools was announced.  The report was published by the NCCA on 11 December 2019.  The NCCA was asked to look at a number of specific issues regarding RSE and the curriculum, developments in respect of contraception, healthy, positive sexual expression and relationships, safe use of the Internet and social media, relationships and self-esteem and also LBGTQ+ matters.  The immediate focus of the work was on creating support materials for teachers to support effective teaching and learning linked to the current curriculum.  This work is progressing well and the first section of the toolkit, a portal repository of teaching and learning resources linked to the primary SPHE curriculum, the SPHE junior certificate short course and the SPHE framework, has been published and the second section is due to be published at the end of April.  In tandem with the development of the online toolkit, preparation for redeveloping the SPHE curriculum has begun, with an initial focus on the junior cycle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900016#O00600","speaker":"1474","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619694900,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste.

When one talks to parents, many of them say they like the model they have and the way their school works.  It is a case of \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" or \"don't throw the baby out with the bathwater\".<\/p>  <p>  It is important that we listen to parents and students, where appropriate, and ask them what model of education they want.  One will often find that there are children and families from a diversity of backgrounds attending the local parish Catholic diocese school who are not looking for a change in patronage.  They like the school and the way it operates and they do not want it to change fundamentally.  We need to bear that in mind also.  Very often, migrants who come to Ireland want to send their child to the local Catholic parish school because to them that is integration.<\/p>  <p>  To come back to the Deputy's question on sex education, the Minister and Government will make a statement on that.

That will continue for as long as other sectors on which they depend for their income, such as music, entertainment, events, tourism and aviation, are affected.  However, their appeals for specific assistance to deal with the debts they are accumulating, their ongoing costs and a financial package to help them survive and recover have been consistently refused by this Government.<\/p>  <p>  To add insult to injury, taxi drivers were planning to come to Government Buildings at 10 o'clock this morning to engage in a public health compliant protest where they made it absolutely clear that they would be in their cars so as not to breach public health guidelines.  Despite giving that clear assurance and communicating it to the Garda, on Wednesday, one of the representatives of the four national taxi groups received a call from Pearse Street Garda station in which they were informed that if taxi drivers turned up in their cars, every driver would be fined &euro;100 and the organisers of the protest could face up to &euro;20,000 in fines or up to two years' imprisonment.

We all know their business is heavily dependent on tourism and people attending events and availing of hospitality.  As a result, they have seen a very major reduction in their incomes.<\/p>  <p>  I have met taxi drivers, at the Deputy's suggestion, and I am following up on some of the issues they raised with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan.  Most are self-employed and, as a result, can access a range of Covid-19 financial supports, including the PUP and the credit guarantee scheme.  The Department of Transport has waived licence fees for 2021 at a cost of &euro;2.6 million.<\/p>  <p>  Taxi drivers eligible for the PUP are also allowed to continue to work and receive the payment.  There is an income disregard which allows taxi drivers to earn up to &euro;960 every eight weeks, net of any expenses, without jeopardising their entitlement to the payment.  That is not only a crucial lifeline for those who, through no fault of their own, cannot work in the way they did previously but will also be an important financial support for drivers once they return to work and until passenger demand returns to more normal levels.<\/p>  <p>  As I mentioned, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, met the taxi representative groups twice last year.  I understand officials from the National Transport Authority, NTA, have been in regular dialogue for months with groups representing taxi drivers.  The Minister and officials from his Department remain available to meet taxi representatives, as they would with any lobby group or representative organisation.  Officials have also been engaging with the advisory committee on small public service vehicles.

They have asked for the taxi advisory committee to be replaced with a body that allows them direct access to the relevant Ministers.<\/p> <p>There are also other demands, many of which are non-financial.  One such demand is to replace the rule requiring vehicles to be replaced after ten years with a rule stipulating 15 years, given that drivers have lost their incomes.  None of those demands has been met and that is why the drivers were forced to organise a protest this morning.  They have now had to call it off because, even though they made it clear they were going to comply with public health guidelines, they were threatened with fines, implications for the future licensing of their vehicles and the possibility of their leaders facing prison sentences or massive fines.

In particular, it is a day of hope for the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and her husband, whom I congratulate.  It is a day of hope in the mid-west but we cannot live on hope alone.  There is a marked absence of announcements on when the hospitality industry will open.  I refer in particular to hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation.  There is an absence of a plan for the aviation sector.  Shannon Airport still does not have a chair and is expected to resurrect itself miraculously without one.  Shannon Heritage sites are being opened.  We still do not know what their future will be.  It is 15 months since I raised this issue in the D&aacute;il.<\/p>  <p>  It is also a day of hope in that it is hoped some of the draconian enabling legislation passed by this D&aacute;il will not be rolled over in June.  It has been abused by successive Ministers for Health, particularly Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  The T&aacute;naiste incorrectly said he has not seen an attempt to revoke any of it.  The Rural Independent Group, supported by many in my group, put a motion before this House.  Notwithstanding the bleatings of some Government backbenchers who opposed the statutory instrument, those backbenchers nevertheless went through the lobbies and voted to keep it in place.  Therefore, the T&aacute;naiste is incorrect in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  I want to focus on one point in particular.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to cast his mind back over a year to last March when the pandemic first began.  Enhanced Covid illness benefit was introduced at &euro;350 per week.  The rationale for that was that people would not be disadvantaged, or would be disadvantaged as little as possible, as a result of having to self-isolate or having Covid.  One could not but agree with that.  It became the rationale for the rate at which the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, was set.  As we congratulate the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and rightly so because there is nothing more hopeful than the birth of a baby, we should recall that thousands of mothers across this State, when they went on maternity leave to give birth and bring a life into the world, had their rate of pay reduced from the PUP rate to the maternity benefit rate, which is &euro;245.  Notwithstanding all the laws we rightly have in the private sector to prevent women from being discriminated against because they, uniquely, give birth, we are quite happy to penalise them for it by reducing their payment from &euro;350 to &euro;245.  That begs the question of the rate at which the maternity benefit is set in this country, which cherishes life and must cherish birth.  Consider what is required if our economy is to have a future, bearing in mind that the T&aacute;naiste has stressed all this money will have to be paid back.  We have a relatively high birth rate in this country and need to maintain it for the good of the economy and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900018#Q00300","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1619695500,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  There will be a formal announcement by the Taoiseach later today on the reopening of hotels, all the services associated with them and the hospitality industry more broadly, including pubs and restaurants.  It relates to outdoor activities.<\/p>  <p>  I fully agree that we need a plan for aviation and a return to international travel.  Airports have received very large amounts of grant funding from the Government in recent weeks and months.  Airlines have been among the biggest beneficiaries under the employment wage subsidy scheme.  Hundreds of millions of euro have already gone to the aviation sector during this pandemic but what it wants and needs is to get back to business and resume flying, not grants from the Government.  However, it is just too soon for the return to international travel, unfortunately.  The pandemic is raging around the world; it is worse than it ever was.  The number of daily cases around the world is at a record high and we cannot escape that reality.  The truth is that, in a few months, the world will essentially be divided into three parts: those areas whose populations are heavily vaccinated, namely, Europe, including the UK, and Israel, some Gulf states and the US; countries whose populations are not fully vaccinated, including Brazil, India, Russia, most of Africa and South America; and countries that have adopted an elimination strategy whereby they are safe but closed off, with populations that are not vaccinated and will not be for at least another year.  Travel between those groups of countries will be very difficult.  We may be able to allow international travel among countries whose populations are substantially vaccinated but we are not there yet.  Only Israel is in that position.  It is reopening to tourism on 26 May.  It will be many months before we will be at that point.  We need to think ahead and plan for it, however, and that is what we intend do over the course of May.<\/p>  <p>  On the question on whether the maternity benefit rate is too low, I believe it is.  We set the pandemic unemployment payment and the enhanced illness benefit payment rates at &euro;350 per week because that is 70% of average earnings in the sectors most affected, namely construction, retail and hospitality.  The payment is income linked, based on how much a recipient earned before receiving it.  I have often said I would like to see a reform of our welfare system so benefits such as illness benefit, maternity benefit and jobseeker's benefit are income linked.  We should do that.  A lot of people would oppose that but we should do it.  Let us not forget, however, that all of these benefits are paid for through the Social Insurance Fund, which is now back in deficit.  If we make these enhancements, we need to have a serious conversation about PRSI and whether employees and employers are willing to pay more for higher benefits.  I believe that the more one pays in, the more one should get out, but that means moving to a different system.  I am up for discussing it but there is too much talk about free money in this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900018#Q00400","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1619695500,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I am glad the T&aacute;naiste is not suggesting this is free money because it is a benefit that accrues from working.

Even though emergency department attendances are back to 2019 levels, we have seen a considerable reduction in the number of people who have to wait on a trolley for a bed.  I do not have the exact figures, but it is down more than half on what it would have been in 2018 or 2019.  That is due to the additional investment, changes in pathways and reforms that have been made by the HSE in recent years.  This is not to say that we do not still have big problems in some hospitals.  Limerick is one of those.  It will require more capacity in the years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900021#T01100","speaker":"1474"},{"type":"speech","time":1619697300,"counter":138,"content":"<p>It is encouraging that we are preparing to ease restrictions.

The motion relates to a proposal to strengthen and develop Europol, increasing the services that it provides to European Union member states while remaining within the mission and tasks of the agency, as laid down in Article 88 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.<\/p><p>The deadline for opting in to the proposal under Article 3 of Protocol 21 is 3 May 2021.  Opting in under Article 3 allows Ireland to take part fully in the adoption and application of the proposed measure, and to influence the content of the regulation that is to be agreed.  Negotiations are well under way under the Portuguese Presidency of the Council.  If the Houses support the opt-in, it is my intention to notify the institutions of our participation by Monday.<\/p><p>When Ireland signed up to the Lisbon treaty, the Government of the day made a declaration, which is attached to the treaties, that we would participate to the maximum extent possible in measures in the field of police co-operation.  That remains the position of this Government.<\/p><p>Deputies may ask why the Government is seeking to participate in this regulation.  First, this is very much a supplementary regulation.  In 2016, these Houses agreed to Ireland's participating in a much broader regulation relating to Europol.  The 2016 regulation reconstituted Europol as the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Co-operation.  It represented an effort by the European Union to step up its efforts to fight terrorism, cybercrime and other forms of serious and organised crime.  It also created new governance structures and new relationships between Europol and the European institutions, as required by the Lisbon treaty.  The 2016 regulation will remain as the main Europol regulation, with the new regulation adding on specific powers and filling in any gaps that currently exist, which I will mention shortly.<\/p><p>Second, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na fully supports Europol and values its membership of the organisation.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is represented on the management board at assistant commissioner level, and garda&iacute; are seconded to the organisation on an ongoing basis.  The Garda Commissioner is of the view that the collaboration and co-operation that comes from Europol is invaluable in tackling serious cross-border crime.  Europol is the centre point for communication between the law enforcement agencies of the European Union.<\/p><p>Third, Ireland is broadly supportive of the proposed amendments in this draft regulation seeking to strengthen the existing mandate of Europol which I will now mention briefly.  The draft regulation seeks to enable Europol to co-operate effectively with private parties.  Private parties, such as Internet service providers and social media companies, hold data that are increasingly relevant for law enforcement authorities.  Currently, the rules for exchanges of personal data with private parties only permit Europol to receive such data as an exception.  The new proposed amendments would enable Europol to support law enforcement in its interactions regarding, for example, the removal of terrorist content online.<\/p><p>The draft regulation seeks to enable Europol to more effectively support member states' investigations with the analysis of large and complex data sets, addressing the big data challenge for law enforcement authorities.  Member states often cannot detect cross-border links through analysis of large data sets as they lack data on crime in other member states.<\/p> <p>They also may not have the resources or the infrastructure to process such data.  The amendments would provide legal clarity around the processing of data, the implementation of data protection safeguards and the boundaries for data storage.<\/p> <p> The proposed regulation seeks to strengthen the role of Europol in regard to research and innovation, addressing any gaps that may exist for law enforcement authorities.  It would also allow Europol to engage in research activities that include the development, training, testing and validation of algorithms for the development of new tools.  This is a highly technical area that will allow Europol to help member states to make the most of the opportunities that new technologies can offer.<\/p> <p> The proposed regulation aims to strengthen Europol's co-operation with third countries on preventing and countering serious and organised crime and terrorism.  Serious crime does not stop at the European borders and co-operation with third countries will be of particular importance to Ireland given that our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom, now has third country status.  A new provision will outline Europol's co-operation with the European Public Prosecutor's Office, EPPO, through the exchange of information, provision of analytical support and specialist knowledge in criminal  investigations.  Europol would also be obligated to report criminality falling within the mandate of the EPPO.  <\/p> <p> The draft regulation seeks to further clarify that Europol may request, in specific cases where it considers that a criminal investigation should be initiated, the competent authorities of a member state to initiate, conduct or co-ordinate the investigation of a crime.  Currently, Europol can request a member state to initiate an investigation.  The member state should then respond within one month to such a request, and if it decides not to agree, provide reasons to Europol.  Europol can only request an investigation that affects two or more member states.  The proposal is to amend this to allow Europol to request an investigation into a crime that is not a cross-border crime, where Europol has formed the view that the crime in question is detrimental to the European Union.<\/p> <p>  The draft regulation aims to further strengthen the data protection framework and oversight applicable to Europol.  It proposes to outline the designation, position and tasks of the data protection officer, DPO, of Europol.  This is to highlight the importance of the DPO as an independent function where he or she can ensure the compliance of Europol with the data protection provisions and safeguards within the regulation.  It should be remembered that the 2016 Europol regulation was negotiated before the completion of the negotiations on the GDPR.  Finally, it seeks to strengthen parliamentary oversight and accountability of Europol.  Europol is ultimately responsible to the home affairs Ministers of the European Union.  It currently reports on a regular basis to the internal security working group of the Council.  Providing Europol with additional tools and capabilities requires a reinforcement of its oversight and accountability arrangements.  There are new proposals for joint scrutiny by the Council and by the European Parliament and new reporting obligations for Europol.<\/p> <p> The continuously evolving security threats call for effective EU-level support to national law enforcement authorities such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These threats spread across borders.  They facilitate a variety of crimes and manifest themselves in organised crime groups engaged in a range of criminal activities.  Action at national level will not suffice to address these transnational security challenges.  Europol is well-positioned to provide the support that member states need to address such challenges.  A decision by Ireland to opt in to this measure would be seen as a demonstration of our continued commitment to the effective functioning of Europol and to the wider security of the European Union.  Our participation in Europol is vital to our national interest and we look forward to continuing to playing an active role with the agency. <\/p> <p> I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies and I urge them to support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900022#U01100","speaker":"1618","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619698500,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne.  I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister, Deputy McEntee, on the birth of her baby boy this morning.  I wish them all the best for the future.  Having children is one of the greatest adventures of life.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, embarks on a new adventure today.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the motion.  The role of Europol in cross-border policing has developed over many years.  It is vital to ensure we keep people safe everywhere.  The world is now a much smaller place, as is Europe.  When we exit the ravages of the Covid-19 pandemic, we will, hopefully, be able to travel freely again.  That is a vital part of what we need to be able to do in Europe.  Freedom of movement, freedom of capital and so on, which are at the core of the Europe Union, open up opportunity for criminal gangs and serious crime on a cross-border basis.  This has to be addressed.  I recognise that much of the crime which Europol is engaged in and investigating is the serious crime of drug trafficking, as well as people trafficking and other crimes of that nature which need to be dealt with appropriately.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a role to play here and it is playing that role.  <\/p>  <p>  I recently dealt with a case where a person had two children taken out of this country to another country.  It is difficult to deal with law enforcement agencies in one's own country, but dealing with them in several countries at the same time is very stressful for families or individuals.  Greater co-operation and integration between security forces, particularly police forces across member states, is vital in that regard.  Europol is a key part of that.  <\/p>  <p>  The main point of this particular motion is to ensure there is co-operation with private parties as set out in the Minister of State's speech, which includes communications and online companies.  I am interested to know if that includes private security firms, which can often be unregulated.  We have had issues with them in this country, but in many other countries, they are very unregulated.  We need to focus on how that is operating in other countries as well.  We are dealing with this particular motion in an Irish context but it also has a reach into every other country in Europe, where it has to deal with variants of regulation in the different sectors within those countries and also different legal regimes and applications of the law within those countries.  The legal systems in Ireland and in Britain are different to those in most countries in Europe.  That is an issue of which we need to be conscious and aware.<\/p>  <p>  Many people have had reason to deal with problems at an international level.  It can sometimes be very difficult for people to deal  with the forces of law and order in other countries at arm's length.  There is, perhaps, a role here for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to link up with people in this country who are trying to deal with such issues and to assist them in their dealings with law enforcement agencies in other states. <\/p>  <p>  Europol has expanded and developed its technology and its way of doing things.  As we know, it is based in The Hague and it has over 1,000 employees, which number will probably grow into the future.  We are in a time when, apart from a global virus pandemic, we have a global crime pandemic.  I mentioned the issue of people trafficking.  Europe needs to address the issue of criminal gangs bringing people into many countries in Europe, including Ireland, where many of them are abused in the sex trade, which is not a trade but the abuse of human beings.  This can only be dealt with at an international level.  There needs to be a real focus on address of that crime.  The issues of data and analysis of large-scale data are also addressed in the motion.  It is clear to all that we need to have in place the resources to deal with international crime and the large, and often hidden, means by which they can operate.  <\/p>  <p>  I commend the Government on bringing forward the motion.  The deadline in terms of opt-in is fast approaching.  I suggest that in future we should try to deal with these matters more promptly than close to deadlines.  I am sure the Minister of State would agree.  As I said, Sinn F&eacute;in supports the motion and we hope it progresses through the Houses with great speed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900023#V00200","speaker":"1607"},{"type":"speech","time":1619699100,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Whenever we see words such as \"Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) 2016\/794\" on the Order Paper, we wonder what exactly we will be discussing.  In this instance, we are dealing with a very important issue and a proposal I am happy to support.  Ireland has the power to opt in and out of regulations on the matters to which the motion relates, mainly because of our relationship with the United Kingdom in the past.  As members of the European Union together for more than 40 years, we mirrored the UK's opt-in-opt-out view on many justice-related matters.  My first question to the Minister of State relates to how we might position ourselves into the future in the light of the new status of the UK as a third country.  How will we maintain our links with the UK in terms of security and policing, which are extremely important, and how will the UK link into the EU, not only bilaterally with Ireland but also with the other member states?<\/p>  <p>  A related issue is the question of how we are going to proceed into the future in terms of our involvement with justice issues as they arise.  The importance of police co-operation on an international scale has never been more real.  We have seen Irish criminal gangs become entirely internationalised, with some of them based in the Netherlands or Spain.  Feuds that originate in this jurisdiction have had impacts in other jurisdictions, not only across the EU but beyond.  There is no doubt in the world that we need to have the capacity to co-operate not only on a pan-European level, through Europol, but even beyond Europe.  Criminal investigation is becoming more demanding and requires additional resources.  Issues like data analysis, as the Minister of State referenced, forensic accounting and others require a degree of specialisation that we have only really begun in recent years to apply to policing in this country.  We need not only trained members of the Garda, who go through a process of training in Templemore before progressing through the ranks, but also a range of specialist supports.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State indicated that these proposals will strengthen with the EPPO.  This is an issue we raised in a previous debate.  At the time, we were not fully engaged with that office, with the reason cited being that we are a common law jurisdiction and this would prevent difficulties for our full participation.  I am interested to know, if the Minister of State can give an update, whether we are more advanced in this regard than we were the last time he spoke to the House about it.<\/p>  <p>  In the debate in the Upper House, the Minister of State dealt with the issue of co-operation between Europol and private parties.  He has given a little more elaboration in that regard today.  He said this issue would have significant implications for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because of the presence here of so many European headquarters of Internet and social media providers.  He talked in the other House about An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being able to influence any outcomes in this regard.  Will he comment on how that will be brought about?  He indicated that the proposed amendments would enable Europol to support law enforcement in its interactions regarding, for example, the removal of online terrorist content.  How will that happen from a procedural point of view?<\/p>  <p>  I do not expect the Minister of State will have time, in this very short debate, to deal with all the issues I and other Members raise.  Will he come back to us on the points he does not have time to deal with in his closing remarks?  Mar fhocal scoir, we support these proposals for greater co-operation between police forces as an absolutely essential adjunct to ensuring that criminality can be dealt with adequately.  Criminal activity is now entirely internationalised, as highlighted by other speakers in referring to specific issues such as people trafficking.  Our policing response, therefore, must be robust, internationalised and properly resourced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900024#W00100","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1619699100,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I join colleagues in congratulating the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and her husband on the birth of their son.  None of us is surprised that the new baby has arrived but we are all a bit surprised that it seemed to happen so soon after the commencement of the Minister's maternity leave.  I wish her and her family the very best.<\/p>  <p>  On the regulation we are discussing, we share the view that there is a need for co-operation in dealing with crime.  However, we have significant and serious misgivings in regard to certain aspects of the provisions, which I hope the Minister of State will take on board.  In considering this proposal to expand the data collection remit of Europol, it is important to take account of the reasons it has been put forward.  In September last year, the European Data Protection Supervisor, EDPS, released an absolutely scathing report on Europol's handling of large databases or data sets.  It found that national law enforcement agencies from various member states were increasingly transmitting very large data sets to Europol, rather than targeted data, to allow for criminal investigations to take place, and this breached the standards in the 2016 Europol regulation.  These data sets contained vast amounts of personal data, concerning nobody knows how many individuals.  They are too large to be adequately examined and this makes the regulation less effective.<\/p>  <p>  The EDPS also found that personal information about innocent individuals who had no connection to the crimes in question was being processed through Europol's system.  Its report stated that Europol had not properly implemented the data minimisation principle and the significant safeguards in the 2016 Europol regulation.  That is a big red flag.  The EDPS further noted that, as a result, data subjects run the risk of being linked wrongfully to criminal activity right across the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  We need to look at the companies responsible for the software that deals with digital forensics.  Technology companies and the products they create are not politically neutral or free from bias.  Their founders and key employees create the software through the prism of their own viewpoint, values and moral philosophy.  Europol uses the Gotham software developed by Palantir Technologies to conduct data analysis.  That company, run by Peter Thiel, is known to be one of the controversial private technology firms, with an involvement in Cambridge Analytica and, in the US, the National Security Agency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the CIA.  Palantir Technologies has become increasingly active across Europe, especially during the initial stages of the pandemic, and it sees Europe as a key focus for its activities.  The EDPS report raises concerns that the Gotham system was not designed to make it clear how people's data enter the system, which led to the problem of being unable to distinguish without doubt whether someone was a suspect, informant, witness or victim of crime.<\/p>  <p>  The EDPS raised concerns about the decision to use this specific company.  There are real dangers for the EU in relying on particular technology companies that are based outside the European jurisdiction, especially when they are involved in matters of domestic security.  The proposal will see the scope of Europol's data-gathering powers massively expanded.  The current limits on the categories of people on whom the agency can gather data, such as criminal witnesses and victims, could be circumvented to legalise the large data sets that will be transferred to the agency.  I also have concerns about a report published by the European Network Against Racism, ENAR, on migrant and minority communities across Europe.  Specifically, there is a concern that particular views may be reinforced into a technical approach.  That has to be avoided.<\/p>  <p>  I wish there was more time to speak on these proposals.  There is no doubt that we need co-operation to fight crime across jurisdictions.  However, it must be done as safely as possible.<\/p> <p>I have concerns about some of the issues the data supervisor flagged.  If we are to endorse this, then at a minimum we have to flag the significant and reasonable concerns highlighted by the EDPS.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900024#W00200","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619699700,"counter":161,"content":"<p>As there is no Deputy present from Solidarity-People Before Profit, the next contributor will be Deputy Matt Shanahan from the Regional Group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900025#X00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1619699700,"counter":162,"content":"<p>We are now firmly living in an age of digital advancement.  The change this is bringing to our lives is evident in every sector, community and home.  Digitisation and technology development are greatly improving many aspects of our social, economic and cultural lives.  However, they are also creating a national vulnerability that Ireland cannot manage on its own.  This is true of every other European country too.  Therefore, our defence to cybercrime lies in a pan-European cybersecurity response.<\/p>  <p>  What was once deemed fanciful thinking from the pages of Marvel comics and science fiction films is today a present reality.  The development of artificial intelligence and cyber intelligence are accelerating all the time.  Our national challenge is to be enabled by developing technology rather than emasculated by it.  As with all threat scenarios, we must quantify the risk and be ready to implement appropriate responses.  This requires insightful intelligence, expertise and proactive planning of resources to build a co-ordinated response.  Given our resource platforms, we are best served by integrating fully with the European response to cybercrime and terrorism security.<\/p>  <p>  The reality of Brexit has firmly positioned Ireland as a fully signed up member of the European project.  That reality exposes the vulnerability of Ireland to international crime and terrorism opportunities.  These traits are not only national but transnational.  Where digital technology is being utilised, these traits are not bounded by borders.  Cybercrime is now a well established fact in Ireland.  Many companies have faced hacking and ransomware attacks as well as fraudulent invoicing that involves using forged signatures and trademarks.  This is something I have seen personally with regard to a company in Waterford.  In that case, had it not been for the actions of the Garda fraud office and the ability of the officers to liaise with European cybercrime colleagues, a significant financial loss on an international financial transfer would have occurred.  That would have cost enterprise and jobs.<\/p>  <p>  In recent weeks, there has been much discussion in the media regarding the privilege and protection of personal data and how they are stored and protected.  In the modern digital age of cybercrime, data are the new currency to be traded and mined to deliver fraudulent opportunity.  Our national law enforcement capability cannot react fully to the transnational security challenge that faces the EU bloc through cybercrime, organised criminal activity and terrorism opportunity.  Therefore, we need to integrate our crime detection and response capability with those of other European countries to protect our country from malevolent large-scale crime and terrorist syndicates that target our shores daily.  If people think this statement is an exaggeration, I ask them to ponder the volume of illegal drugs that pass through this country every year in response to domestic and European demand.  We might also consider the human trafficking that has taken place in this country or that has been assisted by Irish individuals.  This has included the exploitation of manual labourers and sex workers.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation seeks to further cement Europol as the centrepiece for European law enforcement co-operation.  It proposes to give additional powers to handle large data sets to assist Ireland's crime prevention service, which has neither the capability nor the resources to fully analyse such data.  The proposed legislation seeks to strengthen our individual and pan-European responses to counter criminal activity in communications, banking and transport services.  These are among the largest sectors that facilitate international crime and terrorism.  This new legislation will aid additional co-operation in policing and judicial matters.  It will also allow the increased sharing of data and information of third country nationals and citizens on the Schengen information system, which is a European database used by Europol.  This information may be used in future prosecutions taken with Europol support.<\/p>  <p>  The Regional Group supports this proposed legislation.  We believe our future lies in Europe and through integrating with European cybercrime and terrorist responses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900025#X00300","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speech","time":1619699700,"counter":163,"content":"<p>We move to the Rural Independent Group.

They could vastly increase the powers of the EU policing agency, Europol.  They would grant Europol new data processing powers, a role in developing algorithms for the police and a mechanism to facilitate co-operation with non-EU states.  The policy states: \"In specific cases where Europol considers that a criminal investigation should be initiated into a crime falling within the scope of its objectives, it shall request the competent authorities of the Member\u00a0States concerned via the national units to initiate, conduct or coordinate such a criminal investigation.\"  That is a concern.  What are the implications of this for Ireland?  I believe this provision will allow Europol to set priorities for member states when it comes to investigations being carried out in the relevant territory.  Is this the case?  Can the Minister clarify the matter?  Many member states have flagged concerns about the contents of this provision.<\/p>  <p>  What level of consultation with Ireland, as a member state, will be required when it comes to sharing data with private parties?  This is especially troubling when the private party concerned is not established within the Union or in a country with which Europol has a co-operation agreement.  It would allow for the exchange of personal data under an international agreement which the Union has concluded under Article 218 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  Was this matter raised by the Government?  Are there implications for the rights of Irish citizens?<\/p>  <p>  Previous speakers spoke about cyberbullying and hacking.  I was the victim of hacking this week for the first time in my life.  It was not a major incident but it was frustrating to learn that people received emails with falsified details looking for personal details and they appeared to be sent from my email address.  My thanks go to the dozens of people who contacted me because they were concerned.  They knew it was fictitious.  It was a frustrating situation.

While we all want a stronger police force and stronger supports for Interpol, we have to be careful that we do not sign up to something that erodes our status in Europe.  We have so many ideas.  The document provided by the Commission to member states on 5 March last was sizeable covers many issues.  The purpose is to enable Europe to co-operate effectively with private parties.  We are all for that.  It will also enable Europol to process large, complex data sets and strengthen Europe's role in research and innovation.  These are all noble aims but I have concerns.<\/p>  <p>  I agree fully that we must be able to deal with criminals, sophisticated criminal gangs and sophisticated cybercrime.  We must be careful as well.  It is a difficult issue.  There is a reference to strengthening Europe's co-operation with third countries.  I note there is mention of giving information to the Schengen organisation.  It is rather complex.<\/p>  <p>  In these times, we are seeing how liberties are being seriously eroded.  I hope I will not get another lecture from the Minister like the one I got last night.  I will not take such a lecture.

This has very significant implications.  There is obviously good and bad in everything but we need to make haste slowly and to be sure that we are not signing ourselves up to something that we will regret.  There will be issues.  Our citizens above all have to be protected while at the same time trying to protect the laws of the land and our citizens in dealing with drug and other crime as well.  We have to be wide awake and to understand what we are signing up to.

How inaccessible are the European Parliament and the Council in the business they conduct?  There must be a better way of doing this.<\/p><p>Europol is located in The Hague, the Netherlands, and states that it supports &ldquo;the 27 EU Member States in their fight against terrorism, cybercrime and other serious and organised forms of crime&rdquo;.  There are over 1,000 staff; 220 liaison officers and approximately 100 crime analysts that reportedly support over 40,000 international investigations per year.<\/p><p>Earlier this week, in the Committee on Justice, we heard from the Data Protection Commissioner and other experts on GDPR.  There was a great amount of criticism of the Data Protection Commissioner.  Interestingly, in researching for today, this regulation is cited on the Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s website.  It says that since 1 May 2017: &ldquo;In line with Europol Regulation (EU) 2016\/794, the European Data Protection Supervisor is designated as the supervisor of personal data processing&rdquo;.<\/p><p>There are national supervisory authorities through a Europol Cooperation Board, ECB, for which the European data protection supervisors provides the secretariat.  The website states that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tthe EDPS acts as an independent supervisory authority with full-fledged enforcement powers, whose decisions can be challenged before the European Court of Justice.  The EDPS is also accountable for his or her supervision activity before the Joint Parliamentary Scrutiny Group, JPSG, composed of representatives of the European and of national Parliament, established under the Europol Regulation. <\/blockquote>  <p>Will there be any changes to this aspect of data protection through the amendments of this regulation?<\/p><p>Last June, Europol&rsquo;s EU Terrorism Situation and Trend, TE-SAT, report showed that right-wing extremism was growing in Ireland.  The report showed that in 2019 there was an increase in violent right-wing activities.  Europol reported that there is a &ldquo;strong international network involving right-wing extremists from Ireland, other European countries and the USA&rdquo;.  I would think that it is fair to say that since the emergence of Covid-19 globally the far right have gained stronger footholds in communities.  They are preying on people&rsquo;s fears, the anti-Government, anti-lockdown and anti-mask sentiment in trying to build their movements.  So much of this recruitment and grooming is happening online.  Europol and all other relevant agencies, civil society groups and others are going to have to step up their game to combat the spread of disinformation, lies and dangerous scapegoating.  In this regard I would like to commend the Far Right Observatory and similar groups which have been working diligently to gather information on the tactics, personalities and plans of the far right in Ireland.  I wonder what our State has in mind in this regard also because it is vitally important.<\/p><p>Europol has also reported that the Covid-19 pandemic has opened up opportunities for criminal gangs.  There are gangs offering fake vaccines and bogus home testing kits.  Europol&rsquo;s Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment, SOCTAS, report has said that the threat has never been greater.  The SOCTAS review is conducted every four years into the impact of high-level crime on the EU.  Media reports said that Europol &ldquo;previously identified the Rathkeale Rovers, an Irish-based crime gang, as forging Covid-19 test results and selling the false documents across Europe.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Another arm of Europol is its European Financial and Economic Crime Centre, EFECC.  The EFECC is said to have played a part in working on the intelligence provided by different countries on an Irish criminal network.  This led to the Criminal Asset Bureau of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na taking action against a criminal gang.  There were fund transfers in excess of &euro;4 million identified from other jurisdictions into Irish bank accounts linked to members of this criminal network.  This is an example of agencies working well together to go after serious criminals.<\/p><p>The explanatory memorandum provided on the regulation speaks to the digital transformation of the landscape.  It tells us that the European Counter Terrorism Centre of Europol has increased fivefold.  In 2016, there were 127 operational cases supported and this had risen to 632 cases in 2019.  A resolution by the European Parliament in July last year called for cross-border investigations into &ldquo;serious attacks against whistleblowers and investigative journalists&rdquo; and it would be interesting to see that developed.<\/p><p>As always, the Commission plans to strengthen Europol&rsquo;s mandate.  We are told that the legislation &ldquo;takes full account of the relevant EU data protection legislation&rdquo;.  I have noticed that this is a one-sentence-fits-all statement but as we heard in the Committee on Justice earlier this week there are questions around the application and enforcement of data protection legislation in Ireland, so I would imagine that it is similar in other member states.  I also wonder how that will be impacted by this proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900026#Y00200","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1619700300,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy call the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900026#Y00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1619700300,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  There were some important and technical issues raised and I will try to get answers for the Deputies on some of those points.<\/p>  <p>  We all agree that co-operation with Europol makes sense.  The threats that we face are continuing to evolve.  Criminals will always be ready to exploit the advantages that they can gain from new situations and technologies and I am thinking about the Internet and how fast this is changing in our everyday lives.  Globalisation and increased mobility of people also present new opportunities for criminals.  I am conscious that there have been four significant terrorist attacks in Europe since September 2020 alone.  Terrorism remains a significant threat to our freedom and to the way of life of the citizens of the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  I have no doubt that criminals will exploit the Covid-19 crisis in ways that we have not even imagined yet.  The European Commission is of the view that the full impact of the Covid-19 crisis on security is not yet apparent but it could potentially shape the landscape of serious and organised crimes in the EU for the mid to long term.  Given how everything is changing, we must ensure that Europol has the capabilities and tools to support member states effectively in countering serious crime and terrorism.  The political guidelines for the von der Leyen Commission stated that the EU would leave no stone unturned when it comes to protecting our citizens.<\/p>  <p>  While this appears to be a highly technical proposal from the Commission, it is simply about keeping people safe.  As I said earlier, the opt-in allows Ireland to participate in the negotiation process.  It is not clear if all of the issues raised in the draft regulation will be part of the final agreed instrument.  There may be elements of the proposals that would be of real value to Ireland and some elements that would be of less importance to us.  With that in mind, I do not propose to go over all of the key provisions of the regulation again but there are a number that I would like to focus on.<\/p>  <p>  First, I refer to co-operation with third countries.  The 2016 regulation gave the power to the European Commission to conclude co-operation agreements on behalf of Europol with third countries.  Since then, no new agreements have been reached and negotiations are underway with only one third country, New Zealand.  There is a requirement to put such agreements in place in a quicker manner and Ireland will support any changes which will allow that to happen.  The amending regulation proposes changes to allow the executive director to be authorised to transfer certain data to third countries in specific situations on a case-by-case basis. The circumstances for such transfers will need to be properly regulated.<\/p>  <p>  Concerns have been raised in this House and in the other House on data protection.  Europol already operates to the highest standards in this regard.  Given the importance of the processing of personal data for the work of police in general, this draft regulation puts a particular focus on the need to ensure full compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and notably the rights to the protection of personal data and the respect of private life.<\/p>  <p>  The regulation also outlined a more detailed designated position and the tasks of the Europol data protection officer, highlighting the importance of this function in the EU data protection architecture.  There are new safeguards on the processing of personal data for research innovation processes and new provisions on the keeping of records of categories of data-processing activities.<\/p>  <p>  Questions have been raised about the provision on \"private parties\".  By \"private parties\" the regulation is referring to private non-state actors which are legal persons.  This would include Internet service providers and social media companies.  Criminals increasingly use the cross-border services of private parties to communicate and carry out illegal activities such as child pornography, radicalisation or credit card fraud.<\/p> <p>The new rules would allow Europol to engage directly with private parties in member states.  The new provisions respond to the problems faced by private parties and law enforcement authorities when co-operating on crimes in which the offender, victims and relevant IT infrastructure are under multiple jurisdictions within the European Union and beyond.<\/p> <p> The new provisions would also allow Europol to support law enforcement authorities in its interactions with private parties on, for example, the removal of terrorist content online.  These provisions are highly important.<\/p> <p> I refer also to the provisions in relation to the parliamentary oversight and accountability of Europol.  The European Parliament has been supportive of a stronger role for Europol.  A resolution in the parliament in July 2020 stated that \"a strengthened mandate should go hand-in-hand with adequate parliamentary scrutiny\".  The European Parliament will require detailed justification for the necessity for any new data processing capability at Europol and will call for strong data protection safeguards.<\/p> <p> Provisions contained in the draft introduce new reporting obligations for Europol to the joint parliamentary scrutiny group and I support these provisions.  To enable effective political monitoring, Europol should provide a joint parliamentary group with annual information on the use of these new provisions.<\/p> <p> Deputies will be aware that Ireland only recently joined the Schengen Information System, SIS, which enables Europe's law enforcement authorities to check and share data on banned, missing and wanted individuals, as well as lost or stolen property.  This is the largest law enforcement database in Europe and connecting to it has already enhanced our national security and strengthened our co-operation at a European level.<\/p> <p> This legislative initiative is linked to a separate legislative initiative that would allow Europol to enter data into the Schengen Information System, SIS, on the suspected involvement of a third country national in a crime in respect of which Europol is competent.  Ireland is automatically bound by the SIS proposal, which the Government supports.<\/p> <p> Finally, a range of other smaller but, still important, provisions are contained in the draft regulation that will add to the existing tasks of Europol, including supporting member states special intervention units; supporting member states through the co-ordination of cyber attacks; supporting investigations against high-risk criminals; supporting the Commission and the member states in carrying out effective risk assessments; providing threat assessment analysis; allowing Europol staff to give evidence in criminal proceedings in member states; and clarifying that Europol staff may provide operational support in member states should they be requested to do so.<\/p> <p> The benefits of Ireland's full participation in Europol will always far outweigh any small aspects we do not like or do not seem to be relevant to us.  As Minister of State, I would like to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in having access to all of the international systems and networks available to help it solve crime.  International co-operation in tackling crime is essential in the modern world given the nature of serious and organised crime and terrorism.  Consequently, full and active membership of organisations such as Europol is essential.<\/p> <p> Once again, I ask the Deputies to support this motion and to support Ireland's continued, active engagement in Europol.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900026#Y00400","speaker":"1618","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1619700900,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"National Marine Planning Framework: Motion","time":1619700900,"counter":172,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900027#Z00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1619700900,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the draft National Marine Planning Framework, a copy of which was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 24th March, 2021. <\/blockquote>  <p>With the introduction of the national marine planning framework, followed closely by the maritime area planning Bill and the maritime jurisdiction Bill and, in the near future, the expansion of our network of marine protected areas, we will experience a seismic change in how we manage and protect our maritime area.  This is an historic development, providing a new way of looking at our relationship with the seas that surround us.  As Minister of State with responsibility for planning and local government, I am proud to be leading this programme of modernisation.<\/p><p>Our maritime area is seven times the landmass of Ireland, more than 490,000 sq. km of some of the most productive and diverse resources in the world.  When we take our seabed into account, Ireland is one of the largest countries in the EU and our coastline of 7,500 km is longer than that of many our European counterparts.<\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s coast and seas possess environmental and social treasures which include a diverse ecosystem, a range of recreational opportunities such as fishing, sailing and surfing and culturally unique coastal communities and historic sites.The maritime area and coast play a significant part in defining Ireland, attracting tourists from around the world.<\/p><p>Our national maritime area also holds great economic value.  In 2019, Ireland&rsquo;s ocean economy provided employment for more than 34,000 full-time equivalents, a 13% rise on the previous year.  It had a turnover of &euro;6.2 billion through activities such as seafood and tourism.  Huge economic opportunities in areas such as renewable energy, which is critical to Ireland&rsquo;s clean, decarbonised future, remain untapped in our waters.<\/p><p>Government recognises how fragile our marine environment is.  It is determined to strike the right balance between the three, sometimes competing, pillars of sustainable development, protecting the health of the ocean, enhancing our social engagement with the sea and developing a thriving maritime economy.  These pillars can coexist through proper, conscientious long-term planning, working in tandem with a robust, fair and transparent licensing regime.<\/p><p>I am seeking a resolution from this House approving the final text which will allow me to establish the national marine planning framework.<\/p><p>The European Maritime Spatial Planning Directive requires all member states to publish and implement marine spatial plans by the first quarter of 2021.  The State&rsquo;s maritime spatial plan, which we call the national marine planning framework, represents the outcome of a cross-Government approach over the past four years to develop Ireland&rsquo;s first marine spatial plan.<\/p><p>The national marine planning framework is intended as a marine equivalent to the national planning framework.  As such, it provides a long-term spatial planning framework up to 2040, providing a clear decision-making framework for marine regulatory bodies over a long term and structured around the three pillars of sustainable development, the environmental, economic and social pillars.<\/p><p>The national marine planning framework outlines our approach to managing Ireland&rsquo;s maritime activities to ensure the sustainable use of marine resources up to 2040.  This single framework, which brings together all marine-based human activities, presents our vision, objectives and planning policies for each activity.  Those activities include: aquaculture; fisheries; offshore renewable energy; ports; harbours and shipping; safety at sea; sport and recreation; tourism; and waste water treatment and disposal, all of which are important and deserving of protection, support and development.<\/p><p>To support this new management approach, the national marine planning framework sets out extensive context information, including more than 70 maps that indicate areas of importance to particular activities.<\/p> <p>Planning and licensing of these activities will now occur within a bigger picture that balances the development of these activities with the health of the ocean.  The national marine planning framework, NMPF, will be the key decision-making tool for Departments, State agencies, regulatory authorities and policymakers.  All planning applications, policies, projects and strategies will now be obliged to meet the objectives of the NMPF.<\/p> <p> I mentioned that this framework is part of a series of major reforms in the maritime area.  Following recent Government approval of the text, my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, will shortly be publishing the maritime jurisdiction Bill.  This Bill will consolidate and update the State&rsquo;s maritime jurisdiction legislation and describe the State&rsquo;s territorial seas and its maritime area. <\/p> <p> In coming weeks, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and I will bring the maritime area planning Bill to Government for approval to publish.  This Bill is a priority identified in the programme for Government and will be a key enabler for our overall decarbonisation programme targets.  Broadly, it will introduce a new marine planning system, which seeks to protect the maritime area in the first instance, but also allow for development where robust environmental assessments have taken place.  The Bill will establish a new agency, the maritime area regulatory authority, MARA, which will license activities under the strictest of environmental protection conditions and serve as the gatekeeper for full planning permission applications.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la will consider planning applications for larger infrastructural projects, such as interconnectors and offshore wind farms, and will consider the full suite of environmental impact assessments for each project while being guided by the NMPF.  This Bill has undergone pre-legislative scrutiny and is currently being finalised.<\/p> <p> The Government has set a target of expanding Ireland&rsquo;s network of marine protected areas, MPAs, to cover 30% of our maritime area by 2030.  Having a clean, healthy, diverse and productive marine environment will help protect biodiversity, our well-being and our economy.  It will also provide greater resilience against the effects of climate change and support a wide range of sustainable human activities and practices.  Ireland&rsquo;s network of MPAs will be an important tool for ensuring that we continue to have a thriving marine environment, whether in our coastal bays, shallow bays or deeper in the Atlantic.  To that end, the report of an independent, Government-appointed expert advisory group on expanding Ireland&rsquo;s network of marine protected areas was published by my Department in January 2021 and is currently the subject of public consultation.  My Department will be developing legislation based on this report and consultation, further contributing to the reform of marine governance.<\/p> <p> My Department has ensured that the NMPF has been developed using an ecosystem-based approach.  Following introductory material, an overarching \"Environmental &ndash; Ocean Health\" section is the first part of the plan readers get to.  This section comprises nine chapters setting out 21 of the NMPF&rsquo;s 92 policies.  The ocean health chapters have been developed to integrate with the contribution of the Government&rsquo;s work on the marine strategy framework directive, MSFD, seeking to achieve good environmental status, GES, across a range of descriptors supported by targets.  The relationship between the MSFD and the ocean health chapters act as descriptors and targets and is made explicit in terms of structure and content. <\/p> <p> In relation to standing environmental measures, it is explicitly set out that the NMPF reinforces the need for rigorous environmental assessments.  The NMPF also includes policies, supporting information and maps aimed at enhancing consideration of existing marine protected sites &ndash; those already designated &ndash; as well as articulating the need for decision makers to make efforts to account for ongoing and future designation processes.<\/p> <p> The NMPF is the culmination of very extensive public and stakeholder engagement during its development.  It is our belief that the plan needed to be strategic as well as instructional and informed by effective public and stakeholder participation.  Therefore, a core principle in developing the plan has been to ensure that, as well as the wider public, all relevant stakeholders are consulted and encouraged to contribute.  The consultation on the NMPF was the longest running and most extensive of its type. <\/p> <p> Dialogue has been, and will continue to be, facilitated in a number of ways.  An interdepartmental group was established to aid the development of the plan.  This is chaired by my Department and is made up of senior representatives from relevant Departments and Government agencies.  Many bilateral meetings were held with the broad public sector bodies where the marine functional responsibilities lie.  An advisory group, which I chair, was established in 2018 to guide the development of the NMPF.  This group was invaluable in imparting collective knowledge and offering guidance.  The group features representatives of the environmental, economic, and social pillars as well as relevant public sector organisations.  <\/p> <p> The environmental pillar features representatives from bodies such as An Taisce, Coastwatch, Sustainable Water Network, SWAN, and the Irish Environmental Network.  The social pillar features representatives such as the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and academia.  The economic pillar has representatives from IBEC, the Irish Farmers Association, IFA Aquaculture, various Irish fish producers and the tourism sector.  The group has met 11 times and I intend to request members of this group to now guide implementation and monitoring of the NMPF, next steps that members have expressed a keen interest in being involved with.<\/p> <p> Following the launch of the NMPF baseline report in 2018, five regional public events were held as part of a statutory public consultation.  When we launched the draft NMPF, a further eight events were held throughout the country, seven of them in coastal locations, during 2019 and 2020.  Elected representatives from those areas were invited to attend each meeting.  When public health restrictions meant we could no longer hold town hall meetings, my Department extended the period of consultation and moved the consultation online, a first for the Civil Service.<\/p> <p> In addition to these public events, my Department engaged with, and participated in, more than 150 conferences, seminars and marine stakeholder events during this time, promoting awareness and understanding of both the NMPF and the public&rsquo;s role in the wider marine planning process.  Public participation was an integral element of the NMPF consultation process.  My Department strongly believes in the importance of engagement and education about Ireland&rsquo;s marine resources, the NMPF and the proposed marine planning system.  Through Government initiatives such as SeaFest, Ireland&rsquo;s national marine festival, and other outreach activities, my Department has worked in partnership with other stakeholders, such as the Marine Institute, to promote marine education opportunities and strengthen our maritime identity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900027#Z00400","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619701500,"counter":175,"content":"<p>The national marine planning framework is a document of enormous importance.  It is a statutory plan that will shape the future of our marine, and all the people who use it, for a generation.  The idea that something of this importance, equivalent to law in its impact, would only receive a two-hour committee presentation from officials from the Department and a 45-minute debate on this floor with five minutes per party and grouping is, I have to say, a real disgrace.  The Oireachtas has a very specific purpose under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018, to properly scrutinise these kinds of plans to ensure they are the most robust, compliant and effective plans possible.  I simply do not understand why the Government has denied both committee members and the Oireachtas from doing the job required by the enabling legislation.<\/p>  <p>  There is much of merit in this plan.  In fact, we did not want a controversy over its passage.  However, there are three key areas where this plan falls down and requires urgent attention.  It is not the case, as the Minister of State stated, that the marine protected areas are coming shortly.  That legislation has not even been drafted.  It is unlikely to be passed before the end of the year at the earliest.  We know from other jurisdictions it will take two to three years before marine protected areas are designated.  Meanwhile, applications for very large, industrial-sized, offshore wind farms will be processed under this plan and the consequent planning legislation.  They will be blind to the impact of that, much-needed, wind energy on the marine environment.  Therefore, the Government should try to accelerate the marine protected areas legislation and designation.  When that legislation is passed, the east coast should be prioritised for designation, where appropriate, because that is where the first wind farm operations will be progressed.<\/p>  <p>  The second weakness in this plan is its impact on inshore fishermen.  If one talks to members of the National Inshore Fisherman's Association, NIFA, they will flatly contradict what the Minister of State has told the House today.  They have not been adequately engaged with or listened to and are genuinely concerned that just as they are being pushed around by industry today as they prepare for their planning applications, they and the communities they sustain will be the big losers.<\/p> <p>Environmental NGOs such as the Irish Wildlife Trust, IWT, the Sustainable Water Network, SWAN, an Taisce and others and the inshore fishermen have repeatedly told Deputies that the consultation has not been adequate, has not been deep and their views have not been adhered to.  All we wanted in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage was to give those two groups a hearing, alongside the officials from the Department specialising in marine protected areas, whom we had not heard from, concerning questions other officials who had presented to us were unable to answer.  <\/p> <p> Why a Government would want to silence and prevent Deputies in this House hearing from well-established and reputable environmental NGOs, representatives of inshore fishermen and departmental officials I do not know.  We even proposed that a hearing could have been held during the recess and that would have meant we could then have made our views known to the Minister.  We could be here today, then, with a two- or three-hour debate progressing this motion in the full knowledge of the concerns which many people have.  <\/p> <p> There is also a genuine concern that significant portions of this plan and the consequent legislation for a marine planning regime will not be compliant with the necessary EU directives.  I refer to the requirement in the first instance to take an ecosystems approach to the protection of the marine environment and for the plan to not only be spatial but also temporal, something which is completely absent from the text detail.  <\/p> <p> I have a suspicion the reason debate and scrutiny have been shut down by Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party is because there was a provision in the 2018 enabling Act stating that if an Oireachtas committee scrutinised this plan and if it made its views known to the Minister regarding changes, improvement or parallel additions being required, such a recommendation would have had legal effect.  The Minister would have been obliged to act.  The reason we have this charade today is because the Government does not want Deputies to highlight the failings and weaknesses of this plan and consequent legislation and does not want to be democratically obliged, by way of a report from an Oireachtas committee, to make the required improvements.  <\/p> <p> What is the consequence?  Bad and rushed planning legislation leads to bad planning decisions, judicial reviews and to delays.  That is what has happened with previous bad planning legislation and that is what will happen with these plans.  It could have been otherwise if the Government had just worked with the Opposition to make this the most effective marine planning framework possible.  That it did not is deeply unfortunate and many people will be much the worst off because of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900028#AA00200","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619702100,"counter":177,"content":"<p>It is deeply regrettable that this item of business is getting off to such a poor start.  The requests at the Business Committee last week, in the D&aacute;il yesterday and again today, and in the contribution of Deputy &Oacute; Broin and subsequent contributions to follow, including mine, were and are perfectly reasonable.  The Minister of State stated that this has been the longest consultation in the history of the State.  What would another week have cost in that context?<\/p>  <p>  We have committees that are dying to do proper work and to scrutinise legislation.  This proposed plan deserves a great deal of scrutiny because it is a huge piece of work.  Our sea area is seven times the size of our land mass and we are developing a spatial strategy for that entire area.  It has never been done like this before.  It is vitally important.  Last week, this week and next week we will be discussing the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021.  To achieve our climate action goals, we will have to lean heavily on renewable energy, and offshore wind energy is going to play a big part in that overall context.  We have some offshore energy now, but comparing that to what we need means that a great deal more is yet to come.  That is going to have a big impact on communities. <\/p>  <p>  We must have strong and robust spatial planning legislation for offshore projects in place before such proposals come before us.  We are deeply concerned that we do not have that in place.  Nothing which has been discussed in the last week has allayed those concerns among the Opposition.  We cannot go through this process and come out with several marine Bills that are strong and robust if the elements on which those Bills must impact, especially in respect of offshore energy, have already been delivered.  I refer to such aspects as the laying of cables having already been delivered.  The horse should not have bolted from this stable, but our worry is that it already has.<\/p>  <p>  These are all things that must happen and which we must support.  We need offshore energy and energy security, but we must also protect the delicate ecology of our seas.  In the draft consultation document, several appendices are dedicated just to the spawning and nursery grounds of our fish.  There is so much to this area.  We must also deal with coastal erosion effectively.  It is literally eating away at communities and washing homes into the sea.  There is a piecemeal approach to this aspect, which means that some local authorities are able to stop coastal erosion, and stop it effectively, while other local authorities are powerless because of special area of conservation, SAC, designations or National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, rules and regulations.  <\/p>  <p>  That must stop and these regulations should do that.  They need to do that, but we must have confidence that they have been scrutinised effectively by Oireachtas committees.  We do not have that now.  A debate of 55 minutes, as this is today, with five minutes for each group, is absolutely shameful considering the amount of ground this plan covers and the impact it is going to have, not just for one generation, but for generations to come.  It is totally unsuitable in respect of what we are discussing today.  <\/p>  <p>  Turning to a broader point, we have been operating for months on a reduced schedule.  We have had reduced time in the D&aacute;il, in committees and in the Seanad due to the Covid-19 crisis.  That is now having an impact on how we are able to scrutinise important legislation.  We are at a crucial point as parliamentarians regarding how we organise our business and how we scrutinise what needs to come through the Oireachtas.  This Bill is one of those moments which has highlighted how restricted, I do not want to say poor, our Parliament is in its operations now.  We must redouble our efforts to ensure we have enough time to debate something as serious as this issue.  We could have an hour each on this topic and still not have covered a fraction of the impacts of this Bill.  Therefore, 55 minutes for this debate is derisory and deeply regrettable.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900029#BB00200","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speech","time":1619702100,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I support comments from previous Deputies regarding the amount of time for this debate and the lack of scrutiny in committee being completely unacceptable.  The Government has had great co-operation from Opposition parties during the last year concerning restricted timings.  When, across the board, we have raised concerns about this aspect, the Government was not willing to listen and engage.<\/p>  <p>  The lack of scrutiny in committee is particularly disappointing.  Regarding the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, when officials from the Department appeared before it, they did not flag with the committee that it potentially had a role in respect of scrutinising this plan and in drawing up a report, as per section 73(2) of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018.  That subsection makes it very clear that an Oireachtas committee can, by way of a report, address any concerns it might have concerning these marine spatial plans and that the Minister is required by law to give regard to any findings arrived at by the committee.  In that sense, this is highly regrettable. <\/p>  <p>  I believe this is an erosion of the democratic process and of our role as an Oireachtas in this process.  The lessons from the Derrybrien wind farm case clearly have not been learned by the Government.  The State in that instance has been paying out about &euro;15 million in fines for rushing through planning legislation in the past and having made mistakes from doing so.  As was said, not trying to rectify these mistakes through scrutiny leads to delays, objections, judicial reviews and additional costs.  The objective we all share in respect of wanting to support and facilitate renewable energy, and wind energy especially, gets delayed through not doing this properly.  Scrutiny of the plan could have been done over the Easter recess, as I and other Deputies requested, but the Government voted us down.  <\/p>  <p>  The European Union's maritime spatial planning directive is clear that we must have an ecosystems-based sustainable approach in respect of our marine planning framework.  <\/p> <p>In that regard, it is very important that account is taken of areas that need restoration and conservation.  Article 8.1 of the directive requires the framework to identify spatial and temporal distribution of activities and uses in the marine area.  There is no discretion in this regard.  These are flaws which I and my party wished to scrutinise and highlight and I have to ask why the Government would not allow time for that to be done.  Why is it trying to avoid that scrutiny?<br\/><br\/>This issue has significant implications for the marine environment, protecting sensitive marine ecosystems and ensuring that livelihoods from sustainable fishing can continue uninterrupted.  I have met people working in the fishing industry and those whose families have been working in fishing for generations.  The disruption already being caused to their livelihoods and the fact that they have to hire lawyers and take legal action just to try to protect their livelihoods are completely unacceptable.  We should be able to facilitate renewable energy and protect the marine environment and sustainable fishing.<br\/><br\/>Significant concerns have been expressed by the environmental sector and NGOs on this issue, particularly with regard to the incredibly slow progress by the Government in the context of marine protected areas.  It has been delayed for years.  We have not seen any action in terms of robust interim measures on marine protected areas as recommended by the Oireachtas housing committee.  We need the Government to step up with regard to marine protected areas and put resources into protecting areas that need it.  The Irish Wildlife Trust stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe Oireachtas must be allowed to fully debate and scrutinise the Marine Planning Framework in a democratic manner.  Decisions made on foot of this plan will have far reaching implications for our seas and, as it stands, threatens to seriously exacerbate our biodiversity crisis.  We simply can&rsquo;t afford to further imperil threatened marine life in the rush to develop the marine environment. <\/blockquote> <p>It seems the Government is not willing to listen to those voices and concerns or to engage, find solutions and make sure the national marine planning framework can be as good as it ought to be as it and needs to be to comply with our European Union objectives.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion, there is no reason we cannot facilitate renewable energy, protect the marine environment and protect livelihoods in fishing.  We have enough marine space to do all of those things, but we need to do them properly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900029#BB00300","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619702700,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.  Deputy Cian O'Callaghan and I objected at the Business Committee to the original plan of the Government to attempt to push through this motion on the marine planning framework without debate.   I am glad we did so.  It is clear the Government wants to ram this through in order to silence legitimate concerns and questions by people concerned with our precious marine environment, including groups such as fishermen.<\/p>  <p>  Only a few weeks ago, I raised the issue of private developers who have got hold of the Codling Bank riding roughshod over fishermen and refusing to properly consult them as they do their surveys.  They are trying to short-change the fishers in terms of compensation for lost income.  They are moving the goalposts and generally refusing to engage.  This is a worrying echo of the sort of behaviour seen during the madness of onshore private development that led to the Celtic tiger and the property and financial crash that hit this country.  Now it seems there are efforts to replicate that in terms of the offshore by using the critical issue of developing renewable energy essentially as an excuse to hand over large stretches of the marine environment to private companies interested in profiting from that.<\/p>  <p>  Since the Foreshore Act was essentially struck down in 2013 because it did not have a proper level of consultation, the Minister has been, in effect, issuing private companies with the right to grab whatever sites they want offshore, including environmentally sensitive sites such as the Kish Bank and the Codling Bank.  This is impacting on fishermen and has the potential to impact very badly on the marine environment and biodiversity in the marine environment.  It is worth noting that, according to the official EU body for wind turbines, the average distance for offshore wind in the EU is 43 km.  However, huge marine sites 6 km and 7 km off the east coast of Ireland are being given to private companies that will have no obligation to in any way benefit this country and in a way that could be devastating for fishermen, marine biology and biodiversity.  It is the wild west once again.  Private developers who wrecked onshore development and brought about an economic crash and housing crisis are now being given the licence through this process to rubber stamp the privatisation of the marine environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900030#CC00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1619702700,"counter":181,"content":"<p>Like many other Members, I find it extraordinary that the House is being given a few minutes to discuss a document comprising more than 600 pages which has the potential to be of vast importance to the State and its people.  I came to the House today from the ESB picket lines and was thinking about the foundation of the ESB as a company run, led and funded by the State and the wonderful job it has done through the decades.  It is now being pulled apart by outsourcing and forms of privatisation.  These planning guidelines, like those applying to land, are really a dream for developers.  The developers will decide what is built and how, why and where it is built.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to spend a few minutes dealing with the chapter relating to energy because it is alarming.  The chapter trumpets the use of carbon capture and storage.  This is a system that does not exist at scale anywhere on the planet, yet it is being continually used in the climate emergency Bill and in this report.  What it is really saying is that the potential to drill for gas and oil remains and this infrastructure that will be developed will not interfere with it.  It is clear from the chapter on energy that there is an intention to protect and ring-fence the potential for drilling for and using fossil fuels into the future.  That must alarm anybody who is concerned about climate change and how we will deal with it because existing licences for decades to come will not be banned by the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and are good to go until 2035.  That means that fossil fuels and their future in this country are part of the report.  We have to reject that and not just limit, but end the use of all existing licences.  Petroleum-related activity and gas activity have no place in our future but this 600-page document which we are barely given time to discuss has given them pride of place.

In many cases, it resulted from the lack of debate and scrutiny.  It is a big frustration in the context of the way business is being conducted that, often, debate only happens after a bad proposal has been passed.  The Government is attempting to do the same thing with this motion.  The motto seems to be to rush it through, ignore concerns and curtail debate.  Only 55 minutes has been allocated for the House to discuss the motion.  That is not adequate time to carefully assess and debate the pros and cons of any motion.<\/p>  <p>  I completely discount the remarks of the Taoiseach to me yesterday on the floor of the House to the effect that this is not legislation but, rather, a framework.  What the Taoiseach did not say is that this framework will be underpinned by legislation.  That is when we see the problems.  Such problems can currently be seen in the national planning framework, which is underpinned by section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, allowing for guidelines to be issued at any time by the Minister.  However, these planning guidelines are developed by zealots and are being imposed across county councils and county councillors by the planning regulator in the most Stalinist fashion.  That is the reason we must have more debate on this so-called plan.  A college debating society would spend longer on a trivial topic for debate than 45 minutes the 160-odd Members of this country's main law-making chamber are getting to discuss important issues.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, I raised briefly with An Taoiseach the issue of a lack of joined-up thinking when it comes to issuing licences for marine activities.  Cable-laying conglomerates are currently being issued with licences to lay underwater cable in coastal waters by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.<\/p> <p>At the same time, there are numerous fishermen and women who have licences issued to them by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to fish in the same areas.  No consultation has taken place with the Departments as to how the cable-laying licence may impinge on the fishermen who have been there for their lifetime.  Now the cable-laying conglomerates are issuing legal measures telling the fishermen to cease and desist from fishing over their cables in the areas where the cables are laid.<\/p> <p> These massively rich corporations know their wealth places them in a strong position to bully the fishermen.  Many fishermen do not have the financial resources to fight a complex court case to defend their rights to fish.  In this situation, we have two licences granted by two separate Departments for two separate activities in the same waters which are ultimately in conflict with each other.  This is what I mean by a lack of joined-up thinking.  When it comes to the arms of the State, the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing.<\/p> <p> I would like to hear from the Taoiseach as to how this has happened.  We cannot allow anyone or anything to ride roughshod over fishermen and their rights to fish in our waters.  This year there has already been a 15% loss to quotas due to Brexit.  On top of that, the Government did not see fit to recognise the charter skippers when it came to providing Covid business supports.  They have been treated as if they do not exist or do not register as having any importance at Government level.<\/p> <p> The fishermen of Wexford, Duncannon and Kilmore want to be able to head out, earn their living and not arrive home to a threatening cease-and-desist letter waiting in their postbox from some billion-dollar conglomerate which sees them as being in the way.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine must take responsibility and take this in hand.  I am all in favour of wind energy but we cannot allow its roll-out to destroy our fishing industry further.  There have to be protections for the primary rights of fishermen, ferry operators and leisure craft operators who have serviced the islands of this country for decades and centuries.  Any licences awarded for an alternative marine activity must give due regard and higher priority to the activities of those who have fished our waters for decades and centuries.<\/p> <p> A token 45-minute debate does absolutely nothing for the confidence of the fishing communities, which are already of the belief that Government does not want them there or to continue in the sector.  A decommissioning scheme has been suggested but fishermen want to be able to earn their livelihood with mechanisms in place that allow them to do that.<\/p> <p> I call upon the Secretary General, Brendan Gleeson, to hold up his hand immediately in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and take ownership of the mistakes that have been made, to defend the fishermen currently having to go to the High Court to assert their rights over the multi-billion cable conglomerates and to take responsibility for the Department's failings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900030#CC00400","speaker":"1622","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619703300,"counter":184,"content":"<p>We go to the Rural Independents Group.

Some 75% of our population live in coastal counties and for as long as people have lived on this island, our seas have held sway over our imagination, sense of adventure and achievements.  Our ocean is one of our greatest treasures.  It supports a diverse range of economic activities such as seafood, tourism and renewable ocean energy and has abundant potential to open up new applications for health, medicine and technology.  Our maritime area is seven times the land mass of Ireland at over 490,000 km&sup2; of some of the most productive and diverse resources in the world.

As I asked the Taoiseach yesterday, what has this Government got against our fishing community?  This time it is the inshore fishermen that are being affected.  The Taoiseach was the acting Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine last year, a short time ago.  He signed a statutory instrument to impose penalty points on our fishermen.  While Brexit was happening, the Government was asleep at the wheel and now here we are with 45 minutes to debate this.  There is something very fishy happening yet again.  What is the rush?  Why are we not being given the appropriate time to debate this important framework?

The disgraceful way in which this motion is being rushed through brings the whole Oireachtas process into disrepute.  Legal advice was sought by the housing committee on section 73(2) of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018.  It states the Minister shall \"have regard to any resolution, report or recommendation of any committee of [the] Houses of the Oireachtas\".   The Oireachtas was not alerted to the fact that the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; have regard to recommendations from any committee of both Houses.  I believe that the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action was also trying to do something in relation to this plan.  The motion was rushed through the Seanad last week in a clandestine manner.  The way in which the Government is attempting to rush the motion through without proper process, scrutiny or recommendations is completely reckless and will lead to legal challenges down the line.<\/p> <p>Why can this Government never have foresight?  I have said before that it is disheartening to work within such a reactive system.  That is the problem.<\/p> <p> Earlier this week, the \"Echo Chamber\" podcast brought us voices we needed to hear on this matter when it hosted a panel with representatives from NGOs.  How did it come about that marine protected areas, MPAs, are not even included in the plan?  We had set a target that 10% of our seas would be MPAs by 2020, increasing to 30% by 2030.  Guess what?  It is 2021 and just 2.3% of our seas are MPAs.  The Department's advisory group's report, Expanding Ireland's Marine Protected Area Network, is open for public consultation until Friday, 30 July 2021.  The website states: \"Informed by these steps and the resulting information, the Department intends to begin developing legislation on the identification, designation and management of MPAs later in 2021.\"  How can these matters be worked on separately?  It makes absolutely no sense.<\/p> <p> I thank the Irish Wildlife Trust for hosting the first town hall meeting on MPAs yesterday and for choosing to kick off the series in Donegal.  We have a lot of dedicated activists and groups who want the best and to highlight our beautiful country.  It is also telling that fishermen were not consulted on the matter.  The people who work at sea and use it to earn a living were not even consulted on what is being proposed.<\/p> <p> The excuse that we are late for transposition of the EU directive does not hold water - pun intended.  EU Directive 2014\/89\/EU was adopted in 2014 by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.  This regulation was originally transposed in 2016 and then repealed and replaced in October 2018.  The marine spatial plan was supposed to be in place by March 2021.  This has been in the pipeline for years.  We are asking for a few weeks to undertake proper scrutiny and make recommendations.  A few weeks will not make a difference to the EU but will make a significant difference to the future of our marine estate.  The matter is far too important to ignore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900031#DD00600","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619703900,"counter":190,"content":"<p>It is significant that we do not have a copy of the Minister of State's speech.

The Minister of State is asking us to rush through a framework that will set the entire agenda for the Bill that will come before us with the marine protected areas excluded, the fishermen excluded, and many other areas also excluded.  We have learned nothing from Derrybrien and the landslide in Donegal.  We have learned nothing from Shell to Sea, which fought every step of the way to make the system safer.

I wish to strongly respond to what has been said and point to the consultation that has taken place on the Bill.  The Government has prioritised this area.  We can see that by the action it took in setting up the stakeholder advisory group composed of almost 50 different actors from various sectors, including fisheries.  There was robust engagement with them.  The engagement was carried out on a regional basis over several years.<\/p>  <p>  I cannot be held to account for a process that went on for three years but that was not prioritised by the Oireachtas joint committee in its work.  My job is to try to ensure that we get the best possible plan together, one that has gone through the most robust scrutiny through the Department and its engagement with the various actors.  I am confident that has been done.  People attended more than 150 conferences.  The facts speak for themselves.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that we get a joined-up plan.  Many speakers articulated the gaps that exist in the foreshore area.  The framework does everything to join all the dots and come up with a plan that we can be proud of.  It speaks volumes that both An Taisce and IBEC say this is an exciting plan, in a good way.<\/p>  <p>  The NMPF is a national document that sets out the State's approach to managing Ireland's marine activities and ensuring sustainable use of marine resources to 2040.  The framework, bringing together all marine-based human activities, articulates the Government's vision, objectives and planning policies for each activity.  It outlines how they will interact with each other in an ocean space that is under increasing spatial pressure.<\/p>  <p>  As I indicated, the Government has consulted broadly in preparing this framework, including running two public consultations, and is moving to establish it now, in line with the requirements of the EU maritime spatial directive.  The finalised NMPF will be the key decision-making tool for Departments, State agencies and regulatory authorities in making decisions on marine activities.  Decisions will include planning applications as well as policies, projects and strategies.<\/p>  <p>  The framework will be a parallel document to the national planning framework, which provides a high-level guide to terrestrial planning and development over the next 20 years.  The NMPF applies to the work of public bodies, including functions related to the formulation of any policy, programme or plan in relation to development or activity, or proposed development or activity, in the maritime area; the giving of any consent or approval, or the grant or issue of licences, certificates or other like documents, under any enactment for the purposes of any such development or activity, or any such proposed development or activity; and the regulation of any such development or activity.<\/p>  <p>  I will outline the benefits of the NMPF.  It will contribute significantly to the effective management of marine resources.  Long-term forward planning for Ireland's maritime area will enhance the effective management of marine activities and more sustainable use of our marine resources.  The NMPF will provide a clear direction for managing our seas, clarifying objectives and establishing priorities.  It will direct decision makers, marine users and stakeholders towards more strategic and efficient use of marine resources.  It will inform decisions about the current and future development of the maritime area, aiming to integrate needs.<\/p>  <p>  The NMPF will ensure co-ordinated planning decisions, consistent with the Government's vision and objectives.  Marine users, including regulators, applicants for consent and interested persons, should find that the reformed marine planning system will reduce the regulatory burden on them by giving them more certainty regarding what can happen and where, thereby speeding up the licensing process.<\/p>  <p>  The NMPF will support Ireland in taking climate action and meeting the Government's ambitious renewable energy targets.  Specifically, the NMPF contains a number of overarching marine planning policies aimed at requiring marine regulators and decision makers to take account of climate action when considering any proposal for marine use or activity, including, for example, ports development, aquaculture, shipping, etc.<\/p>  <p>  The NMPF reiterates the Government's climate action plan's commitment to a major shift away from oil combustion within the heat and transport sectors towards renewable energy in the coming decade.  The NMPF has been prepared with an ecosystem-based approach, comprehensively outlining an integrated management of human activities in the maritime space, based on the best available scientific knowledge.  This approach will achieve the sustainable use of ecosystem goods and services and the maintenance of ecosystem integrity.<\/p>  <p>  I will now turn to the environmental assessments of the NMPF.  As part of the preparation of the NMPF, a strategic environmental assessment, SEA, and an appropriate assessment, AA, have been carried out.<\/p> <p>These assessments have been undertaken to evaluate the high-level impacts of the NMPF on the environment and to inform the direction of the NMPF.  This is to ensure that the national objectives and outcomes respond to the sensitivities and requirements of the wider natural environment, the likely environmental consequences of decisions regarding the future accommodation of development and how negative effects can be reduced, offset or avoided.  The NMPF is in full compliance with relevant legal environmental requirements.<\/p> <p> As I previously mentioned, the MSP advisory group was established to facilitate participation in the marine spatial planning process by all relevant stakeholders from the economic, environmental and social pillars.  The intended purpose of the advisory group was to harness the potential and capacity of a broad range of sectors, including representation from the public sector, business, environmental, social and knowledge based sectors to guide strategic thinking and decision-making in the preparation of marine spatial plans.  I am pleased to say that the work of the advisory group throughout this process was of an exceptional standard, having provided expert reports, recommendations or updates when required, thus informing the work of the interdepartmental group and strongly influencing the final NMPF.<\/p> <p> The NMPF contains a commitment to regional or sub-national plans in future planning cycles.  These will be more localised and will potentially be more empowering for coastal communities throughout Ireland.  At least three regional plans will be developed, specifically based on the locations of Ireland&rsquo;s regional assemblies, which have an existing range of powers in regard to spatial planning and economic development. <\/p> <p> All public bodies that have a role in making policies, plans or programmes relevant to the maritime area, or have a role in regulating activity or development in the maritime area, are statutorily obliged to support and implement the objectives and policies of the NMPF when it is adopted.  This means, in practice, that in assessing and deciding on an application for a lease, license or consent, a public body must ensure consistency with the NMPF&rsquo;s objectives.  It also means that where a public body is introducing a new policy proposal or plan, such as, for example, a sectoral marine action plan, that policy document must also contribute to the achievement of the NMPF&rsquo;s objectives and policies.<\/p> <p> Chapter 2 of the framework sets out how the NMPF will interact with terrestrial forward plans at national, regional and county level.  The chapters on overarching marine planning policies and sectoral marine planning policies contain extensive referencing and signposting on how the NMPF can be implemented, who will implement it and how it interacts with other strategic plans, policies and development management processes.<\/p> <p> I will now outline some of the further implementation initiatives of the NMPF that will be rolled out over the coming months.  The programme for Government committed to the establishment of Project Ireland Marine 2040 and this marine governance group, working under the broader Project Ireland delivery board, will provide leadership and oversight during the implementation of the NMPF.  A central and successful underpinning of Project Ireland 2040 and the national development plan, NDP, has been the alignment of spatial and investment plans and we intend to align the NMPF with the NDP.  Together, the NPF and NMPF will form the statutorily based spatial planning framework.  The NDP is the key investment plan, covering all sectors, irrespective of whether the investment is on land or sea.<\/p> <p> As part of the roll out of the NMPF, my Department proposes to examine options for maximising stakeholder engagement and buy-in to the concept of marine planning at a local level through coastal partnership arrangements.  This will serve as an important part of the implementation and monitoring arrangements for the first cycle of marine planning from 2021 onwards and a learning opportunity for future cycles of marine planning and the extent to which specific forward marine planning functions should be devolved to regional, local or national level.  Coastal partnerships will bring together an area's coastal community to address issues of concern, share best practice and resources and facilitate communication, and I expect that the selected pilot partnerships for coastal areas will be rolled out by my Department over the next 12 months. <\/p> <p> I thank all Members for taking the time to make their contributions.  I have heard the issues causing frustration, but I wish to put on the record the robust process this went through over a number of years.  Everyone had an opportunity to engage, including those who did so successfully, with the Department and our expert advisory group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900032#EE00500","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619704500,"counter":195,"content":"<p>Is the motion agreed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900033#FF00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1619704500,"counter":196,"content":"<p>It is not agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900033#FF00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1619704500,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1619704500,"counter":198,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 80(2), the division is postponed until the next weekly division time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900033#FF00500","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021: Second Stage (Resumed)","time":1619704500,"counter":199,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900033#FF00600"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1619704500,"counter":200,"content":"<p>Question again proposed: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1619704500,"counter":201,"content":"<p>Is this Minister of State taking this debate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900033#FF00800","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1619704500,"counter":202,"content":"<p>There is a Minister of State here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900033#FF00900","speaker":"1514"},{"type":"speech","time":1619704500,"counter":203,"content":"<p>You can all chair if you like.

Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release pure oxygen.  Forestry filters and cleans the air we breathe.  Young commercial plantations along with sequestering carbon quickly over their lifetime, will, when harvested, lock carbon away in wood products and when replanted will begin another cycle of carbon storage.  The end use for the timber will offer alternatives to fossil fuels and a possible replacement for cement and steel in the construction industry.  Other countries are already leading the way in replacing steel with cross-laminated timber in high-rise buildings.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has less than 11% forestry cover, which is way below the European average of 35%.  Past Governments have, over 30 years, invested over &euro;3 billion in the industry.  Climate action afforestation targets were set each year, but were never achieved.  That failure was never questioned.  If the current target is 8,000 ha of new woodland each year, why are we planting so little?  Only 3,000 ha were planted in 2019.  Just over 2,000 ha in 2020 and 2021 will be a repeat of that, with only 900 ha planted this year to date.<\/p>  <p>  We have an abundance of land available.  We have a damp climate and the best weather conditions in which to grow trees.  There has always been plenty of interest from landowners in Ireland in planting their land, yet the Department is failing to capitalise on this interest and convert it into planted hectares.  Why is that happening?  It is because we have a licensing system which is simply not fit for purpose and cannot produce enough licences for the sector to operate.  Therefore, the current administrative process is completely compromising Government planting targets and the national interest.<\/p>  <p>  While I welcome the recent initiative of Project Woodland, which is examining the licensing process in its entirety - I believe great work has already commenced through the four working groups - the deliverables are for the future and remain to be seen.  Climate change will not wait while delays in processing afforestation licences are sorted out.  Time will not allow it.  Failure by the Department to achieve afforestation targets in recent years already makes for very grim reading on what carbon we have failed to capture due to reduced afforestation.  Indeed, my party colleague, Deputy Brendan Howlin, last week requested this information in a parliamentary question and received a reply from the Department, stating that over the last five years there has been a shortfall in meeting targets of 15,365 ha.  Was this area to be afforested with 70% conifer and 30% broadleaf, these forests would have the potential to remove 5.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide over their lifetime, taking into account the fact forests are felled and replanted.<\/p> <p> If we are to take climate action seriously the long-running saga within the Department must be addressed without delay.  There is a need to bind afforestation targets into this legislation.  That is something Labour will examine on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900033#FF01500","speaker":"1514","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619705100,"counter":210,"content":"<p>The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill is important and ground-breaking legislation and a significant achievement for the Green Party in government.  It will set the framework and the parameters within which our economy and our society will develop from this year on but we must accept what we mean by setting these targets and the implications they have for all of us and for every sector of our economy and our society.<\/p>  <p>  It will be possible for some to applaud the objective but to deny the means or pretend that we can achieve these legally binding targets without enormous effort and commitment and changing the way we do things.  By way of example, I had the experience of dealing with the economic disaster after the last Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government.  We came into Government in 2011 with a commitment to reduce the national deficit to 3% of GDP.  That objective was accepted by all.  The declaration that we would have to achieve a balanced budget was the easy bit.  The achieving of the objective was considerably more difficult.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill provides for binding targets to achieve a \"national climate objective\" and, no later than 2050, the transition to a climate resilient, biodiversity rich, environmentally sustainable and climate neutral economy.  Those are lofty words that will require a great deal of effort to fulfil and we can only succeed if we build public support.  We can only have that support if we ensure that we mitigate any harm done to individuals and their standard of living by the actions we have to take.  We have to ensure that no group is disproportionately harmed.  We have to be clear in the just transition and if I have a complaint about the Bill it is that it does not front-load the issue of a just transition enough.  No one can be left behind.  Nobody can be allowed to endure fuel poverty, loss of employment or disadvantage.  That will require very significant resources.  If whoever is in government loses the buy-in of the public it will be impossible to achieve the true transformation that is both possible and essential.  There will be any number of groups and individuals who will resist the changes necessary.  Many will be well-intentioned and truly concerned; others not so.  I welcome and support this destination which, hopefully, will soon be legally underpinned.  Sustaining the journey to its achievement will be a monumental challenge for all of us.<\/p>  <p>  Now that the destination in terms of emission targets will be set in law let us see the specifics from the Government.  In terms of energy, I will touch on offshore wind because it was talked about in the last debate.  We need to fulfil the capacity of the east coast which largely will have fixed turbines in place, with the west coast probably having them later when the technology of floating turbines arrives.  In my judgment, and I am biased on this, we should designate Rosslare Europort as the port of service and assembly for the turbines on the east coast.  If we do not do that those turbines will be serviced but it may well be from Wales, England or Northern Ireland.  Let us acquire the land and get going on these issues, and let us do it now.  Let us ensure the interconnectors are built to export surplus energy when we have it and to import and supplement our green energy requirement when we do not.<\/p>  <p>  In transport, the Minister should lay out the plans for achieving the end to petrol and diesel vehicles.  He should set out the specifics and the supports we will have rather than saying we will have 1 million electric vehicles.  Where will the charging points be located?  When will construction on them start?  What supports will the Minister give to individuals many of whom in rural Ireland have no option but to have a car because there is no public transport and there will never be public transport?  How are they to be supported in this transition?  Where are the transport plans for the urban areas?  How quickly can they be put in place?  It is time now for the specifics.<\/p>  <p>  In housing, where is the realistic plan and the money behind it to retrofit all our housing stock, public and private?  Nearly zero energy building, NZEB, housing is under construction.  There will be a new national NZEB centre of excellence in Enniscorthy, which will be a UN centre and, it is hoped, will give a lead and enthusiasm to ensure that we make this transition.  However, that will be an extraordinarily jobs rich but expensive undertaking.  We have not really begun that but we are going to tinker with it.<\/p>  <p>  In agriculture, the Minister must be honest and set out the changes that will be required and the real supports that will be put in place to bring about that achievement in a painless and supported way by our public.<\/p>  <p>  In essence, what we have now is a destination.  It is a set of legally binding targets.  We have to fill in that framework now because just as with fixing the economy, the declaration of the goal is one thing; the specifics and how they will impact on our people are quite another.  Now that this Bill is here and will have broad support in this House and outside it, despite some negative comments, all of us, including the people who want him to succeed on this journey, need the detailed actions, timelines and resources that will underpin that achievement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900034#GG00200","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1619705100,"counter":211,"content":"<p>Climate change, as the Minister well knows, is the single biggest challenge facing humanity today.  It is a problem of such an order of magnitude that it can be difficult for us to get our heads around it.  The forests of the world are literally on fire.  Twenty-four months ago the Amazon was on fire, 16 months ago Australia was on fire and this week the national parks in Kerry, the hills of Wicklow and the mountains of Mourne are on fire.  Increasingly, we are looking at weather and temperature events which exceed some of the most pessimistic predictions of the international models.  When we take into account the global dimming effect of particles in the air caused by burning fossil fuels and the extra warming that may take place as we replace fossil fuels the need for urgency and the scale of the consequences may be even greater than any of us care to admit.  This is an existential challenge for society.  In that context, all of us will be judged by our actions - by what we have done and what we have failed to do.<\/p><p>By nature, I am an optimist.  I look to the future.  I believe that we can find a way to solve this problem but the first step is to admit that the entire current fossil fuel based economic model is broken and that we have to replace it.  We need to admit that we will only replace it by regulation.  We cannot just close our eyes and hope that it goes away.  We cannot pretend that it is other people's problem to solve or that the free market will magically produce a solution like a rabbit from a hat.<\/p><p>In Ireland, we have some of the highest <i>per capita<\/i>emissions in the world.

We need a just transition to a carbon neutral future.  We need that transition to bring people with us and to treat people fairly.  This Bill is a step towards that process.  It builds upon Deputy Alan Kelly's work in government in producing the first climate action Bill, the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill, in 2015.  I am glad to see the Green Party has retained the framework of the Labour Bill.<\/p><p>As spokesperson for enterprise, trade and employment I can see the vast potential for employment in a carbon neutral economy but we need to ensure that the transition is an orderly and managed one that creates benefits and opportunities for people across Ireland.<\/p> <p>We want a just transition that gives people the skills and education they need.  We need to strengthen local democracy and examine new and old structures, such as town councils and co-operatives, to build organisations that will share costs and benefits more fairly in our communities.  We need the State to invest, subsidise and regulate to make sure those who can least afford to pay are subsidised the most.  We need to invest in active travel, walking, cycling and public transport infrastructure in towns and villages that are designed for people and not primarily for cars.  We need to invest in large-scale public transport and we need considerable State investment in housing, transport and industry to deliver carbon-neutral economy and infrastructure.<\/p> <p> Our greatest challenges lie in agriculture and construction.  We need to put the needs of our people at the heart of how we face these challenges.  We will need to change, but that change need not be at the expense of the ordinary person if we put his or her need for decent living at the heart of what we do.  There is a nettle here to be grasped, and pretending we can stay the same will leave our farmers behind and ultimately prevent us from meeting the challenges of climate change and the collapse in biodiversity we have seen over the past 50 years.<\/p> <p> This Bill is about the economy and regulating it and with any attempt to regulate an economy, there will be some big business interests that will seek to delay, obstruct or damage anything that will force them to change.  These forces need to be resisted.  The common good is too important for us to cave in to the demands of those who do not want to change.  We need to support those who are working towards a carbon-neutral economy based on decent, well-paid jobs and a good standard of living.  We cannot allow those who are working to change for the better to be undercut and undermined by those who seek to earn a fast buck by cutting corners and exploiting natural and human resources without regard for environmental justice both here and abroad.<\/p> <p> Human rights and workers' rights are inextricably linked to climate change.  The climate emergency threatens the social fabric of every country on earth, and Ireland is no exception.  I have hope for the future and believe that, with good regulation and strong public and community engagement, we can get our economy to change.<\/p> <p> There are valid criticisms of this Bill.  There are justifiable questions as to whether it goes far enough.  Are the links between the carbon budget and the fiscal expenditure budgets too weak?  Are the exact mechanisms too technocratic?  Most of all, how can we make sure the Bill does not lose sight of the needs of the most vulnerable, rural and urban, and make sure the transition is, indeed, just?  With these questions in mind, we will seek to submit amendments to improve the Bill.  Ultimately, however, as my colleagues Deputies Howlin and Sherlock have said, we support and welcome this Bill because it is a step we need to take.  We cannot afford to delay any longer.  The Green Party deserves credit for putting it at the heart of its Government programme, and it would be cheap politics just to attack that party over the Bill's imperfections.  I ask the Minister of State and everyone in this House to take this opportunity to listen to one another, honestly debate, examine and accept amendments, and work to produce a climate Bill we can be proud of.  We have a duty to the Irish people, and to people everywhere, to deliver a carbon-neutral future with people at the heart of it and to bring positive change to people's lives as we go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900034#GG00300","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619705700,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I do not know where to start as this is such a wide area to discuss, but it is exceptionally important.  It is definitely the issue of our time.  The next ten years will be the deciding factor in how the entire planet, including Ireland, will decide what its future will look like for its people.  As the youngest member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and one of the youngest parliamentarians in the world, I am extremely worried about the rate of progress.<\/p>  <p>  There are many areas I could refer to but I might as well give the background to my pathway in life.  I grew up on a family farm in east Cork.  Dairy farming is a hugely important part of my constituency's economy.  Both of my parents are working in the dairy industry, my mother as an employee of Dairygold, like thousands of others in Cork East and throughout Munster, and my father as a dairy farmer.  I have seen the importance of dairy to the economy but it has to be said there is a lot of worry and uncertainty in the Irish agrifood industry, particularly in the dairy sector.  I single out the dairy sector because it is often landed with the accusations about emissions.<\/p>  <p>  I grew up in a country in which there was so much focus on medium-sized farmers.  They were told to buy land, build sheds, build new parlours and spend hundreds of thousands of euro to expand their operations.  Many of them did so on the advice of the Government.  I remember being at one of the phenomenally well organised open days in Moorepark, Fermoy, where I heard milk described as \"liquid gold\" in one of the ministerial contributions.  Now we are facing a situation in which tens of thousands of people are working on farms that are under enormous pressure.  There is a lack of workers, which has put a great strain on farmers right around the country.  There is great uncertainty after spending all the money on the advice of the previous two Governments, only now to be facing the impact of reducing the national herd, which we are now discussing.  I am very conscious of that.  I am conscious of it from two perspectives, one based on my background and the other based on my being a young person trying to protect our environment.<\/p>  <p>  I have a very logical suggestion for the Government that I hope it can work on over the coming months and, indeed, over its term in office, which I hope will last the full duration.  We have to make sure that medium-sized dairy farmers in Ireland are supported to retain the number of cows they have.  It does not make any sense to tell them to expand if we are talking about reducing the size of the national herd.  The reality is that for many at grassroots level in agriculture, it has been a case of continual expansion since the milk quotas were abolished.  This is not specific to my constituency.  Deputy Sherlock, who was here a moment ago, is also from Cork East and will be aware that in the north of that constituency and well into counties Tipperary and Clare, one really gets an insight, from a climate-action perspective, into how important the dairy sector is on the ground.  This is the case throughout the south, where there is a lot of grassland.<\/p>  <p>  We have to do more to expand in the area of environmental protection and must incentivise farmers to engage in climate-friendly activity.  If I were asked whether I believe we are doing enough, my honest answer would be that we are not because, for a lot of farmers, every single square inch of land available, be it owned or rented, goes towards grassland.  The farmers are not interested in trying to encourage the establishment of habitats because it just does not make financial sense.  We need to make it financially sensible.  That needs to be done not only in Ireland but also throughout Europe.  What many European countries have done is phenomenal, including in Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark.  I could go on and on about how such countries encourage farmers to engage in serious climate-friendly activity.<\/p>  <p>  Having one's own power-generation capacity is an exciting area on which I am watching the Government make progress.  The same applies to microgeneration using small wind turbines, perhaps located on agricultural land.  This allows farmers to supply their neighbours with electricity and sell electricity back to the grid, including to local schools.  Some schools were considering this as an option but for many years in Ireland we held people back who wished to sell power back to the grid.  I acknowledge the presence of the Green Party, whose members are in government.  They are very passionate about pursuing the policy on microgeneration.  It is good and I acknowledge it.  It will be very positive.<\/p>  <p>  I am the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on transport.  In Cork, we have a dirty problem, namely, the number of people in the county, city and metropolitan area commuting to their places of work in private cars.  This is because the public transport system is simply not up to scratch.  It is critical, through legislation we are bringing to the D&aacute;il, including the Bill we are discussing, that we try to push on the existing metropolitan strategies on transport and improve public transport in our cities and metropolitan areas.<\/p>  <p> Let me put the issue into perspective.  The Jack Lynch tunnel and Dunkettle interchange in Cork comprise one of the busiest junctions in the country.  Cork is many times smaller than Dublin, yet the number of vehicles that use the junction is only a few thousand smaller than the number that use the Red Cow junction in Dublin.  Comparing Newlands Cross to Dunkettle puts the matter into perspective.  It just shows the root of the problem; it is terrible.  I have been working on this for ages, even before I entered politics.<\/p> <p>The issue that first brought me to Leinster House was to lobby to improve public transport when I was a transition year student.  It was a very exciting day.  We met the Taoiseach at the time, Enda Kenny, and the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, when he was Minister with responsibility for transport.  That very day he was appointed to the Department of Health because it was the day of the Cabinet reshuffle.  We were the only ones allowed near Enda Kenny that day.<\/p> <p> I have been pushing this for such a long time but the bureaucracy involved in public transport in Ireland is a disgrace.  What bothers me about it is that very talented people work in the Departments and at Irish Rail, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Local Link - I could go on but I will not - and they want to fix this issue.  Leadership in Ireland, however, as we know with the Civil Service, must come from the top down.  I am a bit worried about the focus in the Department of Transport on cycling, walking and that type of infrastructure.  We have to get down to brass tacks in terms of the numbers of people moving.  Public transport, particularly in rural Ireland through our rail and bus corridors, needs to be prioritised and examined.<\/p> <p> It makes no sense to me that Bus &Eacute;ireann is a State-owned company divided in two.  There is the commercial side, which there is no political oversight of or interference in, and there is the State-controlled entity within Bus &Eacute;ireann which is responsible for its public service obligation, PSO, services, yet there is no co-ordination between the two.  To add a third wheel to the mix, the way in which we co-ordinate our student transport services to secondary schools is also very frustrating.  Every year since I have entered politics, and every rural Deputy will probably agree, our ears are chewed off by angry parents, and rightly so.  They have every right to be furious over the lack of bus places for students going to and from school.<\/p> <p> When I was a student at Trinity College Dublin - I travelled from Youghal to Dublin to attend Trinity - I noticed that when public transport services are run, everybody uses them to get to and from their places of work or education, whether they are in primary, second or third level.  We do not do that in rural Ireland.  Dedicated bus services serve many secondary schools in major towns, such as Midleton, Carrigtwohill, Youghal and other towns of more than 5,000 people where there are very good public transport links within close proximity of the schools provided by private bus operators.  It would make a great deal of sense to have a bit of co-operation to expand the school bus services by working with Bus &Eacute;ireann to a greater degree.  Every year, this crops up as a big issue and it will be very important in order to get cars off the road.  There are hundreds of thousands of journeys every day and that is what this is all about.<\/p> <p> We can only do what we can.  Ireland is a small nation and I fully agree that we have a responsibility to do something about climate change.  I object to some of the language I have heard from certain Deputies in recent times about the impact that Ireland has because ours is a small nation and what we do does not matter.  That is not true.  The world looks at Ireland as an example of how to get things done properly.  We are, after all, according to the human development index, in the top four countries in the world in which to live.  Ireland is a world leader, regardless whether other Deputies agree or disagree, and we have an opportunity to go and do something with the issue.  School transport is a key area and we could take action in respect of it in order to significantly reduce the number of car journeys people take.<\/p> <p> On the speed of development of rail projects, three huge towns in my constituency are still awaiting news on the Cork metropolitan transport area strategy.  I spoke recently in a one-to-one meeting with the CEO of the National Transport Authority, NTA, Anne Graham, and I am very appreciative to her.  The NTA is working very hard but we have not received timelines.  We need timelines to push on with the expansion of rail services in Cork.  The plan in the Cork metropolitan transport area strategy for people living in Mallow, Cobh, Carrigtwohill and Midleton is to triple rail capacity in the county and the constituency I am very happy to represent.  In addition, there are wonderful plans for park-and-ride facilities but we have no timelines for them either.  The Minister of State might convey to the Minister and their colleagues who work in climate action that we have to start setting the process in motion.  There have been too many plans in Ireland for different initiatives and they never develop into anything.  I am very worried about the development of the metropolitan transport area strategies and ensuring they happen.<\/p> <p> The issue of rail freight is going to be very important.  I would very much appreciate it if the Government could do more to take lorries off the road, particularly at night.  There is no reason we cannot use rail freight in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900035#HH00200","speaker":"1516","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619706300,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill and applaud the ambition behind it.  If the past year has taught us anything, it is that governments can take extraordinary action to tackle extraordinary issues.  The Bill will, I hope, be a significant step towards tackling the climate crisis.  It is, without doubt, the most ambitious climate action legislation this country has produced.  Its provisions are nationally significant for Ireland's climate policy but they are also internationally significant because they clearly set Ireland's intention to become a global leader in tackling the climate emergency, an ambition I wholeheartedly welcome.<\/p>  <p>  The legal targets contained in the Bill are a positive step.  I refer to the 51% reduction in emissions in the next decade and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.  These are ambitious goals but they should not be the limit to our ambition.  If we can reach these targets before the legal deadline, we should of course do that.  The most important thing is that we set these targets and that they are met because we cannot afford to miss targets this late in the game.<\/p>  <p>  We are no longer living through a time of climate change, we are in a climate emergency.  We owe it to our younger generations, who have been so vocal about their feelings on the issue, to get this legislation right.  Before the pandemic, I was so proud to see young people taking to the streets, using their voices and collective power to call for action on climate change.  The youngest members of our society are not just engaged but also enraged by the crimes being committed against our natural world.  Last week, many young people celebrated Earth Day.  My nephews, Cian and Blaine, planted trees and took a virtual tour through the Amazon rainforest.  In Cian's words, they planted trees because they wanted to bring more nature into this world.  The Bill can be our message to kids such as Cian and Blaine, and to the generations who will come after them, that their voices will be heard loud and clear by the Government.  What a legacy that would be.  Protecting the world we live in needs to be a top priority for everyone, everywhere.  It is as simple as that.<\/p>  <p>  I was concerned to read recently that leading climate experts from Irish universities have voiced their opposition to what they are concerned may be fundamental flaws in the Bill.  They view the emissions targets and the proposed management of greenhouse gas reductions as ambiguous and are worried that could leave us open to legal challenges.  I understand that their recommendations have been sent to the Minister as well as the climate action committee and the Climate Change Advisory Council, and I ask that they be taken into consideration.<\/p>  <p>  In order to ensure that targets are no longer missed, we need some clarification on how the limitation of liability will work.  After all, targets are only as strong as the actions behind them.  Within the Bill, there are no fines for not meeting targets or for Ministers exceeding their carbon budgets, but Departments could instead face budget cuts.  I am concerned that any budget penalties could inadvertently hurt essential Government-run programmes and schemes that are so badly needed by the people.  The Bill has been widely welcomed by society, but concerns must be listened to as we move to the next phase.  The inclusion of local authorities in the plan is really welcome.  We need every level of our society and of the Government working towards addressing this problem, and we need to listen to every group.<\/p>  <p>  Let us remember why the Bill is so necessary.  For the past year we have been living through a pandemic.<\/p> <p>Every aspect of life has been impacted.  If allowed to run away from us, this climate crisis will have an even greater and more detrimental impact on us all.  Dr. Mike Ryan of the World Health Organization has clearly stated that we are pushing nature to its limits.  By doing so, we are creating the conditions for new epidemics to grow and thrive.  We need to face up to the climate crisis and we need to find a way to limit the real damage already being done.  Protecting the world in which we live needs to be a top priority for everyone everywhere.  This Bill is a welcome and significant step in tackling that crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900036#JJ00200","speaker":"1566","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619706900,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for her consideration.  The entire world is aware of the need to enact change to prevent global warming.  The human, environmental and economic costs of global warming are becoming increasingly clear each year.  Every year, we witness the global results of, and the damage caused by, climate change.  Major flooding, hurricanes, droughts and wildfires are not fears for the future but the realities of the present.  Climate action is critical.  We must stop the inexorable rise in global temperatures.  We owe it to this generation and to those who will come after to protect our planet.  In doing so, we must also remain conscious that a one-size-fits-all approach to climate action cannot be taken across the globe.  Put simply, what can be achieved with relative ease by one country may have the potential to cause significant change and upheaval in another.  It falls on every country to address the growing problem but it falls on the government of each country to introduce change in a fair and equitable manner. Ultimately, it falls to each of us to play our part.<\/p>  <p>  When talks on the urgent need to take climate action were headline news during talks on the formation of this Government, a number of fingers were pointed towards the agricultural sector.  We were led to believe reducing our national herd would be a quick-fix solution in reducing Ireland's emissions profile.  Very few acknowledged the enormous volume of CO2 that Irish grasslands and farms actually remove from the atmosphere.  Even fewer highlighted the fact that Ireland's agrifood industry remains a global leader in sustainability.  Ireland is the most carbon-efficient country in which to produce dairy products.  Limiting milk production here will shift production to less sustainable and less regulated markets.  The Irish sector continues to break new ground every year due to cutting-edge research on carbon-neutral beef and dairy farming.  The Irish dairy industry should not be damned for pursuing a livelihood from livestock.  Farmers should not be scapegoated.<\/p>  <p>  While many challenges remain for the agricultural sector in the quest to positively address climate issues, it is vital that we recognise the enormous change taking place.  Ireland's agrifood sector is transforming.  With financial and educational support, this sector will not be a major stumbling block with regard to Ireland's contribution to proactive climate action.<\/p>  <p>  Rather than pointing the finger at agriculture and industry, as many have chosen to do, the key to taking positive climate action lies within our own daily lives.  Every one of us can play a part and, in many cases, this can involve saving money as well as our planet.  Homes, businesses, farms, industry and educational centres all have a role to play.  Small daily changes to the way we live will accumulate and have a major impact.  Turning down the heating, reducing water and food waste, switching off lights, not leaving appliances plugged in and using public transport instead of driving are all little things that can help.  If we had the collective will to change little things, the impact would be enormous.  In fact, it would have a similar effect to culling the national herd.<\/p>  <p>  When we speak of taking climate action, our thoughts revolve around major changes that will most certainly come our way in the future.  We seldom concentrate on the simple things we can do to help today.  By doing things differently, we can all be part of the solution.  This analogy also applies to Government.  The aim must be to bring people willingly on board rather than to bombard them with dramatic scenarios as happened in respect of the farming sector.  There is no for and against saving our planet.  It is a universal objective.  Each one of us has a shared responsibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900037#KK00200","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speech","time":1619706900,"counter":218,"content":"<p>In case there is any misunderstanding, the Regional Group's slot will come up in due course.

If we had been warned five or ten years ago that Covid-19 was on the way, what would we have done?  We would have made the drastic changes necessary to avoid the turmoil and suffering of the past year.  It is not an exaggeration to say we are in a similar place today.  We know the science.  We know climate change is happening.  We know that, without proper action, it will have devastating impacts on society and the economy.  We know.<\/p><p>This could be the most significant legislation this D&aacute;il will pass.  It has the potential to establish a clear and fair framework to make the changes necessary to protect our society and economy.  Equally, it could contain fudges that will damn future generations to severe consequences.  Addressing the Joint Committee on Climate Action in October, Dr. &Aacute;ine Ryall, co-director of UCC&rsquo;s centre for law and the environment, said:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe must deliver robust, workable climate legislation that supports a just transition and protects human rights.  We must ensure that the new legislation has the necessary impact across society and the economy to deliver the transformative changes required within the necessary timeframes. <\/blockquote>  <p>She outlined clear principles that have to be present in the legislation and climate action plans.  They must be robust and workable, there must be a just transition and transformative changes must take place within the necessary timeframe.<\/p><p>Climate legislation must be robust and workable.  Our plan to curb our emissions and reach our international obligations needs to be clear, achievable and guided by climate science.  The much-lauded target of 2050 to reach net zero-carbon emissions is too late.  We need to significantly reduce our emissions before then if we are to do our part to halt a significant and irreversible temperature rise.  What is the actual plan to achieve this?  Our current approach is failing badly.  The Government&rsquo;s 2019 transition statement states that our target for 2020 was to reduce emissions to 20% below their 2005 value.  Instead, it was in the range of 5% to 6%.  Successive Governments have been kicking the can down the road and passing the buck to the next Minister.  We are operating on borrowed time, time which we are taking from future generations.<\/p><p>Last year, the Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling in the climate case found that the Government failed to specify credible measures for addressing climate change.  Part of the finding is the need for each climate action plan to have clear targets.  The public is entitled to know how the current Government, not the next Government or the one after, will actually implement emissions reductions and other measures within its lifespan.<\/p><p>Climate law experts have expressed concern about the target for 2030, which is included in the proposed new section 6A(5) to the principal Act, as lacking in legal certainty.  There needs to be legal minimum interim targets that establish the basis for an average reduction in emissions of 7%.  Otherwise, the reductions will just be rolled over from year to year, with responsibility passed from this Government to the next.  If this Bill is to be all it claims to be, then any such ambiguities need to be removed.  This legislation has to have robust and workable commitments that demand plans which will meet annual targets in a transparent and accountable manner. <\/p><p>The climate legislation must be just.  A just transition must be at the heart of climate legislation.  We need an approach of leaving no one behind.  I welcome the inclusion of references to just transition in the Bill but the definition of climate justice is much too loose and the policies proposed and opposed by this Government thus far do not indicate a willingness to pursue this Bill or any kind of progressive change.<\/p><p>I echo the calls of Community Law and Mediation, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice in Ireland to include more robust definitions for climate justice that would ensure just transition, such as appear in Scotland&rsquo;s climate change legislation.  We cannot allow the burden of climate action to fall on the shoulders of those least responsible for the crisis.  Climate action needs to be based in workers' rights, healthcare, housing and transport.<\/p> <p>We also have to live up to our responsibilities to the people of the global south who are already enduring some of the most extreme climatic changes.  Obviously, the part we can play is not as big as much larger countries, but it is not any less significant.  All countries and communities are being called on to do their bit to avert the climate crisis.  The Irish people know this and want this.  We must deliver legislation that matches their commitment to a just transition and climate justice.<br\/><br\/>We need sustainability and equality to go hand in hand.  Social and environmental policies are not contradictory - they can and should be complementary.  We need progressive and ambitious measures to support low-income households and rural areas.  Most importantly, we need joined-up thinking.  A carbon tax is a necessary tool to reduce emissions, but it will only work if there are alternatives in place.  Poor public transport in rural areas and a lack of active travel infrastructure means people have no choice but to use cars.  It does not matter how expensive petrol or diesel is - they will still need cars.  Without alternatives, carbon taxes are merely punitive and help build up resentment and anti-climate science rhetoric.  A just transition recognises the supports needed for families and communities, but it also holds polluters to account.  The majority of global emissions come from large corporations, especially fossil fuel companies.  We need a tax regime that targets them rather than ordinary people.<br\/><br\/>Climate legislation must make transformative changes in the necessary time.  Climate action requires systematic change - change in behaviour, change in the way we do business, change in the way the economy works.  We have a choice to be proactive and lead the way in a green economy or stick to a business-as-usual model involving some greenwashing, which will inevitably lead to irreparable damage and job losses.<br\/><br\/>Climate action has to be understood and pursued as a necessity and an opportunity.  Too often, Deputies and even Ministers present this as a cliff edge for farmers and fishing communities.  As a farmer and a scientist, that is disappointing.  Farmers and fishing communities need to be treated with respect, not fed such platitudes.  The way we farm is shaped directly by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's policies.  Deputies tirelessly defending farmers when it is not the latter's fault only serves to reinforce the false narrative that it is somehow farmers' fault, a narrative that supports a policy that does not support the majority of farmers.  We need climate science-informed approaches that support all farms, not just the big players, and value practices that enhance the landscape and generate sustainable produce.  The same is true of fishing.  Many small-scale fishermen and fisherwomen can feel as though the Government is working against them rather than fighting for them.  Inshore fishing represents the type of sustainable fishing that has been practised for generations in west Cork and other coastal and island communities.  We need transformational change and plans that outline how we can guarantee that there is a viable future for small farms and fishing communities in Ireland, especially family farms and small family fishing communities.<br\/><br\/>Regrettably, the Environmental Pillar's recent withdrawal from the 2030 agrifood strategy committee reveals that the Government remains committed to a business-as-usual approach.  The pillar highlighted that vested interests were prioritised from the establishment of the committee rather than the development of agricultural policy that could cut pollution and emissions while ensuring a just transition for farmers.  The palpable frustration at the recently announced results-based environment-agri pilot project, REAP, is another example of the Government blatantly failing to provide the necessary change in the sector.  Constantly clinging to increased efficiencies as a response was never good enough and, at a crucial point like this when we need timely transformative change, is disgraceful.<br\/><br\/>Most people agree that the Green Party has good intentions, and I commend it on introducing this Bill, but what we need to know is how, if at all, those intentions will be realised.  Where exactly will emissions be reduced?  When and how will that happen?  Crucially, how will it happen in a fair and just way?<br\/><br\/>We are living with the effects of climate change.  Ireland is 0.5<sup>o<\/sup>C warmer than it was in the period 1960 to 1990, it is wetter and we are seeing more extreme weather events, which are having significant social and economic costs.  We have experienced the stormiest winter in over a century and one of the wettest winters since records began.  We are experiencing extreme weather events like flooding time and again in west Cork.Farmers and fishermen can see the impacts of a changing climate.  Young people have been taking to the streets demanding substantial and meaningful action.  Climate scientists and legal experts have provided the frameworks and targets we need to work towards.<br\/><br\/>This legislation needs clearer commitments and more robust definitions of &quot;just transition&quot; and &quot;climate justice&quot; and must explicitly address issues around liquefied natural gas, LNG, fracked gas and the biodiversity crisis.<br\/><br\/>Dr. Andrew Jackson, assistant professor in environmental law at UCD, told the Joint Committee on Climate Action:<\/p><blockquote>\tIn conclusion, to stand a chance of limiting heating to 1.5&deg;C, our emissions need to fall very deeply and very rapidly, starting immediately.

People coming together and speaking with a coherent voice and in large numbers telling the powers that be that something is not good enough are a powerful force.  They have got us to this point where we can progress the process of ensuring that climate action, for which they campaigned, becomes law.  I met some of the organisations recently.  It is a reassurance to me, the future of the planet and my children's future that they will keep pressing for faster and fairer action and implementation of current and future climate action plans.  They will be there if Departments do not meet their commitments and they will help to ensure accountability for the future of the planet and the future of our children.<\/p><p>It is my honour, as Minister of State with responsibility for community development and charities, to acknowledge the role of the climate movement and the various organisations that comprise it and thank them for their determination and persistence.  The movement and the people in it are the last people who need to hear that the Bill is only a first step and the majority of the work is still ahead of us, but the Bill is an important first step.  I thank the movement for pressing for more.  Please continue to do so for all our sake and the planet's.<\/p><p>As the Minister of State with responsibility for community development and charities, I have responsibility for the five-year strategy to support the community and voluntary sector.  The strategy, Sustainable, Inclusive and Empowered Communities,  contains 11 core objectives, one of which is to support community development and local development in engaging with climate change, adaptation and mitigation strategies.  More specifically, it commits to:<\/p> <blockquote> \t- provide training and capacity building in relation to Climate Change to community development and local development organisations,<br \/><br \/>- pilot and develop models of good practice on Climate Change adaptation and mitigation at community level, and<br \/><br \/>- include a focus on Climate Change in all community development and local development programmes and initiatives. <\/blockquote>  <p>Under the strategy, priority commitments for 2021 are the training needs of the sector.  We commenced a needs analysis process recently, starting with local community development committees, LCDCs.  LCDCs are key in terms of climate action.  They are the mechanism that links local reality with national policy.<\/p><p>I received support for our public participation networks, PPNs, nationally.  They are a major asset in terms of building a ground-up, grassroots force to help enact climate action in a fair way that ensures those who are marginalised are not left behind.  There are 16,000 PPN member organisations across the country working in the areas of social inclusion, the community and voluntary sector and the environment.  PPNs allow member organisations to connect with one another and their local authorities, but they also ensure that normal people have a greater say in local decisions that affect their communities.  This is key to climate action.  PPNs are already contributing to climate policy by taking part in focus group consultations on the Climate Action Plan, which commenced last month.  These consultations were held in the local authority areas of Offaly, Meath, Monaghan, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, Galway, Clare, Wicklow, Donegal, Carlow, Kilkenny, Fingal, Limerick, Kildare, Sligo and Kerry.  Through these focus groups, volunteers are bringing a local perspective into the national conversation, a perspective that will help us as a nation to address climate change and its impact on our daily lives.<\/p><p>A review of how to improve the operation of PPNs will begin soon.<\/p> <p>The capacity of PPNs to be involved in climate action will form a part of that review.  The climate action Bill requires local authorities to develop climate action plans for their local areas every five years.  These local action plans will bring climate action right into the heart of local communities and the climate action Bill ensures that community members will have a strong voice in those plans.  The Bill makes it a requirement, in law, for local authorities to consult their local PPN in forming their local action plan.  This is in recognition of the importance of community groups in the challenge that lies ahead and the importance of bringing everyone on board.<\/p> <p> I also have responsibilities in the Department of Social Protection, which recently held its annual social inclusion forum where community and voluntary groups from around the country spoke about the realities of exclusion and poverty.  The forum was focused on the implementation of the roadmap for social inclusion which I oversee.  The roadmap is up for review next year and I will ensure that concerns about ensuring a just transition are reflected in that review, as they are in the Department's new overall strategy.<\/p> <p> In line with Government policy, one of the high-level goals in the new statement of strategy of the Department of Social Protection published last month is to target changes to key social welfare payments to ensure that increases to carbon tax have a progressive impact on the most vulnerable, those contributing to a just transition.<\/p> <p> Climate action can lead to warmer homes, cheaper and healthier ways of travelling and ways of using land to produce food without damaging the planet.  Locally generated and owned energy has significant potential to bring communities together and tackle disadvantage.  Climate action can be an opportunity and an organising force to improve the situation of those marginalised and to develop a more socially just Ireland.  I launched the pilot bike repair and upcycling scheme with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, yesterday.  This is one small example of how this might be done.<\/p> <p> I oversee the State's main social inclusion intervention, the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP.  SICAP is implemented by local development companies across the country and provides tailored one-to-one assistance to people on the margins and the groups that work with them.  The current iteration of SICAP runs from 2018 to 2022.  When we start discussions and consultations on the shape of the new SICAP, the principles of just transition and climate justice will form part of how we frame social inclusion into the future and the next SICAP.  Local development companies across the country are already recognising and naming this.<\/p> <p> I opened with an acknowledgement of the role the community and voluntary sector has played in getting us to this point today.  This role must continue and must be augmented.  The Government should support citizens to engage and take action.  We will be supporting the community and voluntary sector to engage in climate action at a local level.<\/p> <p> I have a short comment on the just transition project in the midlands.  My party does not agree with the assertion made in this House that the just transition jobs will not materialise as stated by another Member.  The Government agreed last year to allocate &euro;108 million to protect over 300 jobs and the fund was mobilised shortly afterwards.  The Department is working closely with projects to ensure the money flows at scale.  Covid has slowed down many of the projects.  However, grant agreements have already issued to strand 2 projects and the remainder will be finalised very shortly.  The Minister has assured me that he expects a substantial number of the projects will be operational this summer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900038#LL00200","speaker":"1563","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619708100,"counter":223,"content":"<p>Today we begin the journey to net zero and we legislate for the ambition of decades of work by environmentalists, climate activists, scientists, NGOs and more recently the voters across our communities who have demanded action to stop our climate chaos and biodiversity loss.  We do this for the young people across this country and across the world who went on strike and marched and raised the bar and demanded action now, action that should have started 20 years ago.  Many do not yet have a vote, but they certainly have a voice in this House and in today's climate Bill.  We are acting for the future generations.<\/p>  <p>  I want my children to grow up in a country that leads on climate action and finally casts off the mantle of being laggards in the battle to save our planet.  I thank all those young people, the activists, the environmental groups, the individuals who want a better future and understand the action that is required.  The voters of Wicklow put me here and put me in a position to create laws that will set us on the right path and keep us on that path.  I ask them to continue to demand action from every party in this House for faster, bigger and better action on climate.<\/p>  <p>  There is no room for complacency in the battle ahead of us and I do not underestimate that challenge.  We all have a role to play.  The journey we started today is for the benefit and protection of everyone.  It is for our precious life-sustaining environment and biodiversity.  It is for our future economic gains.  It is for job creation, better health outcomes and secure comfortable affordable quality housing.  It is for energy efficiency and better ways to live, to work and to travel.  It is for all of us together in a fair and equitable manner across every part of our island.  It is for our shared future.<\/p>  <p>  It will be challenging, but the opportunities are enormous.  Over the next decade the steps we take to reduce climate-changing gases will improve our health, economy and communities.  Climate action will create thousands of jobs across all sectors.  Jobs will be created in the maritime environment as we embark on harnessing wind energy to supply our electricity and energy needs.  The marine protections we put in place as part of that development will protect our seas, provide a sustainable fishing sector and ensure healthy oceans, which are crucial for carbon sequestration.<\/p>  <p>  Our coastal communities will see direct social and economic benefits from offshore renewable energy.  We are already seeing that in Arklow and more will follow in town such as Wicklow and in the larger-scale ports, such as Moneypoint and Rosslare.<\/p>  <p>  The ambition we have on the targets we have set for offshore wind energy will reduce our reliance on imported fossil fuels, lowering our emissions and providing energy resilience.  It will provide us the opportunity to electrify transport and home heating.  It gives us cleaner air, more comfortable homes, a better quality of life and enormous financial savings in energy efficiency.  That is climate action.<\/p>  <p>  Long-term, sustainable, clean and well-paid employment will be created as we make our housing stock energy efficient, warmer and healthier.  I welcome the recent launch and promotion of apprenticeships and opportunities for mature apprenticeships and upskilling.  As we transition to cleaner industry and take the necessary actions to wind down the high carbon-emitting processes, we will ensure that those workers are not left behind.  We will have a significant future requirement for skilled workers across new technologies and continued improvements to construction trade skills.  Our new and retrofitted houses will have solar technology, heat pumps, high levels of insulation, smart metering and energy-saving heating and lighting controls.  This means thousands of jobs now and into the future.<\/p>  <p>  Across the SME sector, which is vital for employment throughout Ireland, we will support investment to improve energy efficiencies in offices and commercial buildings.  Improved operations, resource management and manufacturing processes to reduce waste and emissions save money.  These aspects of business may not be at the top of the list for an owner of an SME at the moment as they struggle to re-emerge from the pandemic, but it is important for their future sustainability.  We will support those SMEs.  This creates savings, protects and creates jobs and ensures viability.  That is climate action.<\/p>  <p>  Investment in digitalisation, innovation and our fibre network will assist in decarbonising our economy and bring benefits across society.  The pandemic forced many of us to work remotely from home and has shown that jobs can be located in smaller towns and villages, which have good broadband infrastructure, digital hubs and workspaces.  Throughout the last year we have learned to appreciate what our local towns, villages and green spaces have to offer for our physical and mental well-being.  Rejuvenating smaller towns and putting town centres first creates local jobs, improving the public amenity offering, making our town centres attractive for cycling and walking to school and to shops and for recreation.  It also attracts business and investment.<\/p>  <p>  Proper planning, higher densities, good designs and managed open spaces in our towns will sustain those local businesses.  Good public transport through and to our towns and villages and to urban centres will reduce car dependency and congestion, improve air quality and create safer, quieter and more enjoyable town centres.<\/p>  <p>  We need to seize the chance we have to borrow at all-time low interest rates to invest in the infrastructure deficit that exists in our public transport networks, both rural and urban, in our fibre and communications networks, in housing, in our water network, in town planning, in urban design, in placemaking and in our main streets.  That creates jobs, putting life back into our smaller towns and villages.  That is climate action.<\/p>  <p>  We are now setting out on a path to reduce our carbon emissions.  The actions we take to achieve this will be beneficial across society and for future generations.  There are, of course, scaremongers who do not wish to change and those who fear change; we heard them here last week.  They are also part of this, and we must bring everyone on this journey in the confidence that a carbon-neutral future is good for everyone.  In fact, to continue as we have done has a devastating price.  Carbon has a cost and if we do not act now with the highest ambition and achieve the science-based and proven targets, we will place an immeasurable burden on our children.  The cost to them will be unaffordable and leave them with a worse quality of life.  Every generation seeks to improve the quality of life and future for their children and, of course, that must be a just transition.<\/p>  <p>  I am proud to stand here to support the Bill, as a Green Party Member and as part of a Government that understands the science that will provide the solutions that will vest in our people and our economy across society to safeguard our shared future.<\/p>  <p> On a personal note, I acknowledge the lifetime commitment to and work of the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on this issue.  I also acknowledge the manner in which he has worked on it collegially across this House and in committee for many years and the faith he had when we Green Party councillors together that some day would be here to enact a climate action Bill.  I am very proud to stand here today and I thank the Minister for the time he has spent on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900039#MM00200","speaker":"1626","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619708700,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I will begin with a short history of climate in numbers.  When I was born, the carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere was 333 parts per million, ppm, which is above pre-industrial levels but consistent with a relatively constant global temperature.  When I went to college, the figure stood at 360 ppm.  On the day of my wedding, the concentration was 385 ppm.  When my first child was born, the reading was 393 ppm.  Today, the CO<sub>2<\/sub>concentration measure at Mauna Loa Observatory stands at 411 ppm.  The composition of our planet's atmosphere has significantly altered in less than a human lifetime.<\/p><p>The changes in our climate system have been studied by scientists for almost 100 years.  Thousands of experts from all over the world have been collecting evidence, reviewing scientific research and debating results.  The resulting message is blunt: human-induced climate change is now a reality.  According to the World Meteorological Organization, as of December 2020, the Earth's average temperature has increased by 1.2<sup>o<\/sup>C above pre-industrial levels, dangerously close to the 1.5<sup>o<\/sup>C limit set out in the Paris Agreement and the temperature limit which scientists regard as safest before climate change is irreversible.  Worryingly, if the current trends of warming continue, as they have during my 44 years on this planet, we can expect to hit the 1.5<sup>o<\/sup>C limit as soon as 2034.  Thereafter, we increasingly run the risk of triggering climate tipping points - points of no return.  I refer to Hemmingway's response to the question, &quot;How did you go bankrupt?&quot; which was &quot;Two ways.  Gradually, then suddenly.&quot;  So it may be with climate breakdown.  It is our children's futures that we stand to bankrupt.<\/p><p>How does a 1.5<sup>o<\/sup>C increase in temperature translate to reality?  The answer is sobering.  Here in Ireland, summer droughts such as those we have seen in recent years will become the norm, damaging agriculture and food production.  In winter, intensified storms will lash our coastal communities more often and flooding events from increased rainfall and rising seas will threaten to inundate our urban centres.  Cork, Galway, Limerick, Dublin and my home town of Waterford, all of which are coastal and at sea level, are all vulnerable.  There is an ugly truth in how climate breakdown will affect those beyond our shores.  Climate modelling shows that people in the developing world, those who have contributed least to the emissions causing climate breakdown, will be the most adversely affected.  I refer here to sub-Saharan subsistence farmers scraping a living from desiccating soils, Middle East families displaced by conflict over scant resources and Pacific islanders, whose entire nations may well sink beneath the waves.  These are people who have done little to contribute to the changing of our atmosphere, yet they will be the ones to pay the highest price if we here continue to fumble in the greasy till.<\/p><p>As much as we owe it to our children to take action in respect of the climate, we owe it to those in developing countries too.  In the sustain development goals, SDGs, we promised them climate action and action on biodiversity and on land and below water and, also, peace, justice and partnership.  We are under binding obligation to our brothers and our children or, <i>faoi geasa, <\/i>as it would have been in Celtic myth.  No good ever came of reneging on promises made.  By contrast, our implementation of the SDGs in international solidarity and in intergenerational solidarity can strengthen societal and economic support for climate action.<\/p><p>There is no planet B.  On this shared planet, this is our shared future.  Let us act now.  The decades of work to build and communicate the scientific evidence of climate change underpins the growing movements of activists demanding bolder and more ambitious climate action.  It underpins the continuous efforts of policymakers and political leaders to agree on collective climate action for the next 30 years.  It also underpins the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 before the House today.  We are past the point of debating the science of climate change.  Anyone in this House who wishes to make electoral hay by undermining unequivocal scientific evidence - we had a few of those voices in the debate last week - let them consider Isaac Cordal's sculpture, Electoral Campaign, and consider, too, if they wish history to count them among those grey heads slowly sinking under water.  We must never underestimate the role that research and scientific evidence play in plotting our course.  If anything, we will be leaning on research and science more and more as we develop solutions to mitigate the causes of climate breakdown.  In availing of scientific research and innovation, we can plan a way ahead that averts the worst impact.<\/p><p>A great deal has happened on the international stage since this Bill was present a week ago.  Last Wednesday, we set ourselves firmly apart for all the right reasons in the context of our stated ambition.  One week on, we are hearing about commitments made across the world's major economies in their efforts to tackle climate crisis.  We have set ourselves apart in establishing this climate Bill, but we are not alone in our efforts.  We are at the centre of something much greater and more impactful.  The science is clear and the need is great.

We have to get to grips with the issue of climate change.  That is beyond doubt.  How we do it is the question.  We have to become carbon neutral by 2050.  We have to decarbonise.  We accept the cessation of commercial peat harvesting, but this has been a big hit to the economy and jobs in the midlands.  There is also a ban on domestic turf cutting.  For some families and households, jobs have been lost and their social domestic fuel is gone, not in ten years, as projected, but in ten months.  Some of these householders are former Bord na M&oacute;na employees.  Earlier, Government speakers referred to the elaborate new high-tech systems for retrofitting houses.  While that is where we want to get to and while it is the ideal, those systems are not available this year and households are also being told they cannot engage in small-scale domestic turf cutting.  This is a major issue.  These households have no alternative at this point.<\/p>  <p>  Transition from commercial peat harvesting and small-scale domestic turf harvesting was to take place over a ten-year timeframe, but, as I said, it was done over ten months.  Meanwhile, peat briquettes that are high in carbon are imported from Germany and further afield in eastern Europe.  In the manufacture and transport of these products very high levels of carbon are emitted and thousands of carbon miles are clocked up.  I have in my hand one such product from Germany.  It was shipped here from thousands of miles away in Germany.  This stands logic on its head.  As someone who wants to get to a point where we carbon neutral, I do not see the sense in this.  These products are sold within a stone's throw of the briquette factory at Derrinlough in Offaly.  Meanwhile, that factory is being scaled down.  We accept that commercial peat harvesting will have to end, but that does not make sense if at the same time we are allowing these products to be imported into the locality where briquettes were made and did not have be transported, and that facility will close in just under three years' time.<\/p>  <p>  Last year, I raised the issue of small-scale domestic turf cutting in the D&aacute;il.  Nothing has been done in the interim to resolve matters.  I have argued for a just transition and, during my time as Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on climate action, I brought forward ambitious policies in that regard.  We need to move on this today.  The science supports that.  Jobs in the midlands are not plentiful.  Household income in Laois-Offaly is 15% lower than the State average.  Retrofitting has commenced.  I welcome that.  I understand the logic behind it.  I have argued for it, but it needs to be accelerated.  There are thousands of homes that require retrofitting, many of them inhabited by low-income families who do not have the money to retrofit.  The schemes need to be accelerated.<\/p>  <p>  In the area of renewable energy, we have a site at Shannonbridge in west Offaly that is in a pivotal position in terms of the national grid.  It needs to be a connection point for renewable energy, solar power, wind energy, biomass and biogas.<\/p> <p>The Mount Lucas facility should be scaled up to a large national training centre that can deliver the apprenticeships that are needed to train people to carry out retrofits and acquire the building skills needed to build the homes that are required to meet the housing shortage.<\/p> <p> Commercial large-scale peat harvesting has to end.  Small-scale domestic turf cutting will peter out over a generation or less but, for now, it must be protected.  The families concerned have no alternative and do not have the income or capital to retrofit their houses.  I fully support the proposed transition but it must be a just transition for Laois, Offaly and the midlands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900040#NN00400","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619709300,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I welcome that many of the suggestions and changes that were put forward have been inserted into the Bill.  However, there are still significant weaknesses in it.  I hope the Government will keep listening to those who continue to have concerns and ensure there is the necessary public confidence in a just and fair climate action plan.  Youth throughout the world have driven the pace of change on these issues.  I commend, in particular, the young students in Blakestown Community School in my constituency, who have organised a number of protests outside Fingal County Council's offices in recent years to highlight the points we are discussing today.<\/p>  <p>  I want to address the issue of climate justice, which will be a core part of getting people to buy into efforts to achieve our climate change objectives.  Deputy Cowen spoke yesterday evening in the House about the importance of a just transition.  However, the Bill gives many of us cause for serious concern in this regard.  It appears that working people are being set up to bear the largest cost of the transition.  Working families are already struggling as we come out of the pandemic.  We had a warning this week by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, that the supports in place to help workers in some way to cope with the pandemic will be withdrawn over a short period.  That is a cause for particular concern.  If this is being done during a pandemic that has devastated the economic well-being of people in our community, how can we trust that supports will be put in place to help them through the changes needed to tackle climate change and enable us to reach the targets that have been set?<\/p>  <p>  The challenges we face in my constituency of Dublin West are significant.  Sinn F&eacute;in is working on a submission on the county development plan that will seek to address those challenges.  Many of the themes for the next decade set out in that plan are intrinsically linked to climate change.  How do we protect our trees and hedgerows, many of which have been devastated by urban sprawl and the years of corruption in our planning system?  How do we protect our green spaces and green belts and ensure we have a green lung left in Dublin?  How do we revitalise towns and villages that have been affected by Walmartisation?  Massive superstores, built with only car users in mind, have sucked the life out of those towns and villages.  Planning legislation such as that to deliver strategic housing development has rocked the confidence of communities in proper and sustainable planning and development.<\/p>  <p>  How do we ensure we have strong public support for major infrastructural projects such as BusConnects and DART+?  Another major public transport scheme, metro west, has been all but abandoned.  It would have connected Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown to Dublin Airport.  Without it, people in Dublin 15 continue to have absolutely no public transport access to the airport.  If we are serious about connecting communities and getting people out of cars, we need a free public transport system.<\/p>  <p>  If we are to bring everyone along on this journey, a just transition must be about more than a few paragraphs in a climate strategy document.  Justice must be at the very core of everything or our efforts will fail.  We must avoid that at all costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900041#OO00200","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speech","time":1619709300,"counter":230,"content":"<p>While I welcome this Bill as a step in the right direction, it must be acknowledged that we are very much on the back foot in the fight against climate change.  I am deeply concerned by the notable lack of several important elements that are needed to tackle climate change effectively.  The legislation does not include a number of commitments made in the programme for Government, which is very telling about the priorities of a certain party of government when it comes to climate action.  Where is the provision for a meaningful just transition?  Without it, communities will be left behind and public buy-in to a decarbonised future will be lost.<\/p>  <p>  I am concerned that the Bill does not include a ban on the importing of fracked gas into Ireland.  That is a missed opportunity.  We share our world and no nation can stop this crisis on its own.  That is why our actions must be of a collective mindset.  By allowing the importation of fracked gas, we are, by default, making Ireland a supporter of fracking.  It seems the only concern is that the fracking is not done in this country and in our sight.  Profits reign superior to the environment and local communities.  This missed opportunity reminds me of when the EU banned the use of dangerous pesticides, which was the correct stance to take.  However, it allowed the large chemical corporations to continue to manufacture and export those harmful pesticides to the global south, thereby ensuring their profits at the expense of others.  When it comes to climate action, an attitude of see no evil and hear no evil is fooling no one.  Fracked gas might appear cheap but it comes with a heavy and very damaging cost to our environment.<\/p>  <p>  Climate action is a huge step and we all need to play our part in it.  There is much talk about global change and global action but we seem to ignore what is happening on our own doorstep.  The Ringsend waste water treatment plant on the Poolbeg Peninsula regularly discharges raw sewage into Dublin Bay, mostly during winter.  The condition of the water last weekend was disgusting.  While it may not have contained raw sewage, it was not of a quality such that I would let a child or dog paddle in it.  People should not be afraid of what they might step in on the beach at Sandymount Strand.  Last summer, residents found the beach was almost unusable because of an algae bloom.  The experts tell us this is a natural occurrence.  Algae bloom may be natural but the amount that grows on Sandymount Strand is not natural.  It grows in such volumes because of the particulates discharged into Dublin Bay.  For many months of the year, it makes Sandymount Strand a no-go zone.  This is not good enough.  We need a short-term engineering solution to stop the regular discharges into Dublin Bay from the waste water treatment plant.  We need the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and Dublin City Council to carry out an audit of the heavy industries on the Poolbeg peninsula and to heavily fine or shut down any that are not compliant with good practice.  Dublin Bay is too important an amenity to do otherwise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900041#OO00300","speaker":"1555"},{"type":"speech","time":1619709300,"counter":231,"content":"<p>There has been much discussion of this legislation over the past few months.  I am glad the debate on Second Stage is being given the time it deserves.  The view among environmental activists is that the Bill does not go anywhere near where it should.  Notwithstanding the good provisions it contains, many people have concerns.  A large number of constituents have contacted my office to express their concerns about the provisions in the Bill and, even more so, what is not in the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  A key focus for me is the need for the actions to tackle climate change to be fair for people and for a just transition to be a key part of Government thinking.  There must be an element of social justice to it.  Those who are least well off cannot be left, once again, to pick up the tab.  Climate action can be a huge opportunity to improve people's lives, deliver warmer homes and ensure a better work-life balance.  However, we must bring people along with us.  We must give them the choices and the means to do so and we cannot punish them.<\/p>  <p>  Carbon taxes are an example of poor policy decisions that impact most on those who cannot afford an alternative.  Rather than work with people, the Government will penalise them for a behaviour they are not in a position to change.  We need a definition of what the Government means by a just transition and there is an opportunity to provide it in this Bill.<\/p> <p>The whole purpose of setting targets is that they are achievable.  If we go beyond them, we will celebrate.  The lack of accountability by previous Governments has got us where we are today.  This is our opportunity to get things right.<\/p> <p> My colleague, Deputy Darren O'Rourke, spoke about the need for the Government to invest significantly in public transport.  Many communities have been failed by a lack of investment over decades.  Governments have prioritised profitable bus routes but then complained when Bus &Eacute;ireann has not made money.  We need to stop looking to the private market to serve the public.  If we have to get cars off our roads, we need a complete overhaul of public transport because the current system is not sustainable.<\/p> <p> There is much good in the Bill but it is not a silver bullet.  Much more needs to be considered before it is passed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900041#OO00400","speaker":"1464","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1619709900,"counter":233,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 4.30 p.m. and resumed at 4.50 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"speech","time":1619710200,"counter":234,"content":"<p>There can be no climate justice without social justice.  We are not doing enough to ensure a just transition.  Current Government policy punishes ordinary workers and their families and rewards big businesses and wind farm developers.  This needs to change.  I welcome the fact that we have a Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill but it needs to be stronger.  It needs to be less aspirational and more legally binding.  The climate crisis will not be solved by hopes and dreams.  We need targeted action if we are to arrest the downward spiral.  In years to come we will be speaking of the curlew and the corncrake as we now speak of the dodo if we do not act.<\/p><p>We cannot rely on crude measures like banning cars and culling herds and certainly not without proper planning and consideration for the consequences.  Energy efficiency needs to be prioritised and our housing stock needs to be brought into the 21st century.  I am assisting a lady who has been offered a grant for front windows and was told that perhaps she might apply for the back windows next year and a new door the year after that.  This approach is wrong and it needs to stop.  If we are not serious about sorting these things out properly, why bother at all?  Is this what we are now reduced to?  <\/p><p>Ireland is supposedly a very affluent country and ranks fourth in the IMF list of the ten richest countries in the world, as apparently measured <i>per capita<\/i>.  Unfortunately, the contempt shown towards working class families for years has increased the unequal distribution of wealth, meaning that many are left behind when the tide rises.  <\/p><p>We need to implement a rolling programme of upgrades for older housing stock.

Where is the just transition for the residents of these areas?<\/p><p>We need a comprehensive plan to ban the importation of fracked gas and, specifically, to ban liquefied natural gas terminals in Ireland.  The Bill needs to be reviewed to ensure compliance with the Aarhus Convention.  We need more engagement and consultation with the public.  We say there must be nothing about us without us.  Another way of looking at this is that those who are not at the table can find themselves on the menu.  We must consider the views of our citizens.

There is a genuine fear that more will be asked of some than of others.  Some decisions made by the Government have only added to these fears.<\/p>  <p>  As someone who lives on a farm in a rural area, it is important for me to say that farmers and rural areas cannot pay the price for climate action, nor will we be sacrificed for climate change.  People in rural areas rely on their car because there is no public transport and no alternative.  Likewise, this Government and previous Governments have continued to heap carbon taxes on solid fuels at a time when bills have already been increased, energy poverty is on the rise and there are no affordable alternatives.  We now have the situation, which would be laughable if it were not so serious, of peat briquettes being imported from Germany when peat production here is being wound down and jobs are being lost.  The workers, families and communities concerned see peat briquettes being imported.  It is absolute madness.  <\/p>  <p>  Many farmers have been playing their part for a long time when it comes to climate action but they are not being compensated for it.  We need to acknowledge that.  Many of them have been left greatly disappointed having been sold the promise in the previous general election that REPS 2, a new environmental scheme, was coming down the tracks.  Instead, a pilot scheme has been announced with a focus on results rather than actions.  It will cost &euro;10 million, whereas &euro;79 million was set aside in the previous budget for a new environmental scheme and other measures.  A sum of &euro;10 million is not enough.  The signs are not good that we will get the type of environmental scheme that farmers are desperately waiting on to try to increase their income.  Farmers need a scheme that recognises the work they already do and puts money in their pockets, that a box-ticking, overly administrative scheme.  That is all that is required.  <\/p>  <p>  Communities at the coalface in the current move from brown to green, including Lanesborough and Ballyleague, need urgent attention.  We need to see the jobs in the Lough Ree power station replaced.  These communities are already feeling left behind.  In towns like Lanesborough and Ballyleague, which have proactive communities, people understand the change but they need to be supported.  This issue should be given urgent attention.<\/p>  <p>  We need to protect domestic turf cutting.  Turf has been much more than just a form of heating for many families for generations.  Under no circumstances, should domestic turf cutting be banned while there is no affordable alternative available.  Many families in areas such as Ballinasloe where domestic turf cutting has been stopped have been left overnight without the source of heating on which they have relied for so long.  Domestic turf cutting must be protected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900043#RR00400","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speech","time":1619710200,"counter":236,"content":"<p>This is possibly one of the most consequential and society-changing Bills this D&aacute;il and, dare I say, any D&aacute;il will discuss.  It requires substantial and detailed parliamentary scrutiny.  It also requires public engagement.  It can be legislatively successful but it may not have an impact or support.  Without public engagement and support, it may not achieve the results we need it to achieve.  I am concerned that as we discuss the Bill, everybody else&rsquo;s attention is on Covid-19.  While that is understandable, given the changes involved in this legislation, the attention it requires has been diverted elsewhere.  When the consequences of this legislation and the changes that it will place on our shoulders become apparent, the public may not support it because they have not engaged with it.  We must all do a better job at this.<\/p> <p> It is extraordinary that so many people deny the basis of this legislation and deny the challenge of climate change, even in the face of incontrovertible scientific evidence and the lived experience.  I refer to the lived experience of two so-called one-in-100-year flooding events happening in the space of three weeks in Crossmolina in 2015.  These are flooding events of a type that we did not encounter previously.  The damage caused by them is becoming regular throughout the year.  Even in Ireland, we have experienced extremes of heat and weather that are as direct consequences of climate change.  We see it worldwide.  The evidence, the damage and the challenge it presents cannot be ignored.  This legislation is necessary.<\/p> <p> Before we come to the end of Second Stage, it is worth reflecting on the fact that the German constitutional court made very strong findings relating to the German climate action Bill, its impact on younger people in particular and why they are being forced to take up that burden.  It would be beneficial for the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to take the time after Second Stage to reflect on that judgment and the detail of it.<\/p> <p> The past 12 months in the context of Covid and its sizeable medical and other consequences have shown us how something relatively small can shut down the world.  We must reflect on what the worst aspects of climate change would do to the world if they were to be allowed to proceed.  Unless we change our way of doing things, that is what will happen.  However, Covid showed that a national effort can be mobilised in pursuit of a common goal and protecting society.  It also showed that many things that could not be achieved for many years were achieved, with many policy decisions being taken very quickly and suddenly.  The silos of government about which I regularly speak in the House suddenly came down in the interests of a common goal.  We need to apply that approach in the context of this legislation and our climate action policies.<\/p> <p> Covid also showed that communication is key.  Communication that is empathetic and understands where people are at is the key to action and mobilisation.  Unless we get that kind of communication, which has an understanding of people&rsquo;s fears and the consequences for various elements of society, this legislation will not work and its aims will not be achieved.  There is significant disinformation around climate change, as is the case in respect of Covid.  When one puts up a social media post about Covid, be that on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or whatever, a message comes up to direct people to reputable sources on Covid.  A similar approach should be taken by social media companies when it comes to discussions on climate change because there is too much misinformation that is destroying the discussion and moving people&rsquo;s focus away from the actual key problem and down rabbit holes that have no bearing on the issue at stake.  The social media companies need to step up to the mark in that regard.<\/p> <p> Many of the roots of this legislation lie in a finding of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly.  It is welcome that there was citizen involvement.  The Citizens&rsquo; Assembly model has proven quite successful.  However, in the context of preparing the climate action plan, I believe the legislation will put the cart before the horse.  The understanding is that there will be a national climate action plan which will lay down parameters and guidelines and is to be followed by local authority climate action plans which will take their lead from it.  We would have a better chance of success were it to be the other way around, that is, for communities to come forward first and feed into the national climate action plan.  I would like to see commitments in the legislation to regularly review the national climate action plan.  There should be some sort of link between that review process and input from local communities.  <\/p> <p> It would be worthwhile to have local citizens&rsquo; assemblies based on the national Citizens' Assembly.  I know there is a commitment that the public participation networks, PPNs, will be involved, but having a citizens&rsquo; assembly in each local authority area to focus on the issues considered by the national Citizens&rsquo; Assembly would make for far greater buy-in on and discussion around each local climate action plan.  I was intrigued that many of the recommendations in the report of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on the national climate action plan secured more than 90% endorsement on the day.  That is very healthy and positive but Members know that is not the way things go in real life.  A more finessed local citizens&rsquo; assembly in each local authority area would give the Minister a far better insight into where people are and their fears and concerns around this whole issue.<\/p> <p> For me, the climate agenda and action on the climate agenda are rooted in local activities and, in particular, the green schools programme at primary school level.  We must thank primary school teachers and the green schools programme for inspiring so many young people of primary school age, creating awareness of the various aspects and challenges around climate change and prompting them to take action.  Having taken action at school, they go home and take action there and, in many cases, force and drag their parents, guardians, grandparents and other family members into taking action.  The strength of the primary school level programme seems to be lost at secondary school level and we need to consider why that is the case.  I welcome the increased awareness and input on climate action issues within the new junior certificate geography curriculum, but I put it to the Minister that it should be incorporated in every subject.  It should not be an issue just for geography.  Climate action issues should be embedded within every subject.  They can be incorporated into each subject to avoid a silo kind of approach and to have, rather, an all-education approach.<\/p> <p> Local involvement outside of schools is crucial.  I had the pleasure of engaging with the Westport Eco-Congregation on this issue.  It was a really insightful discussion.  Its members were coming at the issue from different angles and with various constructive inputs.  It is a group that also takes action on the ground to deal with the issues.  There are many groups that could be involved with local input into the local climate action plan process, thus ensuring the climate action plan process is rooted in communities across the island and that the climate action plan does not just come out of Government Buildings or the usual suspects but, rather, has local buy-in and investment.<\/p> <p> I previously proposed to the Minister the idea of a green towns competition which would involve funding being put in place to allow towns across the country to compete to be Ireland&rsquo;s greenest town.  We in Ballina have set ourselves that ambition as a town following a challenge from former President and Ballina native, Mary Robinson.  We have fantastic committees working on it locally that are trying to achieve what is required and to bring the community with them in doing so.  The Ballina community clean-up group was established prior to Covid, but has taken on a new life during the pandemic.  It is not just doing clean-up; it is investing in biodiversity and bringing nature back to the heart of the town.  I compliment that group.  It has mobilised people across the town to get involved because it is a local group that is getting involved with projects with which people can identify and wish to be on board.  That is the kind of template that needs to be supported.  It is local and can be supported in a manner that sustains and respects it and respects the input of those groups into the decision-making process.  <\/p> <p> I note that the public consultation on the 2021 climate action plan is currently open and will close on 18 May.  There is very little awareness of that consultation.  There were very intensive social media, press and television campaigns behind the consultations in respect of the national development plan and Covid, for instance.  I put it to the Minister that in the two weeks remaining in the consultation period, we need to get to that kind of level of making people aware of this process, that they are welcome to take part in it and that it is in their interest to take part in it.<\/p> <p> The Bill outlines new carbon budgeting processes and that is welcome.  They will be challenging.  I have a couple of concerns.  Through many years, the elected Oireachtas comprising the D&aacute;il and the Seanad has ceded power to unelected bodies.  That is to our detriment.  It has been constantly to our detriment in terms of getting answers and responsibility.  The Bill proposes giving the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC, the power to set the initial carbon budget which the Minister of the day would then discuss with his or her colleagues and spend time on in terms of its implementation.  I believe democracy would be better served if the Minister and the Government, who are answerable to this House, presented the budget and involved the CCAC in a key way.   I welcome the strengthening of that body and its new powers.<\/p> <p>In terms of parliamentary democracy and respect for ourselves as parliamentarians, our carbon budget by its nature should be introduced, in my view, by the Minister.  <\/p> <p> As for the input of communities, the document that goes with the legislation has a phrase to the effect that the climate change plan should offer the least burdens and the greatest opportunities in the pathway to decarbonise and achieve the carbon budget for a given period.  We all agree with that.  The least burdens and the greatest opportunities should apply in this regard.  The burden and the opportunity should be shared.  However, many communities feel the burden is heavy on them and the opportunities are limited.  I speak for many rural communities, which already feel alienated from this process.  I speak for the agricultural community, which seems to be in the firing line every time, despite what it has done over at least 20 years in terms of changing processes and ways of doing businesses and farming.<\/p> <p> If this legislation is to work, have an impact and get buy-in, we must ensure, as is laid out in that document, that we offer the least burdens and the greatest opportunities to rural communities.  We must ask the agricultural sector to come with us in partnership on this journey, rather than telling it what to do, blaming it or fingering it, and the Minister must engage in that partnership with it.  <\/p> <p> One sector that has made huge changes in the past 20 years is the hill farming and sheep farming sector.  It potentially will be asked to make massive changes under the new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  That cannot be allowed to happen, given what it has done already.  Now is the time to engage with all communities around this, particularly the agricultural community, on a partnership basis, rather than a lecturing basis.  <\/p> <p> The challenges of decarbonising transport, including public transport, are necessary and welcome but, for rural communities, there is not an option.  The option is one's car or one does not get to travel.  We have to look at investing in public transport as well as decarbonising it, also opening it up, investing and ensuring it all lines up in rural areas.  We have a myriad of services but few of them seem to talk to one another in a way that makes them practical and effective for people's day-to-day lives.  With the Minister's transport hat on, let us try to put something together so that all our transport services add up.  Let us invest in public transport as well.  We have spoken about the western rail corridor.  That is a perfect example of how we can link regional communities up with regional capitals for education, work and healthcare.  A proper service in place will give people the option of leaving the car behind.  That is not an option they have at the moment.  <\/p> <p> There are many communities for which the road is necessary.  Not investing in roads is not an option.  Otherwise, the Minister will isolate people or force them to live in the big cities where there is already overmuch pressure on systems and ways of living.  The Government cannot ignore road investment programmes with a view to emphasising public transport.  That will drive more people into cities and into bigger carbon usage.<\/p> <p> The area of retrofitting offers massive potential and opportunity in terms of achieving the aims of the climate action plan, reducing our emissions and enhancing people's living experience.  We talk a lot about it and there are big targets but it is about trying to start making those targets happen around the country.<\/p> <p> The Bill contains a number of commitments in respect of oil and gas exploration.  There is a programme for Government commitment in this area.  However, work is also under way in the Department on an energy and security review to ensure our energy security is upfront and is being dealt with in the context of changing the energy inputs.  It would be useful to have that review completed before we move towards a complete change of our energy mix.  It does not make any sense for us to ban offshore exploration and ban fossil fuels in our gas and oil but still import fossil fuels from countries where that ban is not in place or where they are quite heavy users of fossil fuels.  That makes no sense whatever and we need to be clear on that.<\/p> <p> Before this legislation came in today we had the marine area planning Bill, which is very welcome.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, as well as the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, on bringing that forward relatively quickly, despite its complexity.  Without that Bill, this Bill will not happen.  That Bill will change the opportunities for offshore wind but let us be sure that before we make decisions on our energy mix, we can be confident of the supply into the future.  <\/p> <p> I have raised hydrogen and other issues with the Minister previously and I fear there is not enough ambition around the potential uses of fuels such as hydrogen in relation to our energy mix.  As the world is moving quickly to hydrogen, Ireland is uniquely placed in terms of using wind to drive on the hydrogen agenda.  We can be a world leader there if we show more urgency.<\/p> <p> As I said at the outset, this is hugely consequential legislation and it will change the way we do things in every aspect of our lives.  It is happening in the Covid bubble and the legislative bubble and we need to do more to involve everybody in the discussion and make everybody aware of the consequences of this legislation.  If we do not, we will lose people.  We will not bring people on this journey but it is absolutely necessary to do so.<\/p> <p> While people are willing to contribute and share their part of the burden, they need to see the opportunities for themselves, their communities and their families.  They need to see those opportunities are real and not pie in the sky or a form of spin.  They need to see that the changes they are being challenged to make in their daily lives have a point and that everybody is shouldering the burden, regardless of income or geographical location.  They need to know the changes we are making in Ireland are being made internationally and that we as a country are sharing our burden and that burden is being shared internationally.<\/p> <p> We all want this Bill and its aim to succeed but we have to ensure we bring people with us.  We have to do a much better job of bringing people with us and showing the opportunities that come from this Bill.  We have to do a better job of reassuring people that, while there will be burdens, those burdens will be shared fairly and shouldered collectively.  If we do not do that, this Bill will only be a piece of paper.  It will only have some sort of legislative impact but it will not have public buy-in and there is no sense in doing this unless we get public buy-in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900043#RR00500","speaker":"1602","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619711400,"counter":239,"content":"<p>We move to Solidarity-People Before Profit.

I appreciate it.<\/p>  <p>  When the school student climate strikers came out on the street in this country and across the world, they shouted and had on their banners and placards the slogan \"System change, not climate change!\"  They also loudly shouted about the need for a just transition as being absolutely critical to delivering the radical climate action we need to stop climate disaster.  This Bill should be a reflection of the demands and aspirations of those school student climate strikers and the demands they are making for truly radical action to prevent a climate disaster.  I would like to be able to celebrate it as such but, to be honest, it is not.  There are so many compromises and get-out clauses in this that it may well be a dead letter.<\/p> <p>The Bill is littered with the phrase &quot;as far as practicable&quot;.  It is a constant refrain.  It is stated that, as far as practicable, we will do this, that and the other.  If it is not practical, we will not be doing it.  That is the clear implication of the constant use of that phrase in terms of the responsibility of Ministers and the factors they must take into account.  In spite of all the references to climate justice, the single reference that the Minister was forced to put in, which was not included in the first draft in the context of the just transition, is that of &quot;as far as practicable&quot;.  As a result, the just transition is an optional extra.  Many of the targets are also optional extras, particularly when one looks at some of the key assertions made in the Bill.  Section 4 states:<\/p><blockquote>\tFor the avoidance of doubt no remedy or relief by way of damages or compensation is available with respect to or arising out of any failure, of whatever kind, to comply with any provision of this Act or any obligation or duty created thereunder. <\/blockquote> <p>There it is, with that one paragraph there is a legal get-out clause in respect of everything, of every single aspect of the Bill.  Why those get-outs are needed becomes apparent when one looks at some of the other measures that are put forward in the Bill.<br\/><br\/>The Bill refers to: &quot;the need to deliver the best possible value for money consistent with the sustainable management of the public finances&quot;.  Where have we heard that before?  That is neoliberal, capitalist austerity lingo.  There is no doubt about it.  That is what it is there for.  No doubt it was heavily lobbied for by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  Where have we heard that stuff about the sustainable management of the public finances before?  The Bill goes on to refer to &ldquo;the need to maximise employment&quot;, of which I am very much in favour.  However, there is then a reference to &quot;the attractiveness of the State for investment and the long term competitiveness of the economy&quot;.  This means we will not be doing things that might impact on the attractiveness of the State for investment and the long-term competitiveness of the economy.<br\/><br\/>What is envisaged is not system change when one takes those get-out clauses into account.  In fact, that is a legal assertion that we are going to work within the existing system and that said system is the absolute framework outside which we are not going to step.  That is not what the school student strikers were saying.  They were saying that we have to break the shackles of the existing system that has given us the climate crisis.  Unless we do that, what we are referring to is the pursuit of profit by the companies that are destroying the environment.  We must consider that 70% of global emissions come from 100 corporations.  If we are setting it out in law that we are not willing to do anything that might annoy these corporations or make us less attractive to them, that is a get-out clause and it means we are not going to take the action against the companies that are responsible for destroying the environment.  That is what it means.<br\/><br\/>I suggest to the Minister that the use of language referring to the sustainability of the public finances in the Bill rules out the radical move towards a greater use of public transport that we need.  The evidence suggests that.  If we want to take radical climate action and get people out of cars, we must increase investment in public transport and make it cheaper and more accessible.  Let us look at what is actually happening with public transport.  Cash fares have gone up 87% in the past ten years.  In 2008, the  PSO element of public transport funding was &euro;85 million.  The PSO was cut every single year until 2019, prior to Covid, and currently stands at &euro;47 million, almost half what it was in 2008.  At the same time, we have announcements that Expressway services in rural areas such as Wexford, Waterford, Sligo and Dundalk are to be cut.  The public transport system, which is not based on profit, is being slashed in favour of private for-profit transport providers that have no interest in cutting fares and every interest in increasing them in order to increase their profitability.  We have seen the outsourcing of 10% of Dublin Bus routes.  Do we honestly think Go-Ahead Ireland has an interest in providing free public transport or making routes that do not make a profit for it available?  Of course it does not.  That is not what it does, it is out to make money from people.  Such companies cut the unprofitable routes in favour of profitable ones.  That is how they operate.  If we want a public transport system that is so state of the art that people would not dream of getting into their cars, we must have the level of subsidy required to invest in routes that are not profitable from a narrow commercial point of view or from the point of the view of the so-called sustainability of the public finances.  That is what we need if we are going to make the radical transition that is necessary.  We need to be able to say to taxi drivers that it is not going to be a punishment for them.  I have asked the Minister repeatedly for this.  This year, many of them are facing the possibility of having to exit the industry because they do not have the money to replace their cars and they most certainly do not have the money to pay &euro;50,000 for an electric taxi that is disabled-accessible.  All that is available to them is &euro;20,000.  Where are they supposed to get the other &euro;30,000, particularly when they have lost a year and a half's income?  They will not be able to do it.  They will be pushed out of the industry.  There will be no just transition for them.  That is the reality of these things.<br\/><br\/>Let us take forestry as another example.  We had a report in October 2020 that Irish forestry is not a carbon sink, but is now a net carbon emitter.  How on earth could that be the case?  It is explained in a report commissioned by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is because we have the completely wrong forestry model that is run for profit.  It is about plantations of Sitka spruce and clear-felling.  When one operates forestry on that basis, one cuts when the market will deliver the profit.  Clear-felling also gives rise to large amounts of emissions and destroys the biodiversity we need to address.  It is critical to address the climate and biodiversity emergency.  We need to move to continuous cover forestry and agroforestry on a massive scale, and I regret to inform the Minister that that means bucking the market.  We cannot be hemmed in by attractiveness to foreign investors and by the so-called narrow sustainability of the public finances if we want to do those sorts of radical things.<br\/><br\/>We have the carbon tax and the just transition for ordinary people.  Critically, we need to retrofit.  At the moment, we are punishing people.  Some 400,000 people are in fuel poverty.  What are we doing to provide investment to ensure a just transition in order that people are not punished by the carbon tax?  I will tell the Minister what we are doing in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  We are providing an extra &euro;1 million that will be used to retrofit 41 houses next year.  That amounts to 1% of the housing stock.  That is not radical.  All the rest of the people who are living in fuel poverty, some in council housing and some not, will continue to be punished with the increasing carbon tax because we are not serious about putting in the investment.  That 1% is roughly replicated in the context of the money that is being put into retrofitting on a national scale.  We are not doing it and that is because, in order to do it, we have to break away from the neoliberal market model.  We have to say that it does not have to be sustainable in the narrow sense but that it has to be sustainable in the actual sense of the just transition and of the system change we need in order to facilitate climate action.<br\/><br\/>I am deeply worried that this Bill has the outward appearance of radical action but contains all the get-out clauses which mean that the system will not change and that just transition will not be delivered.<\/p> <p>Where is the binding reporting mechanism for the just transition to make sure that happens?  Where are the powers for the just transition commissioner to call people to account if the just transition does not happen?  They are not there because the investors we are so worried about would not want them.<\/p> <p> Where are the taxes?  It was insisted that we were going to tax the big corporations that continue to pollute and which are the real problem.  They are not there.  I am worried.  As I said, this is decoration.  It is the appearance of radical action when actually it is a balancing act to appease the big polluters and corporate interests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900045#TT00700","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619712600,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I want to express my support for the open letter published recently by more than 400 academics researching climate and environmental change protesting the worldwide attempts to criminalise non-violent climate protest.  The letter states that those who put their voices and bodies on the line to raise the alarm are being threatened and silenced by the very countries they seek to protect.  I agree with that, and I want to add my voice to this important issue.<\/p>  <p>  I want to draw attention to the fact that the Bill does not include measures to ban the importation of fracked gas.  It should have done so.  I hear Green Party Ministers swear blind that such a ban will be included in separate legislation.  Climate activists will watch like hawks to see that that legislation is indeed brought forward, and brought forward quickly.  Perhaps the Minister can provide us with a date as to when we will see that legislation.<\/p>  <p>  I am for climate action.  I am also for climate justice.  The idea of carbon taxes on the general population, taxes that will rise year on year up to 2030, is something I oppose.  These taxes are counter-productive.  They will rightly be perceived by many as unjust and they have the potential to turn people away from the necessary climate action agenda.  A total of 71% of greenhouse gas emissions in the past three decades came from just 100 large corporations.  That is where carbon taxes need to be directed.  They need to be targeted precisely at forces such as those which pollute for profit.<\/p>  <p>  Worldwide, data centres account for 2% of world energy demand, a figure which is expected to quadruple to 8% by 2030.  However, in this country data centres and other large users are expected to account for 27% of Irish energy demand by 2028.  Ireland is fast becoming Europe's data centre capital.  There are currently 54 such centres, with planning permission in place for a further 31.  They all require high levels of energy to power and cool machines.  It is estimated by the Irish Academy of Engineering that data centres are set to add 1.5 million tonnes to Ireland's carbon emissions total by 2030.  We should act like our house is on fire.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland cannot become Europe's data centre capital and reach emission targets.  It is not enough to say that data centres should use renewable sources.  Of course they should, but at the current rate of growth they will end up using close to 50% of all energy from renewable sources.  This drive needs to be slowed down.  The case for strong carbon taxes on the owners of these centres is clear and undeniable.<\/p>  <p>  What we need in Ireland and internationally is a green new deal that puts the environment first and promotes the question of a just transition, one that is just for society and ordinary working people.  What kind of policies might be enshrined in a green new deal in this country?  I suggest the following issues would be among those at the core of it.  There should be massive State investment in renewable energy.  There should be a State-funded programme to retrofit houses, including the State building social and affordable housing and retrofitting new housing.  There should be free public transport, via a public transport system which has had a major increase in investment.  There should be a four-day working week.  There must be a major increase in investment in reforestation.  Agribusiness should be taken into public ownership and a plan should be drawn up, linked to a move towards sustainable, carbon-free agriculture. <\/p>  <p>  Policies such as these clash with the imperative within a society to put profit first.  One cannot square that with a system which puts profit first, before people and the environment..  We cannot fund that without massive increases in taxation on big business and the wealthy in society.  It points towards the need for a break with the current economic system, the system of capitalism.  <\/p>  <p>  Young people on climate marches carried signs that read \"System change not climate change\".  The system that needs to be ended and replaced with something better is capitalism.  Capitalism is the system responsible for those 100 companies that account for 70% of global carbon emissions.  Capitalism is the system which results in the top 10% of income earners in the world having up to 43% of the environmental impact, while the bottom 10% of earners have between just 3% and 5%.  Capitalism is the system that the author of the Stern report referred to when he stated that \"Climate change is a result of the greatest market failure the world has seen\".<\/p>  <p>  We cannot afford that market system if we want a future for the next generation, halt the threat of climate change to our planet and offer a real future for young people.  We need to end the system which puts profit before the environment.  We need to end the system of capitalism and replace it with something better.  I would suggest that something better is a democratic and socialist society, rationally planned in the interests of all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900047#VV00200","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1619712600,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I am quite glad that I get to speak on the second week of the debate on the Bill because it gives me a chance to read and listen to the contributions Deputies have put forward, which has been very interesting.  There has been quite a spectrum of responses to the Bill.  For some the Bill goes too far and there is a feeling that it might pit communities against the inevitable reforms that will be required by the very real changes brought about by global climate change.  I agree with some of those concerns.  We have a challenge in terms of making the just transition work for farming.  Ireland is not unique in the reaction to some of the change around carbon emission reduction and the fear it will impact on the average worker and those who farm the land most.<\/p>  <p>  For others, the Bill does not go far enough.  There are concerns around governance not being robust enough and that not all Departments will be involved.  I also take those concerns seriously.  It may be that we need to calibrate the reporting or governance around them as the Bill takes shape and is working.  If this is not an all-of-government project, it will not work.<\/p>  <p>  My concern in all of this is the impression conveyed by both sides of the House and both sides of the argument that this is an all-encompassing initiative and is almost like a full stop in terms of our country's approach to addressing our role in climate action.  For me the Bill is, in fact, an answer to, if not a pathway away from, a lost decade where inaction and calculated political indifference saw us at the bottom of every table of progressive climate action.  Let us be honest; many Deputies in the House are not particularly bothered and do not particularly care about climate action or the impact climate inaction might have on their constituents.<\/p> <p>That is their prerogative but it is important that every side of the argument from every side of the House recognises that the decade of inaction and indifference we have just experienced has left the Irish nation singularly vulnerable to the economic, social and environmental impacts of climate change.<\/p> <p> Whether one believes in or cares about it, climate change is not a slow train coming at the Irish people.  It is a very fast train coming down the tracks at us and due to our international agreements and the extreme weather events we are experiencing in our own backyards now, we will have to deal with it.  We can no longer ignore it or escape it.  <\/p> <p> This could have been easier.  In the past ten years we could have reached out to farmers to gradually phase in land management and biodiversity measures.  We did not do that.  We will have to do more now in a shorter timeframe and we cannot pretend that will be easy or without worry for small and medium farmers.<\/p> <p> In the past decade we could have been talking to communities about pooling their resources and capitalising on the very real opportunities that we see other communities in the EU capitalising on around community ownership of renewable energy sources.  We did not do that either.  We will now spend millions of euro on retrofitting homes and on retro-engineering community energy, instead of being ahead of the pack on public investment in green technology.  <\/p> <p> We could have spent the past decade looking at high carbon emission industries in specific communities and targeting them for just transition supports in order that the average worker would be able to upskill and benefit in a real way from the new jobs that will be created by the inevitable change that is coming in all our industries in response to climate action.  We did not do that.  Our ability to retrofit our homes, install solar power and run district heating systems will be slower now than it could have been because we will struggle with capacity in the sector.<\/p> <p> We should not be proud of the past decade because it was a political and societal choice to ignore the need to plan for our children&rsquo;s future and for their survival.  We decided not to do that.  This House decided not to do that and the new task will be harder, more painful and more expensive than it needed to be because of that choice.  <\/p> <p> This is an incredibly important Bill.  It sets out internal Irish structures to finally address climate action.  It is a one of a suite of measures that sits in parallel to other things we must act on now to safeguard our future and plan for our children to not just survive but to thrive.  The first on that list of parallel issues would be the issue of biodiversity.  Ireland is in the middle of a biodiversity crisis.  We have widespread species collapse, river pollution and mismanagement - we have just seen the burning of our beautiful national park in Killarney - and the widespread loss of habitats across the country.  The curlews, corncrakes, barn owls and bats that I used to hear above my head growing up in Limerick were common around Ireland.  If we continue along the current path, future generations will not enjoy that.<\/p> <p> It is now time to consider recognising the right of the Irish people to nature as part of their right to live in an environment consistent with human dignity.  For the families who are battling rising flood waters and the incredibly high number of children up and down this country who are struggling with asthma across our towns and villages due to low air quality, it is fair to say we may have reached a tipping point for them where the degradation of our natural capital may now be impeding the human rights of Irish residents.<\/p> <p> Second, Ireland must become a leader in global climate agreements.  Our efforts to meet net-zero emissions must be complemented by adaptation and resilience measures and, importantly, the mobilisation of climate financing for countries that have not developed modern infrastructure.  We give out about the infrastructure in Ireland all the time but we are incredibly privileged here.  We live in a well-developed country.  Many countries around the world do not enjoy that type of infrastructure and we need to work with them to ensure that the move towards climate action does not disenfranchise them.<\/p> <p> The issue of emissions from farming is a global one.  I would put it in the second bracket of global climate agreements because farmers feed the world and the world will have to reverse the recent unhealthy move to meat-heavy diets and return to a more balanced diet, which existed a generation or two ago.  We have no target for herd reduction in this Bill but the reality is that we could reduce the herd by more than 70% and we still would not have to import beef for consumption here.  What we are doing by not addressing this issue is onshoring carbon emissions from other countries so that they can eat beef.  We will have to pay the fines on those carbon emissions.  In effect, the Irish taxpayer will be paying the environmental fines to allow somebody in Essex or Surrey to eat a steak.  Import or export, this is a global community issue.  All of us will have to eat less meat.  We will have to have less livestock just to survive.<\/p> <p> Third, Ireland had an interesting year in 2020.  We placed people in significant roles in finance within the EU.  Mairead McGuiness was placed as the EU Commissioner with responsibility for financial stability, financial services and capital markets union.  It is an incredibly important role.  Our own Minister, Deputy Donohue, was placed as chair of the Eurogroup.  Instead of acquiescing to the global move towards tax reform that President Biden has been citing in recent days, it is time that we used our outsized international presence as a small country to lead reform because there can be no climate justice without tax justice.<\/p> <p> Finally, we must actively lead within the UN on the children's environmental rights initiative, CERI, which has three primary objectives.  The first is the UN recognition of the human right to a healthy environment, with specific reference to children.  The second is the creation of a general comment from the Committee on the Rights of the Child as it relates to the environment.  The third is the decision by the parties to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child to clarify and advance fulfilment of children&rsquo;s right to a healthy environment through an optional protocol.<\/p> <p> Last month, at the Human Rights Council's 46th session, a core group led by Costa Rica issued a statement calling for states to engage in a consultation process on the recognition of the right to a healthy environment.  Sixty-nine countries supported that call.  I am proud to say Ireland was one of them.  We should progress that and act with them to make sure that happens.  Ireland should now sign the Declaration on Children, Youth and Climate Action launched at the UN Climate Change Conference COP25 in Madrid.  This is an obvious area of leadership for Ireland and it builds on the Kwon-Gesh pledge, which was pioneered by Ireland and the Marshall Islands in 2019, which is not that long ago.  It places young people and children at the heart of climate decision-making.  UNICEF wrote to all New York missions on Earth Day this year to ask them to progress that pledge.<\/p> <p> After our lost decade, those are the initiatives and that is the place for Ireland to now lead on climate action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900047#VV00300","speaker":"1559","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619713200,"counter":250,"content":"<p>If there is consensus now across the House to take climate action, it is worth asking why it did not happen before now.  One of the most common arguments against it was not even an argument.  It was a question that was put forward to the effect that we want to do this climate action but who will pay for it?  That argument was really powerful even though it was misleading.  It contained the built-in assumption that it would cost a lot of money, that we would probably have to pay for it and that climate action was an additional frippery that would be added to the real business of living our lives.  It was like building a conservatory under one's house or ordering another course in a restaurant.  It was an unneeded extra, a luxury, and something we could not really afford and we needed to get back to business.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear there has been a change of heart about that and we realise there has been a mistake.  Our whole economic system was being measured with GDP even though the inventor of GDP in the 1930s said that it is not a measure of general welfare and we should not use it in that way because it is a measure of consumption and production.  The faster that one exhausts one's finite resources is not a good way of showing how rich one is.  The faster one gets through all the food in one's cupboard does not mean that one's family is getting wealthier.  Why would we think that even for a second?  Yet, despite that, we would see stories in the newspaper about a drop in GDP of 0.5% this quarter and asking if we were getting poorer or richer as a result.  It was all ludicrous.<\/p> <p>Wealth, human happiness and the success of a nation are not measured by how fast it exhausts its finite resources.  I do not know how we had that idea.  How do we measure viability and evaluate the investment of taxpayers' money in large projects?  We have a cost-benefit analysis system.  If, for example, a giant road is being built, a cost-benefit analysis measures the travelling hours saved by all the people who will be driving.  This is multiplied by how much an average person would be paid to work, and that is the cost saving.  What is not taken into account is the extra time it takes for people in the area who are not in a car, including those on bicycles, to cross the road or the time for which those on buses are stuck in a traffic jam.  They do not count; their time has no value.  The person working on a laptop on a train has no value.  The lives, time and health of people walking along the road who are breathing in the fumes and who then get respiratory illnesses &mdash; our rate of asthma is twice that in any other country in Europe &mdash; have no value because it is really handy to pick just one number to do sums and compare things and to say that anybody who argues with it is wrong.  Therefore, we are going to change how we do cost-benefit analyses of our major projects.  We are not going to do it in the old way anymore.  We are going to do something more sensible, just as we do not measure the health of our economy with GDP because it does not make sense.<\/p> <p> In Ireland, the Government spends a lot of money and we are in an era of major State investment.  A lot of the money goes through public procurement frameworks, which are guides to achieving value for money, obtaining good quality with money spent, spending transparently and fairly and ensuring there is no corruption or favouritism involved.  We can add to that by requiring that we spend our money in a way that supports our strategies and Government policy on sustainability to help our environment and meet our social aims.  We are allowed to do that legally by the European directive, and we will be progressing legislation in that regard over the course of the year.<\/p> <p> It has emerged during the pandemic that there is an absolute need to have broadband.  There was a debate some time ago as to whether we could afford it and whether there was a good cost-benefit argument for extending it to every house in Ireland.  It turns out we cannot really live, conduct commercial life, interact with the Government and even interact socially without broadband.  We must deliver it.  We must accelerate the delivery and invest in it.  It can help us to achieve our climate goals because it allows people not only to work from home but also to work in their community.  They can go down to their village or suburb and they do not have to commute.  In the past, the benefit of a project was measured as the amount of time saved by a driver.  There was a clear reason for it: time spent driving is hell.  Everybody hates the torture of a life that involves commuting back and forth, varying journey times, just not knowing how long journeys will take and hoping each one will be the quickest ever, with every one involving stress and unhappiness.  Avoiding that hell by reducing the total amount of commuting and getting people to work in their local village or home will improve the quality of life for everybody.  It will improve communities.  Already in suburban areas, villages and towns, we see more people socialising on the streets.  They have happier lives and are not involved in the absolute hell of long-distance commuting.<\/p> <p> We come back to the misleading question of who will pay for what is proposed.  Again, it is not an accessory.  It is an absolute revolution in the way we will do things.  The answer is that we are not going to do something additive or extra.  This is not icing on the cake.  We are changing the old way of doing things and replacing it with something new.  Rather than this resulting in a cost, it will result in savings.  Not needing to own a car saves money.  Having an electric car saves money because fuel is not being put into it.  An insulated home saves money on electricity and heating bills.  We have to do this.  On the concept of sustainability, which is a technical word that makes people turn off, ultimately something that sustains is something that lasts, and when something lasts one does not need to pay to replace it quickly, again saving money.<\/p> <p> Can we make all these huge changes?  Can we change our transport system, the way we do agriculture and the way we heat our homes and generate electricity?  Faced with an existential challenge a year and a half ago, people all around Ireland and the rest of the world came together and changed their habits of a lifetime.  They voluntarily made huge changes to their lifestyles.  At the same time they were making these changes, scientists and doctors were working to push the boundaries of innovation.  Working together with a common purpose, with science and medicine coming together to solve in a technical way the existential problem facing us, has meant we are now in the final chapters of the pandemic.  If we can do this to combat a pandemic that was threatening the lives of our older people, some of whom are here, we can also change our system to protect our young people, including our children and grandchildren.  We can make those changes.  I am delighted to see this is no longer a party-political issue and that there is broad consensus.  I hear people from all parties and none saying they want a climate Bill.  If they want to make changes to it, that is great.  Let us work together.  A Bill is not perfect on day one; there is a process to go through.  We will go through that process, work together, co-operate and collaborate to solve this problem for everybody in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900048#WW00200","speaker":"1479","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1619713800,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I support sensible measures to encourage people to lead more environmentally healthy lives but I have major fears about whether this Bill will lead to that.  While I believe the Minister and his colleagues in the Green Party are sincere in their motives, I disagree with the approach they want to take.  First, this Bill could best be described as motherhood and apple pie.  While it sounds wonderful, what will it mean when push comes to shove?  We are being asked to pass a vague Bill that will give Governments free rein to do as they please for the next 30 years.  I agree with Deputy Naughten's statement that the Bill is anti-democratic and that, by passing it, we are tying the hands of future legislators and depriving them of a say.  When we deprive Deputies of a say, we are effectively depriving people of a voice.  Past behaviour is a key indicator of action in climate-related matters.  Past behaviour is a key indicator of future performance, and this is very true when it comes to action on climate-related matters.  The past behaviour of successive Governments has targeted the wrong outcomes.  We need only return to 2008 when a Minister responsible for the environment, Mr. John Gormley, told us to buy diesel cars.  Sales of diesel cars went up by 30% in six months.  The Green Party was delighted.  It said consumers had modified their behaviour and turned to fuel-efficient cars, claiming this was evidence that its policies worked.  Less than ten years later, the Green Party says that was wrong.  Yesterday I heard Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe, MEP, say he believes speed cameras on the M50 are a great idea.  He said the approach is proven to slow down traffic but that it is not where we want to be.  He said we need a modal transport shift, with more people on buses, but preferably on bicycles, meaning that in the future one lane can be dedicated entirely to buses.  This is happening all over Europe, he said.<\/p>  <p>What I have never heard from the Green Party or this Government is that an extension to Dublin Port is a bad idea because of nitrogen oxide, NOx, emissions.  Mr. Cuffe may know what is happening all over Europe.  Ports in major cities are being wound down or relocated, or commercial activities are being minimised and users are being dispersed to regional or less congested ports, but not in Dublin, it appears.  Anyone would believe that the Environmental Protection Agency reports do not matter or that people's lung health is not as important in Dublin Port.  Is it being ignored for political reasons?  Is it easier to pay the nitrogen oxide exceedance fines than discuss the hot potato, which is that Dublin Port activities could be shared with regional ports to the people's advantage?  Dare I mention that removing a toll barrier at Dublin Port tunnel would make a world of a difference with regard to emissions?<\/p> <p>The entrance has one of the highest levels of NOx emissions of anywhere in the city, according to the EPA.  Perhaps that is simplistic.  It would not make us world leaders because First World countries do not have toll barriers and tolls, just Ireland.

<br \/><br \/>&mdash; a best practice model of service delivery, assessment, diagnosis and intervention for service users with autism, drawing on international expertise, with guidance for health service providers on how to meet the needs of both children and adults with autism, and their families and carers; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; a clear and detailed intervention plan, funded and time-bound, on support services for families and carers, and a fully established roadmap on how family support services are to be developed; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; appropriate amendments to the definition of disability in equality legislation, so as to include specific reference to autism and other developmental issues that affect a person&rsquo;s capacity to take part in social interactions or to form social relationships, and to incorporate a rights-based, child-centred and inclusive approach; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; a sustained autism inclusiveness campaign and the provision of autism inclusion procedures and real engagement, including training for all professionals who frequently deal with adults with autism; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; appropriate regulation of autism services and therapies and recommendations on appropriate action to be taken in relation to therapies which are not medically, or evidence based, make false claims or are dangerous to the welfare of people with autism; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the inclusion of a question on autism in the next national census to determine the number of people with autism in the State; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the implementation of the recommendations of the report entitled &lsquo;Unmet Needs - A report by the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office on the challenges faced by children in Ireland who require an assessment of their needs&rsquo;, including and not limited to:  <blockquote> \t&mdash; additional resources, including a refund element for private assessment to get to grips with the significant waiting lists; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; changes to the Disability Act 2005, to ensure a holistic and multidisciplinary approach to the assessment and identification of a child&rsquo;s development needs; and <br \/><br \/>&mdash; recognition of the special educational needs of children in legislation, via changes to the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, to ensure these needs are met in a timely and appropriate manner;  <\/blockquote>&mdash; the commencement and resourcing of all relevant disability legislation without delay; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; in relation to adults with autism, access to diagnostic services, to key worker support and appropriate mental health care where required, and a pathway of care which clearly maps services and ensures their consistent availability across the State and outlines how the healthcare, educational, employment and social needs of adults with autism are to be addressed throughout their lives and across the public service in terms of access to services, justice, housing, employment and social inclusion, with parity of access as the underpinning goal; and <br \/><br \/>&mdash; a clear system of accountability and scrutiny relating to autism service provision.&rdquo; <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>Notes were being taken.  When a family who are adjusting to the realisation of a challenging diagnosis come into contact with the services of the State, they should assume a culture of partnership, compassion and care, but notes were being taken.  They fear for their child because of an autism diagnosis and ask how he or she will navigate the world.  They wonder whether the child will have to endure prejudice, misunderstanding or isolation, and ask themselves who will partner with them to empower him or her, but notes were being taken.<\/p><p>Parents have long waiting lists, of 18 or 19 months for an assessment of need or of 35, 36 or 40 months for some essential interventions.  Why are these periods counted in months?  Thirty-six months is three years.  They ask these questions at night, heartbroken at the sight of their sleeping three-year-old, who will be six years old by the time their country comes to their aid, but notes were being taken.  In rooms where the compassion of the State should have been most manifest, notes were being taken to add to a dossier that would be used in a court case.  If a parent was so exhausted and frustrated by the failures of this country to empower his or her child that he or she turned to the legal route, the State would turn to its notes.  They are dossiers not just on the child but on his or her entire family.<\/p><p>The &quot;RT&Eacute; Investigates&quot; programme broadcast last month exposed the culture of confrontation that emanates from the corridors of the permanent Government: notes were being taken.  While the expos&eacute; was shocking, it was somehow, ironically, completely unsurprising because no one who has ever had to embark on this adventure with an autistic child would be in any way surprised by the culture, the systemic failures and the institutionalised obstacles we promote as a child-centred approach.  No western democracy would attempt to stand over such pathetic waiting lists.  No genuine republic would force parents to go on a hopeless merry-go-round trip of local schools to access a place for their child, and no country with aspirations for all its children would force families to the courts when they try to vindicate their rights and then reach into a filing cabinet or download a file within which is a dossier compiled by taking notes.<\/p><p>We in the Labour Party want the Government to take note.  We want D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and the citizens to take note.  Autistic people are a gift, an inspiration, a guiding light for all of us.  We are enhanced, empowered and enlightened by them.  Their potential is limitless; all they need is a society willing to listen, learn, love, empower and take note of who they are.<\/p><p>There was a man more than 100 years ago who took notes.  He took notes for an address he would never make, during a struggle and a time after which he would be long forgotten.  His name was Tom Johnson, the leader of the Labour Party in 1919.  He was entrusted with the honour of scripting the Democratic Programme of the First D&aacute;il.  As voices such as his struggled to be heard over the sound of gunshots from the men and women of war and of flags, he wrote of the children.  In his well-crafted notes, he wrote:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe Irish Republic shall always count its wealth and prosperity by the measure of health and happiness of its citizens.  It shall, therefore, be the first duty of the Government of the Republic to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the children, to ensure that no child shall endure hunger or cold from lack of food, clothing or shelter, that all shall be provided with ample means and facilities requisite for the education and training of free citizens of a free Gaelic nation.  A condition precedent to such education is to encourage by every reasonable means the most capable, sympathetic men and women to devote their talents to the education of the young. <\/blockquote>  <p>We should reflect on the notes he took and the words he used, such as &quot;health&quot;, &quot;happiness&quot;, &quot;physical, mental and spiritual well-being&quot; and the need for &quot;sympathetic men and women to devote their talents to the education of the young&quot;.  This is the founding document of our State, of the Oireachtas.  It is said of Tom Johnson that he wept openly when he heard those words read aloud as he had written them in his notes.  Have we failed that aspiration, that purely republican aspiration, for the well-being of the children of the sympathy, understanding and compassion of that same State?  As today these children try to find their voice between the flag-wavers and the tax-cutters, they now need to be empowered.<\/p><p>We need a national autism empowerment strategy to correct the mistakes of the State and to embed here the international best practice of others.  The Maltese autism Act is a template this country should work from, an Act that in its citation seeks &quot;to empower persons within the autism spectrum by providing for their health and well-being in society, the betterment of their living conditions, their participation and inclusion in society and to make ancillary and consequential provisions thereto in full adherence to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability.&quot;  There are those words again, as if inspired by Tom Johnson, &quot;health&quot;, &quot;well-being&quot;, &quot;inclusion&quot; and &quot;betterment&quot;.  It is an Act of empowerment and defiance that in the face of generations of misunderstanding, prejudice and underfunding, autistic people are now ready to defy the odds, the history of their state and the expectations of their country to live full, productive, healthy and love-filled lives.  We should compare notes with Malta.<\/p><p>At the heart of the Maltese legislative achievement and of our motion is accountability.  It is what parents are crying out for, in regard to service providers, to when mistakes are made and gaps need to be filled, and to this House, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  These are the notes the Minister of State and the Government need to take.  They should take note from Malta and the advocacy groups and parents' associations that are crying out for the State to take some of the burden in this empowerment process.  I refer to groups such as those in Dublin 6 and 6W, which are working with Senator Bacik, or in Dublin 12, which I have met with Senator Moynihan and which are changing the world for their children, or to the children I have met in my constituency such as James Field and Abigail Cahill, who have changed my entire understanding of the world in which they live.  The Government should listen to groups such as AsIAm, which empowered us in the Labour Party to draft our motion.<\/p><p>It is not right that parents feel they are at war with their Government and State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021042900050#YY00500","speaker":"1551"}]
