This survey found that the basic deprivation rate was 30.5%, an increase of 3.6% on the 2012 figure.  The two most commonly experienced indicators of deprivation were stated as &ldquo;unable to afford to replace any worn out furniture&rdquo; and &ldquo;unable to afford a morning, afternoon or evening out in the past fortnight&rdquo;.  These indicators were experienced by one in four of the individuals surveyed.  The rise in basic deprivation has affected all income groups and reflects the legacy on households of the economic crisis since 2008.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2012 to 2013, the period referred to in this survey, there have been significant improvements in the economy.  For instance, unemployment and long-term unemployment have fallen significantly.  The January live register figures published yesterday show a reduction in the numbers of over 70,000 people unemployed since 2013.  The unemployment rate fell yesterday again to 10.5%.<\/p>  <p>  Poverty is strongly linked to unemployment and as employment increases, we can expect to see decreases in poverty and deprivation.  The best way to reduce poverty is through getting a job.  The Government has protected the incomes of the bottom income 20% - or quintile, as it is termed - by maintaining core welfare rates.  While deprivation has increased, it should be noted that the at-risk-of-poverty rate has declined from 16.5% in 2012, to 15.2% in 2013.  The at-risk-of-poverty rate for 2013 is, in fact, lower than that in 2005 at the height of the boom when it was 18.3%.  A key reason for this fall is the effectiveness of social transfers in reducing income poverty.  SILC 2013 shows that, excluding pensions, social welfare transfers lifted one third of the population out of poverty.  In budget 2015, we further enhanced the poverty reduction effect of social transfers, such as increases in child benefit and the living alone allowance and the restoration of the Christmas bonus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500003#A00500","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1423128600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>The Minister seems to indicate that trends since the end of 2013 would show a different result if these figures were taken up now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500003#A00600","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1423128600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Excuse me, Deputy, it is difficult for us to hear the Deputy on this side of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500003#A00700","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1423128600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>My apologies.

A total of &euro;72 million extra will be spent on child benefit in 2015 with &euro;22 million provided for expenditure on the new back to work family dividend, and an additional &euro;2 million on the school meals programme.

On the other hand, the at-risk-of-poverty rate for children decreased from 18.8% in 2012 to 17.9% in 2013.

In preparing the report the Department&rsquo;s internal auditor raised a query relating to the appropriateness or otherwise of one job club hosting a small number of interns in a role of job club instructor.  It is important to note in this regard that the Department funds the operation of 50 job clubs located around the State.  These job clubs are operated by 46 separate contractors - mainly local development-partnership companies, LDCs.  The job club in question is a community based, not-for-profit, social enterprise.  Departmental records show that it is one of two job clubs which have hosted JobBridge interns.<\/p>  <p>  Department management has considered the query raised by the internal auditor and is satisfied that the use of interns did not give rise to any cause for concern in this instance.  In this regard, JobBridge has been criticised on occasion on the basis that some of the opportunities offered are so-called \"low level\" jobs.  In this instance, some reports have queried the appropriateness of the internships on the basis that the opportunities offered required \"higher level\" qualifications.  In fact, what this case shows is that JobBridge offers a broad range of internships to respond to the needs and aspirations of the complete spectrum of jobseekers, including those targeting specific sectors but lacking critical real workplace experience in their chosen field.  I am satisfied, therefore, that no question arises about JobBridge as a consequence of this case.  It was our internal audit that raised issues, as it should have, and brought them to the attention of the Department.  In this case, the issue was examined and it was deemed appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500006#D00900","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1423130400,"counter":78,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

The question raised in the audit was whether the job clubs were able to do this, as well as providing mentoring and training under JobBridge.

While a broad variety of work is provided by the councils, the majority of positions identified as being suitable for Gateway placements relate to services of an environmental or outdoor nature.  A breakdown of the types of work being done illustrates this.  Just under one third of participants are currently engaged in caretaking and the upkeep and repair of facilities, such as beaches, housing, and sports and community facilities.  Roughly one quarter are employed in tourism and village and urban upkeep.  More than one fifth of participants are employed on the development and maintenance of walks, leisure trails and heritage projects, including cemeteries and parks.  Around 13% of participants are involved in supporting council administration and related services, and 5% are involved in the upkeep of roadways, with around 4% covering waste management.  Gateway, T&uacute;s and other community schemes are designed to meet a range of objectives for the broader community and individual jobseekers.<\/p>  <p>  It is unfortunate that the Deputy is not looking at the positives of the Gateway scheme.  I have taken the time to meet Gateway participants and to listen to their stories, which are very enlightening and, to some degree, uplifting.  The participants tell me about how long they have been out of the workforce, the opportunity and hope the scheme has given them, the network they have created and the friends they have made.  <\/p>  <p>  Already, participants are exiting the Gateway scheme into employment.  The Deputy should take the time to talk to the participants.  He may be very much surprised by their response.  They are contributing to their communities and derive from this a sense of pride and fulfilment.  Before being too negative about this, the Deputy should talk to some of the people involved in the scheme and working under it daily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500007#E00500","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1423131000,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I have talked to them.  If the Minister of State and Minister had listened to my criticism of the Gateway scheme, they would have learned there is no proper training or structure to it.  I have always argued that a model similar to the community employment model should have been used.  It would have allowed somebody to come out the other end with a qualification or achievement that can be put on a CV, rather than requiring him to say he spent two years pulling weeds, filling sandbags or cutting hedges.  The scheme jobs are specifically set up to displace local authority staff.<\/p>  <p>  I have come across two changes, which are welcome if they have been implemented.  I saw a letter from an assistant principal officer in the Department to a council official that indicated a number of changes.  It stated that, in the event that a jobseeker does not wish to participate in Gateway, the Department is committed to finding other suitable activation measures or identifying whether other supports are more appropriate.  Will the Department confirm that this means the threat of the reduction or withdrawal of payment for refusing to participate on Gateway has been lifted?<\/p>  <p>  The second change is one that I had encouraged from the start, which confirms I have not been negative, as the Minister of State has alleged.  The change involves the addition of a voluntary application process.  If this applies, can it be extended to the T&uacute;s programme.  I also have problems with this programme but I have not been totally negative because of its benefits, sometimes to the community.

This payment, I am happy to say, increased by &euro;5, to &euro;135 per month, with effect from January 2015.

The section also provides for the penalties that apply.<\/p>  <p>  Section 16 provides for determining whether a customs offence is to be tried summarily or on indictment.  The key to this determination is the value of the goods which are the subject of improper import or export.<\/p>  <p>  Section 17 provides for forfeiture of goods which have been illegally imported or attempted to be illegally exported, that is to say, without payment of duty or contrary to a prohibition or restriction.  Any conveyances or any goods which are packed with or used to conceal goods liable to forfeiture will themselves be liable to forfeiture.<\/p>  <p>  Section 18 provides for a notice of seizure to be given to the owner of goods, where the goods are seized by a customs officer.  The section is a restatement and modernisation of existing notice of seizure provisions.<\/p>  <p>  Section 19 provides for a notice of claim to be made by a person who claims that something seized as liable to forfeiture was not so liable.  The section is a restatement and modernisation of existing notice of claim provisions.<\/p>  <p>  Section 20 provides for court proceedings for condemnation of seized goods as forfeited.  The section specifies the appropriate court of jurisdiction for such proceedings and also provides for the course to be followed in such proceedings.<\/p>  <p>  Section 21 provides for the rules for court proceedings in regard to customs offences.<\/p>  <p>  Section 22 covers the question of damages and costs in civil or criminal cases where judgment is given against a Revenue official as the defendant on account of the seizing or detention of any thing.  No change of substance is involved.<\/p>  <p>  Section 23 provides for presumptions and onus of proof in proceedings under the Customs Acts, that is to say, where certain things may be presumed to be true until the contrary is proven.  The section represents no change to the current law.<\/p>  <p>  Section 24 provides that a person may be liable to other penalties in respect of the same offence under either customs legislation or other legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Sections 25 to 35 deal with customs powers.  Section 25 provides for powers to enter, inspect and patrol certain places for a customs officer, and any person assisting a customs officer, without a court warrant.  The power to patrol in this way along the coast and the land frontier, and in customs ports and airports and other approved places, is an essential control mechanism to combat smuggling.<\/p>  <p>  Section 26 provides for powers to stop vessels, aircraft, vehicles and other means of transport in different circumstances.  The possibility of stopping conveyances in this way is an essential control requirement to ensure compliance with the customs Acts and to prevent smuggling.<\/p>  <p>  Section 27 provides for powers to board and search conveyances that are entering or leaving the State, as well as away from ports and airports and the land frontier.<\/p>  <p>  Section 28 provides for the power to examine goods under customs control.  Examination of declared goods is a standard part of customs controls and a clear requirement under Community customs rules.<\/p>  <p>  Section 29 provides powers to a customs officer, and any person assisting the officer, to enter and search a specified premises or land under a search warrant issued by a judge of the District Court, and to seize and detain anything found in the course of the search which might be required as evidence in proceedings for an offence under the Customs Acts or any other enactment.<\/p>  <p>  Section 30 provides for the search of persons in certain circumstances.  This power is a necessary control provision in regard to smuggling.  The section provides for several safeguards in regard to the search of the person.<\/p>  <p>  Section 31 provides for the power to stop and question a person entering or leaving the State as regards their journey and their baggage and, if necessary, to search their baggage.  Stopping and questioning persons entering or leaving the State, and examining their baggage where appropriate, are essential powers to prevent smuggling.<\/p>  <p>  Section 32 provides for the power to arrest without warrant a person who a customs officer suspects is committing, or has committed, an offence under section 14 or section 15 of the Bill, or where the person has obstructed or assaulted a customs officer.<\/p>  <p>  Section 33 provides for the power to detain goods and conveyances being imported or exported, pending the outcome of inquiries and investigations into whether the goods in question are in compliance with the Customs Acts.<\/p>  <p>  Section 34 provides for the power to seize any goods and conveyances that are liable to forfeiture under the Customs Acts.<\/p>  <p>  Section 35 provides for the power to deal with seizures, whether before or after the goods have been condemned by the courts.<\/p>  <p>  Sections 36 to 39 of the Bill deal with general customs administrative matters.  Most of the sections are standard provisions in legislation relating to the Revenue Commissioners.  Section 36 provides that the duties of customs are under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners.  It also confirms that the Commissioners are the customs authority for the purpose of the Community Customs Code.<\/p>  <p>  Section 37 provides that the Revenue Commissioners may authorise customs officers to carry out various functions deemed necessary by the Commissioners.<\/p>  <p>  Section 38 provides for the delegation of certain powers, functions or duties by the Revenue Commissioners to an officer of the Commissioners.<\/p>  <p>  Section 39 provides for the making of regulations by the Revenue Commissioners for the purposes of giving effect to the Customs Act and of giving full effect to the Community Customs Code.  The section also provides that the Minister for Finance may make regulations specifying the customs controls to apply in regard to the import or export of any goods by land.  The section makes it an offence to contravene any provision of any regulation made under the section and provides for the penalty that applies.<\/p>  <p>  Sections 40 to 42 of the Bill deal with EU and international customs obligations.  Section 40 provides for a system of penalties for contravention of certain customs rules and procedures.  These penalties were first introduced in 2011 to ensure uniform application of the EU customs rules.  The opportunity is now being taken to broaden the application of such penalties to all areas of customs legislation, as the existing regime of monetary penalties had become hopelessly outdated with the passing of time and had, as a result, fallen into disuse as an effective tool for ensuring compliance with customs requirements.<\/p>  <p>  Section 41 provides for the continuation of the force of law in respect of the Naples II Convention, which governs mutual assistance between EU customs authorities in regard to criminal matters.  The Naples II Convention was originally given the force of law by the Customs and Excise (Mutual Assistance) Act 2001.<\/p>  <p>  The section also provides for the application by Ireland of the 2009 EU Council decision on the use of information technology for customs purposes.  This decision establishes a joint computerised information system for customs to assist in preventing, investigating and prosecuting serious contraventions of national laws by making information available more rapidly, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the co-operation and control procedures of the customs administrations of the member states.  This EU decision replaces an earlier EU convention, which was originally given the force of law in the Customs and Excise (Mutual Assistance) Act 2001.  The 2001 Act is among those being repealed by the Customs Bill.<\/p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p> Section 42 provides for the ratification by Ireland of the EU Council convention of 10 May 2009 on centralised customs clearance, concerning the allocation of national collection costs when customs duties are made available to the EU budget.  The convention covers the situation where the customs duty is collected in one member state but the goods are physically imported into another member state.  This arrangement has only been introduced relatively recently, as a trade facilitation measure.  In such circumstances, both member states incur costs but only one member state has collected the customs duty.  The convention provides for the sharing by the two member states, on a 50:50 basis, of the collection fee.  As it happens, Ireland is currently a net beneficiary under these sharing arrangements and Deputies might like to note that the benefit of centralised clearance to Ireland will be in the region of &euro;20 million for the full year 2014.<\/p> <p> Sections 43 to 48 of the Bill provide for the appeal procedures in regard to customs decisions and assessments of customs duty.  As I stated earlier, these sections are a restatement of the existing legislation.  Section 49 of the Bill deals with prohibited or restricted goods.  The section is, in effect, a restatement and modernisation of existing legislation concerning the application of the Customs Acts to prohibited or restricted goods being imported into, or exported from, the State.  At this stage, a number of matters are under consideration in the Bill that I may bring forward on Committee Stage.  I will, of course, also give consideration to any constructive suggestions put forward by Deputies during our debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500011#J00300","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423134000,"counter":187,"content":"<p>On behalf of my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  It is primarily a technical Bill, but it gives us a chance to discuss the issues and pay tribute to the work of the Customs and Excise service.<\/p>  <p>  Any legislation dating back to 1876 is probably in need of review.  However, what has been constant since then has been the dedication and courage of the members of the service around the country in doing their job, often in very difficult circumstances.  These officers do not receive the attention other branches of the services do.  We never see a drama series about customs or any fly on the wall documentaries.  However, that is not to say the officers are not doing a fantastic job.  We support this legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the challenges facing the service were never envisaged in 1876 or even in the most recent legislation, particularly in regard to what is covered by section 42 - customs duty collected in one state on goods imported into another.  I expect we will see significant growth in this area in coming years.  The Minister is aware there is a difficulty currently in regard to online purchases which are not subject to the sales tax or VAT a person buying goods in a shop must pay.  This makes for an uneven playing pitch for retailers and we end with a situation where the traditional bricks and mortar retailers operate versus those online and those outside the jurisdiction.  Is there some potential to level that playing pitch in section 42?<\/p>  <p>  The issue of customs duties and fuel presents a particular challenge.  I wish to pay tribute to Customs and Excise, the Garda, the relevant local authorities and the Minister's officials in regard to the progress made on the issue of diesel laundering in the past few months.  However, the progress on diesel laundering puts into stark contrast the lack of progress, a kind of \"do not know where to go\" response, on the issue of petrol stretching.  I wish to acknowledge the work the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, has done on this.  However, there is enormous frustration, particularly across my constituency where hundreds of people have been affected, that the response of the State on petrol stretching has not led anywhere and has not provided any answers.<\/p>  <p>  I know this is a difficult issue to tackle, but the people affected are ordinary people who went about their business and filled their cars with petrol from legitimate retailers and as a result of that basic transaction, their engines were damaged.  Sometimes two or three cars belonging to one family were affected.  In most cases, insurance companies have paid out for repairs, but this has affected \"no claims\" bonuses and many bonuses were lost, leaving people hundreds of euro out of pocket.  In the case of those with only third party insurance, the damage was not covered and people are thousands of euro out of pocket.  When people report the issue to the Garda, garda&iacute; say it is being investigated and Customs and Excise says the same.  However, there is no sense that they are anywhere near getting to the bottom of the issue, which is a frustration for everybody.<\/p>  <p>  I understand it is difficult to investigate this issue because the damage was done long before its effect was seen in cars.  However, when consumers pay fuel duty - almost 60% on petrol - and pay a levy on their insurance policy towards Government protection, they expect that when something beyond their control happens, there will be some sort of compensation.  While I acknowledge the significant work that has been done by the Minister of State, will the Minister ensure that the Department examines this issue?  These people were innocent victims of something which I now believe was not criminal.  Somebody messed up somewhere along the line and hundreds of families have been affected.  Some families in rural areas have two cars off the road and public transport is not an option.  I ask for particular attention to be given to this.  In the context of diesel laundering, we have seen success can be achieved and in the past number of months have noticed an increase in the level of detection.  In County Monaghan, a plant laundering 20 million litres a year was uncovered.  This took years of work, surveillance activity, investigation work and other work we are not even aware of.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has stated previously that there are approximately 2,000 staff in Revenue involved in enforcement activities.  We need to ensure they are up to date with all the technology available and that they have the capability and access to modern technology on a par with the people and organisations they are tracking.  We must ensure Revenue and Customs and Excise are one step ahead of those involved in diesel or fuel laundering or in illegal cigarette sales for the purpose of illicit earnings.<\/p>  <p>  When the issue of fines was discussed in the context of the Finance Bill, Deputy Michael McGrath suggested we needed to increase the fines for laundering and smuggling of fuel considerably.  This would send an important signal that we will not tolerate this type of activity within our country and that those caught will pay a heavy price.  I understand it is now considerably more difficult - I cannot say it is impossible - to remove the dye from fuel.  We need to look again at the issue of marked diesel for agricultural and industrial use and at replacing it with a rebate system.  This would further reduce any incentive to buy this cheap fuel.<\/p>  <p>  There is much consideration given to the issue of cigarette smuggling.  EU estimates suggest that the illegal tobacco trade costs the Union &euro;10 billion a year, at a time when national budgets are stretched beyond breaking point.  A report by Northern Ireland's organised crime task force showed that paramilitaries work with international smugglers to import both counterfeit cigarettes and so- called \"illicit whites\".  These are cigarettes made in legitimate factories overseas but then smuggled into the European Union without paying the appropriate duty.  A report by Irish customs shows 76% of seized cigarettes in 2012 were \"illicit whites\", up from 46% in 2011.  This gives us some indication of the size of the problem.<\/p>  <p>  Counterfeit cigarettes are typically manufactured in China and other Asian countries and illegally shipped to Europe.  Apart from the loss of revenue, there are other issues of concern, such as the content and the abnormally high levels of cancer-causing chemicals in them.  I welcome the fact there has been increased co-operation between EU and Chinese customs to cut the scale of this trade.  However, much more needs to be done in terms of building awareness of the content of the cigarettes and educating people on the fact that these cheap cigarettes are dangerous to their health.<\/p>  <p>  More work needs to be done on educating consumers on their rights, particularly in regard to purchasing goods from overseas retailers and the excise duties they face.  I said earlier we need to level the playing pitch.  Many websites do not tell customers the full cost of the goods they are about to buy, particularly the cost when customs duty is added.<\/p><p>As I understand it if the value of the purchase plus shipping from a website outside the EU is &euro;22 or more, then Irish VAT must be paid.  Someone buying goods valued at &euro;150 or more is liable to pay import charges.  That needs to be more widely publicised so that people are aware of the full cost when making purchasing decisions rather than having to hand over more money to the import agent when the gift arrives.<\/p> <p> I welcome the Bill which gives us a chance to discuss the customs service and the very brave work the men and women of that service do every day across this island.  They have been faced with huge challenges over the decades, particularly during the Troubles.  Members of that service have put themselves at risk to serve the State for which they deserve the respect and support of the House.  I welcome the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500012#K00200","speaker":"1071","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423134600,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Fuel smuggling is obviously a great cost to the State in terms of tax that is not paid into Revenue.  It is obviously a great cost to the people who are trying to function along the Border, maintaining the law and ensuring they are selling proper product.  Let us imagine there was a way to stop fuel smuggling.  Let us imagine if fuel taxes on both side of the Border were equal.  Let us imagine if the cost of diesel, petrol or any fuel were the same in south Armagh as it is in north Monaghan.  That would obviously take away the incentive to smuggle and reduce the cost to police smuggling, which would be a further win for the State.<\/p>  <p>  Let us imagine we had a government with the political will to seek to bring the taxation powers governing excise on fuel to the North of Ireland so that on the island of Ireland we could organise it for ourselves.  That would be a sunny day.  That opportunity is in the Government's gift.  Our party has won getting corporation tax powers back to Ireland.  There is no reason that other taxation powers and fiscal powers that are logical could not also be brought back to Ireland North and South.<\/p>  <p>  This is a mainly technical Bill which consolidates much existing legislation related to our customs system.  I say \"our\" customs system but in reality our system is just a cog in a bigger EU customs machine.  While the content of the Bill is described as consolidating and technical I would like to deal with a number of issues that jump out on reading it.<\/p>  <p>  Section 6 deals with customs ports and airports.  I am curious as to whether military aircraft using Shannon Airport, for example, are subject to the provisions of this section.  Sections 10 and 11 also deal with the procedures to do with aircraft landing and leaving, and refer to all aircraft having to comply \"unless otherwise authorised or exempted\".  How does an aircraft receive such an exemption?  The same applies to foreign naval vessels that occasionally visit us.  Under what grounds are they exempt from customs?<\/p>  <p>  The Bill refers to Type I and Type II airports.  Type II airports are subject to extra requirements.  Is there a list of which airports are Type I and which are Type II?  How many aircraft or vessels are known to have landed without the knowledge of Customs and Excise in 2014 and previous years?<\/p>  <p>  The accompanying memorandum points to two new subsections.  The first in section 17 allows for goods under official control to be forfeited if customs duty is not paid.  The new subsection in section 33 allows for the detaining of goods which the Garda or other relevant authority believe may be required as evidence.  The goods can be held \"for such period of time as may be required to determine if they are so required as evidence\".  I am not convinced the wording here is sufficient to prevent a possible abuse of this section to detain goods for long periods of time under the pretence that they might one day be used as evidence.<\/p>  <p>  Last year the Revenue Commissioners sold &euro;213,385 worth of seized goods.  That is not an insignificant amount.  Is that money kept by Revenue or channelled to charitable organisations or some other worthy cause?<\/p>  <p>  Section 22 is worthy of some scrutiny.  It seems to give immunity from any sort of legal recourse to anybody hurt or who has property damaged by officers carrying out a seizure or detention.  I ask the Minister to clarify the meaning of that section.<\/p>  <p>  Sections 44 to 46 suffer from what is a common flaw in some legislation.  Appeals are effectively dealt with in house through the appeals commissioner appointed by the Minister.  I note the legislative programme has a Bill which will presumably bring about some change to this system.  In the meantime this legislation only allows an appeal to the courts and only to the less accessible High Court on a point of law.  This is a common mechanism used in consumer protection, for example, and I believe its purpose is sometimes to discourage or simply prohibit by means of cost a legal challenge to how the State operates.  I ask the Minister to outline his thoughts on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  The main purpose of this Bill is to reiterate the State's assent to EU-wide rules on customs through the Naples II convention and the CIS system.  The Customs Information System deals with a huge amount of personal data and clearly it is important that proper data protection systems are in place.  Have any breaches of data occurred since the system came into place?<\/p>  <p>  While an EU-wide approach to customs has some practical advantages it can also have drawbacks.  For example goods labelled as Israeli are given preferential treatment under EU-Israel agreements but they may, in fact, originate in the illegally occupied territories of Palestine.  It seems the procedure in doubtful cases is to confirm the details with the country of origin.  In other words, all Israel has to do is to confirm the goods are not from the illegally occupied territories and there is nothing that can to be done.  The State could ban goods from the settlements on human rights grounds, but it has not tried to do so.  Obviously in recent weeks on the back of a Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members' motion, the Oireachtas gave a promise to recognise the State of Palestine, which is also important in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  More broadly a Customs Union means setting trade rules at an EU level.  The most topical example of this is the proposed transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP.  The TTIP is probably one of the most challenging and dangerous agreements being negotiated and discussed at EU level, most of it behind closed doors and most of it without any information seeping out.  It cedes massive sovereignty from the Irish people to the dispute mechanism, which is completely out of our hands.  It means to a certain extent that private companies can sue the Government regarding policy changes if those policy changes negatively impact on the profitability of those businesses.<\/p>  <p>  The promises for job creation are very dubious.  Those figures do not stand up to scrutiny.  The most damaging element of TTIP is the investor state dispute settlement mechanism, ISDS.  From what we know of this mechanism it is designed to cause damage to states that want to use policy in future to the betterment of its citizens.  For example, the Government's plan to introduce non-branded cigarette packaging has come under scrutiny recently.  The European Commission, the American Chamber of Commerce and a number of organisations have started to focus on this.  It is very dangerous if governments cannot decide policy for fear that private corporations could sue them through the ISDS.<\/p>  <p>  Other issues such as fracking and farming may be threatened with regard to this.  Environmentalists, trade unionists, farmers and many civil society groups have raised huge concerns about what TTIP will actually mean for Ireland and the rest of Europe.<\/p><p>It is important to understand in the context of the customs union.  My party is happy to support the passage of the Bill to Committee Stage where we will examine it in detail and possibly propose some amendments based on the issues I spoke about today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500013#L00200","speaker":"1080","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423135200,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on the Customs Bill 2014.  I welcome the debate and the legislation.  It is important to examine reform and the legislation dealing with customs.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the staff who work in customs and commend them on an excellent job, which is thankless at times.  They are dedicated public servants who sometimes put their lives at risk to serve the public good.  It is important to say that in the debate.  Over 2,000 staff are engaged in activities dedicated to target and confront non-compliance.  The front-line activities include anti-smuggling, anti-evasion, investigation, prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection.  At times this can be a thankless and a dangerous job but they should focus on these issues.  It is important these people get out and deal with it on the front line.  They should focus on the concerns and protection of the citizens of this State.<\/p>  <p>  A number of colleagues referred to the issue of illegal cigarettes.  It is a major industry in the country.  As well as being illegal, we are missing out on a couple of hundred million euro in taxes and revenue.  We must focus on this.  We must stop beating up smokers, which happens a lot.  In recent days, we have started beating up e-smokers.  While 150,000 of them are trying to give up cigarettes, Senators are prancing around trying to make life more difficult for those on e-cigarettes.  This is the kind of nanny-state activity and distraction politics that must always be challenged.  The real issue is illegal cigarettes and trying to get in a few extra bob.  Every day, the Minister for Finance is looking for an extra few bob.  Customs is a strong part of it and we should strongly support its activities.  This is important.<\/p>  <p>  We also have a drugs crisis in the State.  Drugs are being smuggled in and, every now and again, we hear about the shipment being caught.  However, most of them are getting through to many gangs in the city that are causing havoc, wrecking communities and intimidating whole streets.  That is why we should be strong on this issue and vigilant about our coasts.  We are an island nation and our coasts need to be protected and patrolled.  The average customs man or woman on the front line would say that we do not have enough resources.  These people play a major role in trying to protect the citizens of the State.  I raise these issues in the broader context of the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation is positive.  It seeks to consolidate and modernise the national legislation relating to the administration of customs into a single item of legislation.  That is common sense and part of the modernising process.  It is also important to consider the European dimension to customs and, in particular, the EU's customs code.  The current code and its implementing provisions set out the rules for importing and exporting goods and impose legal requirements and obligations on importers and exporters.  In Ireland, customs controls are enforced by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, administering the customs regime for the control of imports and exports and collection of duties and levies on behalf of the EU.  Import duties collected by customs remain an important source of income for the EU.  In 2012, they represented nearly 13% of the EU budget, which amounts to &euro;16.3 billion.  That is a very important figure yet most people have never heard of it.  According to the Revenue Commissioners annual report for 2013, Ireland is fourth in Europe for efficiency of customs administration and fifth in the world.  That is a high ranking, although not as high as the Acting Chairman, Deputy Bernard Durkan, who had the highest speaking time in the D&aacute;il in 2014.  I congratulate him on getting the number one slot.  Many people are not aware of that and I hope the Minister appreciates the importance that we are up there in the premiership.<\/p>  <p>  According to the Revenue Commissioners annual report for 2013, there were 1,170,989 customs declarations in 2013, an increase in 4% over 2012.  With regard to drug seizures, the 2013 figures show 724 seizures of cannabis, amounting to a value of &euro;11.31 million.  There were 116 seizures of cocaine and heroin, amounting to &euro;4.54 million, while there were 5,690 seizures of ecstasy and other drugs, amounting to a value of &euro;4.96 million.  The total number of seizures in 2013 was 6,530 and the value was &euro;20.81 million.  That is a lot of money.  I warned the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Finance that this is the tip of the iceberg.  Many drug shipments are getting through.  The sad reality is that they are destroying our cities and towns.  While we are modernising and making the legislation and the customs service more efficient, we should never take our eye off the ball.  While we are at the top in terms of efficiency, we should be interested in upping our game.<\/p>  <p>  Customs are in a unique position today to be able to facilitate trade and protect the interests of the EU and its citizens.  I focus on our own State, which is very important.  The custom systems can regulate and collect customs and excise duties, check commercial goods, and carry out security and safety checks, which are an important dimension, as well as monitoring to prevent organised crime and terrorism.  I mentioned the drugs issue but there are organised crime elements, particularly in Dublin city, that have moved away from drugs because of the hassle from the drugs squad and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They have moved into illegal cigarettes, where there is more money to be made than in cocaine, cannabis and heroin.  Customs have an important part to play in this.<\/p>  <p>  The powers of seizure and forfeiture of goods have been known to the law and have been used in varied areas of legislation including firearms, drugs, fishing, counterfeiting and the proceeds of crime.  Under the Bill, in addition to fines and imprisonment, goods can be detained, seized and declared forfeit.  Customs officers have powers under Part 4 of the Bill, sections 25 to 35, to assist them in detection, including powers of stop, search, examination and arrest.  This is dealt with in legislation but the important aspect is the safety of the staff.<\/p>  <p>  Customs, at its most basic definition, means taxes on imports and exports.  The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for regulation of the customs system in Ireland.  It is important to focus on the issue.  I welcome the legislation and I will support it because it consolidates all national customs provisions.<\/p><p>It will also modernise the existing legislation.  I am interested in hearing more about the amendments that will be proposed on Committee Stage but, overall, I welcome this Bill and I will be supporting it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500014#M00200","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423135800,"counter":193,"content":"<p>Deputy Finian McGrath is holder of the record for the second highest level of speaking time in the D&aacute;il in 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500015#N00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1423135800,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  When I studied the Bill and its digest this morning, I noted a number of references to EU legislation.  Anything that consolidates legislation is to be welcomed.  The Bill deals with issues under EU legislation, such as free trade and transferring goods with ease, but the reality is that we seem to pick and choose in respect of the EU.  Some goods can be transferred from one country to another without bother but if, for example, one imports a car from the UK one must pay a serious amount of tax.  In the context of Europe and free trade, we hold EU driving licences and speak about open markets across the EU but when we want to import a vehicle, there is a huge gap between the price in Ireland and that in other jurisdictions.  Are we taking out the nice pieces of the dinner for ourselves while leaving behind the pieces we do not like?<\/p>  <p>  I have been involved in efforts to deal with the issue of petrol stretching in recent months.  Customs officials have a wide variety of duties, and I commend them on their efforts.  However, there has been an awful silence in the last few months in regard to petrol stretching.  Numerous families around this country have two cars lying at the side of the house because they cannot afford to fix them.  We levied taxes on the petrol these families purchased from filling stations in various parts of Ireland but they were unlucky in not having comprehensive insurance.  Even people who had comprehensive insurance found they were not covered by the small print of their policies.  The insurance policy may have been cheap but it included clauses that ensured the customer did not get what he or she expected.<\/p>  <p>  This issue is causing havoc.  Deputies from both sides of the House have attended meetings on this issue.  It is like finding a needle in a haystack.  It is a sad reality that we cannot tell whether the fuel contained in a lorry coming from the docks in Dublin is good or bad.  It does not require magic tricks to analysis a sample from each such lorry to identify where the problem lies.  Everybody and nobody in this business is getting the blame.  People are being blamed in the wrong, while others are left with ruined car engines because of petrol stretching.  Revenue has to step up to the mark.  If it takes the money, it has to deliver.  It has taken taxes from these people, who paid them in good faith.  In their hour of need, however, there is silence when it comes to offering a solution.  They are told to go to the filling stations, the suppliers in the docks in Dublin or the insurance companies.  They have gone to everybody but the stark reality is that people are being left high and dry, especially where they have third party insurance.  The Department of Finance should liaise with Customs and Excise to address the problem because it will not be resolved otherwise.  I have had similar issues where kerosene was used in diesel machinery.  The only thing we could do was add engine oil to ensure the pumps did not break for the similar reason that a blown engine would cost &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000 to repair.  People who are already struggling cannot afford such costs.<\/p>  <p>  Last week I read a newspaper report that Ireland was seen as a friendly place to do business.  I was contacted by an individual who had been in business for 30 years.  He told me he was packing up because he got a letter from the bank which blamed an increase in the price it charged for writing cheques from 20 cent to 60 cent on the Government's new centralised system for getting rid of cheque books.  I hope this Bill does not put further costs on business.  Consolidating legislation should be aimed at making us more efficient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500015#N00300","speaker":"1198"},{"type":"speech","time":1423135800,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  This week, a cross-Border raid on properties connected to an organised tobacco smuggling outfit resulted in the seizure of millions of cigarettes and a large quantity of cash.  Some 334,000 branded cigarettes were recovered, with a retail value of &euro;167,000 and potential tax revenue of just over &euro;100,000.  This was a significant result for Customs and Excise, Revenue, the Garda and, ultimately, the Irish taxpayer.  It would not have been possible without strong legislation to back these organisations up.  This is why I welcome the Bill.  Some of our existing legislative provisions date back to 1876 and this Bill will make some of the more outdated provisions redundant.  It is important that we update and consolidate our legislation to reflect these changing times and I commend the Minister for bringing this reforming legislation to the House.  It would be remiss not to commend him also for bringing us back from the point of economic Armageddon.  If events had continued in the way they were looking at one stage, this would be a minor item on our agenda.  We would be in the economic abyss but for the actions of the Minister and the Government.<\/p>  <p>  While the Bill aims to streamline our existing customs legislation into a single entity, it also contains some additional provisions pertaining to forfeiture and the power to detain goods.  These new additions are dealt with in sections 17 and 33, respectively.  Section 17(3) deals with the issue of illegally imported goods and non-payment of duty.  If an individual or business is found to have imported goods without paying the necessary duty, it is standard practice to impound the goods until duty is paid.  There are instances where a liability for duty arises and, under this legislation, such goods will be liable to forfeiture.  The Bill also reinforces the practice of the immediate forfeiture of goods which are deliberately concealed with a view to avoiding payment of duty or because they are prohibited.  These are two welcome additions to existing legislation.  They bring Ireland in line with our European counterparts and will harmonise the definition and the qualification of custom infringements and sanctions across all member states.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that, in advance of the publication of the draft EU directive on the Union legal framework for customs infringements and sanctions, the European Union identified huge discrepancies between customs sanctioning systems amongst member states.  One of the more startling differences was that the nature of sanctions for customs infringement varied widely from state to state.  That is why it is so important to have this legislation in place to unify and consolidate our customs laws with our European neighbours.  I was heartened to hear from Deputy Finian McGrath that we are fourth in Europe for quality and competence of our customs services.  That can be overlooked when we cite dramatic cases but there is always room for improvement.<\/p><p> Sections 25 to 35 of Part 4 address the powers of customs officers and officials.  My constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, which is a Border constituency, has seen a sharp increase in the practice of fuel laundering, petrol stretching and cigarette smuggling around the Border.  Last year, Criminal Assets Bureau officers carried out a total of 25 fuel laundering and cigarette smuggling searches in the Border counties.  They targeted 21 individuals and confiscated assets with a value of &euro;1.7 million.  In Monaghan, customs officials and the Garda located a large fuel laundering plant which had the capacity to launder dyes out of approximately 20 million litres of oil every year.  The dyes found are commonly used to differentiate fuels sold at lower taxes for certain industries, as with green diesel for agriculture.  The estimated cost to the Exchequer in terms of lost taxes was thought to be somewhere in the region of &euro;10.5 million per year, which is a significant sum.  Some of that money would be much better invested to strengthen services and employ the necessary personnel to prevent these offences.<\/p> <p> The impact of this activity on legitimate traders - the ordinary decent retailers who provide local jobs - cannot be overstated.  I met a number of them in more recessionary times and it was heartbreaking to hear their stories.  They were beset with all the difficulties, including lack of demand, that went with the recession and the collapse of construction and were experiencing a double whammy in having to compete with illegal fuel.  It is a very serious matter.  I am pleased with the initiative between the Revenue Commissioners and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs service on the new marker for rebated fuels in both countries.  This is a new dye that will be used in diesel which cannot be laundered.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, has welcomed this on a number of occasions and was very proactive on it.  I remember being one of the facilitators of a meeting a couple of years ago with the Minister and the hauliers from this region.  He heralded at that meeting the prospect of this dye and his commitment to working with the authorities to ensure it was introduced.  I gather that its implementation is imminent and the Minister might comment further on that in responding to this debate.  Its effect will be enormous and its introduction will represent great progress when supplemented by patrols.  To get it done from a chemical and scientific point of view would be great.<\/p> <p> The significant achievements of our customs officials and Garda must be commended.  While they are all good, as is the initiative on the dye, there are still a number of plants working North of the Border which continue to have a negative impact on our economy and citizens.  While there are people who think that purchasing illegal or laundered fuel will save them money, some are unaware of the potential damage they are doing to their vehicle engines.  Some people are very foolhardy.  The same cautions apply to illegal cigarettes, which are often made using inferior tobacco and can have even greater health implications for smokers than genuine brands.  The issue also arises in respect of other illegal drugs crossing the Border.<\/p> <p> Sections 25 and 26 are also very important elements of this legislation.  They provide customs officers with the power to enter, inspect and patrol certain locations and to stop vehicles, aircraft and vessels which they suspect are involved in smuggling activity.  The new provisions outlined in section 33 will mean that customs officials who have reasonable grounds to suspect that goods are being illegally exported or imported have the power to detain said goods pending the outcome of an official enquiry under the terms and conditions of the Customs Act.  The 30-day detention limit, as outlined in section 18, is important and represents a modernisation of the existing notice of claim provisions.  If a customs officer is of the belief that such goods may also be used as evidence in criminal proceedings but fall outside the remit of the Customs Act, he or she will also have the power to detain these goods and hand them over to the Garda.  These aspects can have operational importance in certain instances.<\/p> <p> I welcome the inclusion of this provision in the Bill.  Our customs officers do sterling work in the Border region and it is important to ensure they have the necessary legislative backing and are equipped to deal with issues.  Section 41 in effect repeals the Customs and Excise Act 2001 and ensures that the Naples II Convention, which was designed to improve co-operation between customs officials in various members states, has effect in Ireland.  As such, a central data bank, accessible by each member state, will now be accessible by Irish customs officials.<\/p> <p> Fighting fuel laundering and illegal trading across the Border is one facet of normalising life between North and South.  It is a huge, critical issue to normalise life for law abiding citizens, proper retailers and good employers in the area and to fight off the criminal elements who, as we recently discovered, are also polluting our natural environment with laundered fuel.  These criminals are displacing jobs, revenue and services for our needy people.  That is one crucial dimension to normalising the North-South situation and harmonising life on the two sides of the Border.  The legislation is welcome in that context.  While it is not germane to the legislation, it is important to note that as we deal with this issue we need to get an infrastructural balance between North and South, including proper connectivity of roads and byroads.  Roads should be restored so that people can travel North or South with ease.<\/p> <p> In referring to legitimate traders and the decent people who go about their business trying to earn an honest day's pay with a local filling station employing local people, it merits mention that the fall in the value of the euro against sterling represents a huge economic opportunity for retailers south of the Border to trade into Northern Ireland and the UK.  There is great potential also for Internet trading and legitimate traders.  It is seldom that this happens but it does occasionally.  Now is one of those times, which is all the more reason the legislation is important.  It is important for proper and legitimate trading to eliminate criminality, petrol stretching, diesel laundering, cigarette smuggling and other forms of illicit drug trading.  If we eliminate those and build the infrastructure, we can establish a normal trading relationship North and South.<\/p> <p> People talk in a misty or romantic way at late hours in taverns and inns about the possibility of a united Ireland.  Perhaps they sing songs.  However, one will only create the proper united Ireland to which we all aspire by getting the bricks in the wall in the initial stages.  That means removing the criminality, establishing normal trade along the Border through legitimate businesses with proper employment and revenue accruing to the State, and building the right infrastructure and trading practices.  It is by building those core bricks and putting economic foundations and the rule of law in place that one creates the potential to implement the more grandiose plans.  The superstructures will come later but one must get the small things right first.<\/p> <p> The legislation is important in getting the small things right.  It gives our Revenue services and customs personnel the legislative framework to do their job in a modern and coherent way with other EU states.  It is reforming in that respect and I commend the Minister on it.  With the new and critical initiative on dye in diesel, it provides confidence and hope to the legitimate traders I met a few years ago who were heartbroken at having to lay people off and whose businesses were greatly at risk.<\/p><p>It gives hope to the legitimate hauliers, whom I met and for whom I facilitated a meeting with the Minister some years ago, who could not run a normal haulage business because they were competing with people who used illegal diesel.  Their jobs and families were at risk.  I have a very distinguished colleague and friend, an eminent person in local government and a leading member of the council of the Irish Road Haulage Association, Councillor Peter McVitty.  I make no apology for naming him.  He is a very good, fine community person.  He often told me that his business was seriously challenged by those who did haulage runs at a much more competitive rate using illegal diesel, and who were not doing their patriotic duty.<\/p> <p> I appeal to the Minister, as the economy frees up, to keep the maximum customs enforcement personnel on the Border.  They will pay for themselves over and over again through the smuggling they stop.  I look forward to his response on Second Stage.  I also hope the dye initiative works and that, as the years progress, we can restore normal life on the Border and get back to a sane existence in which people go about their business in an ordinary way and fully take part in society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500015#N00400","speaker":"971","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423137000,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I am glad to contribute to the debate.  It is a good, common sense approach to consolidate the legislation, get rid of the overlapping and make it much clearer so we can all understand it.  Given that the world of 2015 is very different from the world of the 1800s when some of the legislation was put on the Statute Book, it needs updating and clearing up and I welcome it.  In addition, there was no EU in the 1800s, and it is a major consideration today.  While it is valuable and helpful to have customs legislation consolidated so it can be clearly understood and implemented, there remain major challenges, which many Deputies have outlined.  There is still major illegal criminal activity operating inside and outside the State that affects us and causes millions of euro of losses to the country.<\/p>  <p>  I very much compliment the Customs and Excise and the Revenue on their detections and seizures in recent days.  They seized 2 million cigarettes and 12 tonnes of tobacco and the North-South co-operation was very important.  In early January, 7 million cigarettes were seized at Dublin Port.  While these increased detections and seizures are welcome, the worry is that this might be the tip of the iceberg and that much more might be slipping through the net.  The Minister has assured us that whatever resources are needed to take on the criminal gangs are put at the disposal of the Customs and Excise and the Revenue.  People should receive realistic sentences.  Fuel laundering gangs were making up to &euro;15,000 on a tanker of laundered fuel.  Although sentences and fines have increased in recent years, they should be constantly examined because criminals must be hit at every level.  The Government has put new tools at the disposal of the Revenue regarding traceability, such as the monthly return of mineral oil, ROM1, system, which traces fuel back to its source.  However, it does not apply to petrol.  Given that people in the trade, distribution companies and service stations have reported that ROM1 had an impact on diesel laundering, why does it not apply to petrol?<\/p>  <p>  During recent years, an increasing number of fuel laundering operations have been closed down and seizures made.  Some 130 filling stations have been closed down.  Deputies Fitzmaurice and Calleary, among others, raised the major issue of petrol stretching.  The Customs and Excise have assured us that they have enough resources to address it.  However, while it happened last June or July, it has not been nailed down yet.  It is confined to certain areas, namely, my constituency, Mayo, as well as Galway, Roscommon, Meath and Westmeath.  Recently, Insurance Ireland came before the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications and told us 600 cases had been settled with people who had comprehensive insurance.  However, these people have lost their no-claims bonuses.  There are people who have third party insurance and whose cars have been put out of service by this and who have no access to public transport.  Some people have had to buy new cars and if they had already taxed their cars, without the knowledge that they would be taken off the road, they lost the motor tax.<\/p>  <p>  The issue needs to be resolved quickly.  These people went into filling stations and paid for fuel, 57% of which went on taxes and customs duties, and got nothing but devastation, and they are still left hanging on.  While it is not a major national issue, it is a serious issue for those affected.  The other victims of petrol stretching have been the legitimate services stations.  The Irish Petrol Retailers Association has formed a group which guarantees to the public that the fuel they sell is legitimate, and it should be supported.  This week, it will launch in Claremorris, where there are more than 30 filling stations.  A customer who goes into one of these stations will know that the fuel will be legal.  Fuel contamination has put a question mark over every filling station and they must be protected.  I urge the Minister to do whatever can be done to help the people devastated by it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500017#P00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1423137000,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Bill, which will have a positive impact on efforts by Customs and Excise and the Revenue to tackle, among other issues, the smuggling of tobacco related products, narcotics and counterfeit goods into the State.

What is the position on the treatment of these patients?  It has come to my attention in recent weeks that many of these patients have been told they will no longer be able to continue their treatment under their current consultants and that their files have to be returned in order that they can rejoin the ever increasing outpatient waiting lists at their original hospitals.  For example, a young mother, whom I will call Caroline, was referred by her general practitioner in January 2012 to Letterkenny General Hospital for an outpatient appointment with a consultant gynaecologist.  Two years later, in January 2014, she was referred under the HSE outpatient waiting list initiative to a private hospital for that consultant appointment, which she attended in March last year.  The consultant diagnosed her as requiring surgery.  She has been waiting for follow-up treatment since.  Last week she received a letter informing her that, unfortunately, the hospital had been instructed by Letterkenny General Hospital that her treatment could no longer continue there owing to financial constraints.  The hospital returned her file for ongoing treatment to be carried out within the public sector.  The hospital apologised and stated it was completely out of its control.  It stated that if she would like to continue her treatment there, she could do so privately and that it would provide a costing for it.  Three years after her initial referral she is being put back on the waiting list from which she was referred.  There are 1,300 patients in the same situation in Letterkenny General Hospital alone who are unable to have their treatment completed as planned.  They are being put back on an ever increasing waiting list from which they had been removed.  How many patients are in this position nationally?  Will the Government decide to provide the funding required to allow them to complete their treatment, rather than send them back and add them to ever increasing waiting lists in public hospitals?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500018#Q00400","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1423137600,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.

The plan is to build on work under way and will be available in a few weeks time.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has also committed in the 2015 service plan to the publication of a waiting list of consultants and at specialist level and aims to reduce waiting lists by redesigning the processes and the way applications are treated.

Every day families with children and single people continue to present as homeless.  Rising rents, increased repossessions and the lack of social housing are forcing scores of adults and hundreds of children out of their homes.  Following the tragic death of Mr. Jonathan Corrie in December, the Government Press Office went into overdrive in announcing measures which it was stated would stem the crisis.  Today we learn that despite the provision in Dublin of an additional 300 emergency beds, there is still no spare capacity.  Some 1,692 adults were sleeping in emergency accommodation in Dublin on New Year's Eve, the highest number in years.  The problem is now so bad that there is a waiting list for family emergency accommodation in Dublin.  As many as 80 families, with hundreds of children, are waiting to be placed in emergency accommodation, some of whom have been waiting for accommodation for months.  In some cases, they have been forced to squat in homes when their notice to quit expired.  They are being forced to sleep in cars or split up for days, weeks or months, with children being separated from their parents.  They are being forced into low threshold hostels or hotel rooms, which environments are totally unsuited to children.  <\/p>  <p>  Despite all of the Government's high profile announcements, it is failing to stem the flow of families into homelessness.

First, she said the Government would commits to doing more \"should\" additional capacity be required.  Lest she and her colleagues in government are unaware, there is an absolute and urgent need for additional capacity.  As I set out, this is particularly the case in respect of families with children who find themselves homeless.  I have spelled out - I hope the T&aacute;naiste was listening and heard me - the circumstances in which many families find themselves.  In some cases, parents sleep in their car, while their children stay on either side of Dublin city with relatives or friends.  Some families have been in this situation for weeks and others for months.  There is no \"should\" in this equation.  It is an imperative and a must.<\/p>  <p>  Second, there is the T&aacute;naiste's reference to beds.  Of course, there is a need for emergency beds and to address the phenomenon of rough sleeping, but what people need, particularly families, are homes.  This is about houses, permanent accommodation to allow people the certainty and dignity of having a roof over their heads.  Far from being blameless in this scenario, the current crisis is of the Government's own making.  Let us look at its record.  Despite all of the recent announcements, since taking office, the Government has cut funding for social housing by 25%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500019#R01800","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1423138200,"counter":235,"content":"<p>A question, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500019#R01900","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1423138800,"counter":236,"content":"<p>The Government introduced the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act in 2013 which has led to a tenfold increase in the numbers of repossession cases lodged with the courts.

It has failed to invest in appropriate emergency accommodation, especially for families.  That is the Government's record.  No amount of activity or propaganda from the Government's press office can change that.<\/p>  <p>  The families waiting for emergency accommodation, those on the homeless lists and those not on the homeless list but who have to sleep in the box room of their mother&rsquo;s house with their three kids - I am sure we all meet them at our constituency clinics - want to know when the Government will take a hold of these matters and fulfil its responsibilities.

Four years of delays in implementing this have led to significant disappointment in Wexford.  As the T&aacute;naiste may know, the Health Service Executive, HSE, intended to have such a service operational in Wexford by 2012.  However, we were told this was not achievable due to a legal challenge by private dialysis providers to the tender award for the contracted satellite services in Dublin.  A company called Fresenius Medical Care (Ireland) Limited, part of a &euro;20 billion corporation, secured an injunction restraining the HSE from awarding the contract to another company, Beacon Medical Group.  The dispute concerned the contract in Dublin but has impacted strongly on Wexford with a two and a half year legal battle and a four-year delay.<\/p>  <p>  Meanwhile, 39 Wexford dialysis patients have to be taxied from Wexford to Waterford three times a week.  When I queried the costs of this with the HSE, it informed me it costs &euro;38,330 a month to taxi the 39 patients back and forth, &euro;460,000 a year.  Worse still is the incalculable cost to the well-being of the dialysis patients affected.  The majority of these patients are in their 60s.  I spoke to one of them recently, a man who is almost 80.  He spends 400 hours a year, that is 50 eight-hour days, just travelling in a minibus from his home in Wexford to Waterford Regional Hospital for dialysis.  His daughter Bernie told me her dad is collected at 10.30 in the morning, home usually at 7 p.m. with a five-hour dialysis session in between, Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  This journey in a minibus in the cold and wet is tough for any individual.  For many of Wexford's elderly, it amounts to abuse.<\/p>  <p>  As the promised Wexford service was private rather than public, it has been held up by this injunction.  There is something seriously wrong with the idea that a private company's action in court can have such an impact on the provision of a vital health service in Wexford.

The general principle is to develop the network of dialysis facilities around the country so as to be as close to the patient as possible.  I agree with Deputy Wallace about the letter he received from the patient's daughter.  For somebody requiring dialysis, it is very difficult to end up travelling a long distance over a long day to get essential treatment.<\/p> <p> Regarding the provision of services in Wexford, my colleague, Deputy Howlin informs me that there has been an enormous focus on investment in services in Wexford.  This is clearly a service which requires further development.  Some years ago, when the service in Waterford was developed for much of the south east, it was considered very significant progress.  I recognise that it would be much easier for people if that service was available locally in Wexford.

Nor do I know whether or not it is a PPP - it may well be.  I broadly agree with what Deputy Wallace is saying.  If it is possible to borrow much more efficiently and cheaply on the international markets - as we have done this week - and also to roll over a &euro;9 billion portion of our previous IMF debt and re-borrow it at a much cheaper price - as we did before Christmas - that is certainly the way to grow national capacity in order to have the money for all the capital investments we require.  <\/p>  <p>  There may, however, be a role for PPPs.  The Deputy is probably aware that Ireland has developed a very good model of bundling school and third-level education projects together.  An agency like the European Investment Bank would not give us the &euro;8 million or &euro;20 million required for a small or medium-sized school but if we take a whole bundle of schools together we can get very advantageous rates, although not quite as cheap as what we borrowed this week.  The Government has been using that mechanism widely.  There are a number of different mechanisms.  <\/p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Wallace that it depends on the terms, rates and conditions, but I do not want to comment on the specific case.

Even the period of two years prescribed in our amendment will not be adequate in some instances.  Perhaps we should consider writing into the legislation a series of special circumstances for which the deadline could be extended beyond two years.  The current proposal is to extend the deadline to two years for cases that involve the circumstances outlined by Deputy Wallace.<\/p>  <p>  We have encountered many cases involving people who did not realise the role garda&iacute; had played in events that impacted on their lives.  The role of garda&iacute; may only come to light more than two years after a tragedy, for example.  In such circumstances, a person who takes a case to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission will be told it is too late to have a complaint investigated.<\/p>  <p>  We are discussing an oversight body or complaints board for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This week, I dealt with a case involving a couple of individuals in Galway who were involved in a property deal in Romania with two garda&iacute;.  According to the individuals in question, the garda&iacute; in question embezzled funds of approximately &euro;500,000.  They reported the crime to the immediate superior of the garda&iacute;, the then Chief Superintendent &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in who has since been promoted to the position of acting Deputy Commissioner.  In correspondence sent to the then chief superintendent they highlighted their allegation that garda&iacute; had been involved in what was effectively a case of embezzlement, which is a very serious crime.  They had information to show that Garda fax machines were used in certain transactions.  The chief superintendent indicated the complaint would be investigated but was subsequently moved to another area.  When another chief superintendent was appointed, the individuals in question chased up the case but did not get anywhere.  Having given the Garda the option of investigating the matter internally, the individuals found that their complaint was not listened to and they made a complaint to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  GSOC decided it could not deal with the case because it was four years old, which is not good enough.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the cases that come to our attention are heartbreaking and involve people who are desperately seeking an acknowledgement of a wrong that has been done to them.  Time limits should not apply in such scenarios.  We must be flexible and show an understanding that some people are knocked back by an event to such an extent that they cannot take a complaint immediately and need more time.  The one-year time limit is inadequate.  Two years would be a preferable timeframe in the serious circumstances Deputy Wallace outlined.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500024#W00300","speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1423141200,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I draw the attention of Deputies to the fact that they should not name people who are not able to defend themselves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500024#W00400","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1423141200,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I support the amendment.

The amendment fits into the idea of a new beginning in that it would give people more time to submit a complaint to GSOC.  It also has an element of natural justice built into it.

I thank speakers who welcomed this change.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the amendment is to extend the time limit from one year with a proviso that it can be set at two years for complaints about behaviour that would constitute an offence.  I considered the six month limit to be too short and decided to double it to one year to give people who may wish to make a complaint a reasonable period to do so, rather than requiring them to do so immediately after an event occurs. <\/p>  <p>  Section 4 is concerned with the general time limit for making a complaint to GSOC.  A question arises as to what is a reasonable period within which someone must make a complaint.  I decided that doubling the ordinary time limit for making a complaint from six to 12 months was the best approach at this point.  It strikes a good balance in terms of addressing the issues I and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission would have to take into account.  If the period were to be extended by another year, it would give rise to another tier of complaints.  I will explain what I mean by that comment in a moment. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that in extending the time limit from six months to one year, I have not changed section 84(2) of the 2005 Act which permits the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission to extend the time limit in respect of any complaint when it considers there are good reasons for doing so.  GSOC makes completely independent decisions.  If a case is taken outside the time limit, it is not required to refuse to investigate it and may decide the case is sufficiently serious to warrant it taking a decision not to be restricted by the time limit, which is set at one year in the Bill.  Section 84(2) will remain exactly as it is, which means GSOC has flexibility, irrespective of when an incident took place.  The commission makes its decisions independently. <\/p>  <p>  I will make available to Deputies information on the number of cases in which the time limit has been a factor.  I will keep the position under review to ascertain whether the time limit continues to be a matter of concern and the main reason for ruling out cases.  As matters stand, I am increasing the time limit from six months to one year and have left untouched section 84(2), which gives the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission full power to take a case at any point.  In addition, the Minister may refer specific cases to GSOC for examination.  The Bill provides for a workable framework within which complaints against members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies should not endlessly repeat the claim that members of the public do not have confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  The evidence shows that the public is making complaints.  I fully accept that Deputies have encountered cases in which people are not satisfied, have other points to make or believe their case may warrant further investigation.  In many cases, however, the individuals concerned are unhappy with other aspects of the criminal justice system, for example, the outcome of a court case or their experience in respect of a decision made by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  <\/p>  <p>  I expect that it is the goal of every Deputy to ensure we have a truly independent system for investigating complaints, one which is supported in doing its work.  It must also be understood by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that this body must be able to do its work and the Garda must co-operate with it effectively in terms of timeframes and so forth.<\/p><p>I would have thought the goal of everybody in this House is to ensure we have a system in which people have confidence.  GSOC is the body that has to examine complaints and it is evolving all the time.  I want to make it better and I know the Deputies do as well.  Through the initiatives we are taking in this Bill, I believe we are strengthening GSOC and increasing the confidence the public can have in the fact it is an independent body.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500024#W00600","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423141800,"counter":322,"content":"<p>With regard to extending it to two years, this looks as if another layer of bureaucracy is being created but the number of people who would not put in their complaint within one year, and who would do so between one year and two years, would be small.  Our experience in talking to people, and having people come to us, has been that while section 84(2) allows GSOC to look at complaints that go outside the time period, those concerned have not had much success in this area.  Part of the reason for this is that GSOC probably has too much on its plate.  GSOC struggles to do as much as it would like with the resources available to it but it does not have enough staff to deal with all the challenges that face it.  This would be an extra challenge.  When someone makes a complaint that is 18 months old, there will continue to be tendency not to deal with it because of a lack or resources.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of public confidence, I can assure the Minister that despite all rumours to the contrary, we want to improve public confidence in GSOC and the Garda, not the other way around.  However, if public confidence does not improve in time we will feel we have made a great effort in this regard but without a successful outcome.  That is why we are so keen that the legislative changes that come in during the next 12 months are strong.  We want to believe that our time was not wasted and that it was used effectively.  If it turns out that in 12 months time we are still unhappy people might think that we like to give out simply because we get attention for it.  However, if there is an improvement we will feel good that we made some input into it.  It will not all be our doing but it would be good to think we had some input and that we did change things for the better.  I assure the Minister we are working to a point where the public will be able to have greater confidence not just in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but also in GSOC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500025#X00200","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1423141800,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I would be interested to see the figures on the timescale, which would help to inform us.  I believe Deputy Wallace will be shown to be correct that the numbers are relatively small in terms of the difference between one and two years, and I believe it would bring a certain consistency to this.  For example, where somebody was to initiate civil proceedings against An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, there is in many instances a two-year period when they can do so, therefore, I do not see why the GSOC issue would not be similar.  Perhaps one of the positives out of all the recent controversies is the fact there is now a far greater awareness about GSOC.  It is almost a household symbol or abbreviation whereas, even two years ago, no one, including probably half of this House, had heard of it.<\/p>  <p>  While I accept the Minister's point that we should be careful about saying people are not happy about GSOC, I would qualify that by saying that clearly some people are unhappy with it.  Those we have encountered who are involved with GSOC are very talented but it must be said that those who are most unhappy with it are working there.  They feel it has been constituted in a manner which prevents them from carrying our their duty, which is to be an ombudsman commission for the Garda, because of the many problems that have been highlighted over the past two years.<\/p>  <p>  The problem the members of the public have with GSOC concerns what happens after a complaint is made.  We all know it is only in a minority of cases that GSOC would recommend criminal sanction against a garda, so it is proportionately a very small number that gets referred to the DPP.  However, even of that small number, practically nothing is actually actioned by the DPP later on.  That is the source of people's discontent.  When the file in regard to the Kieran Boylan inquiry was sent from GSOC, there was a recommendation to the DPP that criminal prosecutions would take place against garda&iacute;, and the DPP did nothing.  That is why people are aggrieved.<\/p>  <p>  The corollary is that, when we are looking at extending the time, it link in with the issue of retired garda&iacute; being excluded from the legislation, because the longer the timescale, the greater the chances that some people might have retired.  However, it must be borne in mind that they would have been at one stage members of the Garda.  We need to look at that but unfortunately is not covered by the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500025#X00300","speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1423141800,"counter":324,"content":"<p>If there are questions of criminal investigation concerning retired garda&iacute;, clearly, that would continue in regard to those garda&iacute;.  When it comes to disciplinary procedures a different issue arises because if a person is retired that is not relevant.  Clearly, however, if there are issues in regard to a criminal investigation that would be ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  I will give the Deputies as much information as we have in regard to the breakdown of the number of complaints that are excluded because of time.  The point is that those in GSOC are satisfied they can appropriately deal with complaints which go further back than 12 months within the scope of section 84(2).  I would refer the Deputies again to that section, which states that GSOC has discretion in this regard, although the Deputies are asking how much it uses that discretion and whether cases are falling outside the remit of investigation by GSOC which should be included.  Again, that is a critical decision-making area for GSOC.  It has the discretion, if a case goes back more than 12 months, to undertake the investigation.  It is very important to remember that.  The key point might be to ask the question, and to put it in the public arena, as to what are the criteria with regard to the cases that come forward that are beyond the 12 months and which GSOC rejects or accepts.  We will see if we can get more information in that regard as I believe it will inform the debate.<\/p>  <p>  In 2014 some 2,224 people used the services of GSOC, which looked at a whole range of allegations.  For example, the Garda Commissioner, under section 102(1) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, referred 60 cases to GSOC.  The number of fatalities that were investigated arising from referrals to GSOC under section 102 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act was 14 because, of course, those cases are always investigated by GSOC.  Twenty-five files went to the DPP from GSOC last year.  From those statistics, we can see it is a very active body.<\/p>  <p>  There is a 19% increase in GSOC's budget this year.  However, I take the point that, given the demands of the situation and the work it does that is subject to ongoing review.  The extra money was given because it was doing the work on the penalty points.  If it is working on specific areas again, we will continue to examine its budget.<\/p>  <p>  I have regular meetings with GSOC.  It brings issues to my attention and I work on those issues.  In terms of staff being dissatisfied, I would hope that we will try to address any concerns that arise in as satisfactory manner as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500025#X00400","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"vote","time":1423142400,"counter":325,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 39; N\u00edl, 63.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Mick Wallace and Clare Daly; N\u00edl, Deputies Paul Kehoe and Emmet Stagg.<\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500026#Y00100","aye":["1190","1071","1193","1057","1083","1195","1101","1186","1037","1192","1107","1022","1047","1198","1182","1050","1094","960","1188","983","945","962","998","999","1008","1017","981","1183","1197","969","1054","1028","984","1005","1001","953","1102","1080","956"],"nay":["980","1079","989","1029","1030","975","988","1031","972","1041","1093","1087","986","994","968","1075","1007","1011","1103","957","1014","1085","1105","1009","1068","951","1051","995","1106","949","973","1033","1012","1098","1021","1110","1053","982","1023","996","1180","1194","1000","1082","1038","1004","1070","1056","1058","1073","971","1061","1063","1081","964","947","952","1074","1013","1025","961","978","1095"]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1423142700,"counter":326,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 7 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1423142700,"counter":327,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 8, 12 and 21 are related and will be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500027#Z00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1423142700,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 8:<blockquote>In page 3, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/><b>&ldquo;5. <\/b>Section 96(1) of the Principal Act is amended by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (1):<blockquote><blockquote>&ldquo;(1) For the purpose of an investigation under section 95, the Ombudsman Commission&mdash;<blockquote>(a) may require a person who, in its opinion, possesses information or has a document or thing in his or her power or control that is relevant to the investigation, to provide that information, document or thing to the Commission, and<br \/><br \/>(b) where appropriate, may require that person to attend before the Commission for that purpose,<br \/><br \/>(c) may require the Garda Commissioner to provide the Commission with access to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Police Using Leading Systems Effectively (PULSE) computer system, and the person and\/or Garda Commissioner shall, subject to subsection (4), comply with the requirement.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote>As discussed on Committee Stage, the amendment relates to putting access to PULSE on a statutory basis to empower and bolster the independence of GSOC.

I assure them that at this stage it is an aspect of co-operation and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that is being fully catered for operationally.  That is the reality.  There were problems in this area for a variety of reasons and protocols were put in place.  There definitely were difficulties in the past.  The commission has confirmed to my Department that it is satisfied with the level of access to PULSE now being provided.  As part of the processes involved, Garda training has been provided for GSOC personnel.  If they need further training, it will be made accessible by the Garda or elsewhere.  It is better to provide for GSOC access to PULSE within the general framework of co-operation between the Garda and GSOC which is specifically provided for in the 2005 Act.  <\/p>  <p>  From a general principle point of view; there has to be co-operation.  I understand the Deputies are suggesting it should occur lower down in the system and that we should name PULSE.  I think they will understand the difficulties to which giving access to a named information system would give rise.  We are examining the ICT requirements of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and PULSE needs to be developed having regard to crime management.  Other technology is also needed, but PULSE will be changed and developed.  If we were to name particular types of system within the ICT framework, each time it was changed we would need to change the legislation.  I do not think that would be wise.  The Deputies will understand naming a particular system such as this in legislation would give rise to many difficulties from a legislative point of view.  The key point is that I have been assured by GSOC that it has full access to what it needs on PULSE.  That is the operational position.

However, when Bob Olson and his colleagues from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, as part of their substantial report on the crime investigation carried out over three years, they spoke about the inadequacies of PULSE.  They said that ideally they would like to see the replacement of PULSE, which, obviously, a view that would be supported.  We want to see the IT systems of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being improved as we move forward.  That would fit with an upgrade of how it did its business in crime investigation.

It goes back to the debate last night.  The ombudsman in the North of Ireland signs the Official Secrets Act in respect of security issues, has the same powers as the police force, is regarded as the same and has the same access as the police.  I would like GSOC to have real teeth, the same powers, the same obligations and sign the same statutory declarations as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This amounts to full access all the way for it.  The best way to do this would be to enshrine it in legislation, rather than providing for it in protocols.  Protocols mean An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is still in control, even though there are agreements and understandings in place.

While there have, undoubtedly, been some improvements, the problem remains that if it is not specified, in cases in which tensions are high or where a serious matter is being investigated, there is a tendency to cover up.  We need to ensure GSOC will not be hindered in its work.  We cannot just specify PULSE, but often GSOC investigations are delayed by obstreperous and ridiculous objections to requests for information.  In my case, it concerned a request for a list of staff on duty on the night in question.  It took 11 or 12 letters to get the information, with replies being received querying the reason GSOC wanted to know the information.<\/p>  <p>  There is a provision inserting, in section 103A, a legal obligation on the Garda Commissioner to hand over some information, but it only applies to investigations under section 102.

Providing for GSOC to have the power to require someone to pass on information under these sections or to attend in person is important because there have been multiple examples of the GSOC process being delayed by someone not turning up or coming up with excuses.

I took the advice of the Attorney General on the wording of the section.  Without specifying a specific time which would not work effectively in the management of work to be done, this is as strong a provision as I can include.  The statutory obligation to provide information GSOC requires in carrying out its functions is strong.  The information must be given to it.  There is statutory underpinning of the obligation to provide it.  It applies to the PULSE system and nothing in the section excludes information from a particular place.  It also operates in respect of alterations made to it.

There was a commitment to provide the moneys necessary to begin to develop the right ICT infrastructure.  I set up a working group with representatives from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

This provision only allows GSOC to investigate the Garda Commissioner where the Minister consents to such an investigation and only if an offence or serious misconduct is suspected.  These circumstances will rarely, if ever, arise.  There is no strength or independence in this function and it is clear that political protection of the Commission can continue under this structure.  Amendment No. 13 would allow GSOC complete independence in that function by removing the need for ministerial consent.  The amendment also extends the circumstances in which an investigation might include a third group.  Section 102A of the 2005 Act provides that GSOC shall report its conclusions to the Minister but my amendments propose that GSOC shall report to the new Garda authority, which may at its discretion subsequently report the matter to the Minister.  Furthermore, it is only through ongoing monitoring and oversight of the Garda Commissioner's activities and policies by an independent Garda authority that a transformative impact will be made in terms of holding the Garda accountable to citizens. A once-off power for GSOC to investigate the Garda Commissioner with the consent of the Minister, and only on the grounds of a suspected criminal offence, is not sufficient.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is well aware of our feelings on this issue.  The core of the issue for us is the ability of the Government of the day to retain control over policing by restricting GSOC in what it can investigate.  I urge the Minister to rethink this provision.  If one compares the different measures the Government has already introduced with our own policing Bill, there is a stark contrast in the area of real reform.  In light of the strong public appetite for doing things differently, I believe the Minister would have the public's support if she took a stronger position on de-politicising policing.  If we had tried to introduce the reforms proposed in our Bill several years ago, we would have been run out of the place.  In fairness, we were nearly run out of the place when we introduced the Bill in 2013.  We did not get much support, other than from Sinn F&eacute;in Members, who voted for it.  It got more support in its second time in the House in July 2014 because the mood had shifted and the public were becoming aware that all was not well.<\/p>  <p>  I am sure the Minister read Conor Brady's book in her spare time over Christmas.  There is no doubt that the politicisation of policing has caused problems for successive Governments over the past 60 years.  If she has not read the book, I suggest she do so.  The two able officials sitting beside her should also read the book if they have not done so already.  I am sure they make a serious impact on policy implementation.  It is amazing how problematic the politicisation of policing has been over the years.  I appeal to her to give GSOC the opportunity to hold the Garda Commissioner to account.  That would be a serious reform and I would take my hat off to her if she took this step.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500029#BB00300","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1423143600,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Mac Lochlainn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500029#BB00400","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1423143600,"counter":349,"content":"<p>I will wait until we have heard from the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500029#BB00500","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1423143600,"counter":350,"content":"<p>This is the easiest limitation to identify in the Bill.  It probably reflects a decision by the Government to tinker around the edges of Garda reform in the teeth of a massive public outcry on foot of the heroic efforts by a number of Garda whistleblowers, followed by which members of the public began to speak about their own experiences.  These interventions led to a change in mentality both inside and outside of this House.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill as it stands will not deliver the reforms that are necessary to establish a modern police service rather than the old type of police force that was subject to much public discussion.  From the days of the heavy gang, the Kerry babies investigation and the Sallins train robbery through to the Donegal cases and the blue wall of silence in investigations the tendency was to cover up for poor behaviour.  This Bill is supposed to offer a new start in terms of accountability but we need a system which offers the public an effective mechanism for bringing complaints about the activities of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The idea that the Garda Commissioner would be excluded from such a situation is clearly laughable.  However, while it is welcome that the Commissioner is now being included, the provision that it will be subject to the approval of the Minister takes the teeth from the entire process and undermines the strength and independence of GSOC.  The political protection of the Commissioner remains.<\/p><p><i>2 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>It is precisely as Deputy Wallace says.  While GSOC can now investigate the Commissioner, it is only where the Minister consents and in the case of an offence or serious misconduct rather than by way of a facility to analyse ongoing behaviour and breach of duty.  That is why amendment No. 15, which refers to repeated breach of duty, is also important.  It should not only be in the case of a one-off incident and on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>, once-in-a-blue-moon, basis that GSOC can to investigate.  There should be a system to provide for effective monitoring and remedies on an ongoing basis where the Commissioner's behaviour is called to account.<br\/><br\/>The fact that GSOC has now replaced the confidential recipient adds a new dimension to this scenario.  While members of the public may have complaints about individual garda&iacute; or the practices, policies and procedures which can be complained about through the figurehead of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it will sometimes be the case that the personal actions of the Garda Commissioner affect matters.  That is more likely to happen in cases where the complainant is a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The likelihood of a private citizen having a complaint personally against the Garda Commissioner rather than in respect of Garda policies is limited.  However, garda&iacute; themselves are in a position where they are more likely to need that mechanism.  That is why this needs to have more teeth.<br\/><br\/>Public utterances are being made by the new Commissioner welcoming whistleblowers and asking people to speak out against dissent, but within the ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the reality is very different.  This because there are a number of people who used the mechanisms internally and through GSOC to make very serious complaints of Garda misconduct against their peers and, in particular, against senior members of the force.  These serving Garda whistleblowers are living in hell as we speak.  One of them is out sick for a period of nearly ten months and his case is being investigated by GSOC.  It is a very difficult situation for that man and his family.  As he goes about his daily business, he has to face unmarked patrol cars coming to the place he lives where no random cars pass by.  He has a feeling of complete vulnerability and susceptibility to pressure.  The Garda Commissioner overseas appointments, promotions and senior staffing and in many cases these are the people involved in the activity the person is complaining about.  We have to be very mindful of that fact.<br\/><br\/>Some of the matters which have been brought forward for investigation involve very serious matters, including for example, garda&iacute; being involved in the drugs trade, which is of deep concern.  Information on this may have been given to the Commissioner and not acted upon while members of the force are still in their jobs.  These are very worrying matters.  The fact that complaints can be made for a period of nine or ten months without anything being done or any feedback provided is very worrying.  We must remove political protection.  While we will not rehearse what we debated yesterday and over the past few years in terms of the relationship between the former Minister for Justice and Equality and the former Commissioner, it is the reason many of these issues have got public traction.  There was a feeling that the police force was, as the former Commissioner said, his force and not a body that should be accountable to citizens.<br\/><br\/>We must be careful here as a great deal of the activity garda&iacute; are being forced into at the moment is not helping, including the involvement of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the policing of anti-water charges protests or the installation of water meters.  We have been contacted by very senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who feel they are being pressurised by those at the top of the force because of political interference at Government level.  They are being told to send their officers out to act as a private security firm for Irish Water and to go to war against the citizens they are trying to work with in communities on a collective and ongoing basis.  The result of that has been a knock-back of community relations which undermines some excellent work by community garda&iacute; who have been trying to move things on.  It is critically important that any political protection is removed.

After careful consideration and listening to what people had to say on Committee Stage, I said I would take account of the discussions that took place with many of the Deputies present here.

Rather than the decision remaining with one Minister, I deem the issue so serious that it would require a decision by the entire Government.  This is why I have tabled amendments Nos. 14, 16 and 17, under which Government approval would be required before the Minister could consent to the investigation, request that GSOC commence such an investigation or refuse to consent to a proposed investigation by GSOC.  It has been strengthened.  Under amendment No. 17, the original proposal has been further strengthened to ensure that when the Government refuses a request by GSOC to undertake an investigation into the conduct of the Garda Commissioner, it must state reasons.  The decision is not just for the Minister, who might have a relationship with the Garda Commissioner, but the Government, and it would have to be for stated reasons, which is important.  The practical reality is that consent to a proposed investigation would be refused only in exceptional circumstances.  In these circumstances, the Government would have to provide specific reasons.  It is impossible to envisage any circumstances under which, on foot of a demonstrable concern that the Garda Commissioner may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner that would constitute serious misconduct, consent would be withheld.<br\/><br\/>The introduction of the requirement for Government approval of a ministerial decision under section 102B is intended to meet some concerns expressed on Committee Stage that there would be a ministerial veto on a GSOC investigation into the Garda Commissioner.  I hope the Deputies will accept the Government amendments in this spirit and also because of the pivotal national security functions undertaken by the Commissioner.  It would not be appropriate to accept the amendments, which would remove the requirements for ministerial consent.<br\/><br\/>Amendment No. 15, tabled by Deputies Wallace and Clare Daly, seeks to add an additional criterion for which GSOC could initiate an investigation into the Garda Commissioner.  The proposal is that GSOC could investigate the Garda Commissioner if it considers the Commissioner had repeatedly breached his or her duties.  Having examined the amendment, I am satisfied that, were the Commissioner found to have officially breached her duties, the case would be comprehended by proposed section 102B(1)(<i>b<\/i>), which allows for investigation in cases in which the Commissioner behaves in a manner that would &quot;constitute serious misconduct&quot;.  This is a broad concept which extends not just to a specific set of actions but to a course of contact.  The proposed amendment is not necessary.  In addition, I am concerned that the Deputies are focusing on a very particular set of circumstances and given the varied circumstances that could arise, it is not the approach that should be adopted.  I regret that I cannot accept the amendment and I asked the Deputies not to press it.  I have listened to the debate and discussion on Committee Stage and have brought in three amendments which give further protection regarding the points discussed on Committee Stage and which acknowledge the very serious situation outlined.  If GSOC said there had to be an investigation into the Garda Commissioner, the Minister's decision would have to be supported by a Government decision and if the Government refused, there would have to be stated reasons.  This would involve the Cabinet taking its obligations and responsibilities under the Constitution as it should.<br\/><br\/>I do not accept some of the language that has been used, that we are tinkering around the edges of Garda reform.  Very real reform is taking place.  There will be further amendments relating to GSOC under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (policing authority and miscellaneous provisions) Bill, which was intended to deal with a number of issues originally.  The establishment of the Garda authority was one of the main points Deputy Wallace had in his original Bill.  It is moving forward and will be done.  No doubt we will have debates on a number of issues related to it.<br\/><br\/>Some of the points that are being made here on whistleblowing and the cases that have emerged in recent times are about a culture which is and has been changing over time.  While legislation, clearly, has a role to play, so does good management and acceptance of the need for reform.  Far from the way Deputy Coppinger has described it, garda&iacute;, in their provision of a public service and what it has been necessary for them to do regarding protests, have been keeping the peace.  Considerable resources have been involved.  I ask Deputies to reflect on the amendments I have  introduced in response to the Committee Stage debate and I hope they can accept them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500030#CC01000","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423144800,"counter":362,"content":"<p>The Minister said she could not conceive of a situation in which the Minister or Government would not give GSOC permission to investigate where it was perceived that the Garda Commissioner was behaving very poorly.

I too can think of many instances where an offence might be alleged against the Commissioner that needed to be investigated and a Minister would not consent.  Picture the scene - a Garda whistleblower goes to the Minister, says that senior garda&iacute; are involved in, for example, the drugs trade, entrapping people and supplying drugs in a particular area.  The Minister goes to the Commissioner who gives an assurance that there is nothing to see and further wrongdoing is perpetrated afterwards.  When the Commissioner is called to account for her actions she can legitimately say she discussed it with the Minister and the Minister agreed with her.  Suddenly the Minister&rsquo;s interests and the Commissioner&rsquo;s interests are intrinsically linked and a proper independent scrutiny is prohibited because of that ministerial block.<\/p>  <p>  When the heads of this Bill were announced there was a huge welcome for the headline that GSOC would be given the power to investigate the Commissioner, that it would be independent and autonomous.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties and many of the other human rights organisations welcomed the move.  Then we saw the caveat, \"only on our terms\", which gave the matter a different flavour.  This means the Commissioner can be seen as a creature of the Minister.  The political appointment of the new Commissioner does not help that situation.  The Minister has talked about a new regime inside An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and there is certainly a lot of talk about it but those at the top of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are exactly the same as those who were there a year ago under Commissioner Callinan.  There needs to be a more radical change.

If we manage eventually to put in place an independent Garda authority, it will have great potential to make matters better.  It will certainly go a long way towards creating a buffer, about which we have spoken, to deal with an overly close relationship between a Minister and a Garda Commissioner.  At least there will be some light of day in that regard.  Obviously, the structure of the new Garda authority will be paramount and it is important it has a strong element of independence.  If that is achieved, it will go a long way towards addressing public confidence in how this authority is structured.  It will also make serious inroads into how our police force operates, given it has lacked transparency in how it operated in the past.<br\/><br\/>Another issue is that the Garda code of conduct, a large document which will more or less outline how a garda should behave, has not been published yet.  It would be helpful and important in the interests of transparency that it is published soon.  An independent policing authority would have more of an opportunity of holding An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to account on a regular basis.  That is what we want.  It is not good enough that investigations roll on for some time.  What we really need is constant monitoring of how the force works.<br\/><br\/>This would present a serious challenge to the blue wall of silence that is sadly still in place.  It is unfortunate public confidence in the force has dipped so low.  This is mainly due to the indiscipline of many members in the senior ranks of the force.  It has been very unfortunate that rank-and-file garda&iacute; have suffered dramatically due to indiscipline at senior management level.  The Guerin report pointed out that it was striking that censure and discipline in the Bailieborough area only applied to the rank and file when in fact it was management and supervisors who were most at fault for much of the wrongdoings there.  Obviously, we will learn more about this in time once the commission of investigation eventually reports.  There is a feeling that censure and sanctions are confined to the rank and file when in fact the biggest challenges in the force are how the senior ranks operate and how senior members in different divisions seem to be unaccountable.  We have yet to be convinced that the new Garda Commissioner is in control of some of the senior members in the different sections.<br\/><br\/>Another dimension in developing public confidence in the force will be resources.  These are essential to improving how our police force operates.  Over the past several years, we have concentrated mainly on the need to change dramatically the culture in the force.  Resources are a big issue too.  Last week, I received correspondence from one of the new recruits at Templemore Garda College.  Although he was dying to get the job, he expressed serious unrest about the fact his starting salary after graduation will only be &euro;23,171 before any tax is deducted.  He pointed out that in 2010 there was a pay cut of 10% for garda&iacute; with a further 10% cut for new employees.  He stated:<blockquote>To add to this strain, we are the first batch of recruits who will not be receiving the pensionable rent allowance of approximately &euro;4,000 per annum, an allowance that has been in place since the inception of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and one that all members of the service rely on and view as regular pay.  Worth about &euro;77 per week, the loss of this will really mean the difference between paying the rent and buying enough food for the week for new members.  The loss of this allowance is the main issue which we are concerned about.  Having met with the GRA, Garda Representative Association, and having highlighted the issue, we feel little is being done to fight for the restoration of this vital allowance.<br \/><br \/>The situation is simple.  When we leave Templemore for our stations later this year, we will all feel that for our fair day&rsquo;s work, we will not be receiving a fair day&rsquo;s pay.  A starting salary of &euro;23,171 is literally not enough to survive on, especially for many of the recruits who will be sent to Dublin from their home counties and will be faced with higher rents and the need to own a car due to shift work.  By the time food bills and fuel come into the equation, members will be in a very difficult place.<\/blockquote>I am concerned about this.  The garda in question obviously will need a car and will be forced to move from home when he graduates.  Only a small percentage of these new recruits will get to stay at home when they graduate.  The challenge of running a car and paying rent on a salary of &euro;23,171 is a bit scary.  The Government needs to look at this.<\/p><p>Building the morale of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by improving structures, discipline, transparency and accountability should be matched with good working conditions for all garda&iacute;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500034#GG00700","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423146600,"counter":380,"content":"<p>The Minister alluded earlier to the fact that she will be tabling some other amendments to deal with GSOC in the context of the imminent Garda authority legislation.  The UN Human Rights Committee, in its periodic review last summer, made the point that there is an urgent need for Ireland to deal with this issue and strengthen the independence of GSOC while ensuring that the Garda authority marries in with and complements the project.  This batch of amendments seeks to insert the Garda authority into the role of overseeing the Garda Commissioner and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is to remove the ministerial block on some of the investigations and analysis which could go to GSOC, and instead have that power transferred from the Minister to the Garda authority.<\/p>  <p>  Under the forthcoming Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (policing authority and miscellaneous provisions) Bill, the Minister will be proposing to make the Garda Commissioner accountable to the authority in a certain sense, but also to the Minister.  It is unfair to make the Garda Commissioner accountable to the authority without giving the authority sufficient powers to be able to enforce this accountability.  How can the Garda authority hold the Commissioner to account when the Commissioner's position is, in effect, protected by the Minister who appoints her or him?  Although the ultimate sanction of removal exists, the Commissioner can only be removed by the Government.  <\/p>  <p>  The issue we touched on earlier concerning the unique position of the Garda Commissioner as head of policing and head of security is a problem when we look at investigations.  Under the heads of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (policing authority and miscellaneous provisions) Bill, the Minister is the final arbiter on many of these things including a discrepancy on whether an issue should be considered as a policing matter or a security matter.  We believe the Minister would have an interest in these scenarios and it is not a fair way of dealing with it.  A right wing Government such as this one could, for example, view the protest that took place around May Day, the water charges protests or the Shell to sea protests as national security issues rather than policing issues and therefore block investigations.  If the Minister is really talking about transforming the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into a modern police service, the only way that is going to work is to have a very substantial Garda authority which has the power to call the shots.  That Garda authority would have to be the vehicle to feed into GSOC, which would consider any complaints.<\/p>  <p>  That is really what these amendments seek to provide.  We will have to table a considerable number of amendments to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (policing authority and miscellaneous provisions) Bill because based on the heads of Bill, what the Minister is proposing is far from what is necessary.  We will be reverting back to many of the measures proposed by Deputy Wallace when he moved his Bill on the same subject previously.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500035#HH00200","speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1423146600,"counter":381,"content":"<p>There is a very basic problem with the amendments tabled and it will become obvious when I explain it.  I am unable to accept the amendments because the Deputies are trying to give certain responsibilities to the proposed policing authority, a body that has not yet been established.  How could the House agree to assign responsibilities in advance of a body being set up?  That clearly cannot be done; it is not possible from a legislative point of view. <\/p>  <p>  The policing authority has not been set up.  We have the heads of Bill and the Government is committed to setting up an independent policing authority, the obligations and responsibilities of which will be clearly outlined.  The Government also has obligations and responsibilities in these areas.  In establishing the policing authority, we will be defining very carefully the constitutional responsibilities that remain with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  We have stated that we want a policing authority that will have supervisory responsibilities on policing.  The Garda Commissioner will be going before that body and it will have the power to get information and will have to be furnished with various reports.  That will all be in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (policing authority and miscellaneous provisions) Bill, which is being prioritised at present and will be published, I expect, in the current D&aacute;il term.  The work is being done and we will have a discussion about the responsibilities and balances, and the transition that will have to take place in policing, when the Bill is published and the authority gets under way.<\/p>  <p>  It is a major decision to have a policing authority.  A number of countries have done it, as the Deputies know very well.  There are various issues that we will have to tease out and deal with carefully when the time comes.  I cannot anticipate that legislation by accepting the Deputies' amendments.  We cannot assign legislative responsibilities to a body that is not yet established.  I understand the point of principle the Deputies are making, but their timing makes it impossible for me to accept the amendments.  <\/p>  <p>  If the economic situation had not improved as it has - and I accept that it will take some time before everybody feels the benefits of that improvement - without the reduction in employment we have seen and the possibility of a budget with some investment in it, we would not have seen the increased resources that are now going to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is a stark contrast between the resources that were given prior to the last budget and the current situation.  There is a clear commitment to give the Garda the resources to begin recruitment.  <\/p>  <p>  The point about rent allowance was raised yesterday at the justice committee by Deputy Niall Collins.  Those allowances go back to 1926.  The Government made a decision, given the economic situation, and there was overall saving of approximately &euro;450 million.  We are talking about very substantial sums of money.<\/p>  <p>  I was down at Templemore a few days ago and the recruits are very pleased to be there.  There was a huge number of applications and, as the economic situation improves, the Government wants to make the kind of changes that will make a difference in people's pay packets.  We want to make sure that work is worthwhile.  This intention has been clearly laid out by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan and other members of the Government.  It is important to recognise change when it does take place.  One can repeat endlessly that there is no confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but the reality is that people in many situations put their confidence in the Garda.  From an administrative and management point of view, some of the shortcomings have been clearly articulated in the Garda Inspectorate report and they need to be addressed - nobody is denying that.  There are clearly cultural issues which the management has accepted need to change.  We now have the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013, for example, in respect of whistleblowing, which was brought in by this Government.  We have changes in the management of whistleblowers being accepted by the Garda.  Organisations do not change overnight.<\/p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>Many organisations have great difficulty in respect of working with whistleblowers, managing that issue and getting better at managing it.  This is something that has to happen.  Clearly there is a different history in this area but we are in different times now and organisations need to react and deal with the matter appropriately.  The legislation is in place to underpin that.<\/p> <p> People should not endlessly repeat the mantra that there is no confidence and that there has been no change when, in fact, there is change.  Change takes time and it does not occur overnight but numerous initiatives have been put in place indicating a changed approach, including the protected disclosure issue, the changes to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, the further empowerment of GSOC and the Garda authority Bill.  This is real change.  It may not be as much as the Opposition seeks and Deputies may have points to make in that regard.  However, there are constitutional issues as well as the obligations and responsibilities of Government and the Minister for Justice and Equality to take account of when framing the legislation.  That is what we have done and continue to do.  It remains a priority to bring the legislation to the House as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p> It is important to acknowledge the ongoing work done on a daily basis by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in preventing crime, protecting communities and upholding the security of the State.  Deputies know the statistics from Limerick - I imagine Deputy Niall Collins, in particular, is familiar with them - relating to the series of murders and the nature of the Garda resources that had to be put in place there to deal with that situation.  Opposition Deputies know the resources that have gone into upholding security and ensuring that the security of the State is upheld.  Again, I emphasise the importance of acknowledging the work that is being done on an ongoing basis by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as well as the need for change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500035#HH00300","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423147200,"counter":383,"content":"<p>It is unfair for the Minister to try to suggest that we were saying everything was wrong.

This exposes some of the problems.  A comprehensive approach would not deal with it in this way.  Rather, it would start by looking at what we need to have to ensure real policing by consent and real democratic accountability.  That would mean a substantial authority with a large level of input from civil society.<\/p>  <p>  The reason Deputy Wallace mentioned the appalling starting pay for new garda&iacute; is precisely because we fully respect the job that garda&iacute; do.  The level of payment is wholly unacceptable for the people who do that job.  If the Government values them, it should look at that as well.<\/p>  <p>  While it is true to say that some things are beginning to be addressed, there will be a lead-in.  It is not true to suggest everyone agrees the problems with Garda Inspectorate report are real and need to be addressed.  The Commissioner did not agree with it.  She was quick off the mark to say there is no evidence of massaging of the figures and so on.  She promptly disagreed with the report and downplayed its findings.  Likewise, this is the problem with the protected disclosures Bill.  The need for this reform has been highlighted in the public domain precisely as a result of the heroic endeavours of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have spoken up about what has gone on and certain behaviour, in particular the behaviour of those at senior level.<\/p>  <p>  Although there is a mechanism in place, what is the reality on the ground?  One Garda whistleblower has been out of work for ten months at this stage.  Before Christmas, he and his partner had to take an injunction against An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to stop it from holding an internal investigation into a spurious non-complaint, allegedly made by his partner against him.  The man is living with this.  He went to GSOC and the commission took his complaints seriously but he has been left isolated and vulnerable.  He is not on his own.  Others are in the same position in respect of investigations going on for months.<\/p>  <p>  We are trying to improve the situation.  We know certain measures have been put in place but the Government will not improve things if those at the top are the same as they were before.  There needs to be a far more substantial shake-up.  The creation of the Garda authority, and vesting power with it rather than the Minister is part of that process and is critical.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500036#JJ00300","speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1423147200,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I do not have any further comments to make, save to say it is not possible for me to accept in a legislative sense the assignment of responsibilities to a body that does not exist at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500036#JJ00400","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1423147200,"counter":386,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1423147200,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 20:<blockquote>In page 5, line 10, after &ldquo;investigation.&rdquo; to insert the following:<blockquote>&ldquo;If the Garda Authority deems it necessary and in the public interest, the Authority may subsequently report the matter to the Minister.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500036#JJ00600","speaker":"956"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1423147200,"counter":388,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1423147200,"counter":389,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 21:<blockquote>In page 5, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:<br \/><br \/><b>&ldquo;9. <\/b>The Ombudsman Commission may, if the investigation so requires, access the PULSE system.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500036#JJ00900","speaker":"998"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1423147200,"counter":390,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1423147200,"counter":391,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 are alternatives and may be discussed together by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500036#JJ01100","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1423147200,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 22:<blockquote>In page 5, lines 34 and 35, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;section&rdquo; in line 34 down to and including line 35 and substitute the following:<blockquote><blockquote>&ldquo;sections 95, 98, 102 or 106, is so provided within four weeks of the date of receipt of a formal request.<\/blockquote><b>103B. <\/b>An Assistant Garda Commissioner shall ensure that information is to be provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Ombudsman Commission for the purposes of an investigation by the Commission of a complaint, or an investigation by the Commission of any matter under section 102B is so provided within four weeks of the date of receipt of a formal request.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>The insertion of section 103A, as drafted, by the Government is encouraging.  For the first time it establishes a statutory and legal obligation on the Garda Commissioner to provide information to GSOC.  However, this only applies to section 102 investigations.  This amendment broadens the scope to include the standard section 95 and section 98 investigations, which comprise the vast majority of GSOC investigations.  Neither does this obligation apply to section 106 investigations into practice, policy and procedure.  Given that the Commissioner may now be the subject of an investigation, the addition of the proposed section 103B requires that an assistant commissioner be responsible for the provision of information which might incriminate the Commissioner.<br\/><br\/>A more definite timetable than &quot;as soon as practicable&quot; is also necessary to provide clarity and strength, and the above amendment sets a timeframe of four weeks.  The UN Human Rights Committee expressed concern in July 2014 at Ireland's compliance with articles 7 and 10 of the ICCPR, stating that it was concerned about &quot;the ability of [GSOC] to function independently and effectively&quot;, referencing the time taken to complete investigations due to lack of co-operation by the police.<\/p><p> Until now, provision of information was done by way of mutual co-operation or, more recently, by protocol or soft law, which is unenforceable.  As repeatedly recommended by the UN, most recently in the concluding comments by the Human Rights Committee in July 2014, section 106 has been amended in the Government draft to allow GSOC the independence to initiate investigations into the practice, policies and procedures of the Garda.  Prior to this, the Minister's consent was required before GSOC could initiate any such investigation.  Indeed, the last three Ministers have refused permission to investigate the Corrib policing controversies for overtly political reasons.  However, section 106 reports will be made to the Minister, who may or may not redact parts before laying them before the House.  Once the policing authority is established, it would seem more appropriate that GSOC would present these reports to the authority.  This amendment makes that change while allowing the Minister to retain the duty of laying those reports to the House, subject to national security.  However, where there is a dispute between the Minister and the Garda authority over any exclusions from those reports on national security grounds, a right of appeal to the designated judge under section 100 of the 2005 Act is provided for.<\/p> <p> Allowing GSOC to look at the practices, policies and procedures of the Garda is a move in the right direction, but it would be better if it was not in the hands of the Minister to redact as he or she sees fit.  One can imagine if, by chance, in the case of this becoming law, GSOC decided to investigate Corrib.  We have been down to Corrib and I do not understand why several governments have refused to investigate what went on there because it was a national disgrace.  If GSOC should decide to investigate it, and if it is not allowed to publish its investigation results, but must go back to the Government of the day, I would not be very optimistic about the prospect of the Government revealing all that the GSOC investigation threw up.  On that ground alone, the Government veto, for want of a better word, over the GSOC investigation through section 106 should be removed and any investigations that GSOC carries out into the practices, policies and procedures of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be published by GSOC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500036#JJ01200","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423147800,"counter":394,"content":"<p>The Minister implied that we were saying nothing had changed.  We have not said that, but this is a good, or poor, example of how things are half-changing or quarter-changing.  That is the point we are trying to address.  It is very good that, for the first time, section 103 inserts a statutory and legal obligation on the Commissioner to provide information to GSOC.  That is good and we are very happy with it but as Deputy Wallace said, it is only being provided in regard to section 102 inquiries.  It is not being provided in sections 95 and 98, and most of the queries and complaints that come before GSOC come under those criteria, involving the people with whom all the Deputies' paths have crossed.  In such cases, in many instances information has not been passed over in a timely or accurate manner to GSOC and this has inhibited its ability to conduct proper investigations.  That point is even more critical in regard to section 106, on investigations into practices, policies and procedures.  This is a new departure, which was highlighted repeatedly over the years on multiple occasions by the UN human rights bodies and special rapporteurs.  Giving the Government possession of those reports when they come back is not good enough.  It is moving a quarter of the way in the direction we need to go.  That means it is a piecemeal and non-comprehensive approach to what we need to be doing.<\/p>  <p>  I do not think our amendment is in contradiction of Deputy Mac Lochlainn's.  Thirty days versus four weeks is not the problem.  The point we are both trying to get at is that it is very hard to define \"as soon as practicable\".  If members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were being obstreperous or unhelpful in their dealings, relying on what Deputy Wallace called soft law or protocols, that is not enough.  Defining the timescale in some way would be better.

I was chairing the public oversight committee when the Garda Ombudsman Commissioners came before us to speak to their seven- or eight-page summary of the report into the Kieran Boylan affair.  I appreciate that protocols are in place and that levels of co-operation have improved, but what they revealed then was disturbing.  Also disturbing was their decision to publish a seven- or eight-page summary of their findings in the media.  They appeared on RTE's \"Prime Time\" and they appeared before our committee.  According to whatever understandings were in place at that time, documents were to be given within 30 days.  That was the understanding.  In one case, after over four years, one document was never given to them.  I believe that senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na stymied their investigation.  I know it went to the DPP and that there were no charges, but no member of the public can look at the evidence.<\/p>  <p>  The allegations could not have been more serious to the effect that somebody who was charged with possession of &euro;1.3 million worth of drugs and was visiting grief and misery on communities in this State had charges dropped.  It was alleged that he was an informer on behalf of some within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and was being handled off the books, and that other people were being set up.  Some of the senior garda&iacute; who were blocking that information and documentation being given to GSOC were under scrutiny.  That was an example of why the requirement to hand over documentation within 30 days must be on a legislative, statutory footing, rather than some friendly protocol or something that was agreed.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that much has changed and I welcome many of the reforms that are on the way, and that more power is given to the independent policing authority here.  My fear is that the system, even though it uses nice language, always tries to resist real change, real accountability and real equality in relationships.  I would like to have one Garda Ombudsman, but we need a situation where the three Garda Ombudsman Commissioners are absolutely equal in the eyes of the law with the Garda Commissioner and are given the same powers and ability to hold the Garda to account.  The Kieran Boylan affair, was scandalous.  Saying it was scandalous does not even do justice to the appalling lack of co-operation and procrastination, stalling and blockage by senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into a matter the Garda Ombudsman Commissioners themselves felt they needed to investigate.<\/p><p>These actions held back justice.  While I accept that protocols have been introduced in the meantime, we need more than protocols.  We must send a clear message in legislation that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the Garda Commissioner have equal status and must have the powers needed to do their jobs.<\/p> <p> I hope the Minister, having declined to accept previous amendments, will accept this amendment and the timeframe of 30 days.  Anyone following this debate, particularly those who have reflected on the Kieran Boylan affair, will agree that we need something more than protocols and language such as the phrase \"as soon as is practicable\".  A clearly defined deadline is required and there must be serious repercussions when it is not met.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500037#KK00300","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423148400,"counter":397,"content":"<p>We discussed certain elements of this amendment earlier.  We are sending a strong message by imposing on the Garda Commissioner a statutory obligation to provide information.  This is an important step.  As Deputies Mick Wallace and Clare Daly acknowledged, it is right to underpin in law the obligation to make information available.  The purpose of the new section 103A which is being inserted in the Act by section 9 is to place a statutory obligation on the Garda Commissioner to provide for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission any information it needs for the purpose of the investigation of a complaint.  In that regard and to respond to an earlier point, the obligation applies to all sections of the Bill and is not confined in scope.  The statutory obligation to make available information applies to any investigation or matters comprehended by sections 102 and 102B.<\/p>  <p>  A clear issue has been identified.  I cannot comment on the particular case raised by Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn, other than to state a decision was made by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Historically and even in recent years, there has been a problem with the time taken to provide information.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission has made the point that information needs to be provided in as timely a manner as possible and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has accepted this.<\/p>  <p>  As I indicated, GSOC has informed me that the timeframe within which information is provided has changed considerably.  I have undertaken to provide the Deputies opposite with all information available to me on this issue in order that they can see the changes that have taken place in the time the Garda takes to provide information.  This is very important for complainants and others in ensuring investigations can proceed speedily.  <\/p>  <p>  The legislation requires information to be provided for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission as soon as practicable, that is, as soon as it is feasible to do so.  It is inevitable that circumstances will arise in which it may take longer to make information available.  It would be very difficult to adhere to a specific deadline in some circumstances, for example, where a key witness is not available, a large body of documentation is required or a case is highly complex.  However, we have introduced a statutory obligation which the Garda Commissioner must fulfil.  This is an important step.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that the time taken to supply information and material to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission was unacceptable in the past.  The new provision gives the commission the power to be insistent, where necessary, and places an obligation on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to supply the information sought.  Clearly, each side needs to understand the role and obligations of the other side.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important that information required to conduct or complete an investigation is provided as quickly as possible.  As I stated, this is a statutory obligation.  We can monitor the position.  We have introduced changes, including the introduction of protocols on the initiative of the Department as a means of dealing with problems in the information flow between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission. <\/p>  <p>  I indicated on Committee Stage that I would further examine the provision of information for GSOC.  Having done so and following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, I consider the measure provided in the Bill to be appropriate to the circumstances that may arise in investigations.  However, I will keep the matter under review.  I hope the information I provide on the current position on the provision of information will reassure Deputies that timeframes are being adhered to, wherever possible.  Where that is not the case, it is generally the result of the complexity of a case or a particular circumstance such as a key witness not being available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500038#LL00200","speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1423148400,"counter":398,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's statement that the statutory obligation applies to all sections.

It is asking too much of any human being, not to speak of someone who is under pressure, to expect him or her to behave at his or her best at all times.

For example, section 6 of the Bill, will be a welcome tool in the arsenal of customs officials, as it will provide for the appointment of any place in the State as a customs port or airport for the arrival and departure of vessels into and out of the State.  This will ultimately mean greater scrutiny of cargo and personal belongings in areas other than the main airports and shipping ports of this country.<\/p>  <p>  As the House is aware, in recent times there have been reports that obscure beaches and small airfields are open to serious abuse by drug and criminal gangs.  For example, along the large coastline of County Sligo, there have been numerous reports of speedboat activity occurring in the middle of the night along some of the most obscure beaches.  I dread to think what is occurring in these instances.  As I have mentioned on previous occasions, smuggling and related activities are rampant and their effects are apparent in my constituency of Sligo&ndash;Leitrim.  Hopefully, this new Customs Bill will lead to an increase in efforts by Customs and Excise, Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat offences and ultimately result in more criminal convictions, more fines being issued and the removal of illegal and unsafe products from our streets. <\/p>  <p>  I would like to mention briefly the effects the smuggling of tobacco is having on retailers, such as those I met recently from Sligo.  They are calling on us as a Legislature to control the sale of tobacco in this country.   Retailers are governed by our laws on the conditions of the sale of tobacco and therefore must charge &euro;10 per packet for 20 cigarettes.  This is a stark comparison to the fact that today the same quantity of cigarettes can be bought on the streets of Sligo, like many other towns, for just &euro;3 per packet.<\/p><p>I do not need to elaborate here how this activity is affecting their business trade, at a time when revenues are already dwindling.  Three small retailers closed in Sligo town just last week.<\/p> <p> Not one red cent of this &euro;3 will make its way back to the Exchequer, and in fact, it will more than likely be used by criminal organisations to further their criminality and increase their profits in this country and beyond.  Just this week we have seen the extent to which these criminal gangs will go in order to evade both the Irish Customs officials and their counterparts in the United Kingdom.  The massive seizure of over &euro;2 million worth of raw tobacco in a joint raid by Customs and Excise, the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shows the smugglers' intent and capabilities.<\/p> <p> Another area where the Customs Bill will be beneficial is in the State's attempts to tackle the rise in the online purchasing of counterfeit goods from which the State receives no VAT.  This practice is on the rise internationally, and greater co-operation between Irish Customs and our international partners is needed to combat this trend.  A number of retailers in my constituency have informed me that this practice is having a damaging effect on local retailers.<\/p> <p> While I strongly support the contents of the Bill, I believe that fine of just &euro;5,000, listed in a number of sections of this Bill, for a person convicted of an offence under customs law is too lenient and should be examined again.  This fine needs to be higher, as it will not deter people from taking the chance of smuggling illegal or prohibited goods, both into and out of the State at its current level. <\/p> <p> Along with this welcome modernised customs legislation, I also strongly believe the State needs to invest more funding in the resources available to Customs and Excise, in order to help further combat the threat our country faces from smugglers and criminal gangs.<\/p> <p> I have stated before that an agency similar to the Criminal Assist Bureau should be established within Customs and Excise and the Garda solely to tackle the importation and distribution of illegal tobacco products.  There needs to be an intelligence-led strategy with officers seconded to this unit from the Garda and Customs and Excise who will target the importers and distributors throughout the country.  It will cost money but this funding can be obtained through a levy or tax on cigarettes, rather than directly from the Exchequer.  However, it would need a proper budget and mandate to tackle the crime of tobacco smuggling, which is estimated to cost the taxpayer &euro;450 million per year.<\/p> <p> It is clear from the facts that we are not winning the battle with these criminal gangs and smugglers at present.  More financial resources for Customs and Excise and the Garda are needed along with this new legislation.  However, I welcome the legislation and I hope it will be beneficial to their efforts.<\/p> <p> I pay tribute to and commend the work the Irish Customs and Excise service does in protecting our State.  It is often a thankless job and it is important that their hard work and effort is recognised and commended while discussing this new and welcome customs legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500040#NN00300","speaker":"1082","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423149600,"counter":428,"content":"<p>I pick up where Deputy McLoughlin left off.  I thank the Customs and Excise service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for their efforts in protecting our borders commercially.  The Deputy pointed out that they may need more resources.  I know there is a constant demand on Ministers for more resources.  I will make that point later in my contribution.<\/p>  <p>  We are dealing with legislation in the customs area that goes back to 1876, which is a long time ago.  The importation of articles and material into the country has changed considerably in that 140 year period.  I welcome the measures in the legislation which take account of the changes that have taken place in the intervening period, not least the effect of European Union regulation and law in this area.  I know that is part of the Bill we are discussing and the Minister referred to it in his opening comments.  I welcome that the Bill carries forward the existing customs appeals procedures.<\/p>  <p>  Further to Deputy McLoughlin's contribution, my major focus is on the importation of illegal or counterfeit goods and other materials, principally tobacco and fuel.  I am a member of a committee of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly that is investigating mainly fuel laundering and counterfeit importation in general.  We have been presented with pretty strong evidence of such illegal activities that continue in the country.  I appeal to the Minister of State on the issue of counterfeit cigarettes.  I speak as somebody who from time to time socially avails of tobacco.  Some people might say I have a vested interest.  I can assure the House that my vested interest is in protecting people's health and protecting the taxpayer.<\/p>  <p>  Many of these counterfeit cigarettes are of a particularly dangerous quality and standard.  That goes above and beyond the obvious negative health effects smoking has on individuals.  That is one factor to be taken into consideration.  The other is the loss to the Exchequer, which is hard to quantify for sure.  In my part of the world there is considerable anecdotal evidence of significant sales of counterfeit tobacco products.  Representatives of those involved in the legal sale of tobacco have supplied me with evidence of particular activities that go on in some of our port towns and the surrounding hinterland.  They report significant reductions in the sales of tobacco products at times when significant ships come into that port town.  I know it is anecdotal evidence and it is hard to quantify it exactly.  However, all these retail representatives tell me the same story.<\/p>  <p>  Kilkenny is an unusual area in that it is an inland county with two ports - the Port of New Ross and the Port of Waterford.  The Port of New Ross, partly, and the Port of Waterford, wholly, are located in County Kilkenny.  Significant evidence has been presented to me of activities that coincide with the arrival of certain vessels from certain areas into those port facilities and the resultant decline in the sale of legal tobacco products in outlets in the immediate hinterlands of those ports.  It is also obvious that certain individuals, who have no other obvious source of wealth or income, manage to live lifestyles that are incompatible with what their legal income might be determined to be because they are allegedly, at least, involved in these activities.<\/p>  <p>  I know there has been investment in recent years in additional scanning facilities at our ports.  There is at least one mobile scanning unit and there may be others.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify that in his concluding remarks.  More investment is needed in this area because it will have a knock-on beneficial effect for the Exchequer in terms of ensuring that the tobacco products sold here are legal.<\/p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p> In the area of fuel laundering, we are all familiar with people who have suffered as a result of using laundered fuel.  This has happened across country, not least in my constituency.  In the past five years, the proliferation of disused filling stations suddenly springing up and offering fuel at much lower prices than longer established fuel facilities rings alarm bells for most people.  However, we cannot, nor should we, blame the public for shopping around and ensuring they get the best value for money when buying fuel.  Some of the facilities sell illegal product.  It is easy for a backbencher to seek extra resources but in this area it is self-financing.  If extra expenditure is incurred in policing the activity within the economy, the knock-on benefits to the Exchequer in additional revenue from legally produced fuel will finance the venture.  I encourage the Minister of State to ensure the funding is made available.<\/p> <p> I welcome the legislation.  It seems appropriate that a such a consolidation measure comes before the House.  I ask the Minister of State to consider additional resources sought by me and Deputy Tony McLoughlin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500041#OO00200","speaker":"966","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423150200,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to take part in the progressing of the Customs Bill through the House.  As the Minister, Deputy Noonan, said in his opening remarks, most of the current national customs legislation is old and, in the main, consists of a body of pre-Independence legislation - the Customs Consolidation Act 1876 - which has been extensively adapted and amended on many occasions over almost 140 years.  One consequence is that, while the provisions in the 1876 Act are still on the Statute Book, many of them are now either redundant or of doubtful validity.  From a wider perspective, the complicated and overlapping structure of the resulting legislation can, at times, be difficult to follow and to understand.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the new Customs Bill is to consolidate, revise and modernise Ireland's existing national customs legislation.  The Bill will repeal the existing legislation and will provide a single, modern piece of national legislation in substitution.  The new legislation is more in keeping with the developments in trade and in technology over the years and better reflects the current social and political mores.<\/p>  <p>  This legislative approach is at the core of the wider Better Regulation initiative.  It will provide greater clarity and transparency and, in so doing, it will make it much easier to access the national customs legislation.  This, ultimately, has the potential to reduce the administrative burden and red tape often perceived to be involved in complying with customs legislation and requirements.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, referenced the scale and context of the customs operation in modern-day Ireland that necessitated the modernisation of the underlying national legislation.  Approximately 1.1 million customs declarations are made per annum, made up of roughly 600,000 declarations in respect of imports and 550,000 in respect of exports.  Some &euro;270 million in customs duty was collected last year.<\/p>  <p>  A number of Deputies raised the issue of fuel laundering and petrol stretching.  The Revenue offences attaching to these practices and the powers of Revenue officials relating to detection and prosecution of those involved are dealt with in excise law, principally the Finance Acts.  Having said this, significant additional powers have been made available to tackle these issues.  A comprehensive strategy to tackle illegal diesel laundering has been put in place, including the licensing regime for auto fuel traders was strengthened with effect from September 2011 to limit the ability of criminals to get laundered fuel onto the market.  It also includes a new licensing regime for marked fuel traders, introduced in October 2012, which is designed to limit the ability of criminals to source marked fuel for laundering, and new requirements on fuel traders' records of stock movements and fuel deliveries were introduced to ensure data are available to assist in supply chain analysis.  Also, following a significant investment in the required IT systems, a new supply chain reporting regime was introduced from January 2013, which requires all fuel traders to make monthly electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions.  Revenue is using this data to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and patterns of distribution for investigation.  We have introduced intensified targeting, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the Border, of enforcement action against suspected fuel laundering operations.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Joe O'Reilly and others mentioned the introduction of a new marker.  In this regard, following a joint process with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom, a new, more effective fuel marker was identified and will be implemented in the two jurisdictions from the end of March.  This will provide a significant boost in the ongoing fight against illegal laundering.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Calleary referred to the penalties for offences relating to fuel smuggling and laundering and the need to keep them under review.  Such penalties are laid down in the Finance Act 2001 and were increased in the Finance Act 2010 to an amount significantly higher than that which had applied previously.  For example, the fine on conviction for an indictable offence was increased from &euro;12,695 to an amount not exceeding &euro;126,970.  Deputies can be assured that the Minister will keep under review.<\/p>  <p>  A number of Deputies referred to petrol stretching, which involves the illegal addition of kerosene or some other low tax commodity to petrol to defraud the Exchequer and the motorist.  The financial gain for criminals of stretching petrol by the addition of kerosene is quite low in comparison to diesel laundering.  Revenue estimates that petrol stretching will yield a gain of about 5 cent per litre, whereas diesel laundering will yield a gain of about 50 cent a litre.  Revenue is investigating the recent reports concerning petrol stretching and has been in contact with the motor and oil trades.  It has taken samples from a number of filling stations that, it has been claimed, may have been sources of such suspicious fuel and will undertake any further inquiries required as a result of reports or information it receives.  These inquiries will seek to establish if there is evidence that petrol stretching has occurred and whether there is evidence to support a prosecution.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies, including Deputy John Paul Phelan, raised the issue of tobacco smuggling.  Deputies can be assured that combating the illicit trade in tobacco products is, and will continue to be, a high priority for the Revenue Commissioners.  This includes a range of measures to identify and target those engaged in the supply or sale of illicit products.<\/p>  <p>  I take on board the comments of Deputies John Paul Phelan and Tony McLoughlin with regard to resources.  I will relay their views directly to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan. <\/p>  <p>  I thank Deputies for their constructive and thoughtful contributions during the debate.  As the Minister signalled previously, a number of matters are still under consideration for inclusion in the Bill that he may bring forward on Committee Stage and he is looking forward to debating them and some of the other issues raised by Deputies today during the debate on Committee Stage.  The Minister will also give consideration to any constructive suggestions put forward by Deputies so far and during the debate on Committee Stage.  This is an opportunity for Ireland, in modernising and consolidating our customs law, to get it right and we look forward to a constructive engagement with Deputies on all sides.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500042#PP00200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1423150200,"counter":431,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Customs Bill 2014: Referral to Select Committee","time":1423150200,"counter":432,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500042#PP00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1423150200,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select Sub-Committee on Finance pursuant to Standing Order 82A(3)(a) and (6)(a).<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500042#PP00500","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1423150200,"counter":434,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Estimates for Public Services 2015: Message from Select Committee","time":1423150200,"counter":435,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500042#PP00700"},{"type":"speech","time":1423150200,"counter":436,"content":"<p>The Select Sub-Committee on Health has completed its consideration of Vote 38 for the year ending 31 December 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500042#PP00800","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Debate","time":1423150800,"counter":437,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500043#QQ00100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Library Services Funding","time":1423150800,"counter":438,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500043#QQ00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1423150800,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I wish to raise the issue of funding for public libraries.  An article in one of my local newspapers, the <i>Tuam Herald<\/i>, reported that County Galway only spends 20 cent per person on library books.  It spent very little on library books compared to other counties but it has a good track record in providing libraries, with 29 branch libraries in the county alongside a mobile service.  Galway is the second largest county in the country and more than 500,000 people visited branch libraries there last year.  There is great interest in the library service but in light of these disappointing figures, we should be spending more on books.  Last year alone, Tuam library recorded close to 50,000 reader visits and figures obtained by the <i>Tuam Herald <\/i>indicate that more than 80,000 books were lent by the Tuam branch in 2014.  Investment in our library services should be given priority, particularly in light of the importance the Government attaches to literacy and numeracy schemes.  Libraries also play a social role in that people can use their computer and Internet facilities.  Microfilm is also a popular library resource.  I understand that approximately 39,000 members are availing of these services.  I should use this opportunity to note that some people forget to return books.  I am sure the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coffey, would agree that people who borrow books should return them.<br\/><br\/>In the Seanad recently, my colleague, Senator MacSharry, raised the issue of funding cuts in Sligo County Council and the news that Ballymote library is due to close because of these cutbacks.  I am sure similar issues arise in every county, although the Minister of State will be glad to know that Waterford is doing very well in terms of spending per person.  Funding for Waterford is approximately &euro;3.26 per person, compared to 20 cent in Galway.  The average figure for the country is &euro;1.48.  It appears, therefore, that certain areas are not receiving adequate funding.  Galway and Sligo are two such examples.  The question arises of which will be the next library to close if the cutbacks continue.<br\/><br\/>The school library service, which is funded through the Department of Education and Skills, also needs more resources in order to purchase new books.  If it cannot replace its stock of books every so often, younger students will not develop a strong interest in reading.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500043#QQ00300","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1423150800,"counter":440,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Kitt for raising this issue, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, and for providing me with an opportunity to set out the position on funding for the public library services.  I would like to state at the outset my own personal commitment to the library service and to library facilities, which make a real difference to communities across the country by offering them the opportunity to learn, read and enjoy a range of material.<\/p>  <p>  The total local authority budget in respect of libraries in 2014 was &euro;143.4 million and funding allocations in respect of libraries in 2015 will see funding of the same order provided to this valuable service.  In addition to this funding, my own Department directly provided capital grant aid for libraries totalling &euro;1 million and current expenditure of &euro;1.2 million in 2014 to the service.  The capital grant aid allocation for 2015 is &euro;1.5 million, with an allocation of &euro;900,000 for current expenditure.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and the local authorities are committed to the implementation of an ambitious programme for the development of the public library service.  This is demonstrated in the public library strategy, Opportunities for All, which sets out a five year strategy for the future of the public library service in Ireland and provides a framework for the development of the public library service in Ireland from 2013 to 2017.  In line with national and local government policy, the strategy provides innovative measures to manage existing resources more efficiently in order to continue to develop and deliver a library service which meets the information, learning and cultural needs of individuals and communities and, in so doing, contributes to economic recovery and social and cultural improvement.  It also contains a strong commitment to a programme for the development of services to individual users and communities in the public library service which will improve the already high quality of the service.<\/p>  <p>  To further enhance the service, my Department has also requested local authorities to implement new library structures and other provisions recommended in the report, Managing the Delivery of Effective Library Services, in line with Government policy.  The objective is to establish stronger, more effective and efficient public libraries and deliver better library services to local communities and citizens.<\/p><p>A shared structure is essential to allow smaller library services to reach the capacity required to deliver the necessary improvements.  We are continuing to build on the progress achieved in the library service in recent years with the opening of 145 new state-of-the-art libraries throughout the country and a substantial refurbishment programme for existing libraries.  During 2014 seven new or extended libraries opened across a number of local authority areas, including counties Dublin, Limerick, Louth, Longford and Mayo.  In 2015 the Lexicon Library in D&uacute;n Laoghaire has already opened and an additional six new or extended libraries are planned to open, including services in counties Galway, Wicklow, Waterford, Cork and Laois.  It is clear from the ongoing investment that there is a continuing commitment to the public library service.  I look forward to the opening of each of these libraries and the continued development of library services across Ireland in the coming years.  They are of obvious benefit to young and old in communities across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500043#QQ00400","speaker":"1092","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423151400,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I am glad to hear the programme will continue and that Galway is included in the list of new and extended libraries.  We have had some very good developments in the past.  Students, in particular, use libraries, as do retired people and, without wishing to categorise anyone, those who are unemployed and people with disabilities.  There are very good facilities in place.  I repeat, however, the point about school libraries.  It is a different and separately funded service, but it must be promoted in the context of the Government's proposal, with which we all agree, on literacy and numeracy.<\/p>  <p>  The most famous public library of all is perhaps the National Library of Ireland, which magnificent facility and building successive Governments have failed adequately to fund.  The acting director has said there was a cutback in 2014 of 42% on the figure for the previous year, while I note that there has been an increase in visitor numbers of 85% since 2009.  The National Library of Ireland is very important in terms of tourism and for Irish residents and if we have continual cutbacks, the results will be very serious.  Some of the &euro;2 million provided by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, went to the National Library of Ireland, which was only right.<\/p>  <p>  Let us ensure we do not cut back on libraries.  Certainly, we should not cut back on staff numbers.  We are a long way behind our neighbours in Scotland and Wales, in particular, on staffing and I would like to see the investment in libraries continue.

My Department and the local authorities that deliver the service are committed to the implementation of the strategy.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy will agree that a comprehensive, varied, well maintained and up-to-date library collection is at the heart of what the service offers the public.  It is instrumental in supporting literacy, developing life skills and social cohesion and enabling lifelong learning.  Before 2008, many local authorities had achieved a level of spend on library stock of &euro;3.77 <i>per capita<\/i>or were very close to achieving it.  Owing the downturn in the economy and a lack of available funding, it was not possible for local authorities to maintain the book funds at the pre-existing level.  In recognition of the importance of restoring these funding levels, Opportunities for All again sets out a <i>per capita<\/i>stock fund target of &euro;3.77 for each local authority.  Local authorities and my Department are working to achieve this figure.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue.  The library service is an essential and valuable one at the heart of rural and urban communities across the State.  I reiterate the commitment to maintaining the sustainability and viability of the front-line library service and keeping the book stock up to date into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500044#RR00300","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Exemptions","time":1423151400,"counter":444,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500044#RR00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1423151400,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, for being available to take this topic.  <\/p>  <p>  The proposal I am putting forward is related to the new Central Bank decision on mortgage rules.  Clarity is welcome, although I am not sure why it took the bank so long to deliberate or why it went through the process at all.  However, it is good that we now know what its proposals are.  Of course, I am not entirely happy with the outcome, but perhaps I am not meant to be.  It is incredibly unfair on people who are looking to move into their second home which may be their first family home.  They are going to be penalised.  While they may have thought that they had saved enough to buy a home, the figure has now doubled.  The tiering is welcome in terms of the clear distinction between first-time buyers and those who are buying to let.  Using the percentages to address it is a smart move, but the value at which people in Dublin will step from 10% to 20% in the loan-to-value ratio is too low.  Nevertheless, we have a decision and must work with it.  That is why I am putting the following proposal to the Minister of State.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has made its decision on loan-to-value ratios and it is up to us now to act on the supply side.  If we do not, people who are renting in Dublin will find themselves as collateral damage in the moves by the Central Bank and the property market.  We must see how we can help to free up supply.  I appreciate that the Government is working on a number of strategies in relation to building and investment.  Dublin City Council will begin this year the next phase of the Dublin city development plan in which it will be able to look at densities, height ratios and transport infrastructure.  They will all play a part in increasing the supply of housing.  We as legislators and those in the Department, where the skills set is, can also think of ways to use the taxation system to incentivise people to move home by changing their attitudes to the properties in which they live.<\/p>  <p>  There is a great deal of underoccupied housing stock in Dublin.  This issue is being considered in the United Kingdom where it is estimated that 47% of homes in England and Wales are underoccupied.  We have a problem with underoccupation in Ireland also.  The question is what we can do about it.  One measure we could pursue is one that is being promoted by the Mayor of London, Mr. Boris Johnson.  It is the introduction of a capital gains tax exemption or reduction for people over a certain age - perhaps 65 years - who downsize their properties.  It has the potential to free up family homes, of which there is a shortage at suitable prices in Dublin.  We have known about this problem for quite some time.  Where one finds a lack of supply of suitable accommodation at the right price and an underoccuption of dwellings, this proposal has the potential to have a very positive impact.<\/p>  <p>  In Dublin there is a great deal of potential housing stock that is not being used appropriately.  I hear the same anecdotally about other towns.  When one walks through the city and looks above the ground floors of buildings with a retail purpose, one sees boxes against windows.  People are using for storage or other purposes accommodation which could be used much more appropriately for housing.  This all builds into the idea of a cultural change in how we think about renting versus owning and about where we live and why we live there.  I note that this is not for everyone and that it is not about forcing people to do anything.  It is a way to incentivise a change of behaviour and attitude.<\/p>  <p>  I will set out the benefits.  If the seller is over 65 years, having raised his or her children who are living in their own homes, and wants to downsize, a capital gains tax exemption or reduction would have the potential to permit him or her to keep a further one third of the sale price.  It would be a huge incentive to sell, as well as constituting extra protection for someone in his or her old age in addition to his or her pension.  There would be a benefit for the housing stock where it was an underoccupied home.  A person might be selling a four or five bedroom house near local schools and transport which would then be freed up for a family or other users to come in and use it in the best possible way.<\/p><p>It would also have a positive impact on rents and prices in the area, given that it would increase supply.<\/p> <p> A further benefit would be that the resulting increase in demand for apartment spaces would motivate us to examine how we are using the buildings in the city centre and urban villages that are not being used properly above the ground floor.  This is how the benefit would have a wider impact on how we view property across society.  While it might have to be paired with other incentives, such as redevelopment incentives for such properties, this simple tax incentive alone, without having to build anything new, could be a very efficient way of freeing up housing stock for families who need it and ensuring those who want to move are not penalised for doing so because our CGT tax of one third is so excessive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500044#RR00500","speaker":"1034","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423152000,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.  I note his comments on the Central Bank's decisions on mortgages.  The Central Bank is independent and it, not the Government, has decided on these regulations.  The Government accepts them.  During the consultation period, the Central Bank took on the concerns of many people, including first-time buyers.  The deposit required does not jump from 10% to 20% but increases on a sliding scale.  A house priced at &euro;440,000 requires a deposit of approximately 15% and a house must be priced at approximately &euro;1 million to require a deposit of 18%.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of the Local Property Tax, LPT, is part of a broader approach to the taxation of property, which aims to replace some of the revenues from transaction based taxes, which have proved to be an unstable source of Government revenue, with an annual recurring property tax, which international experience has shown to be a stable source of funding.  The Government decided that a liability to the LPT should apply to all owners of residential properties with a limited number of exemptions.  This is consistent with the report of the inter-departmental group on the design of a local property tax, chaired by Dr. Don Thornhill, which concluded that a universal liability should apply to all owners of residential property with a limited number of exemptions.  Even with the limited number of exemptions available under the legislation, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, based on the most recent data available, exemptions have been claimed in respect of some 36,000 properties for the 2014 LPT.  Reliefs and exemptions have costs which must be paid for and their introduction must be considered only where there is a clear economic and social policy need to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  While there is no specific exemption from LPT for those over 65, they may be exempt or eligible for relief from LPT for another reason, or may be entitled to avail of a deferral arrangement under the provisions contained in the legislation.  Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption.  When people downsize their residential properties, assuming they stay in a similar location to the properties they are selling, their LPT liability will, most likely, be less than the amount they were liable for on their original property.<\/p>  <p>  Capital gains tax, CGT, and stamp duties might also be regarded as property related taxes.  A CGT exemption is already available for the sale of a person's principal private residence.  The exemption applies to any gains made on the disposal of an individual's dwelling house together with land occupied up to an area of one acre, excluding the site of the house.  Full CGT relief applies when the period of occupation matches the period of ownership and partial relief applies where the house has not been occupied by the individual for the full period of ownership.  The beneficiary of a gift or inheritance in the form of a residence or dwelling house is exempt from capital acquisitions tax, subject to certain conditions this might be of particular relevance to elderly parents who gift their residence to a child who does not own residence in his or her own right.<\/p>  <p>  While there is no stamp duty exemption in place, a rate of 1% on the purchase of a property would not represent a serious disincentive to a property owner considering trading down.  In the circumstances, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has no plans to introduce an exemption along the lines suggested by the Deputy.  However, I will relay the Deputy's views to the Minister and I might come back to him regarding how we can best deal with supply in the Dublin area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500045#SS00200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1423152000,"counter":448,"content":"<p>Under-occupancy of homes in Dublin must be addressed.  We need to find ways to incentivise people who are living in large homes which they no longer need to trade down and free up the house for a family or a number of people to live in.  Thus we could use the property we have in Dublin and our urban regions in the most efficient way.  While I understand the Minister of State's points regarding LPT, I will not speak on them because I was not thinking of this area.  The significance of a full CGT exemption for a person aged over 65 trading down a house in Dublin would be enormous, representing one third of the sale price.  The money could be of real benefit to such a person in terms of his or her pension and securing a certain standard of living for the future, as well as the other benefits of downsizing, such as lower utility costs.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State referred to acquisitions tax.  Perhaps the Department of Finance could embark upon a bigger piece of work in examining some of our taxes and their thresholds and entry points.  In view of the supply issues in Dublin and the spike in property prices, parents are passing away while living in a home and their children are having to sell the home because they cannot afford to pay the capital acquisitions tax on it.  That is not right, given that they might be renting and want to move into the homes.  It is an unnecessary and unfair pressure, given the time at which the tax is levied, which affects people in all parts of Dublin because of the threshold entry point.  The last review of our taxation system was done in 2009.  I have read parts of it and spoken to people who were involved in the process.  It was written in order to come up with certain results and conclusions.  Now that we are moving to a sustainable taxation model for the economy and we have broadened tax base, there is a good opportunity to reconsider what are appropriate taxes and entry points and, if there are exemptions, what they are and to whom they should apply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500045#SS00300","speaker":"1034"},{"type":"speech","time":1423152000,"counter":449,"content":"<p>The Deputy's point on thresholds and entry points is valid and deserves significant consideration.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, and I debated it in this Chamber during the Finance Bill debate and the Minister is keeping the issue under review.  I will relay the Deputy's views to the Minister.  The Deputy pointed out that there is already an incentive in the form of lower LPT on a smaller property for a person who downsizes as well as reduced running costs and energy costs.  The nub of the issue is supply.  Recently, I saw startling figures regarding the four Dublin local authorities.  They stated that sufficient planning permission has already been granted, with no insurmountable infrastructural deficit, to deliver more than 20,000 housing units in the four Dublin local authority areas while a further 25,000 new homes are considered permissible on existing land zoned for residential use if the landowners and developers wished to seek those permissions.  The challenge for the Government and my colleagues at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, is to unleash the potential.  The Government's Construction 2020 strategy, along with the forthcoming Planning and Development (No. 1) Bill - which has been given priority and which will include revision of the Part 5 social housing obligations and the retrospective application of reduced development contributions - should, hopefully, result in an activation of the land that already has planning permission and is zoned and serviced.  This could deliver up to 20,000 housing units in the four Dublin local authority areas.<\/p>  <p>  Under the LPT legislation, the initial value of a property on 1 May 2013, assuming it was made in good faith, is valid until 31 October 2016.  The next valuation date will be 1 November 2016.  In advance of this, the Minister, Deputy Noonan has said a comprehensive review of the LPT and its impact on the liability due to increasing property prices will be undertaken.  The review is under way, the Department is considering all pertinent matters and the Minister will report back to the Oireachtas well in advance of the next valuation date, 1 November 2016, to try to give certainty on this issue.  Given that it is causing people significant concern, we would like to provide details on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500045#SS00400","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","time":1423152000,"counter":450,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500045#SS00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1423152000,"counter":451,"content":"<p>The issue relates specifically to the MRI scan service at our largest paediatric hospital, Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin.<\/p><p>It has an impressive record of care for children and continues to have that reputation nationally and beyond.

Waiting times for scans for children have continued to climb despite the fact that the hospital, to its credit, has moved to provide a Saturday morning MRI service, for which I praise it.<\/p> <p> Out of every 74 requests the hospital receives for scans only 42 per week are carried out.  We have to find a way to resolve this.  I appreciate that, as staff have said, scans are time consuming.  They can take up to 45 minutes and children under the age of two years require sedation while those under seven have a general anaesthetic.  The service in Crumlin is used for 35 hours a week.  The hospital management has discussed this with the HSE.  Despite the difficult times we are in, improving the health services is not always a question of providing money.  There are customs and practices that deserve to be considered.  It is a matter of improving this service and trying to move away from a situation where some children wait as long as 27 months for a scan.  I hope that, with the cooperation of the Department of Health, the HSE and hospital management, it might be possible to improve the service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500045#SS00600","speaker":"1038","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423152600,"counter":453,"content":"<p>My understanding was that this debate was about medical infrastructure in general.  I am happy, however, to stick to the issue of the MRI in Crumlin, which is the Deputy&rsquo;s major concern.  By sheer coincidence I spent three hours in Crumlin today.  I was there officially to turn the sod on the new hybrid cardiac catheterisation laboratory, Cath Lab, that is under construction but I took the opportunity to visit the intensive care unit, ICU, and the emergency department, to meet with the board, senior management and the senior medical and nursing staff and many others.<\/p>  <p>  One of the issues we discussed was the delay for non-urgent MRIs.  Urgent cases are prioritised.  If an MRI is required in an emergency it is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in Temple Street Children&rsquo;s Hospital which is the neurology centre.  As the hospitals will be merged and brought together on one site they work together very well and patients are taken to Temple Street if they need an urgent MRI out of hours.  The number of MRI scans has gone up from approximately 1,600 a year or two ago to 2,000.  This is not a case of cutbacks but of rising demand.  That is a feature of our health service.  The hospital does do a list every second Saturday to try to deal with the delay.<\/p>  <p>  There are two rate limiting factors.  One, which the Deputy identified, is that the MRI scanner is used for only 37 hours a week.  We would like that to move to an 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. service on weekdays at the very least.  That is provided for in the Haddington Road agreement.  It would require staff, overtime and so on.  The board is working with the hospital group on a solution to extend the hours so more work can be done.<\/p>  <p>  The second rate limiting factor relates to the need for anaesthetists because young children cannot stay still in the tunnel for long, they get very afraid because of the claustrophobic effect and the noise and need to be sedated or anaesthetised.  There is a shortage of anaesthetists in Ireland as in most countries.  It is difficult to recruit them.  The hospital will be advertising for two additional anaesthesiologists very soon.  I hope there will be applicants.

I did not realise we had a shortage of anaesthetists.  I would be curious to know why &ndash; I am sure the Minister has an answer.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s point because the staff say that emergency cases are facilitated and it has a good track record in that area.  By good fortune the Minister had his own discussions this morning with these people.  Developing the Saturday morning service would go a long way to solving the problem.  The National Health Service, NHS, in Britain has many practices that have improved the service including Saturday service.  Some hospitals in Scotland did the same.

They take a long time to train, six years in medical school and another five or six years of higher training.  Health services around the world are competing for senior doctors.  Last week, the HSE, the Department and the Irish Medical Organisation, concluded an agreement on revised salary scales for new entry consultants to make it more attractive for them to take up posts in Ireland, to make sure that the salaries are competitive with those in Australia and England.  I hope that will result in more applications for the 200 or so vacant consultant posts in our health service.

Many of those active in drug prevention and rehabilitation, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other service users believe the number of drug-related deaths is much higher.  The number of deaths in 2012 was 633, which is a slight decrease on the number for the previous year.  Since 2004, there have been 84 drug-related deaths in Tallaght.  The number for 2012 is 14, which is, again, an increase on the figure for the previous year.  Poly-substance abuse, including methadone and heroin, is responsible for the highest number of deaths.<\/p> <p> At a conference on alcohol organised by the Tallaght drugs task force in Rua Red last year Dr. Joe Barry said that in Ireland alcohol is responsible for 88 deaths per month and 1,500 hospital beds being taken up each night.  It is also responsible for 50% of drownings and fire fatalities, one in every ten psychiatric admissions, is the most common date rape drug, and is linked to 50% of suicides.  A response to alcohol issues has been added to the workload of task forces.  However, there have been multiple cuts in the core services of task forces over the past five years, including a 29% cut in the Canals Area; a 25% cut in Ballyfermot; a 37% cut in Dublin North East; a 30% cut in Finglas, a 23% cut in Tallaght; a 35% cut in Blanchardstown and a 24.7% cut in Walkinstown.

Is he aware of the multiple doctors prescribing drugs to addicts and can anything be done about this through the medical council or the Department of Health?  Is the Minister aware of the sale of drugs outside schools and rehabilitation centres?

They have a considerable impact on communities and society as a whole.  It is extremely disturbing that many of those who have died as a result of taking drugs were 40 or younger and that a significant number had coexisting addiction and mental illness problems.  While it is clear that there are no easy solutions to addressing what is a very complex problem, the Government is committed to stepping up the effort to reduce the number of drug-related deaths.<br\/><br\/>The latest annual figures from the national drug-related deaths index show a slight decrease in the number of drug-related deaths from 645 in 2011 to 633 in 2012.  However, the overall trend since records began in 2004 shows an increase of 50% in drug-related deaths.  I agree this is an issue of major concern for Irish society.  In the region of 5,300 people have died during this period and each of those deaths was a tragedy in its own right.<br\/><br\/>While the number of deaths in which heroin or methadone was involved continues to decline, the number of such deaths remains at a high level.  The fact that almost 90% of these deaths involved poly-drug use, with over half not registered on the central treatment list at the time of death, suggests that we need to redouble our efforts to get people registered as people with a drug problem and help them achieve a sustained recovery.  Government policy in relation to tackling the drug problem is set out in the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016.  The strategy is a cross-cutting area of public policy and service delivery.  It reflects the fact that problem drug users have complex needs which may require multiple interventions involving a range of different agencies, including law enforcement and education.<br\/><br\/>An additional &euro;2.1 million was included in the HSE budget for 2015 for a series of measures aimed at encouraging those dependent on drugs to avail of treatment and other supports to reintegrate them into society.  These measures include enhanced provision for residential detoxification, which is more detox beds, and rehabilitation facilities and the mainstreaming of needle exchange facilities outside of the Dublin area.  The budget of local drugs task forces has not been cut in 2015.  I am, unfortunately, not in a position to increase their budgets and acknowledge their increased workloads now that they have responsibility for alcohol too.  <br\/><br\/>I am firmly of the view that many drug-related deaths are avoidable, in particular, those involving heroin or methadone overdoses.  For this reason, I have given the HSE the go ahead to run a naloxone demonstration project, which will commence in the first quarter of 2015.  The project will involve supplying 600 opioid users and their families with an antidote to drug overdoses to help stem the numbers of drug-related deaths.  Naloxone reverses the effects of drugs like heroin, morphine and methadone if someone overdoses.  This project will increase access to naloxone for non-medical staff, such as care workers, family and peers of opioid users.<br\/><br\/>As I mentioned earlier, the Health Research Board report also indicates that over half of those who died from traumatic causes in 2012 had a history of mental illness.  Dealing with the current high levels of suicide and deliberate self-harm is a priority for this Government and my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  My Department and the HSE national office for suicide prevention are close to completing a new strategic framework for suicide prevention for the period 2015-2019.  The Deputy will be aware that under this Government the budget of that office has been doubled.  The framework aims to ensure that pathways of care for persons at risk of suicide or in suicidal crisis can be accessible, acceptable and available.  It will take account of all relevant policies such as A Vision for Change, Healthy Ireland and the National Substance Misuse Strategy<i>, <\/i>as well as the report on drug-related deaths.<br\/><br\/>My Department will shortly commence work on the development of a new national drugs strategy for the period after 2016.

Many of these deaths are probably not be recorded in the national drug-related deaths index.  As such, there is also a problem in regard to how we identify drug-related deaths.<\/p>  <p>  If we are to tackle this issue we first need to know the scale of the problem.  We need to start the conversation in this House about the scale of the problem and how collectively we can address it.  Many communities feel disempowered.  They are certainly dissatisfied that the Government in its wisdom took the decision to do away with the portfolio of the Minister with responsibility for drugs and instead included it within the remit of the Department of Health.  That is not a criticism of the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar.  As I said earlier, address of alcohol-related issues now comes within the remit of the task forces.  Earlier in the week I attended a meeting at which the issue of resources for alcohol-related issues was raised.  I refer again to CAB as a potential cash-cow in this regard.  We know that a huge envelope of money is being spent on drugs.  <\/p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>That is one source of funding that needs to be directly put back into communities.  If there is no funding available, there is certainly a significant amount of money going around from the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB.  This needs to be spent back in communities.<\/p> <p> Will the Minister accept this is the start of a conversation?  Will he accept just five minutes to discuss this issue is not suitable and that we should have a debate in this House on the drugs issue and associated deaths?  We owe it to all those who have died from drugs, many of them personal friends, and ensure another generation will not go down the same road.  The figures are going up rather than down, however, which is a concern for all of us.  The scale of the problem is getting worse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500047#UU00300","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1423153800,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I believe this is an important issue too and it is one that affects my constituency.  I would very much welcome a more detailed debate in the House on this.  That is a good idea.  The Irish drugs-related deaths index is done to the highest standards.  Such standards are not adhered to by many other countries.  This is the major reason for the relatively high figures of drug-related deaths in Ireland.  The index is calculated from four different sources, namely coroners' records, HIPE, the hospital inpatient inquiry system, the central treatment list and the general mortality register.  It is compiled by the Health Research Board, a very well-respected agency and I would not question its numbers unless someone was able to show me better data.<\/p>  <p>  I am very enthusiastic about the naloxone project which I believe will make a big difference.  Access to it will mean overdoses can be reversed quickly which will make an enormous difference.  I know the solution is not treating overdoses and that the solution starts much earlier than that.  However, it would be a considerable achievement if we could significantly reduce the number of deaths as a result of overdoses this year.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of a drugs Minister working across various Departments, such as health, education and justice, would be a matter for the Taoiseach.  It would not be appropriate for me to assume his position on that.  On alcohol, the Deputy will be aware that for the first time in the history of the State we are proceeding with a public health Bill on alcohol which includes a number of far-reaching measures which have been talked about for a long time but have not been implemented.  I am keen to get that legislation through the House before the summer this year.  I would appreciate the co-operation of the parties opposite in getting this legislation through.  While some people claim it does not go far enough, I can assure the Deputy there are plenty of other interests which will try to delay the legislation and obstruct what we are trying to achieve in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500048#VV00200","speaker":"948"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from Select Sub-Committee","time":1423153800,"counter":464,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500048#VV00250"},{"type":"speech","time":1423153800,"counter":465,"content":"<p>The Select Sub-Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport has completed its consideration of the Roads Bill 2014, and has made amendments thereto.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015020500048#VV00300","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1423153800,"counter":466,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 5.05 p.m. until 10 a.m. on Friday, 6 February 2015.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
