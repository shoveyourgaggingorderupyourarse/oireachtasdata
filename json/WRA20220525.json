In 2020, the ESRI estimated that 17.5% of households in Ireland could be at risk of\u00a0energy\u00a0poverty. Lower income households living in inefficient homes are more at risk of\u00a0energy\u00a0poverty\u00a0when\u00a0energy\u00a0prices increase, as the proportion of their income needed to meet their\u00a0energy\u00a0needs increases.The Government has put a range of policies and measures in place to support households who are at risk of\u00a0energy\u00a0poverty.

The Group&rsquo;s interim\u00a0report and recommendations on how best to reduce vehicle emissions in Irish towns and cities was published in March 2021 and is available to access online. The group&rsquo;s final report is currently at an advanced stage of preparation and is expected to be published in the second half of this year.<\/p>  <p>  At a national level, my Department is responsible for the legislative basis and for developing supporting guidelines and policy in regard to traffic matters and to reducing carbon emissions from transport. Under current traffic legislation (S.I. No. 190\/1963 - Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles Regulations, 1963, Section 87(1)(a)) it is illegal to leave a vehicle idling while unattended. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also considering how best to address the threat to health posed by vehicles in the vicinity of schools, including vehicle emissions, as part of a wider approach to improving road safety and sustainability. Action 177 of the current Road Safety Strategy pledges to roll out the existing 'Safe Routes to Schools' programme to in excess of 500 schools by the end of 2024. This programme is specifically designed to reduce car dependence by encouraging children to take active modes of travel to school, facilitated by the provision of safe, protected infrastructure and &lsquo;front of school&rsquo; treatments designed to ensure greater pupil safety. This programme is complemented by Green-Schools Clean Air Week, which took place for a third year from 15&ndash;19 November 2021, and which focused on raising awareness of how active travel can reduce air pollution at the school gate. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has also looked at ways of reducing idling and emissions from high-emitting sectors, such as the heavy-duty vehicle sector, which includes buses, trucks, and coaches. In this sector, engine shut-off systems are available in the market that can be fitted to vehicles (e.g. buses) that engage when vehicles have been left idling for a specified period and that automatically turn off the engines. Most of the PSO bus fleet currently in operation in our cities and towns have these shut-off systems. Additionally, my Department also encourages professional drivers to avoid unnecessary engine idling time through the Road Safety Authority&rsquo;s Certificate of Professional Competence (CPC) training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052500065#WRB02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport","counter":43,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052500065#WRB02400"},{"type":"question","counter":44,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[26625\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052500065#WRB02500","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the estimated cost of eliminating fares for under 18 years of age on public transport; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":45,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport. I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport, nor decisions on fares.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) that\u00a0has the statutory responsibility\u00a0for the regulation of\u00a0fares in relation to public passenger transport services and also has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public transport services by way of public transport services contracts in respect of services that are socially necessary but commercially unviable.\u00a0 The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.\u00a0 The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of public transport services is heavily dependent on passenger fare revenue as it normally contributes about 65% of the operational cost. \u00a0The remaining 35% of cost is covered by the PSO grant and the Department of Social Protection grant under the free travel scheme. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Prior to COVID-19, &euro;287 million of Exchequer funding was provided for PSO services in Budget 2020; however, since 2020, additional funding has been required to continue to address the significant COVID impacts on public transport provision.<\/p>  <p>  In 2022, I secured &euro;538m to support PSO services including over &euro;200m to address COVID expenses (i.e. loss of fare revenue, cleaning costs). Up to &euro;12m will be provided as ongoing support for the licensed bus sector; while, over &euro;15m has also been allocated to support Local Link regular service provision in rural Ireland.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In view of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured\u00a0&euro;25m\u00a0of funding to provide\u00a0for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) which will\u00a0allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average of discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The YAC was launched on PSO services on the 9th of May, with over 1000 applications received by the NTA on launch day alone. The initiative will be broadened to include commercial operators later this year, with the aim to have it in place before the recommencement of third level colleges.\u00a0 This will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector among this age group but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport with associated benefit of transport emission savings.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>In addition, as the Deputy will be aware a 20% average reduction is being introduced on PSO services as part of a suite of Government measures to help combat the rising cost of living. This fare reduction was applied to all services outside the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) from the 11th\u00a0of April and nationwide from the 9th  \u00a0of May. The fare reduction will be in place until the end of the year and &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares, this is in addition to the REV22 allocations.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, and funding has increased in recent years to cater for additional services and growing capacity.\u00a0 Any\u00a0assessment of a proposed change to\u00a0public transport fare structures\u00a0would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, I have forwarded the Deputy's specific question in relation to the estimated cost of eliminating fares for under 18 years of age on public transport, to the\u00a0NTA for direct reply. \u00a0Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052500065#WRB02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electric Vehicles","counter":46,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052500065#WRB02700"},{"type":"question","counter":47,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[26642\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052500065#WRB02800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if   a map is available of publicly accessible electric car charging ports in Cork.","asker":"1453","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":48,"content":"<p>The Deputy\u00a0will be aware that the Government is fully committed to supporting a significant expansion and modernisation of the\u00a0electric\u00a0vehicle\u00a0charging network over the coming years.\u00a0A national charging infrastructure strategy has been published for public consultation which sets out a pathway to stay ahead of demand over the critical period out to 2025.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Directive, there is a statutory requirement for mapping the location and availability of all EV charging infrastructure in the      country.

I am advised by Revenue that a condition for repayment under the scheme is that road transport operators must purchase diesel in this State, either as a bulk purchase delivered to them or, for smaller quantities, by means of a Revenue approved fuel card. <\/p>  <p>  The DRS operates on the basis of a bulk purchase being the purchase of diesel by a qualifying road transport operator, where that diesel is delivered, in a quantity exceeding 2,000 litres, to a premises or place that is under the control of a qualifying road transport operator. \u00a0I am advised by Revenue that bulk purchases of diesel from licensed mineral oil traders can be verified by reference to these traders&rsquo; monthly electronic returns (Return of Mineral Oil Movements-ROM1). Mineral oil traders are required to include details on their ROM1 of sales to commercial customers who receive greater than 2,000 litres per month. The DRS bulk purchase qualifying amount of greater than 2,000 litres is aligned with Revenue&rsquo;s dataset on commercial oil movements enabling verification of purchases and supplies of diesel on which DRS repayment claims are made. <\/p>  <p>  As outlined above, the scheme also allows claims for the purchase of smaller quantities of fuel purchased by means of a Revenue approved fuel card. Fuel card purchases can also be verified by Revenue as fuel card providers must furnish information about diesel purchases made using the relevant fuel cards. The fuel card and bulk purchase requirements for how diesel is to be purchased are necessary for Revenue&rsquo;s administration and risk management of the DRS. Therefore, I have no plan to change these arrangements.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052500065#WRB05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":76,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052500065#WRB05700"},{"type":"question","counter":77,"qnumday":26,"qnumall":"[26703\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052500065#WRB05800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to address concerns that the current rate of stamp duty applicable to a single residential property is acting as a barrier to the building of a home; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":78,"content":"<p>Stamp duty on the sale of residential properties such as apartments and houses is chargeable at the rate of 1% where the consideration does not exceed &euro;1 million.

These applications include:<\/p>  <p>  - All Passport Express applications - Section 9 Certificate of Identity<\/p>  <p>  - First time adult online applications - Identity Verification Form<\/p>  <p>  - First time child online applications - Child Passport Identity and Consent Form (Guardian A)<\/p>  <p>  The witnessing of these forms is a vital element of the identity verification process for the\u00a0Passport Service, as it provides initial assurance that the person in the photograph is the same person presenting to submit the passport application form.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of an application for a minor the witnessing of this form provides evidence that guardians give consent for a passport to be issued to the child. In order to protect the integrity of the Irish passport and also the rights of parents or guardians and children, it is important that forms are correctly completed and verified by the\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0by calling the\u00a0Garda\u00a0station to confirm the\u00a0Garda's signature.<\/p>  <p>  It is stated in a note to the witness on the identity and consent forms that they may be contacted to confirm the validity of their signature. It is the responsibility of the witnessing\u00a0Garda\u00a0to ensure that the signature is correctly recorded in the logbook, so that when the\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0calls at a later date the signature can be verified.<\/p>  <p>  There are a small number of cases where the\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0has had difficulty contacting\u00a0 a\u00a0Garda\u00a0station in order to verify the\u00a0Garda's signature. While the\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0makes every effort to contact the\u00a0Garda\u00a0station in these cases, unfortunately the passport application may be delayed if contact is not made. In some cases, the applicant may be requested to submit a new witnessed form where the\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0has been unable to contact the\u00a0Garda\u00a0station. The\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0will only request a new witness form after multiple attempts have been made to contact the\u00a0Garda\u00a0station.<\/p>  <p>  A new document management system that was put in place at the beginning of March is ensuring that these applications which require further documents are being turned around within 15 working days of receipt of the additional documents.<\/p>  <p>  It is not possible to provide the numbers requested by the Deputy in relation to passport applications that were delayed due to difficulty verifying consent forms with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as the Passport Service does not record this information.  However, it is not the experience of the\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0that failure to contact\u00a0Garda\u00a0stations to verify witnesses is a widespread issue.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0is continuously looking at ways to make the application process easier for applicants and advises during the online application process to make sure that the identity and consent form is correctly witnessed once they have completed the online process.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0provides instructions on how to correctly complete these forms on the Department's website (www.dfa.ie\/passports\/how-to-get-your-application-witnessed\/) and is also working on public education materials, including video tutorials, with a view to assisting applicants to complete their application correctly.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, the\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0maintains a close working relationship with An\u00a0Garda\u00a0S&iacute;och&aacute;na and regularly offers training and guidance to\u00a0Garda&iacute; on the correct completion of the required identity and consent forms.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Passport Service is publishing a full-page informational advertisement in the June edition of An\u00a0Garda\u00a0S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s magazine, the\u00a0Garda\u00a0Review, to assist\u00a0Garda&iacute; with the process of witnessing passport identity and consent forms. This advertisement includes the information that the Passport Service\u00a0will ring the\u00a0Garda\u00a0station to verify all first time passport applicants&rsquo; consent and identity form details.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Passport Service\u00a0takes its responsibility to protect the integrity of the Irish passport very seriously. The Irish passport has a strong international reputation due to the strength of the security features within the passport book and the robust processes involved in its issuance. The Irish passport was recently ranked 5th in the Henley Global Passport Index as it provides our citizens with visa-free access to 187 countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052500067#WRD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":160,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[26621\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052500067#WRD00900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will examine and expedite a passport application for a person (details supplied);

This 25% reduction in processing times for first time applications is a direct result of the staffing and resources the Department has invested in the Passport Service. The Passport Service is focused on reducing this processing time further in the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  The current processing times for passport applications are:<\/p>  <p>  - 10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals<\/p>  <p>  - 15 working days for Complex or child online renewals<\/p>  <p>  - 30 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online (applications received from 19 April)<\/p>  <p>  - 8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service<\/p>  <p>  Fully complete and correct online applications are issuing within the estimated processing time. Processing time begins from the date any required supporting documents are received by the Passport Service, not the online registration date. Applications that are incomplete and require the Passport Service to contact the applicant to request new documents, forms or photos will take longer than the average turnaround time.<\/p>  <p>  Figures show that of the total number of applications in the Passport Service system, 61% are fully complete and are being processed by the Passport Service. The other 39% of applications in the system are incomplete, which means the Passport Service is waiting for the applicant to submit the necessary documentation required. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service is currently experiencing high demand for first time passports, particularly for children. First time passport applications take longer to process than renewal applications and there are a number of reasons for this. First time applications are necessarily complex to process, since, in many cases, they are applications for Irish citizenship. The Passport Service must validate the identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. It is the statutory responsibility of the Passport Service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first time applicants.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated. Due to the intensive analysis and extra measures undertaken by highly trained and experienced staff, first-time applications take 30 working days to process. It is currently not possible for the Passport Service to check first time applications within seven working days of receiving the supporting documents due to the volume of applications that are being received. Applications enter a queue and are checked in order of date received. <\/p>  <p>  The main cause of delays for first time applications is where incorrect or insufficient supporting documentation is submitted by the applicant. The Passport Service encourages applicants to check the requirements for their type of application carefully on my Department's website. The recently updated website includes a new Passport Service section where applicants can easily find out what additional documents are required for their type of application. The Passport Service is also working on public education materials, including video tutorials, with a view to assisting applicants to complete their application correctly. These videos will be shared on social media and will include instructions on submitting consent forms for child applications properly.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service is taking a number of steps to deal with increased demand on its services:<\/p>  <p>  - The Passport Service has a comprehensive plan to ensure that adequate staff, accommodation and technology supports are in place to meet expected demand for passports in 2022.<\/p>  <p>  - A major recruitment drive has been underway over the past several months, which has seen the number of Passport Service staff increase by over 300 since June 2021.<\/p>  <p>  - The Passport Service is currently running its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers. This recruitment effort will bring staffing      numbers to over 900, which represents a doubling of staff compared to June 2021.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff is ongoing to increase the resources that can process complex applications, such as      first time child applications.<\/p>  <p>  - The Passport Service is prioritising first time applications and directing increased resources to processing these complex applications with a view      to reducing the current turnaround time. Passport Service staff are working targeted overtime with a particular focus on first time applications.<\/p>  <p>  - A new document management system was put in place at the beginning of March. This aims to improve the processing speed in the Passport Service offices, and subsequent turnaround times for the applicant. One particular feature of the new system improves the processing time for applicants who have been asked to submit additional documents. Once the additional documents are received, they are being prioritised and complete applications can then be processed in 3 weeks. This significantly reduces the processing time, particularly for first time applicants.<\/p>  <p>  I am confident that the measures that have been implemented will help to reduce passport turnaround times in the course of 2022, particularly for first time applications, and will assist the Passport Service in meeting the high demand forecast for this year.<\/p>  <p>I strongly urge anyone who is considering travelling overseas this year, particularly families with young children, to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to apply for their passports online in plenty of time  .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052500067#WRD04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":201,"content":"<p>Question No. 62 answered with Question No. 54.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":202,"content":"<p>Question No. 63 answered with Question No. 54.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":203,"content":"<p>Question No. 64 answered with Question No. 53.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":204,"content":"<p>Question No. 65 answered with Question No. 54.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":205,"content":"<p>Question No. 66 answered with Question No. 54.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":206,"content":"<p>Question No. 67 answered with Question No. 53.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":207,"content":"<p>Question No. 68 answered with Question No. 54.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":208,"content":"<p>Question No. 69 answered with Question No. 54.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":209,"content":"<p>Question No. 70 answered with Question No. 54.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":212,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[26757\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052500068#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"when a passport will issue for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1508","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":213,"content":"<p>With regard to the specific application about which the Deputy has enquired, the Passport Service provided an update to the applicant's parent as to the status of the passport application on 16 May 2022.

The Framework gives students the opportunity to develop a wide range of knowledge and skills &ndash; to equip them for further learning, for work, for responsible and active citizenship, and for healthy living. The Junior Cycle has been developed and implemented over several years, with the final phase of new subject specifications having been introduced to schools from September 2019. The Junior Cycle subject specification for History was developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and introduced from September 2018.<\/p>  <p>  When schools in Ireland implement the Framework for Junior Cycle, they have the autonomy and flexibility to design programmes within the parameters of the framework, mindful in particular of the needs of their students and their teaching resources.  This allows decisions on what is offered within these programmes to be at the discretion of the school, and students to have as broad a range of options to choose from as possible.<\/p>  <p>  In the Framework for Junior Cycle, all schools are expected to provide opportunities for students to achieve 24 statements of learning over the period of Junior Cycle. These statements include valuing local, national and international heritage and understanding the importance of the relationship between past and current events, the forces that drive change, and understanding the origins and impacts of social, economic and environmental aspects of the world around them.  <\/p>  <p>  The specification for Junior Cycle History provides a framework for students to acquire the historical skills, conceptual understanding and substantive knowledge that lead to a sense of historical consciousness, whereby students can see the world and their place in it from a historical perspective. It has been designed for a minimum of 200 hours of timetabled student engagement across the three years of Junior Cycle.  The specification has three interconnected strands, each with a set or related elements: the nature of history, the history of Ireland, and the history of Europe and the wider world.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of the learning outcomes approach, teachers can facilitate discussion around a wide range of periods of Irish history and culture, as well as the many other issues which might arise during the course of a class. For example, in Learning Outcome 1.3 (Junior Cycle History) students are asked to appreciate their cultural inheritance through recognising historically significant places and buildings and discussing why historical personalities, events and issues are commemorated.<\/p>  <p>  The two Classroom-Based Assessments (CBAs) in the Junior Cycle specification allow students to explore topics that are interesting and relevant to their own lives. In A Life in Time, students choose a person from the past and explore why that person is historically significant, while The Past in my Place, allows students to present their findings on a study of an aspect of their home place that they consider of interest.  <\/p>  <p>  In October 2019, the Minister for Education announced that History should have special core status within the Framework for Junior Cycle. Further details in this regard are set out in Circular Letters 0076\/2020 and 0016\/2020. From September 2020, students will study English, Irish, Mathematics and History (with some exceptions in the case of students with special educational needs), along with a number of other subjects or short courses in their Junior Cycle programme.<\/p>  <p>  The NCCA is also developing a short course in History for certain students with general learning difficulties\/needs. Students in this category will not be required to study the subject ahead of the new short course being made available.<\/p>  <p>  Across each of the strands and strand units of the curriculum, teachers have flexibility in determining the content which is to be taught and are encouraged to expose pupils to a range of perspectives. In particular, through Strand two: The history of Ireland, students should be able to identify the causes, course and consequence of the Northern Ireland Troubles and their impact on North-South and Anglo-Irish relations as well as examine how one sporting, cultural or social movement impacted on Irish life. This would include elements related to the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052500070#WRG01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":321,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052500070#WRG01700"},{"type":"question","counter":322,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[26867\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052500070#WRG01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if there are 29 ASD classes at primary-level and 1.5 ASD classes at second level in schools in the Dublin mid-west area; and her plans to rectify the discrepancy between the number of placements at primary and secondary level across this area.","asker":"1468","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":323,"content":"<p>Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education is a priority for this Government.<\/p><p>This year, my Department will spend in excess of &euro;2 Billion, or over 25% of the Department&rsquo;s budget on providing a wide range of schemes and supports for children with special educational needs. <\/p><p>This includes additional teaching and care supports. <\/p><p>As a result, the number of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels. <\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. <\/p><p>Over the last two years, my Department and the NCSE have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined up planning process which has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school-year. <\/p><p>I am satisfied that this more joined up approach is delivering.

Allowance.\u00a0 The estimates were based on the rates of payments at end 2020\u00a0and did not make any provision for rate increases.\u00a0 It should be noted that these costings are subject to change in the context of emerging trends and associated revisions of the estimated numbers of recipients.<\/p>  <p>  In February 2021, I introduced the \"Benefit Payment for 65 year olds\" in line with the Programme for Government commitment, to provide a benefit payment for people who are aged 65 and who are required to retire, or who chose to retire, without a requirement to sign on, engage in activation measures or be available for and genuinely seeking work.\u00a0 This new payment was designed specifically to bridge the gap for people who retire from employment or self-employment at 65 years of age but who do not\u00a0qualify for the State Pension until age 66.<\/p>  <p>The Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report\u00a0was published on 7th   October 2021 and it contained almost 250 pages of analysis, consideration and recommendations.\u00a0 The report, Technical Sub-Committee's working papers, agendas, minutes, external presentations and submissions in response to an extensive public consultation process are available on the website, pensionscommission.gov.ie.\u00a0\u00a0The Commission&rsquo;s work established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed.\u00a0 It\u00a0has set out a wide range of recommendations, including in respect of the State Pension Age and early access, and aligning retirement ages in employment contracts with the State Pension age.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, the Government is considering the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.\u00a0\u00a0My officials are examining each of the recommendations and\u00a0consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system.\u00a0\u00a0The views of the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare are being considered\u00a0as part of these deliberations.\u00a0 Once the detailed consideration of all of this in the round is complete, I intend bringing a recommended response and implementation plan to Government.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is clear from the Commission&rsquo;s work that State Pension reform is necessary and it is complex.\u00a0 It would be a strategic risk not to plan and provide for projected demographic changes, not least in terms of income adequacy for older people.\u00a0\u00a0The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.\u00a0 It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.\u00a0 This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers.<\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0trust this clarifies the matter for the

Homemaking Disregards and HomeCaring Periods to recognise caring periods outside of paid employment in the calculation of a State Pension payment.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  HomeCaring Periods may be awarded for each week not already covered by a paid or credited social insurance contribution (regardless of when they occurred) to a maximum of 20 years. \u00a0Only one person can benefit from a HomeCaring Period for supporting a child or adult at one time.\u00a0 HomeCaring Periods can only be used under the Interim Total Contributions Approach (also known as the Aggregated Contribution

of 12 who needed an increased level of care; or<\/p>  <p>  - an adult who needed an increased level of care.<\/p>  <p>  Foster carers are entitled to the benefits of the Homemaker&rsquo;s Scheme or

The lead role in developing the action plan rests with the HSE, in conjunction with Traveller organisations.

The report of the Joint Committee is a valuable contribution to the development of the plan.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Covid-19 has brought into focus the health inequalities faced by Traveller communities. From the outset of the Covid pandemic, a range of additional measures were put in place by the HSE and local authorities to mitigate the risks faced by the Traveller community. The Traveller health action plan will reflect the lessons from the public health response to Covid-19.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Department has engaged with the HSE in the drafting of the Traveller Health Action Plan, to ensure that the plan is aligned with the Department's policy priorities to provide better access to health services for socially excluded groups and to address health inequalities, as set out in the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy and action plan 2021-2023, the Healthy Ireland strategic action plan 2021-2025 and the Statement of Strategy 2021-2023.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The publication and implementation of the Traveller health action plan is a priority for the Department and the HSE in 2022.

The development of the scheme was based on a recommendation of the 'Report of the Seafood Task Force &ndash; &lsquo;Navigating Change&rsquo; (October 2021). The 2022 scheme represents an extension of the 2021 tie-up which ran from October to December 2021 and which I launched rapidly following the publication of the Task Force report, in order to respond to the situation facing fishers.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the scheme is to enable a reduction in quota uptake in 2022 so as to improve quota availability for the fleet overall throughout the remainder of the year. In light of the further quota cuts taking effect in 2022, I have modified the scheme compared to 2021, so that vessel owners can, if they wish, choose to tie-up for up to two calendar months. This enhanced tie-up opportunity will free up additional quota for those vessels continuing to fish, supporting viability in the wider fleet in these challenging times.  Payment rates will be the same as for the 2021 scheme. Vessel owners participating in the 2022 scheme will again be required to distribute one third of that payment to crew.  <\/p>  <p>  The scheme is initially expected to operate over the period June to October, but I will be asking the European Commission to amend the approval of the scheme to encompass November so as to provide for an additional August\/November tie-up option.<\/p>  <p>  The scheme and its timing have been developed in order to mitigate for quota reductions while also ensuring the protection and continuity of the seafood supply chain. To this end, the majority of vessels choosing to tie-up for two months must maintain a two month gap between tie-up months, currently allowing for an individual vessel to tie-up for June and September or July and October. This period will have the greatest capacity to balance quota uptake throughout the year. Conversely, December is typically a shorter month for fishing and would negate some of the effectiveness of this scheme in achieving its objectives. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme has also been developed in the context of the full suite of Task Force recommendations, such as a voluntary decommissioning scheme which is presently with the European Commission for its consideration of the scheme in terms of State Aid rules.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052500077#WRO00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Rural and Community Development","counter":708,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052500077#WRO00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Harbours and Piers","counter":707,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052500077#WRO00500"},{"type":"question","counter":708,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[26859\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022052500077#WRO00600","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"the next steps that are in the delivery of phase 3 of the Pier at An Caladh M&oacute;r, Inis Me&aacute;in, Contae na Gaillimhe.","asker":"1579","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":709,"content":"<p>The Development of the Caladh M&oacute;r Pier on Inis Me&aacute;in is included in the National Development Plan.
