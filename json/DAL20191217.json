It is also a damning indictment of the Government's weakness, paralysis and failure to protect people from a greedy and exploitative industry and the Government's inability to change the story over the past eight years.  At times, the Government seemed to side with the industry and accept its explanations.  This is the first comprehensive study of premiums and cost claims in Ireland and it undermines the narrative of the companies and their claims about spiralling pay-outs and increased claims being the major factor underpinning growing premium increases.  It found that between 2009 and 2018, the average cost of claims per policy fell by 2.5%, while average premiums jumped by 42%.  It is even more alarming that in the past five years, from 2013 to 2018, average premiums went up by 62%.  Meanwhile, the industry generated an average operating profit of 9%, twice the level of profitability seen in the United Kingdom.  We know personal injuries claims, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, and legal costs are also factors.

I believe it comes from the CSO, but I will provide the Deputy with the source by the end of the day.  I am sure he will be good enough to retract his earlier remarks when he sees the data I produce.  As I said earlier, the cost of motor insurance has gone down by approximately 26% since it peaked in 2016.<\/p> <p>It went up before that.  Now we need to make sure we drive it down further because the cost of motor insurance is still too high in Ireland for young drivers and all other drivers.  Our objective is to make sure we bring down the cost of insurance over the next couple of months and years.<\/p> <p> The report published yesterday is the report of the national claims information database.  I commend the Central Bank for its work on publishing the report.  It is worth noting that this report was produced only as a consequence of Government action on insurance.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, in particular, in that regard.  The national claims information database was set up on foot of a recommendation of the Government's cost of insurance working group because we did not have enough data and transparency on insurance.  That is why we asked for the report to be produced.  It would not have been produced had there not been Government action.  It carries out an in-depth analysis of annual trends of non-life insurance claims.  This is seen as crucial in developing an understanding of how claims costs impact on premiums and, in particular, an understanding of the relationship between the price paid by the customer for motor insurance and the cost to insurance undertakings.  This is the first report and it covers the ten-year period between 2009 and 2018.  It highlights the importance of the cost of claims to the level of insurance premiums.  However, it also highlights the highly cyclical nature of the insurance market and, in particular, the growth in insurance premiums relative to the cost of claims and the growth in profitability of the motor insurance underwriting sector since 2015.  The report provides information on how claims are settled, the time it takes, and the legal costs associated with the various settlement channels.  This information had not been previously available.  Therefore, the conclusions from this part of the report are just as important as the premium claims element.  <\/p> <p> I believe the report shows that both the insurance and legal centres have a role to play and questions to answer with regard to the difficulties we have faced in recent years when it comes to the cost of car insurance.  It appears that insurers underpriced in the early part of this decade and then increased premiums beyond levels that were needed to cover losses incurred, and consequently are now making significant profits.  At the same time, the legal costs associated with the litigation settlement channel seem disproportionate when one considers that the report indicates the award levels for those settlements under &euro;100,000 are not much higher than equivalent settlements of the PIAB.  In addition, the length of time to settle the claims is nearly two years longer than in the PIAB, which in itself drives up the cost of insurance.  The Central Bank will finalise its report on the feasibility of expanding the database to cover employer liability and public liability as the next step.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700004#B01900","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576592100,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I wish the Taoiseach the very best of luck in saying to the thousands of young people who have been ripped off over recent years that at least we compiled a report to tell them something they knew all along.  That is essentially what the Taoiseach is saying.  His source is essentially the CSO, which is asking the industry to present the figures.  Is it not?  This is a definitive study.  It is not what the Government has been doing, namely, coming in here last week stating complacently that it is all sorted and that costs are going down by 20% to 30%.  The cost went up 62% in five years.  What in the name of God was the Taoiseach doing?  What were his Ministers doing?<\/p>  <p>  It is not just the motor industry that is affected.  All week, it has been about cr&egrave;ches and childcare facilities, some of which will be closing this week because of inaction.  The Minister of State claimed to be shocked over premiums increasing.  Businesses have been ringing alarm bells because of the excessive rip-off in insurance that has been occurring with no rational explanation.  Of course there are fraudulent claims and issues arising over the high cost of litigation in the courts but, again, the Taoiseach did nothing about it.  He failed to protect the PIAB from the vested interests that sought to undermine it.  The PIAB was an effective intervention brought in by Ms Mary Harney well over a decade and a half ago.  It dramatically upset vested interests and brought costs down but the current Government has stood by.  It has taken a hands-off approach.  The situation is now that, right across the board, from cr&egrave;ches to childcare, we are in crisis in terms of the capacity of businesses and people to survive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700005#C00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1576592100,"counter":28,"content":"<p>We all acknowledge in this House that the cost of insurance, be it motor insurance, public liability insurance or employer liability insurance for business people, is too high.  Our objective is to bring down the cost of insurance.  How do we do it?  We do so through the reforms that have taken place and more that will take place in the future.  One, for example, is the establishment of the national claims information database.  The reason the Deputy is raising this question today is that we now have information we did not have in the past.  We have that information only because of action taken by the Government on foot of the work led by the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy.<\/p> <p> We reformed the PIAB, which the Deputy mentioned, by means of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019 in order to encourage greater compliance with the board's process.  In contrast with the Deputy's claim that we have somehow weakened the board, the opposite is the case.  We have strengthened it by means of the 2019 legislation.  There is also stronger Garda action, through the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, to crack down on fraudulent and exaggerated claims.  Even today we are taking action on insurance costs because the Judicial Council has come into existence.  The commencement order has been signed and the Judicial Council has been formally established.

The reality is that all this information was available to the Taoiseach and Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, and their Deputies, if they wanted to look at it.  We did not have to wait for a comprehensive report from the Central Bank to tell us of the spin and blatant lies from the insurance industry that were pedalled by the Taoiseach and Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin on the floor of this House.<\/p>  <p>  Last week, another insurance provider, Ironshore Europe, one of the biggest insurers in the childcare sector, withdrew from the market.  The Taoiseach may be aware of Ironshore, although I believe that none of his Ministers has reached out to that company or to any childcare providers.  Nothing has been done about the fact that some childcare operators are likely to close their doors and will not be able to reopen in January 2020.  Ironshore was the insurer of the four cr&egrave;ches that were completely exposed on an RT&Eacute; programme in the summer.  Those cr&egrave;ches are the subject of a number of litigation cases.  There has been an injunction in the courts seeking to prevent Ironshore from withdrawing insurance cover for them.  Those cr&egrave;ches will no longer be allowed to operate or be trusted to supervise and care for children.<\/p>  <p>  We are now left with only one insurance provider in the sector.  That company is asking childcare providers for approximately triple the amount they paid for insurance in the past.  Some of these providers are not-for-profit organisations.  I spoke to representatives from one provider and discovered that its premium will increase from &euro;1,800 to almost &euro;5,000 in January.  The provider in question simply does not have the money and does not know what it is going to do when it closes its doors on Friday.  Where will it find the money?  Will it be able to reopen in January?  What will happen to the 80 children to whom care is provided by the organisation to which I refer and which is a centre of excellence for those with additional needs?<\/p>  <p>  The Government has done nothing in respect of this issue.  I tabled a parliamentary question last week regarding what engagement there has been with the childcare sector and what meetings the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has had with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, on this issue.  There has been absolutely no action whatsoever.  The Central Bank issued its report yesterday and it has provided clarity for both parties here.  That report completely rebuts the spin of the industry and is a damning indictment of the Government, which has refused to hold the industry to account and which has done worse by pedalling the spin put out by the industry.  As I did in the case of the Minister for Finance last month, I ask the Taoiseach to stop making the claim that insurance premiums have dropped by 27%.  Do they not understand what is involved here?  I have made the point on the record of the D&aacute;il on numerous occasions that the Central Statistics Office, CSO, asks about one particular policy.  The data are there across all claims and they show that, from 2016 to 2017, insurance premiums went up by 15% and by a further 2% in 2018.  The figure is going up by 17% rather than down by 27% as the Government has claimed.<\/p>  <p>  The leader of Fianna F&aacute;il addressed this House on 1 October and claimed that the compensation culture is rife.  Last week, he blamed the culture of claiming at any cost for the rising cost of insurance.  The facts indicate clearly that the cost of claims has actually decreased by 2.5% since 2009.  I will conclude by stating that the number of people claiming has dropped by 40% and the number making personal injury claims by 20%.

The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is engaging with the sector and with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to see what we can do about it to ensure we do not see cr&egrave;ches closing in the new year.  We are particularly conscious of those difficulties with regard to the price or availability of insurance, particularly liability insurance.  It is acknowledged that the recent announcement of the withdrawal from the market by one of the insurers providing insurance to childcare providers is a worrying development.

The Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Pobal offer a case management system for services suffering sustainability difficulties, mainly in the community childcare sector.  Services should contact their local childcare committee to access available supports such as advice or business planning.  For community providers, financial supports can also be made available after an assessment.  This process is managed by the childcare committees and Pobal.<\/p>  <p>  The Government cannot compel insurance companies to stay in the Irish market.  Consequently, we need to ensure the insurance market is attractive for such insurers in order to generate greater competition and thus improve overall current capacity and the pricing position.  Critical to achieving this is bringing award levels for so-called &ldquo;soft tissue&rdquo; injuries down in this country and more in line with other jurisdictions.

Some 23% of full-time workers earn less than two thirds of the median income.  When the national minimum wage was introduced here in 2000 it was set at this mark to bring full-time workers out of low pay.  Since then, that has never been met and today the minimum wage is only around half of the median income.  It should be pegged at two thirds of the median income to bring about a minimum wage that has been recognised by all.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has just published a report showing that CEO pay in the top companies has increased by between 9% and 99% in one year.  Twenty-two of the top 26 chief executive officers take home over &euro;1 million in pay, with the highest pay reaching &euro;8.2 million in a single year.  In one company the CEO takes 212 times what the average worker earns.  In recent years, Ireland has had the highest gap between the highest paid and the lowest paid of all OECD countries, which is a shocking record to have.  This is not just about CEOs, but it is about high-paid workers in some industries and, unfortunately, a whole swathe of low-paid workers in others.  The main thing that reduces this inequality is the relatively high level of cash transfers that we have in this country.  However, even those cash transfers in tax and social welfare were not raised by the Government in the most recent budget.<\/p>  <p>  Low pay means that many people in full-time work can no longer afford housing or other cost of living increases.  Our cities need workers in retail, security, cleaning and hospitality.  However, the bulk of workers in those sectors do not come within a mile of living and meeting the rent in our inner city areas.  This is deeply unfair and socially unsustainable.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach is on record as stating that the cap on bankers' pay should stay in place and the Government has pledged to raise the minimum wage to &euro;10.10 from January.  Does he agree with me that we need to do much more to address this unique gap between the highest and lowest paid in the country, which makes us the worst in the OECD and outliers when compared with countries that are apparently much more progressive than we are?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700008#F02100","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1576593900,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I do not have those figures in front of me now, but I remember reading them in the past.  I accept we have a high gap between high pay and low pay.  The reason we have that is that we have a very large number of very high-paid people, particularly in the multinational sector.  We have high pay in Ireland.  It is not that we have low pay relative to other countries.  It is that we have many people in very high-paid jobs, particularly in the multinational sector, which brings up the average.<\/p>  <p>  I believe our national minimum wage is the sixth or seventh highest in the world, even adjusted for purchasing power capacity.  If the pay of our public servants, teachers and civil servants is compared with other western countries, it is higher than the average.  The same applies in the private sector.  It is not that Ireland has low pay relative to other countries when one compares job with job.<\/p> <p>It is the very large number of highly paid people, and especially those working in the multinational system, who distort the figures and bring up the average.  Interestingly, as we are talking of statistics, Deputy Howlin will acknowledge the statistics produced by the CSO two weeks ago in the survey on income and living conditions.  These figures looked at income equality and the income gap and came up with quite a different result.  The survey showed that whether one uses the Gini coefficient or the other measure, income inequality is at its second lowest since records began in 2004.  They are, perhaps, conflicting statistics in that the CSO says that Ireland has never been more equal, or that at least since 2004 Ireland's income inequality is at its second lowest level.<\/p> <p> There are different ways of dealing with the gap Deputy Howlin has referred to.  The Deputy has rightly pointed out that one of the ways Ireland distributes wealth is through our tax system and our social welfare system.  This has an enormous redistributive effect, more so than other countries, with our relatively high taxes on those who are well paid and relatively low taxes on those who are poorly paid compared with other countries.  Our tax and welfare system is the main way we deal with that gap, which after transfers makes us a very equal country relative to others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700008#F02200","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576594500,"counter":83,"content":"<p>It is true that because we have progressive taxation and a decent social welfare system, it masks the fundamental inequality, which is the gap between those who earn the highest and the vast bulk of people who are on very low incomes.

They struggle to pay for childcare, and some people are opting out of work because the cost of childcare is greater than their take-home income.  Many of them face incredible pressure even in providing transport to work.  The Government must recognise this reality before we set about resolving it.<\/p>  <p>  While the State can influence income by a progressive tax and social welfare system, the fundamental issue of having a decent wage rate across all sectors of work, some of which were instanced by the Taoiseach in his reply, must be set as a national objective.

It strikes me that the same question can be applied now in the context of the FAI and the scandal around its debts.<\/p> <p>Deloitte was its external auditor for 23 years.  One of the points of having an external auditor is to have independent eyes on the accounts.  Can this really be the case after 23 years of doing the same job for the same organisation?  The Financial Reporting Council in the UK states year on year familiarity with clients can lead to accountants taking the same approach even when business conditions change, thereby underlining the need for rotation if good governance is to be prioritised.  Financial information which was published recently during the unfolding of the FAI saga showed some startling adjustments to the FAI accounts for previous years.  For example, in 2016 an originally reported profit was adjusted from &euro;2.344 million to &euro;66,000.  In 2017, a profit in the accounts of &euro;2.8 million was adjusted to the point that it ended up being a loss of &euro;2.9 million.  This is in addition to the fact that a Revenue audit in 2019 revealed an underpayment of taxes and, together with interest and penalties, led to an additional liability of &euro;2.3 million.  It begs the question as to whether the FAI would have managed to secure the tax clearance certificate it needed to access Government grants.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach was a Minister with responsibility for sports.  He knows that Government grants are paid on foot of a tax clearance certificate in addition to audited accounts.  Should we now look at a system whereby organisations are required to show evidence of audit rotation with inbuilt time limits for each audit period before a rotation is required?  Good governance requires such a system.  The UK has introduced a system of grading its audit firms.  This is also used to ensure rotation.  It plans to publish the grades and past performance of the large audit companies.  It has also introduced more powerful audit oversight.  The introduction of the grading system was on foot of the collapse of large firms such as Carillion, BHS and Thomas Cook, proving the UK has taken lessons from the financial scandals.  We must do the same.<\/p> <p> Does the Taoiseach accept there is an issue with the same external audit firm having an audit contract with the same organisation for 23 years or anything near it?  The EU statutory audit regulations of 2016 are supposed to introduce this and I do not understand why it has not happened.  Will the Taoiseach support making such a rotation system a prerequisite for Government grant funding in addition to tax clearance certificates?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700009#G01400","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576595100,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I do not want to cast aspersions on any particular audit firm, nor on the many thousands of very good people who work in that particular firm, but I do think the Deputy has asked a good question and makes a very good point.  It is a principle of good corporate governance that organisations should not be audited by the same people forever and ever and ever again.  It is certainly something that Sport Ireland and other public bodies should examine as to whether it is made a condition of Government grant aid that auditors are rotated after a period of time.<\/p>  <p>  The same applies to board members.  We often see a situation in a lot of organisations that we fund, whether charities, sporting bodies or local taskforces, that the same people are on the board for ten, 20 or 25 years and this is not good corporate governance either.  There should be a rotation of board members too.  They are definitely areas where the Government could be more active in requiring turnover of auditors and turnover of board members as a condition of funding in future.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the independent audit being done, it was provided to Sport Ireland and the Minister and has been passed on to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Office of the Director for Corporate Enforcement has also been notified.  The purpose of the audit was to get a clearer picture of the financial and governance issues in the FAI and to chart a course for the association to deal with the serious failings in order to restore confidence in public funding to football in Ireland.  The board of Sport Ireland considered the report on 27 November and welcomed that the audit found that State funding given to the FAI was expended for the purposes it was given.<\/p> <p>That is an important point.  We should reassure taxpayers and the public that the taxpayers' money that was given to the FAI was used for the purpose intended, including participation, anti-racism, women in sport and all the other things that Government funds.  The independent audit confirms that public money was not misappropriated.  <\/p> <p> The Sport Ireland board approved the establishment of a liaison group between Sport Ireland and the FAI to prepare and agree a detailed implementation plan for all of the recommendations of the KOSI report.  The board will continue to monitor the progress of reform in the FAI and Sport Ireland will continue to support the association to take the necessary steps to restore public confidence.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, and the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, believe the most urgent priority now for the FAI should be the appointment of four independent directors, new faces sitting around the top table of Irish football.  Therefore, it is important that the board, under the leadership of the independent chairperson, moves quickly to fill the CEO vacancy and to satisfy the concerns of all stakeholders that the new CEO should be independent of any current or previous involvement with the FAI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700010#H00200","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576595400,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I agree on the need to appoint those independent board members and chairperson.  As new appointees, they will need to be given a chance.  They are in a very difficult situation.  The introduction of a rotation of audit should not be exclusive to sport.  It is good practice.  It will not be unique to sports that there are failings by virtue of the fact that there is too much familiarity.  A European Union statutory audit regulation was introduced in 2016, which provides for mandatory rotation over a long timeframe.  Why does that not apply in this case?  It would have forced a change of auditors and thus there would have been a fresh review at an earlier stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700011#J00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1576595400,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I honestly do not know why it does not apply in this case but I will check that out and provide the Deputy with a more detailed reply.  It may well be - I am only guessing - that the directive applies to bodies that are largely publicly funded whereas this is a body that receives only a small proportion of its funding from the Government.  That is just my guess because that is often the way European directives work.  They apply to largely or majority funded bodies, not ones that only receive a portion of their funding from the State.  As I said, I will check it out.  I will ask the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to examine the wider issue that if public money is provided through a third party to voluntary bodies, charities or NGOs, surely it is appropriate that they are properly audited and rotate their auditors.  A bit like the FAI, it would be appropriate that they should rotate their leadership, chairman and board members and not have the same people in charge for ten, 20 or 30 years, which is just bad corporate governance practice, as, I think, we will all agree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700011#J00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"An tOrd Gn\u00f3 - Order of Business","time":1576595400,"counter":101,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700011#J00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1576595400,"counter":102,"content":"<p>The business this week shall be as set out in the first revised report of the Business Committee dated 16 December 2019.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to today&rsquo;s business, it is proposed that the D&aacute;il shall sit later than 10 p.m. and shall adjourn on the conclusion of Private Members' Business.

He effectively retired from serving the people of the northside of Cork about two years ago when he accepted a role as campaign manager for the European People's Party, something the Taoiseach congratulated him on and wished him well.  Last Saturday, the Taoiseach said in an interview that he would find a way to have an independent investigation into former Deputy Murphy's performance and his role as a Deputy.  Despite a number of attempts by the Taoiseach to say to the D&aacute;il that there were different mechanisms that could be used, within an hour of him saying them, they all turned out not to be based on any solid foundation.  Under sections 9(3) and 9(4) of the Ethics in Public Office Act, there is a facility whereby the former Deputy could refer himself to the Committee on Members' Interests.  Given all that the Taoiseach has said on the subject over the past while, has he actually asked his former colleague to refer himself to the Committee on Members' Interests under that legislation?

There are serious issues in the childcare sector.  There have been reports of cr&egrave;ches operating without registration, of staff taking up positions without qualifications and of cr&egrave;ches that will be unable to open their doors on 1 January because of the insurance crisis.  This disjointed sector is overseen by a number of Departments, is seriously dysfunctional in the way it is monitored, funded and so on, and has led to the crisis we face.<\/p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach will be aware, Tusla was given powers in 2016 in respect of re-registration, the deadline for which was 12 December.  I understand that many cr&egrave;ches have not re-registered and that there could be as many as hundreds.  There is an issue with insurance.  The Taoiseach stated earlier that cr&egrave;ches will not need insurance for 2020 to register.  Is he suggesting in some way that cr&egrave;ches should operate without insurance on 1 January?  There is a serious crisis, about which neither the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, or the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, has found the time to have a conversation.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach dismissed my call earlier for a Cabinet sub-committee.  He can forget about me.  What parents and workers in the sector expect is the Government to intervene where there has been a serious failure and that is clearly the case at this point.

It was signed by the President in October 2018.  I am concerned about the lack of progress in implementing this legislation since its enactment.  As the Taoiseach knows, the introduction of minimum unit pricing of alcohol is one of the central measures provided for in the Act.  Under the Act, the \"minimum price per gram of alcohol ... shall be &euro;0.10\".  As half a litre of strong beer with an alcohol strength by volume of 5% contains 20 g of alcohol, it should have a minimum price of &euro;1.98.  This would not have an impact on premium brands, craft beers or the average bottle of wine.  Two of the categories of people on whom it would have an impact are young people involved in the binge drinking of cheap alcohol and those who are addicted to consuming high volumes of spirits.

Some of those who attended the vigil that was held the other day told me that it was a very moving experience.  I extend my condolences to everyone who knew him.<\/p>  <p>  Some elements of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015, which is now the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018, have been enacted, particularly those relating to advertising and promotions.  A key element of the legislation relating to minimum unit pricing has not yet been enacted.  The Government's policy is to implement the relevant provisions at the same time as similar provisions are implemented in Northern Ireland.  We do not want to encourage cross-Border purchases of alcohol.  If people are crossing the Border to buy cheap alcohol, this measure will not work economically or in public health terms.  Talks with the Northern Ireland parties are now under way.  We would like a date for the introduction of minimum unit pricing in Northern Ireland to be part of any agreement among the parties there.  We could then agree to do it on the same date.  We cannot wait forever.  If it does not prove possible to adopt the approach I have set out, we may need to go ahead with the introduction of minimum unit pricing unilaterally.

Unfortunately, he has not established such a fund.  He stated in October that \"Funds are available\" and that \"the amount for Hartstown has been settled\".  The latest news is that these two community centres can claim from the Dormant Accounts Fund and get approximately 20% of what they need.

The report of the cost of insurance working group was published, and unfortunately it included a set of recommendations with no timeframe for implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700018#Q01300","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1576599300,"counter":255,"content":"<p>Deputy Troy should ask a question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700018#Q01400","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1576599300,"counter":256,"content":"<p>Given the crisis across so many sectors concerning insurance, will the Taoiseach review the recommendations that have been published by the cost of insurance working group-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700018#Q01500","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1576599300,"counter":257,"content":"<p>Okay, we have got the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700018#Q01600","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1576599300,"counter":258,"content":"<p>-----and introduce an accelerated timeframe for their implementation to give people an opportunity to see their insurance premiums reduced?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700018#Q01700","speaker":"1250"},{"type":"speech","time":1576599300,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I have some good news for Deputy Troy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700018#Q01800","speaker":"1233"},{"type":"speech","time":1576599300,"counter":260,"content":"<p>The Minister is glad he asked the question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700018#Q01900","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1576599300,"counter":261,"content":"<p>Later this afternoon we will officially launch the terms and conditions of the Judicial Council Act.

Immense damage was done in the past three years since the Assembly and Executive were collapsed due to a controversy over a heating scheme, in which it turns out both sides were implicated.  A very good book, <i>Burned<\/i>, was written on this by Sam McBride.  It is worth reading.  Northern Ireland was essentially left without a voice at a very critical moment in its history and the history of the island given the threat of Brexit.  It was unforgivable and unacceptable that the North was without a Government and Assembly.<\/p><p>In last week's election, the two largest parties lost over 12% of the vote and received a very clear message from the people that they want action on urgent issues such as health and schools and they want politicians to go back to work.  From knocking on doors in Derry, that was a very clear message I received.  When I was out canvassing with Mr. Colum Eastwood and my party colleagues were canvassing with Ms Claire Hanna, Michael Savage and others, there was a very clear message that the people wanted the politicians to go back to work.  Because of this and many other reasons, such as the fact that the largest parties know another Assembly election would weaken their positions, there is every reason to believe there will actually be a deal before 13 January.  The challenge is to make sure there is a sustainable deal.  The fresh start agreement between the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in in 2015 was at the time heralded as a breakthrough and an end to instability but it was nothing of the sort.  There was a quick return to the sort of secret behaviour and party-first tactics exposed so damningly during the heating scheme inquiry.  The most important way to end the cycle of inaction and breakdown is to end the system whereby everything is controlled in two private offices, with other parties and civil society excluded.  Will the Taoiseach give an assurance that all parties will be meaningfully involved in the discussions and that any agreement will not be allowed to become yet another closed one between parties that do not represent nearly half of the electorate?  Given the critical importance of significantly improving North&ndash;South co-operation in order to make the new special economic status of Northern Ireland work, does the Taoiseach agree it is essential that we table substantive proposals on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700019#R00200","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1576599900,"counter":296,"content":"<p>Though it is not acknowledged often enough, there is another 32-county party in this country.  It is called People Before Profit.  We have an Assembly Member for West Belfast and a number of councillors in Belfast and Derry.  Interestingly, in the recent elections our vote in West Belfast went up by 5%, rising from 10% to 16%.  By any standard, this is a significant improvement for a party that organises not on green or orange lines but on the basis of socialist politics and on uniting Catholic and Protestant working-class people in their common interests.  One of the key issues that came up when I was canvassing in West Belfast was the health service.  Indeed, this issue dominated.  It echoes the circumstances down here.  Why are nurses in the North and other health workers on strike?  It is because people are waiting up to two years for important operations and because they are put on trolleys in accident and emergency wards.  Also, actions of the Tories, sanctioned or not challenged by the two major parties in the North, mean health workers in the National Health Service in the North earn less than their counterparts in the rest of the United Kingdom.  Would it not be very reasonable to say the restoration of the Assembly should be conditional on increased investment to address the crisis in the National Health Service and on a clear commitment to pay parity between nurses and other health workers in the North and their counterparts in the rest of the United Kingdom?  Pay parity is a major issue affecting people across sectarian lines in the North.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700019#R00300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1576599900,"counter":297,"content":"<p>My party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, has covered very extensively and comprehensively the issues we want to see addressed in the current round of talks.

I believe the issues around language can be addressed in good faith among the parties, in addition to issues concerning the sectarian conflict that have yet to be resolved and the issue of legislation being blocked by any of the parties in Stormont.  All of these issues are fixable to the credit and benefit of people in the North but also the whole island of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700019#R00500","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1576600500,"counter":299,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Martin Kenny for a brief question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700020#S00100","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1576600500,"counter":300,"content":"<p>It is worthy to congratulate all those elected to parliament.  People are pointing out that Sinn F&eacute;in did not get as many votes in this election as in previous elections.  The reality, however, is that we stood back and did not run in three constituencies, South Belfast, East Belfast and North Down, because we had an agreement with other parties to have, insofar as possible, pro-Remain candidates elected.  That had an impact but we are where we are.  Sinn F&eacute;in still has seven MPs, as we had going into this election.  It is still the prominent voice of Irish republicans and nationalists in the North and that should not be forgotten.<\/p>  <p>  Support for the union has fallen and I do not say that out of a sense of triumph.  This is the fifth election in a row where unionists have been a minority in the North.  This points us to the kind of future Ireland we are going to have.  We need to come back to that question once again and see how we can resolve these issues.  The talks in the next week or two aimed at getting the Stormont Assembly back up and running are vital to that process.  It is to be remembered that the red lines that people talk about have already been agreed.  The St. Andrews Agreement, Stormont House Agreement and Good Friday Agreement will provide the answers to all of this if they are implemented.  We are going into these talks primarily to try to hold the DUP, in particular, to task.  It must implement the agreements to which it and both Governments have signed up.  We understand that this is a difficult place for the DUP and we are prepared to work with it to try to find a solution.  At the end of the day, both Governments also have a role to play and I know and expect that both Governments will play that role.  However, as we move into the future, we need to look at what this election means.  It means that support for the union is on the wane.

Some &euro;1.76 billion was allocated to the Garda in 2018, and this will increase to an unprecedented &euro;1.882 billion for 2020.  This investment is aiding the sustained growth of the organisation.  I understand that these additional resources have enabled An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to staff appropriately specialist bureaus such as the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, GNDOCB.

Recent reporting about the scale and activities of drug gangs in Dublin, and increasingly throughout the country, has confirmed what I and my party have been saying for several years, namely, that there is a new and sinister level of drug activity taking hold and tackling it must be a core priority for the State at all levels.  We believe the most important response to drug use is a return to the proven system of active and targeted community-based interventions.  That is why we identify the social policy side of government.  For this to work, however, we must also tackle the gangs spreading fear and destruction in their communities and using them as a base to grow their reach into the country.<\/p>  <p>  Perhaps the most sinister part of what these gangs have been doing is recruiting and intimidating children into working for them.  They do this because it spreads the legal risk and creates new networks for them.  One part of the response to this issue must be to make it clear to the gangs that recruiting children opens them up to more severe punishment and penalties.  Deputy John Curran, as the Taoiseach knows, has a Bill that does exactly this.  The Bill passed Second Stage with all-party support and we need it now, not next year.  The Taoiseach committed two months ago to looking at fast-tracking this Bill into law, but so far we have heard nothing.  I ask the Taoiseach again to allow Deputy Curran's Bill to proceed immediately to committee and help ensure that it can become law without delay.<\/p>  <p>  Another new element of the work of the drug gangs, as Interpol has said, is sending people down to provincial towns and cities to sell their product.  This has been seen in Britain and America, in particular.  The devastating impact of drugs in these communities can be swift and overpowering unless this activity is stopped early.  Does the Taoiseach agree that this is an urgent issue, which must become a core priority for the Government?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700020#S01500","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1576600500,"counter":311,"content":"<p>Some months ago, I had the privilege of bringing to the House a large group of men and women who are involved in the Coolmine therapeutic programmes.  We had a conversation about what ages people were when they started to use drugs.  These are people who have devoted many years of their lives to trying to quit drugs and become clean.  In a great number of cases, their involvement with drugs started when they dropped out of the later stages of primary school.  They started using and running drugs from the age of ten, in the case of the youngest man, and aged 12, 13 or 14 in most of the other cases.  The damage is done at an early age.  Earlier this year, the Blanchardstown local drug and alcohol task force produced a report about the fact that drug gangs are now specifically tackling young children.  If young children, as the lowest points in the food chain, are caught, it is difficult enough to prosecute them.  It means, in fact, that the godfathers of the drug gangs get away scot free.<\/p> <p>At the Cabinet sub-committees on security and social policy, are there any serious discussions about the incredible damage being done to individuals, families and whole communities as a result of the fact that children not involved in drugs have to be kept indoors to play on their Xboxes and are not free to go out because of the risk of their being preyed upon by these drugs godfathers and gangsters?  On behalf of these beleaguered communities, will the Taoiseach reinstate community policing to ensure that it will be safe for children to play in their neighbourhoods?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700020#S01700","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576601100,"counter":313,"content":"<p>Drugs gangs operate in most of our deprived communities.  This is a reflection of how the Government's policy has consistently fallen short.  A recent report published by the EU drugs agency and Interpol indicates that the drugs distribution networks in Ireland appear to be structured in three layers.  There is a small top layer of serious players who control the upper end of the market.  There is a middle layer made up of young people engaged in high-risk, low-reward activities such as transporting drugs and guns, as well as carrying out beatings and intimidation.  Then there is a bottom layer comprising young people who are highly disadvantaged and who are involved in assaults and stealing, as well as spreading fear on behalf of the network in small communities mainly in urban areas.  Johnny Connolly, an academic from the University of Limerick, published a report last week in which he found these criminal hotspots, particularly the one in the Dublin south central area, are more likely to be linked to small-scale drug crime involving drug addicts and the activities of drugs networks.  Much of this needs to be dealt with in a targeted way but that is not happening.<\/p>  <p>  There are situations where people find themselves in the grip of these drug gangs and then become addicts.  When they seek help, it is clearly a health issue.  They are sent to a health service that is dysfunctional and that does not work, however.  This is a significant problem for many urban communities and across Ireland.  These people want to get assistance and communities try to bring people forward.  I have come across a number of young people who have sought help.  When they go to a service, however, they find in a short time that they are back in the rat race again because the services do not work for them.  This is the biggest shortfall we have.  While this is about criminality, there is also a health aspect and this is not being dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700021#T00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1576601100,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  I agree with them.  This is an urgent issue that relates to social policy and health policy, as well as to security and criminal justice.  It is intended to review the implementation of the national drugs strategy at the next Cabinet sub-committee meeting on social policy.<\/p>  <p>  Reference was made to the Building Community Resilience report by Dr. Johnny Connolly.  I welcomed the publication of this report.  Dr. Connolly was a member of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, CoFPI.  His report feeds directly into initiatives already under way across Government as we implement that report.  His report explicitly situated its recommendations in the context of the developments within the community safety network that were at the heart of the commission's recommendations.  Deputies support the commission's view that community safety, community policing and Garda visibility are of paramount importance.  I was pleased Dr. Connolly spoke of the importance of the policing and community safety Bill that is being drafted, as well as of the new Garda operating model that is being phased in.  Work on these initiatives is advancing well.<\/p>  <p>  I am particularly concerned about children being lured into criminality at a young age.  The Greentown study is contributing to the development of policy and practice in this area.  In this regard, I highlight the ongoing work of the innovative the joint agency response to crime, JARC, programme, which aims to develop and strengthen a multi-agency approach to the management of prolific offenders, prioritise such offenders for targeted interventions and tackle their behaviour.  In this way, we will reduce crime and victimisation in communities.  As Dr. Connolly pointed out in the Building Community Resilience report, an initial report into the effectiveness of this programme has shown it is promising and can be an effective approach for such offenders.  It is essential to recognise that only a small proportion, as few as 1%, of residents in the communities in question are involved in criminal activity.  As the report rightly points out, we should not unfairly stigmatise those communities as a whole as the majority of people in them are hard-working, law-abiding citizens.  Only a small minority are involved in crime or organised crime.<\/p>  <p>  On the actions we are taking to deal with drug gangs across the country, the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, GNDOCB, leads in tackling all forms of drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs.  The bureau continues to have significant success in tackling these issues.  While it was only established in March 2015, it has already seized controlled substances worth almost &euro;167 million, &euro;10 million in cash believed to be the proceeds of crime, 108 firearms and over 3,000 rounds of ammunition.  To date in 2019, the GNDOCB has been responsible for the seizure of controlled substances to the value of &euro;20 million, &euro;2.4 million in cash believed to be the proceeds of crime and 17 firearms.  A large number of seizures and arrests have been made in recent weeks and months.  Some of the recent successes in this area have included the seizure of approximately &euro;100,000 worth of suspected cannabis in Roscommon and the arrest of two people and the seizure of &euro;100,000 worth of cannabis and cocaine and &euro;2,250 cash in Tipperary.  There was a seizure by the Garda, as part of an intelligence-led operation, of &euro;400,000 worth of cannabis herb, cocaine and diamorphine in Ballymun and Santry on 16 November.  There have been significant seizures in Drogheda.  In Ballymascanlon, County Louth, a haulage vehicle in which cannabis herb valued at over &euro;3 million was being transported was seized.  There was a seizure in Ballyfermot and Park West of &euro;3.5 million in cocaine and diamorphine.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding Europol&rsquo;s 2019 drugs market report, the Government&rsquo;s policy on drug and alcohol misuse is set out in the national drugs strategy.  The latter represents a whole-of-Government response to the problem of drug and alcohol use, adopting a balanced health-led approach aiming to reduce demand as well as access to illegal drugs.  While we seek to help to treat people who use drugs consistent with that strategy, the Garda will continue to be relentless in pursuing those involved in the sale, distribution and supply of drugs.  Targeting the supply of lesser drugs is a priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As recently as 27 November, the Garda Commissioner, the Minister and the assistant commissioner for special crime operations were briefed on the energetic approach being taken by the Garda.  The GNDOCB leads in tackling all forms of drug trafficking.  As already stated, the bureau has had significant success since its establishment in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin referred to Deputy Curran&rsquo;s Bill on stopping criminal gangs from grooming children.  The Government very much appreciates Deputy Curran's work in this regard.  As mentioned by the Minister for Justice and Equality last summer, the Department of Justice and Equality is already working on the matter.  Officials are closely monitoring the findings of the University of Limerick's Greentown study.  The Department of Justice and Equality provided a preliminary analysis of Deputy Curran&rsquo;s Bill which highlighted some significant legal, policy and operational difficulties, including the possibility of inadvertently criminalising children.  However, the Government sees merits in the proposals it contains.  The Minister will engage with Deputy Curran to ensure that these difficulties can be ironed out in order to allow the Bill to progress to Committee Stage.  In the meantime, the Department will continue to consider the most appropriate approach to counteract the grooming of children for criminal activity.  Any solution will need to be developed with the utmost care and co-operation with the Garda, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Departments of Health and Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700021#T00300","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Council Meetings","time":1576601100,"counter":315,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700021#T00400"},{"type":"question","time":1576601100,"counter":316,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[50155\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700021#T00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his plans for official trips abroad over the next six months.","asker":"1353","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1576601100,"counter":317,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[51528\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700021#T00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"his plans for official visits abroad over the next six months.","asker":"1238","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1576601100,"counter":318,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[51823\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700021#T00700","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"his plans for official trips abroad over the next six months.","asker":"1253","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1576601100,"counter":319,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[50337\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700021#T00800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the officials who accompanied him during bilateral meetings with other Heads of Government in Zagreb.","asker":"1224","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1576601100,"counter":320,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[51635\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700021#T00900","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on recent engagements with EU leaders.","asker":"1239","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1576601100,"counter":321,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[52729\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700021#T01000","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his attendance at the December 2019 European Council meeting.","asker":"1353","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1576601100,"counter":322,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[52802\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700021#T01100","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"his plans for official visits over the next six months.","asker":"1239","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1576601100,"counter":323,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[52849\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700021#T01200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on recent engagements with EU leaders.","asker":"1238","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1576601100,"counter":324,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[52983\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700021#T01300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he met with the Prime Minister of Finland at the December 2019 European Council meeting.","asker":"1283","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1576601100,"counter":325,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[52987\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700021#T01400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on the December 2019 European Council meeting.","asker":"1224","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","time":1576601100,"counter":326,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[52988\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700021#T01500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he held bilateral meetings while attending the December 2019 European Council meeting;

We called on the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, to take the negotiations forward with a view to reaching agreement.<\/p><p>On external relations, we discussed EU-Africa relations, Russia and Turkey, as well as expressing solidarity with Albania following a recent earthquake there.  We discussed the situation in the World Trade Organization.<\/p><p>At the euro summit, the new European Central Bank President, Christine Lagarde, gave an assessment of the current economic situation in Europe.  We took stock of progress made by finance ministers on strengthening economic and monetary union.<\/p> <p>Finally, we met in Article 50 format where we invited the Commission to draft a comprehensive mandate for the Council to consider for as close as possible a future relationship between the EU and the UK.<br\/><br\/>Since the European Council in October, I have met several of my colleagues.  I met Charles Michel, the new President of the Council when he visited Dublin on 17 November in advance of formally taking up office.<br\/><br\/>I met the Prime Minister of Croatia, Mr. Plenkovi\u0107, in Zagreb on 21 November, ahead of the Croatian Presidency of the EU.  We discussed the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, Brexit and bilateral relations.  I was accompanied at that meeting by Ireland's ambassador to Croatia and by a small delegation of officials and advisers from my Department.<br\/><br\/>In the margins of last week's European Council, I launched a new climate action forum with the Prime Minister of Denmark, Mr. Frederiksen, and the Prime Minister of Sweden, Mr. L&ouml;fven, which will serve as a useful mechanism for our three countries to exchange best practice between us.<br\/><br\/>I also engaged informally with other counterparts, as I always do, to promote Irish interests, including with the Prime Minister of Finland, Sanna Marin, whom I congratulated on her recent election.<br\/><br\/>Tomorrow, I will have the opportunity to brief the House on the European Council in more detail.<br\/><br\/>On future travel engagements, I plan to attend the European Council meeting in Brussels on 26 and 27 March 2020.  I expect to attend the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos in January, where the theme for the meeting is &quot;Stakeholders for a Cohesive and Sustainable World&quot;.  I also expect to travel to the United States in March for the annual St. Patrick's Day programme of events in Washington DC and Boston.<br\/><br\/>Other visits are being given consideration, but at present none is confirmed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700021#T01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576601700,"counter":332,"content":"<p>As the first question was in the name of Deputy Howlin, I call Deputy Burton.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700022#U00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1576601700,"counter":333,"content":"<p>Has the Taoiseach had an opportunity to consider the proposed new European green deal by the new President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen?

As we know, there is an ongoing dispute in the WTO with the United States of America relating to appointments within the WTO.  Does he anticipate that this will create difficulties with the Brexit negotiations?  If, unfortunately, there were to be any kind of hard Brexit, there could be a reversion to WTO rules.

When I say it is good on aspiration, carbon neutrality by 2050 is not a bad aspiration, but if we were very serious about things, we would be aiming for carbon neutrality by 2030 and taking much more radical measures than are being proposed and we would be considerably more specific in those measures.  Of course, the COP talks did not really achieve much at all.<\/p>  <p>  Looking behind the rhetoric in Europe, the picture is not so good at all.  The Mercosur deal exposes any commitment on the part of Europe to addressing the climate emergency, because at the same time as talking about an environmentally sustainable economic model, Europe is trying to negotiate a deal with the Bolsonaro regime to import large amounts of cheap beef from Latin America based on the cutting down of rainforests, the lungs of the earth.

I think we can all agree that the T&aacute;naiste's claim that his relationship with the US and with Mr. Netanyahu might lead to some form of breakthrough in the Middle East peace process has not turned out to be the case.  More than a year ago the T&aacute;naiste made forceful representations to me that we were on the cusp of a big breakthrough and that Ireland was playing a key role between the US and Israel.  At the time I thought it was wildly optimistic and somewhat na&iuml;ve, but nonetheless it was trying to get the D&aacute;il to pull back from the motion on the trading issue with the settlements and Europe.<\/p>  <p>  In response there have been general statements but no commitment to take any action or advocate any action.  The Government has consistently refused to support the D&aacute;il majority view of the need to act directly to stop illegal settlements from having access to selling their goods here and in other countries.  The justification for this is the claim that it would infringe on European Union competence.  This can be disputed, and we and others have received legal opinion using examples from the past.  However, if what the Government says is true, then the obvious step to take is to seek European Union support for the policy.<\/p>  <p>  So far there is zero evidence of the Taoiseach or T&aacute;naiste advocating for a strengthened economic boycott of illegal settlements or taking any meaningful steps to oppose threatened annexations.  The Government could show its good faith on this by writing to the Council and Commission Presidents, asking for a proposal to take stronger steps to block the illegal settlements from trading with the European Union.  Will the Government take such action or is the Taoiseach saying he is happy that enough has been done on this issue to date?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700022#U00500","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1576601700,"counter":336,"content":"<p>Regarding the Taoiseach's discussions in Europe on future funding, every individual and business, particularly businesses in the Border region is conscious of the impact of Brexit.  Even if there is a deal or process that works out before the end of 2020, which everyone doubts very much, contingency plans will need to be put in place.  It would be quite unfair to require the Irish Exchequer to fund that entirely.  We are in this position as a result of Britain taking a unilateral decision to leave the European Union.  It would be appropriate for the European Union to come to our assistance in respect of that.  I am not just talking about moral assistance and support, but financial assistance to help the businesses that will undoubtedly be dramatically exposed.<\/p>  <p>  In Spain, nine Catalan politicians have been imprisoned because of the holding of an independence referendum.  What is likely to happen with that?  It is clear that the political way forward is through dialogue and engagement, in which EU leaders should be playing a constructive role.  Does the Taoiseach accept that withholding voting rights from citizens on self-determination and the subsequent imprisonment of political leaders in this manner is totally unacceptable and flies in the face of the democratic principles of the European Union?  A similar situation could soon arise very close to us in Scotland with the Parliament in Westminster refusing to allow a referendum on Scottish independence in any circumstances.

More than 5,000 people are currently imprisoned on political charges, with many of them subjected to torture, including sexual abuse.  I will give a few examples.  Nabeel Rajab was incarcerated for posting so-called false tweets criticising Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen and the torture in Bahrain's Jau Prison.<\/p> <p>Hajer\u00a0Mansoor\u00a0Hassan was, incredibly, imprisoned based on the human rights activities of her son-in-law.

There is a consistent pattern of mass trials, where the very idea of justice is a joke.  More than 500 people have been convicted in a process of five mass trials in the past two years.  There is no freedom of expression and one can be convicted of promoting terrorism simply for liking a tweet that is critical of the Government or the ruling family.  Will the Irish Government speak out clearly against this in the context of the trade mission attended by the Minister in November?  It was a major trade mission to the Middle East that included Bahrain.  When asked by Deputy Crowe if concerns had been raised about human rights, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, said that it was not possible to raise our concerns about the human rights situation directly on that occasion.

I am encouraged that President von der Leyen and the new Commission have decided to take a lead on this.  When Ms von der Leyen was nominated by the European Council for Commission president she said she would do so and the President has already shown her sincerity in that regard.  The objective is to transform Europe into the first climate neutral continent by 2050.  The approach, and the way the President and the Commission have framed it, is a very good one.  It is less in the vein of a climate apocalypse and more in terms of the opportunities that can be gained for the European Union in being leaders in climate action, be it creating new jobs and businesses, green growth, new technology, innovation and - in particular - new wealth.  It is just an initial document and it now needs to be built upon and funded.  I believe the European Investment Bank, EIB, has a role in this regard and it may be able to lend up to &euro;1 trillion towards climate action projects in the decades ahead.  The projects must be commercially viable so the money can be returned to the EIB.<\/p>  <p>  The Mercosur political agreement has an environmental clause that requires Latin-American countries to honour their commitments on climate change.  If they do not the deal is off.  This is significant because previous trade deals have not included environmental clauses of that nature.  It may become a model for the future.<\/p>  <p>  On Israel and Palestine, I am strongly supportive of Palestinian statehood and we are strong advocates of the welfare of Palestinians.  We do this in international forums, be they the UN, the EU or in bilateral meetings.  We will continue to do so.  This is well recognised by the Palestinian Authority and by other Arab countries.  With products that are made in the settlements, Ireland intervened to support the labelling case, which now ensures that products made in the settlements are labelled as thus.  This allows people and businesses to boycott them.  In our view, an outright ban on imports would be contrary to European law because trade is a sole competency of the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  We absolutely condemn any human rights abuses, in Bahrain or in any other country.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the WTO, international trade requires agreed rules for countries to trade with each other under a common set of principles.  The WTO is at the core of that system.  For it to function properly it must have a mechanism to resolve disputes.  It is, therefore, very regrettable that the United States of America has decided to block the appointment of new judges to the appellate body.  Without them it cannot function.  At last week's European Council we expressed support for the European Commission's efforts to set up an alternative arbitration panel, interim arrangements, with third countries other than the US, while actively pursuing a permanent solution.  Essentially, it is a work-around, except for disputes that involve the US.

In the Defence Forces, these are matters for highly qualified medical officers having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>  There are three anti-malarial drugs, namely Lariam, Malarone and Doxycycline, used by the Defence Forces.  The selection by a medical officer of the most appropriate drug for use is a complex one and dependent on a number of factors.  Significant precautions are taken by the medical officers in assessing the medical suitability of personnel to take any of the anti-malarial medications.  It is the policy of the Defence Forces that personnel are individually screened for fitness for service overseas and medical suitability for all missions and not just those to sub-Saharan Africa.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the second report of the malaria chemoprophylaxis working group was completed in 2017.  This report set out a number of recommendations relating to planning, training and education, information-sharing and for the establishment of a medical advisory group.  An implementation group has been established and is progressing these recommendations. <\/p>  <p>  The intent is that the medical advisory group will further inform internal and external expert medical advice to the Defence Forces on a range of medical matters, including malaria chemoprophylaxis.  This will provide further supports in the ongoing evolution of Defence Forces medical policy.  These actions will ultimately serve to enhance further the existing medical care provided to all members of the Defence Forces, including those posted overseas. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to access to a wide range of primary care supports, a number of other supports are provided to members of the Defence Forces.  For example the personnel support service makes confidential services, including critical incident stress management and psycho-social support available to all Defence Forces personnel through its network of barrack personnel support service officers and occupational social workers at formation, unit and barrack level.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has arranged the provision of a confidential counselling, referral and support service on a wide range of personal and work-related issues for serving members of the Defence Forces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700025#X00400","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1576603500,"counter":364,"content":"<p>Does the Minister of State believe he and the military authorities are acting undemocratically given that the D&aacute;il, with the exception of the Fine Gael Party, passed a motion instructing him to take action to help alleviate and address the suffering of those who have had an adverse effect because Lariam was issued to them while overseas?  A \"yes\" or \"no\" response will suffice.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State referenced medical experts in his reply.  On 30 September 1989 the World Health Organization warned that the new anti-malaria drug Mefloquine, which is Lariam, may cause severe mental disturbance and other psychiatric or neurological side effects and that airline pilots and others whose jobs involve fine co-ordination and spatial discrimination should not use Mefloquine to prevent malaria.  It went on to say that there were reports of 300 of several thousand patients having experienced neurological and psychiatric side effects associated with the drug.  That was stated by the WHO in 1989.  I have been raising the issue in this House since 2010.

The European Medicines Agency report of 2014 states that there is enough evidence from the presented drug safety reports and the submitted literature report and the US Food and Drug Administration, FDA, assessment report supporting a casual relationship between Mefloquine, which is Lariam, and the occurrence of long-lasting and persistent neuro-psychiatric side effects.

Association with ICTU poses complex questions for the Defence Forces from a legal, operational and management perspective.  I asked my officials to examine this matter further and, in this regard, defence management - civil and military - has engaged in discussions with ICTU.  Defence management has also met the PDF representative associations, RACO and PDFORRA, to discuss this matter.  I have also discussed the matter of ICTU affiliation with both RACO and PDFORRA. <\/p> <p> I am aware of PDFORRA's long-standing ambition to affiliate with ICTU.  I am also aware that RACO, the representative body for commissioned officers, has a conflicting position on this matter.   The implications of possible association or affiliation are being carefully considered and engagement is continuing with PDFORRA and ICTU on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700029#BB00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576606500,"counter":423,"content":"<p>The point that jumps out at me from the Minister of State's answer is that RACO and PDFORRA cannot affiliate to trade unions without the consent of the Minister.  The question is why the Minister is not willing to consent.  We need to tease that out because this has gone on for a very long time.  In the meantime, the Defence Forces are haemorrhaging members and finding it very difficult to retain them.  Figures on the number of people who left the Defence Forces in this year alone show there were 256 discharges in the first four months of 2019, the highest figure since the reorganisation of 2012.  In April alone, there were 86 discharges.  It is worth reminding ourselves that each of these discharges costs the individual concerned &euro;300.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State is burying his head in the sand in not acknowledging that, despite the acceptance by some of a pay offer recently, the problems in the Defence Forces run very deep and are not being resolved.

There has been much talk about that issue.  We have revisited it time and again and there have been meetings and discussions.  It is within the Minister of State's gift to give such consent.  PDFORRA has given a commitment that its members would not engage in strike action.  Reference to RACO is disingenuous because its members are already happy with the internal procedures and forums in place to address their grievances.  I want the Minister of State to acknowledge that whatever deals he has done recently, they will not address the gross underpayment and poor conditions faced by Defence Forces personnel and that their desire and expressed willingness to become part of the ICTU and their belief that they would be better represented in that way should not be ignored, particularly while we face climate chaos.  The people we will rely on most when we have flooding events, landslides, rising sea levels and unique storm events will be the members of the Defence Forces.  If the Defence Forces are demoralised and haemorrhaging members, we cannot expect to get a full and proper service.

The allocation of more than &euro;1 billion for the defence sector for 2020, an increase of &euro;32.3 million on 2019, emphasises the importance attached by the Government to ensuring that the Defence Forces have the resources necessary to deliver on all roles assigned, both at home and overseas. <\/p>  <p>  At national level, representation on the Government task force on emergency planning by both the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces ensures the fullest co-ordination and co-operation in the event of an emergency.

The Defence Forces provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate lead Department in the event of a natural disaster or an emergency in its aid to the civil authority role.  Major emergency plans have been developed by local and regional authorities and these plans identify the procedures for requesting assistance from the Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>  With reference to rescue services, the Irish Coast Guard has overall responsibility for the provision of search and rescue services within the Irish search and rescue region.

The long-suffering woman is a very strong motif in our history and religion but it is not acceptable that people living with chronic, debilitating pain would be dismissed by their doctors, that it takes several years to get a diagnosis and that they would be sent abroad for their healthcare.  This is something many women said would not happen after the repeal of the eighth amendment but it is still happening and 155,000 women are suffering from endometriosis.  Many go to Britain, or even Romania, for treatment.  Let us be absolutely clear that we are dealing with a gender bias in medicine.

Of course, the average time for diagnosis is an astonishing nine years.  I agree with Deputy Coppinger in this regard.

I understand that it is within the scope of a general gynaecologist to diagnose and treat the majority of cases of endometriosis.  Therefore, a GP referral to a gynaecologist is the standard pathway of care for the management of endometriosis in Ireland.  This is similar to the pathway in place for the management of other gynaecological conditions.<\/p>  <p>  Information provided by the HSE indicates that endometriosis can be a difficult condition to diagnose and treat because of the variation of presentations, which can affect the physical, and indeed the mental, well-being of patients to varying degrees.  Treatment may include pain medications, hormone treatment and surgical interventions.  The length of time it takes to diagnose endometriosis varies from patient to patient, because of varying, and sometimes ambiguous, symptom presentation.  The Minister is assured, however, that the provision of training in the management and diagnosis of endometriosis forms an integral part of the specialist medical training programme provided by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE national women and infants health programme has advised that the best way to help the majority of patients with endometriosis is to improve access to gynaecology services.  As such, the programme has developed a plan to increase capacity and reduce waiting times for women awaiting general gynaecology, which includes patients with endometriosis.  The plan aims to re-orient general gynaecology services to an ambulatory, or see and treat, model rather than the traditional outpatient referral model.  An ambulatory care model is a more efficient and effective use of resources.  It is also better for the patient as it reduces the requirement for multiple outpatient appointments.  The programme will progress as planned in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that a new women's health task force was established in the Department of Health in September 2019.  The purpose of the task force is to improve women's health outcomes and women's experiences of healthcare.  The task force is at an early stage of its work and is considering the full range of issues affecting women's health in Ireland.  The task force will tackle a wide range of issues impacting women's health outcomes in Ireland and will work on these on a phased, prioritised basis.  Each week, external experts in the area of women's health meet members of the task force in the Department of Health to inform its work.  This initiative has been under way since the task force was established.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the Endometriosis Association of Ireland recently presented to members of the task force, highlighting this important issue that affects many women in Ireland.  This issue will be considered by the task force alongside a range of other issues affecting women's health.  Priority action areas will be decided by the task force in consultation with stakeholders, including the public.  The first action of the task force will be to initiate a national listening exercise, inviting women in Ireland to share their experiences of, and solutions for, the health system, and this will commence in early 2020.

I appreciate that we have had many discussions, but on some occasion I would appreciate if the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, was in a position to listen to some of these discussions.  I appreciate the Minister of State's interest in this area and his desire to tackle it, but this is a massive issue and the community health organisation, CHO, for Cork and Kerry seems to be constantly below other areas in respect of the services provided.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the waiting times people in Cork city and the surrounding areas have been experiencing are outrageous.  The point of community services is to reduce the pressure on the acute services.  That is the theory of them and the primary care centres.  If we look at the kind of waiting times that exist for psychiatry and for psychology and for psychiatry and psychology in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, it clearly is not succeeding in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  I will start with psychiatry.  In some areas, such as in Carrigaline, there is an average waiting time of six months.  In response to a parliamentary question I asked on that issue, I was told that there is not a requirement at present to recruit further.<\/p> <p>When one considers the pressure under which the primary care centre is, I do not understand why no positions are required.  Is that under A Vision for Change or is some other metric being used to determine that?  A six-month wait for psychiatry is far too long.  Six months is a tortuous length of time to be waiting for any kind of treatment.  Anyone who is referred to a psychiatrist is likely to be facing a crisis situation.  It is unacceptable that people in the Carrigaline area, which takes in Douglas and Passage for the purposes of the community health area, are waiting six months to be seen by psychiatrists.<\/p> <p> The story is similarly grim, even worse, when it comes to psychology services.  Some of the psychology waiting times in community settings include nine months for the Ballyphehane-Togher sector, six months for Douglas and Carrigaline and 17 months for Ballincollig-Bishopstown.  Again, it was stated there is no requirement for further recruitment.  I cannot understand the HSE&rsquo;s basis for stating these times are acceptable and it does not need to do any more.  It is unacceptable.<\/p> <p> The story is similarly dreadful for CAMHS, the child and adolescent mental health services.  There are 646 children on the waiting list, 192 of whom have been waiting over a year.  These are vulnerable children and adolescents with real mental health issues.  In many instances, life may hang in the balance.  Certainly, welfare hangs in the balance.  To put this in context, two years ago it came to national attention that there were spikes in suicide and self-harm in the Cork city area.  It is still the case that the Cork city area is way above the national average for suicide among men and self-harm among women.  That has been the case for a decade.  While mental health is broader and takes in much more than that, clearly investing in psychology and psychiatry in community and CAMHS settings is crucial to assisting people in crisis situations.  In that regard, people are being failed when one is looking at psychiatry lists of between six and 17 months.  This is unacceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700034#GG02000","speaker":"1287","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576609500,"counter":498,"content":"<p>Mental health continues to be a priority area for the Government.

This represents an increase of over &euro;315 million, or 45%, since 2012.<\/p>  <p>  This funding will help in the continued improvement and development of mental health services.  Funding by itself is not enough, however.  We also need to look at how we deliver services and how we can reduce demand for the specialist mental health services by treating people at as early a stage as possible. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, the HSE is introducing several digital mental health initiatives driven by the Department of Health.  These include tele-counselling and tele-psychiatry projects, which will provide remote counselling and psychiatric consultations, as well as helping to improve access to these services.  Greater use of available technology will help to deliver services at an earlier stage, helping to ensure that mild mental health issues are dealt with before they become more serious.<\/p>  <p>  These initiatives exemplify the serious intent of the Government to progress and improve mental health services.  We have also enhanced mental health services provided in primary care.  The introduction of 114 assistant psychologists and 20 psychologists in primary care has produced a 28% increase in referrals, which will total approximately 14,000 in 2019.  This has helped to reduce the national waiting list for CAMHS to around 2,000, a decrease of 500 or 20% since December 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Funding for seven of these psychologist posts and 16 of the assistant psychology posts for the Cork-Kerry area has ensured this trend is reflected in this region.  The number of young people waiting to access CAMHS has reduced by 14% from 667 in January 2019 to 574 in October 2019.  Despite this, it is recognised that the Cork-Kerry region CAMHS waiting list number must be reduced further.<\/p>  <p>  Adult services in Cork are provided through 19 adult community mental health teams, five psychiatry of later life teams, three home-based treatment teams, a specialist rehabilitation team, a specialist homeless team and a mental health and intellectual disability team.

It was done by introducing 134 psychologists into the system last year, on top of the existing infrastructure.  It was also done by bringing in a lower level infrastructure which is catching people at an earlier time and preventing it from escalating.  That is not a waiting list initiative which will see it shoot back up again.  It is a structural reform with better organising what we do and how we do it and building lower level infrastructure.  While we could continue to keep employing more psychiatrists, we need to pull back and look at lower level interventions and building that up.  That is what we have done and it has worked.  The figures have been independently verified.  This year it could even be a 25% reduction.  That is a significant reduction in any waiting list.  More importantly and crucially, it is sustainable.<\/p>  <p>  In my time in office, I have tried to ensure that everything we do is sustainable and replicated year after year.  It is not about just throwing an extra &euro;10 million at it this year to bring a waiting list down when it goes back up next year.

The current funding arrangements in relation to the A5 are also governed by the Fresh Start agreement.  Under this agreement, the Government is committed to providing funding of &pound;75 million towards the cost of phase 1A of the A5 upgrade scheme once the statutory planning process in Northern Ireland is concluded.  The implementation of the A5 upgrade project is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland authorities.  As is the case for the all such capital projects, the A5 upgrade scheme is subject to the planning assessment and approval process in Northern Ireland, and since 2012 there have been a number of legal challenges to approvals related to the scheme, leading to unavoidable delays to implementing the proposed scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Following the conclusion of legal action in 2018, the Department for Infrastructure updated project environmental assessments and undertook a public consultation on a number of environmental reports, including the environmental statement addendum 2019.  Having reviewed the responses, the Department concluded that a further public inquiry is required.  It is understood that the inquiry will be held in February 2020.  Allowing for the time required for the conclusion of the public inquiry and for a new decision to be taken on whether to proceed with the scheme together with the possibility of a further legal challenge, the timeframe for the start of construction of phase 1A of the A5 project is uncertain.  In view of the current state of play regarding the A5 scheme and the timeframes involved, provision is not being made in the calendar year 2020 for funding for the scheme.  The Government remains committed to the &pound;75 million contribution and the senior officials group established on foot of the Fresh Start agreement will continue to liaise regarding the project with a view to delivering on that commitment.<\/p>  <p>  A Fresh Start - the Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan, includes a commitment that the Northern Ireland Executive and the Irish Government would undertake a review of the Narrow Water bridge project with a view to identifying options for future development for consideration by the North-South Ministerial Council, the NSMC.  A progress report regarding consideration of options for a Narrow Water bridge was considered by the NSMC in July 2016 and the Council decided that work should continue on the development of options.  While the NSMC has not been sitting for a number of years, the senior officials group, comprising officials from Northern Ireland and the South, which is responsible for liaison in respect of the Fresh Start agreement, has been meeting.  Senior officials have continued to review of options around the Narrow Water Bridge proposal, which has included meetings with relevant stakeholders.  In engaging with stakeholders, officials have highlighted the need to assess all potential options objectively to ensure the best outcome for the area and the best use of public funds.  In this context the criteria identified for assessing options were: linking the two communities on both sides of the Border; encouraging and enhancing overall tourism in the cross-Border region; and protecting the natural environment on both sides of the Border.  Following on from that, the Northern Ireland Department for Infrastructure started work on preparing an business case for a Narrow Water bridge scheme.  The purpose of the business case is to consider the need to construct a bridge over the Newry river and appraise options to ensure any proposal put forward is likely to represent value for money.  My Department has provided input into this work.<\/p>  <p>  It is the case that the proposal for the Narrow Water bridge must be considered in light of welcome developments relating to the Newry southern relief road, NSRR, since 2016.  The NSRR, which is included in the Belfast city deal, would provide an alternative route for strategic traffic that avoids Newry city centre and links to the eastern seaboard, the A1-N1 Belfast to Dublin key transport corridor, which includes road and rail links between Larne and the border at Newry, facilitating onward travel to Dublin and improving access to other regional gateways.  The Department for Infrastructure has conducted a community consultation on the NSRR this year to help identify clearly the advantages and disadvantages in environmental, engineering, economic and traffic terms of the preferred route.<\/p>  <p>  The current proposal for the NSRR is likely to include pedestrian and cycling provision as well as connectivity to the B79-RI73 Fathom Line leading to Omeath and Carlingford. The overall assessment of the case for a Narrow Water bridge, including in the context of developing a wider tourism initiative for the region, is not at a stage where there is a clearly defined and costed scheme.

A development such as this would bring great trade, tourism and connectivity to both communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700037#KK00400","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1576610700,"counter":512,"content":"<p>There appear to be further delays with the proposal to get the A5 upgrade going, which is regrettable.<\/p> <p>That is beyond the powers of the Oireachtas or any Minister here.

There will be no pullback on that either.  As the Deputy said, and as he knows, what is happening is there are perfectly legitimate, and very regrettable in many ways, delays on this and they are on the other side of the Border.  We cannot do anything about them.  They have been going on for a long time and every time there is one legal action it seems to be followed by another.  These are proper planning objections and they are right.  Those of us in a hurry to benefit the Border region and benefit tourism and show commitment to cross-Border roads and bridges regret this is happening but we must allow these procedures to happen.<\/p>  <p>  Let me assure the Deputy that our commitment to the A5, which is a cross-Border commitment and a cross-Government commitment, is as great as his was when he was in government.  At the earliest opportunity, that cross-Border project will go ahead.  It is not our doing that is holding it back.

There is no hesitation there either but there are certain difficulties because of the options presented.

There are two primary purposes of the Appropriation Bill.  First, it provides authorisation in law for all of the expenditure that has been undertaken in 2019 on the basis of the Estimates, which were voted on by the D&aacute;il during the year.  Section 1 and schedule 1 set out the amounts to be appropriated for supply services.  These relate to the amounts included in the Revised Estimates and Further Revised Estimates for 2019 voted by the D&aacute;il earlier this year, and the Supplementary Estimates voted by the D&aacute;il on 12 December.  In aggregate, these Estimates amount to &euro;54.6 billion.  The comparable amount in the Appropriation Act 2018 was &euro;50.9 billion.  The amount to be appropriated this year, therefore, represents an increase of &euro;3.7 billion or 7% on last year's net voted expenditure.  In aggregate, taking into account expenditure of the Social Insurance Fund and the National Training Fund, total gross voted expenditure is forecast to total roughly &euro;67.6 billion this year.  This represents a significant investment to support the delivery of essential public services and to provide for the necessary infrastructure to support social and economic progress.<\/p>  <p>  The second key purpose of the Appropriation Bill is to provide a legal basis for spending to continue into 2020 in the period before the D&aacute;il votes on the 2020 Estimates.  If the Bill were not enacted before the end of December there would be no authority to spend any Voted moneys in 2020 from the start of January until approval of the 2020 Estimates, since this authority for 2020, as contained in the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act 1965, is based on the amounts provided for in the Appropriation Bill 2019 itself.<\/p>  <p>  Under the rolling multi-annual capital envelopes introduced in budget 2004 Departments may carry over, from the current year to the following year, unspent capital up to a maximum of 10% of voted capital.  This reflects the difficulty in planning for major capital projects and provides some flexibility for Departments.<\/p>  <p>  The Appropriation Act determines definitively the capital amounts which may be carried over to the following year.  The aggregate amount of proposed capital carryover from 2019 into 2020 is &euro;215.4 million, which represents 2.9% of the total Exchequer capital programme of &euro;7.3 billion for 2019.  This figure is higher than last year's carryover figure of &euro;93 million, which amounted to 1.5% of the 2019 capital allocation.  This is in the context of an increase of &euro;1.3 billion of capital expenditure included in the Revised Estimates Volume 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed amounts in unspent capital to be carried over by Vote are set out in Schedule 2 to the Bill.  The 2020 Revised Estimates Volume will set out detailed financial and key performance information for Departments and Offices.  In Part Il of the Estimates, for each Vote availing of the capital carryover facility, a table will be included listing the amounts to be deferred by sub-head.  In line with last year's Appropriation Act, section 3 of the Bill includes a specific provision to allow for an advance, not exceeding &euro;185 million, from the Central Fund to the Paymaster General's supply account, with this advance then being repaid to the Central Fund in January 2020.<\/p> <p>The need for this provision arises as certain Exchequer liabilities and social welfare payments which form part of the supply services for 2020 are due for payment by electronic fund transfer on 1 or 2 January 2020.  With the banking system closed on 1 January, funding will need to be in place in departmental bank accounts before the end of this year to meet those liabilities on a timely basis.  In addition, An Post needs to be pre-funded before the end of 2019 in respect of certain payments due in the first week of January 2020 in order for it to transfer payments from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to its network of post offices throughout the country. <\/p> <p> The annual Appropriation Bill is an essential element of housekeeping undertaken by the D&aacute;il.  The passing of the Bill will authorise in law all of the expenditure that has been undertaken in 2019 on the basis of the Estimates voted on by the D&aacute;il during the year.  The passage of the Bill will also ensure that payments funded from voted expenditure in 2019 such as the housing assistance payment, jobseeker's allowance, disability allowance, non-contributory State pension, nurses' pay, teachers' pay and all other pay and pensions funded from voted money can continue to be funded in 2020 in the period before the D&aacute;il approves the 2020 Estimates.<\/p> <p> I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700038#LL00400","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576611900,"counter":518,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aring;il will be supporting this Bill, which, as alluded to by the Minister of State, is technical legislation.

As stated by the Minister of State, the Bill provides statutory authority for the amounts voted by the D&aacute;il during the year.  These amounts include the original Estimates, Revised Estimates and Supplementary Estimates.  However, it would be helpful if the Minister could outline if the recent announcement that RT&Eacute; is to receive an extra &euro;10 million from the Government and reports that an emergency fund is to be established for childcare providers have been provided for in any of the Revised Estimates since budget day.  In my opinion, it is a politicised move if this has taken place without any consultation with my party since October given that we had budget discussions and facilitated its passing.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on that issue in his closing statement.<\/p>  <p>  The sum of &euro;54,582,294,000 is granted from the Central Fund to the proper supply of services.  The sum of &euro;2,691,119,000 is the appropriations-in-aid.  Appropriations-in-aid are revenues received by the particular area that are retained by that area for the use of expenditure.  In other words, they do not go to the Central Fund.  For example, the Director of Public Prosecutions might have a gross expenditure of &euro;43,719,000 but because of appropriations-in-aid of &euro;910,000, the amount it would need to extract from the Central Fund is &euro;42,809,000.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill also provides for sums deferred into the year ended 31 December 2020.  The term \"capital supply service and purpose\" means a supply service voted by the D&aacute;il, the purpose of which is to create an asset intended for the use on a continuing basis with an expected life of more than one year.  These are sums for which surrender is deferred into 2020.  This is mostly salaries and expenses for 14 offices and Departments of Government to allow for the continuing supply of services.

These are for amounts given in the Revised Estimates for this year and the Supplementary Estimates which were considered last week.  In total, these Estimates amount to approximately &euro;55 billion.<\/p>  <p>  Without rehearsing the arguments made last week, I note that the Supplementary Estimate provided for the health service has become an annual tradition.  It is the result of underfunding at the beginning of the year, only to be plugged by unsustainable corporate tax receipts at the end of the year.  As has been made clear by the Parliamentary Budget Office, the Government is failing abjectly to convert additional funding into better outcomes for patients by pursuing the false economy of a recruitment freeze that inhibits the opening of more beds and inadequate home help hours that result in patients taking up hospital beds when they could otherwise be discharged.

The Minister of State's colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, announced that she was astonished that in some cases insurance fees for cr&egrave;ches and such like had increased from &euro;3,000 to &euro;8,000 to &euro;10,000 because of companies leaving the market.  <\/p>  <p>  A report was published yesterday by the Central Bank of Ireland in regard to how insurance companies are gouging ordinary people who are paying motor insurance and do not make false claims.  The people who make the false claims should be dealt with, but they are a tiny minority among all of the people who properly pay their insurance and do not make false claims.  It would have been possible to offer temporary insurance to many of the organisations to which I am referring, including cr&egrave;ches, using the facility of the Irish Public Bodies Insurance company, which is a State owned insurance company, to avoid the risk of valuable community and social enterprises and small businesses closing while the Government seeks to address the real problems caused by the difficulties in insurance.  I am sure the Minister of State has met many of these business operators.  The situation in regard to cr&egrave;ches coming into the new year is a disaster.  The Government should consider the Labour Party proposal in regard to the Irish Public Bodies Insurance company.  Such provision could have been easily made through the mechanism of these or other provisions and decisions of the Government.  <\/p>  <p>  The Labour Party will not be objecting to the passage of this legislation because it is necessary to make payments but it is a black mark against the Government that insurance is in chaos yet again and many valuable community services, particularly cr&egrave;ches, may be forced to close for lack of insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700039#MM00400","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1576612500,"counter":521,"content":"<p>I point out to Deputy Cowen that the moneys for various areas announced since the budget will be dealt with in the Revised Estimates next year.

The Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Health this year is &euro;338 million.  Last year, it was &euro;655 million.  In total, there was &euro;1.35 billion in Supplementary Estimates last year, whereas this year there is &euro;600 million.<\/p>  <p>  Insurance is a major issue with which I am dealing.  I have been in this job for almost two and a half years.  On no occasion has any representative of the childcare sector come to me on insurance issues in the sector.  Similarly, the cost of insurance working group, which was established almost a year before I was appointed, has not been contacted on the matter.  For almost four years, no issue was raised regarding insurance in the childcare sector.  There is currently such an issue.  There are two brokers operating in the sector.  One of them has lost its underwriter for the sector.  The other broker is operating for the sector with an Irish-based insurance company with which there is no issue.  It is open for business and has additional capacity to cater for the childcare sector.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that if there is a claim against a business, its premium will increase substantially the following year.  If there are multiple claims against a business, many insurance companies will not offer it insurance.  That is the case in almost every sector.  In too many areas, whether sporting organisations, childcare or elsewhere, there is insufficient governance, oversight or structures in place for the overall sector.  We must ensure that those elements are put in place because if that is done, insurance companies will be able to see that premises or businesses are being run correctly.  This is not the right forum for a conversation on insurance.<\/p>  <p>  I fully accept Deputy Burton's bona fides in raising the matter.  I am happy to present on insurance to the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, of which she is a member.  Last week, the Law Reform Commission, LRC, published its report on insurance, while the report of the Central Bank was published this week.

The Act was commenced on 31 October last and the fund was subsequently seeded with a &euro;1.5 billion transfer from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, on 15 November.<\/p><p>Before dealing with the substance of and rationale behind the motion, I wish to reflect briefly on the fact that although we have made great strides in recent years as a country and an economy, this is no time be to be self-satisfied or complacent.  New challenges emerging internationally have the potential to shape our economic prospects for years to come.  I wish to touch briefly on one of those challenges, namely, Brexit.  Deputies will be aware that our hope is that the withdrawal of the United Kingdom will take place based on the deal agreed between it and the EU at the European Council last October.<\/p> <p>Despite the outcome of the general election in the UK, the ultimate outcome remains uncertain and a disorderly exit at the end of the transition period in 2020 remains a distinct possibility.  No UK exit is good for Ireland.  Anything that disrupts the ease of trade between Ireland and the UK will be bad for Ireland.  Along with this, the loss of a large member state that has actively promoted free trade and liberal values will come at a considerable cost to a small country such as Ireland, where free and open trade has been the driving force behind the convergence of living standards to European norms.  Brexit, in whatever form it takes, will soon be a reality and our economy must adapt.  The Government can and will help to ease the transition but our economy will have to adjust to a new reality.           <\/p> <p> The motion is a consequence of the Government's Brexit stance.  Under section 5(2) of the Act, the Minister for Finance is required to make a payment of &euro;500 million from the Exchequer to the rainy day fund every year from 2019 to 2023, inclusive.  The Act also provides, under section 6, that in any given year, the Minister may make a proposal to the House not to transfer the annual &euro;500 million contribution to the fund.  The proposal can be made when the Minister is satisfied on reasonable grounds that, by reason of the existence of exceptional circumstances, the making of the payment of the prescribed amount into the fund would place an undue burden on the public finances.  In response to the Minister's proposal, such as that stated in the motion, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann may pass a resolution authorising the Minister not to pay the prescribed amount into the fund for that year.         <\/p> <p> The rationale behind the rainy day fund is to accumulate funding that can be deployed in the event of an adverse shock to the economy.  Given the size and openness of the economy, the use of such funding is an important way to protect the economy in more challenging times.  In his Budget Statement on 8 October, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, stated that if the economic impact of a no-deal Brexit was more severe than forecast, he was prepared to use resources that would otherwise have been dedicated to the rainy day fund to address the impact.  Given that a no-deal Brexit was seen as likely at the time of the budget's publication, the Minister announced his decision not to transfer &euro;500 million from the Exchequer this year as part of his Budget Statement.  Although the outcome of the UK election has reduced the probability of a no-deal Brexit in the short term, I reiterate that the ultimate outcome remains uncertain and that a disorderly exit at the end of the transition period in 2020 remains a possibility.<\/p> <p> The motion is the statute-based follow-through on the Minister's announcement.  Such action is the appropriate response to the more challenging economic environment we may face.  It will help to ensure we have the right supports in place within the Exchequer to protect the economy from the impacts of Brexit and that the Government can continue to protect the funding of our public services in the immediate aftermath of a no-deal Brexit.  I commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700040#NN01600","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576613100,"counter":537,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that significant risks still face the economy in respect of Brexit.  As for the economic relationship between Ireland and the UK, the issue has just been moved into the next phase, namely, the negotiation of the future relationship.  In light of what has emerged from the newly elected British Government, whereby a hard deadline will be imposed on the talks, the risk of a disorderly Brexit has resurfaced.  We all know what the consequences would be for Ireland's economic and trading relationship with the UK.  A disorderly Brexit at the end of 2020 would mean the imposition of customs and an effective regulatory border between Great Britain and Ireland.  They are significant issues, and notwithstanding what has been agreed in the withdrawal agreement, the core economic relationship in the future will be determined by the negotiations.  There are other risks, not least the weak European economy, the prolonged period of low growth among a number of our main trading partners and the trade tensions that persist among the main trading nations of the world.<\/p>  <p>  It should be acknowledged that while the rainy day fund has been established in law, which is welcome, as is the &euro;1.5 billion in the fund, arising from the one-off transfer from the ISIF, the rainy day fund should be in a much stronger position than it is.  The criticisms of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, about the Government's handling of the public finances, were well made, not least in light of the points it made about the tailwinds at our back as a country in recent years, the boom in corporation tax receipts and the historic prolonged period of low interest rates.  IFAC has estimated that yearly tailwinds have risen to between &euro;10 billion and &euro;14 billion, yet the deficit in the public finances improved by only approximately &euro;3 billion between 2015 and 2018.  The council made the point that budget 2020 projected a surplus for 2019 and a return to deficit in 2020, even without disorderly Brexit-related spending, although the central scenario in the budget was a disorderly Brexit, which we all continue to work to avoid.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of the overdependence on corporation tax, which is acute and is now a significant risk to the public finances and the economy, we are likely to collect approximately &euro;11 billion in corporation tax by the end of the year, which is welcome.  The receipts are very strong but IFAC estimates that the excess could contribute between &euro;2 billion and &euro;6 billion to the Government's yearly revenues.<\/p>  <p>  There is a prospect, albeit unquantifiable, of the receipts not recurring.  The Government has made permanent expenditure commitments on foot of the receipts but if they do not repeat year in, year out, we will be left very exposed.  IFAC also made the point that the structural budget balance, based on the Department's measure, has deteriorated in recent years.  Despite all the factors in our favour, the underlying public finance position has not improved in a manner that one might have expected.<\/p>  <p>  We will reluctantly support the motion.  We support the concept of a rainy day fund, as does IFAC.  In its recent summary assessment, it stated the Government needs to \"use the rainy day fund and a prudence account to save temporary receipts, including saving unexpected corporation tax receipts so that they cannot be used to finance overruns in other areas\".  We agree with that, but in the round, given that the risk of a disorderly Brexit remains in place and may not be as remote as we had thought a matter of days ago, we will support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700041#OO00200","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1576613100,"counter":538,"content":"<p>For many people, not least exporters in the Border region, it is already raining in respect of Brexit.  The fear of a disorderly Brexit and the atmosphere that has grown around that have been damaging for many companies and exporters, and our agrifood sector, in particular, has been damaged and remains so.  While I acknowledge that the &euro;500 million to guard against that may be useful, I posed a question earlier to the Taoiseach on the relevance of Europe in regard to the issue and the EU's responsibility.  Ireland has been damaged by a European scenario, given that our closest neighbour, the UK, has decided to leave the EU and we are the collateral damage.<\/p> <p>Most people would firmly agree that the protection of our structures and our economy should not just be the responsibility of the Irish taxpayer.  It should also be the responsibility of the EU, which needs to come up to the plate in this regard.  It is not enough to give us some moral support because we need more than that.  The businesses in the Border region of which I am aware need much more than moral support.  Although Brexit and where it might take us is one of our biggest sources of fear with regard to the international economy, the international trade wars, which are mainly being aggressively pushed forward by Trump's America, are also coming home to bite in some areas.  This development could have an impact on other issues.  As a very open economy, we are very open to being damaged by the factors that influence the global markets.  The notion that Brexit is the only problem we have is incorrect, unfortunately.  Other things that may come at us in the coming months and years could be equally damaging.<\/p> <p> I would like to focus on the rainy day fund.  As I said, for many people it is already raining.  There is an immense infrastructure deficit in rural communities in constituencies like Sligo-Leitrim, which I represent.  We need to see investment in broadband, in roads and in bringing jobs into such areas.  We need to develop the economy in the areas where the most potential lies.  We encourage the Government to use any funds that may be available for such purposes.  The concept of a rainy day fund flies in the face of logic for many people across a large sector of our economy who believe they are still struggling with austerity.  I remind the House that many people are concerned that austerity has not left.  When they hear that a fund is being amassed for a rainy day, they ask who will decide that such a day has arrived.  Will it be a rainy day that the banks, the insurance corporations or the people in some other part of the corporate sector bring on us again?  In the event of another disaster, will the taxpayer have to roll in once more to fund these entities rather than investing in the economy to protect ordinary working people who are struggling hard?  It must be acknowledged that many people are finding it difficult to manage.<\/p> <p> We support the notion that this money should not be put aside.  It needs to be spent wisely.  It needs to be invested to get a return for the many regions of this country that have been left behind.  It can be seen from the Project Ireland 2040 plan, which is very much about trying to put money back into areas that have been left behind, that even the Government acknowledges that this is an issue.  Of course many of us would say that Project Ireland 2040 does not go far enough.  I suggest that &euro;500 million is small money compared to what needs to be spent in many of the regions.  In that context, we will support this initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700041#OO00300","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576613700,"counter":540,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has told the House that the Act which established the rainy day fund \"was commenced on 31 October last and the fund was subsequently seeded with a &euro;1.5 billion transfer from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, on 15 November\".

The bailing out of the banks is one of the recognised purposes of the rainy day fund.  It has a couple of other purposes.  It turns out that Brexit, which is genuinely one of the greatest challenges we have ever faced, does not qualify for the rainy day fund.  If a number of enterprises close down as a consequence of a really hard Brexit - we hope this does not happen in any way - the rainy day fund will not be able to come to their aid.  I am sure the Minister's officials will confirm that the rainy day fund will not be able to come to the aid of enterprises or other institutions that need urgent funding as a result of a hard Brexit.  I think there has been a great deal of agreement in this House about Brexit.  Nobody wants any Brexit, if at all possible.  We have to face the possibility that there could be a difficult Brexit or even a very hard Brexit.  If the UK just drops out of the EU as part of a very hard Brexit, the situation could be genuinely very difficult for Ireland because the World Trade Organization, unfortunately, is in total disarray and is unable to form panels.  I hope nothing like that happens.<\/p>  <p>  Having spoken against the creation of the rainy day fund, I must explain that I opposed the Minister's decision to raid the strategic investment fund for &euro;1.5 billion because this country has another crisis, in addition to Brexit, that relates to capital funding.  I am referring to the housing crisis.  If the Minister walks around Dublin city tonight, within ten minutes he will have seen five or six people sleeping rough and begging on all the streets leading to Grafton Street.  It is really hurtful for many people to see this in the capital city of a country as rich as Ireland.  The strategic investment fund has a clear purpose.  It was established when the previous Government was in power.  One of its potential uses is to put appropriate capital funding into certain areas.  This would include putting appropriate funding into the housing market.  We have a great deal of State land in this country at the moment, but we have no capacity to fund social housing on that land.  The Minister has locked away &euro;1.5 billion which was previously in a strategic investment fund.  This is an example of playing around with money.  It is an accounting trick that involves transferring money from one set of reserves to another set of reserves.  The difference is that there are strict controls on what the rainy day fund reserves may be used for.  As those reserves came from the strategic investment fund, they could have been used for a variety of significant purposes.  They could have been used to make a key investment in the development of housing for those who need it so badly.  Having set up, funded and seeded the rainy day fund as recently as October or November of this year, the Minister is now crying off from his original plans.  In fairness to him, he announced on budget day that he would do this, but all I can say is that it makes a joke of Fine Gael's stewardship of the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700042#PP01200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1576613700,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I support the proposal not to pay &euro;500 million into the rainy day fund for 2019 in the context of the ongoing exceptional circumstances of the UK's proposed withdrawal from the EU.  The Minister announced a &euro;1.2 billion package, excluding EU funding for Brexit, in budget 2020.  He said on that occasion that he was prepared to use resources that would otherwise go to the rainy day fund.  The purpose of this was to address the possibility of an adverse shock to the economy.  After the disastrous outcome of last week's general election in the UK, many commentators immediately said that the result at least brought certainty.  Although it is clear that the UK will leave the EU on 31 January 2020, the uncertainty associated with Brexit is surely destined to continue.  It seems likely that we could again be facing a no-deal, cliff-edge, full-trade Brexit at the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020.  We learned today from the UK Prime Minister that the House of Commons will shortly include this date in statute as the definitive date for the end of the UK's transition into a future EU-UK trade agreement.<\/p> <p>Even after the future customs and trade arrangements for Northern Ireland are made, uncertainty will continue.  Most of all, there is a strong possibility that last week&rsquo;s election was the last general election in the current United Kingdom as Scotland moves decisively to independence alongside Ireland within the EU.  If the Scottish Labour Party and labour movement now throw their weight behind Scotland&rsquo;s push for independence, Scottish freedom will be impossible to stop.  It is timely, therefore, to hold the additional &euro;500 million for the rainy day fund in the Exchequer this year.  In his budget speech and again tonight, the Minister stated that the &euro;1.5 billion would be transferred to the fund from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.  I ask him for a report on how that proposal has worked out in the past month.  <br\/><br\/>When we discussed the National Surplus (Reserve Fund for Exceptional Contingencies) Act 2018 last January, I outlined my continuing opposition to the establishment of the rainy day fund.  I believed then, and still believe, that all available current and capital resources should be allocated to addressing crucial needs of our constituents, especially in health, disability and home care services, housing, education, security and other services, and for the restoration of salaries for all public servants to pre-crash levels.  We know the sad history of the National Pensions Reserve Fund from 2001 and how that fund was decimated by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party and later splurged on the outrageous blanket bank guarantee supported by Fine Gael and, tragically, the Labour Party.<br\/><br\/>I ask that the Minister update the House on the current cash and near cash reserves of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, the current assets of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and the current estimated State shareholdings in the major pillar banks.  Those shareholdings were originally earmarked to pay down part of our still huge national debt.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council reminded a recent meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight that the Government debt burden is the sixth highest in the OECD.  This time last year, Ireland&rsquo;s net debt burden was equivalent to 90% of GNI*.  Only France, Portugal, Italy, Japan and Greece have higher net debt burdens in the OECD.  <i>The Economist<\/i>&rsquo; 2020 world economy survey finds that Ireland's <i>per capita<\/i>income is the highest of all the countries surveyed, surpassing that of states such as Singapore and Switzerland, although I note that no analysis of Luxembourg is provided.  We know, however, that every Irish citizen has a national debt <i>per capita<\/i>burden equal to nearly half of these elevated <i>per capita<\/i>statistics, which are scarcely believable in light of foreign direct investment.  IFAC and other commentators continue to urge that the rainy day fund and what IFAC describes as a prudence account should encompass so-called temporary receipts, including unexpected corporation tax receipts.  Most people would feel that the opportunity cost of salting away another &euro;500 million from current revenues in one year and the &euro;1.5 billion from the strategic investment fund is vast and this money would be better used for much-needed productive capital investment in our economy. <br\/><br\/>It was the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, who first came forward with the rainy day fund idea, which followed up on an original proposal by Deputy Michael McGrath.  The rainy day fund is certainly part of the Fianna F&aacute;il-Fine Gael joint policy.  <br\/><br\/>I support the creation of a national wealth fund like the funds in place in Norway or China but only when the profound needs of our people in health, housing and other critical areas have been addressed by Government.  It was not opportune or necessary to create this fund earlier this year.  Now we see that within weeks, as Deputy Burton said, we will have to change our plans and put this &euro;500 million back into the national account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700042#PP01300","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576614300,"counter":553,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion this evening.  This rainy day fund is a tool developed by the Government to act as a buffer against fiscal shocks.  In general, these funds are used to set aside money during good economic times to support the economy during downturns.  I accept that there are uncertain times ahead following the UK elections and the backing the electorate gave to Boris Johnson to go ahead with Brexit.  However, the decision not to continue to pay into this fund and to use the UK's withdrawal from Europe is another example of this Government backing away from its legal obligations.<\/p>  <p>  I have lost trust in the Government to provide adequately for all the people of Ireland in a fair and equal manner.  We see homeless children seated on cardboard eating on our streets, elderly people lying in corridors in hospitals, our roads turning into dirt tracks and the families of disabled people left to fend for themselves.  Our farmers and fishermen are still reeling from the storms and fodder crisis of 2018.  At that time, I called on the Minister to put in place an emergency fund to help with the crisis but the Government dragged its heels on this too.  Fishermen along the west Cork coast suffered badly from the massive storms leading to their lobster pots and other fishing gear being destroyed.  I asked for an aid package to help our fishermen to deal with these losses and again my pleas were all but ignored.  This is an example of when the Government should have been proactive in engaging with farmers and fishermen offering aid packages and using the rainy day fund.  If we have no funds available to help these groups of people in a crisis and no money to pay the prescribed amount into the reserve fund, where is the money going?  Is this because there is still an open cheque on the table for the national children's hospital, with no accountability for those funds?  With the national broadband plan on the horizon, is the Government providing the contractors involved with the same level of access to extra funding with no accountability, while we have people crying out for some sort of reassurance that things will get better?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700043#QQ00200","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1576614300,"counter":554,"content":"<p>The primary purpose of the National Surplus (Reserve Fund for Exceptional Contingencies) Bill 2018 is to provide the legislative basis for the establishment of a rainy day fund to be formally known as the National Surplus (Exceptional Contingencies) Reserve Fund.  In principle, the Act is fine.  It is sensible and prudent.  I also accept that this represents an institutional reform in Ireland's fiscal policy framework and that it is a Bill whose primary purpose is to mitigate severe economic shocks.  However, I am concerned about some issues raised by the regulatory impact analysis of the Bill.  For instance, the fund was seeded by an initial transfer of cash or near cash assets from the ISIF of up to a maximum of &euro;2 billion, with further Exchequer transfers of &euro;500 million per annum due from 2019 to 2023, inclusive.  Provision is also made for periodic transfers from the Exchequer, thankfully subject to D&aacute;il approval, where, for example, there are above expectation tax receipts.  People have a serious difficulty with this provision.  Most people would probably prefer to have above expectation tax receipts used to improve service infrastructure such as schools and roads, address the health crisis and, in particular, build houses or fund any number of other projects that require cash injections, of which there are many.<\/p>  <p>  We need to be very clear that there is flexibility in this matter and that an automatic transfer of tax to the fund would not occur.

It has created not just a rainy day but a thunderstorm of financial embarrassment, if the Minister was capable of embarrassment.  He will be embarrassed shortly when the people get a chance to embarrass him and have its verdict on him.

Deputy Michael McGrath is right in what he said in that there are now many other risks apart from the risk of a no-deal Brexit in 2019.  What is most likely is that the risk of a no-deal Brexit is there but the timing of it has shifted.  We can see from the events over the last day that as the new Government in the United Kingdom takes shape, it reminds us that many of the risks associated with Brexit have not gone away but the timing of them has clearly changed since the budget was introduced.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny made the point that if we look at where we are with other changes taking place across the world, we can see that while Brexit continues to be a big risk there are other ones also.  He pointed to the changes taking place in respect of global trade and the tone of global trade, and is right to acknowledge that.  It is also important to acknowledge that, to date, the Irish economic performance and the diversity we now have in our exports mean that despite the shift in tone in respect of global trade, we have still managed to deliver a reasonably strong performance across 2019.  While I expect to see an effect on our export performance in 2020 and beyond, there is still every prospect of the Irish economy continuing to be able to grow across the coming years if we are successful in avoiding a no-deal Brexit.  <\/p>  <p>  To deal with the three charges Deputy Burton made, the first was a concern if in any way the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund was raided.  I would recoil from that language as much as I am sure the Deputy would have recoiled from accusations she had raided private pension funds.  Of course, neither claim would be true.  What I have done, as she would do and has done, is make choices as to where the country's assets should sit and how we can make better use of them.  She asked why would we not use a movement of funding from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund to respond to the great difficulties we have in housing, on which all Deputies have touched.  However, we did that by moving nearly &euro;2 billion from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund to seed the Land Development Agency and Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI.  We have moved funding from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund to respond to the great housing challenges we have on which we still need to make much more progress. <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Broughan asked what is our position from a cash balance point of view.  At the end of November, the State had &euro;24 billion of reserves available to it, 60% of which are in short-term funding instruments, which is money the State would be able to access quite quickly if it needed it.  The Deputy touched on the intellectual rationale for a rainy day fund and went on to make the case that he does not believe this particular one is needed because we should be spending all our resources on addressing the issues we face today.  While I understand the need to invest in and respond to all the challenges of today, the balance I am simply trying to strike is to ensure we get ready for the challenges of tomorrow as well.  I believe the creation of a fund such as this one would be of help, particularly in dealing with the reliance on corporate tax receipts which we are making significant progress in moving away from by virtue of the surplus we will deliver at the end of this year.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding what Deputies Michael Collins said, as well as what Deputy Mattie McGrath said that touched on what Deputy Burton said, nowhere in my budget day speech did I say that the role of the rainy day fund was to recapitalise banks.  I never said that anywhere in it.  As I said in a number of Oireachtas debates on this issue, I am certain the rainy day fund would be available to the State if we had to deal with very extreme consequences as a result of a no-deal Brexit happening.  It is one of the reasons we have it in place.  Many have claimed it would not be available to help us deal with the harsher and more unpredictable consequences if a no-deal Brexit were to occur.  I am confident that it would.<\/p>  <p>  I thank all Deputies for their contributions.  It appears some parties and Deputies will support the motion because they believe there is a need for a rainy day fund but they also accept the wisdom of not making a deposit to it now.  It appears there are other Deputies who would support this motion because they do not believe in having a rainy day fund.  In either circumstances, I believe the requirement to bring this motion to the House is the right thing to do.

this independent not-for-profit group of providers, while part-funded by the Government, are accountable to the State and while standards of accountability, compliance and regulatory structures have increased substantially over the last decade, necessary additional funding to assist this work has not been put in place;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; this group of providers stepped up, when the Government did not, to ensure that people with disabilities had at least the prospect of the life they deserved, and they want to continue to do so;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the independent not-for-profit sector is recognised in legislation as providing services that enable people requiring supports to live the best quality of life they can;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; these organisations seek to improve society and communities rather than focus on delivering profits, unlike the private sector; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; there is a growing sense of crisis in this sector, not least the crisis of financial sustainability confronting many not-for-profit organisations; <\/blockquote>agrees that: <blockquote> \t&mdash; according to Census 2016, 13.5 per cent of those resident in Ireland, 643,131 people, stated that they had a disability;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; for many years the approach of the Irish State towards the needs of people with disabilities has not been to provide services directly, but to instead rely on the delivery of services by a variety of voluntary\/not-for-profit organisations, albeit with funding provided by the State;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; over the years the nature of this provision has radically changed, given that in the early years it was driven by religious orders, whereas now it is the remit of a range of secular and increasingly specialised and professionalised organisations;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the significance of these organisations cannot be underestimated;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; in 2018, the Health budget for the provision of disability services was more than &euro;1.81 billion;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; of this, more than 60 per cent was allocated to provide residential services, 20 per cent was allocated to provide day places and supports, with the remaining amount providing respite services and personal assistant and home support hours;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; these organisations sustain the communities they serve, building unique relationships with service users, their families and their network of friends;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; these organisations should always be prepared to be innovative, flexible and adaptable to the often complex needs of all marginalised groups they provide services to, including those living with a disability;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; these organisations should operate from a &lsquo;naturally person-centred approach&rsquo; as opposed to being dominated by the requirements of a system of bureaucracy;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; there is a distinct feeling amongst these organisations that the State does not value their contribution as much as it did in years gone by; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; there is a need to establish a renewed relationship between not-for-profit organisations and any future Governments who will provide adequate funding to enable the continued provision of services to people with disabilities and promote independent living and de-congregation; and <\/blockquote>calls for: <blockquote> \t&mdash; the Department of the Taoiseach to intensively engage with the not-for-profit sector to develop a long-term vision that would allow both the sector and future Governments to provide services through a more integrated approach, underpinned by any new legislative changes required and with sustainable levels of funding;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the not-for-profit sector to establish a forum, which would include service users, to develop a plan to provide enhanced services into the future and agree to develop a compact agreement with the State that will govern this vital future relationship and that this would be completed within a three-year period;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; future Governments to give due recognition to the sector and create a junior ministerial portfolio for the community and these sectors;<br \/><br \/>&mdash; a complete review of current legislative provisions governing the relationship between the State and not-for-profit organisations in the disability sector to take place at the earliest opportunity, and any changes to current legislation or identified new legislation required to be given priority in any new Programme for Government; and<br \/><br \/>&mdash; the Government to agree that the unequal pay terms that exist between Section 38 and Section 39 organisations must end without delay, and that full pay restoration for these workers must be delivered as a priority.&rdquo; <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>  <p>I want to say at the outset that I am deeply disappointed that the business has commenced earlier than was scheduled by the Business Committee, with the result that the people directly affected are not here, though they will be.  It is disrespectful to them.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte is fiche roimh na daoine a oibr&iacute;onn ar son daoine faoi mh&iacute;chumas at&aacute; anseo linn anocht.  Gach l&aacute;, d&eacute;anann siad obair a chuid&iacute;onn linn ar fad.  Ar son &aacute;r dteaghlaigh agus &aacute;r gcairde, gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leo.  Creideann Sinn F&eacute;in gur cheart go mbeadh cothrom na F&eacute;inne ag dul d&oacute;ibh uilig.<\/p><p>I wish to acknowledge, in advance, it seems, those visitors who will join us in the Public Gallery later this evening, especially the many workers employed by organisations that this Private Members' motion addresses.  I pay tribute to the tenacity and determination demonstrated in their campaign to have their pay and conditions restored in line with all other public sector workers, as they should be.  In 2018 the health budget for the provision of disability services was more than &euro;1.81 billion.  Out of this, more than 60% was allocated to the provision of residential services, 20% was allocated to the provision of day places and supports and the remainder was allocated to the provision of respite services and personal assistant and home support hours.  These organisations sustain the communities they serve, building unique relationships with service users, their families and their networks of friends.  They are unique and irreplaceable.  It was wrong for public service pay to be cut to bail out banks and developers.  Sinn F&eacute;in opposed those cuts and we still do.  That is why we are here tonight.  Nearly every week, An Taoiseach responds to my colleagues' questions in this House by telling us that things are not as bad as they used to be.  Let him tell that and prove that to the section 39 workers who will join us here this evening and the more than 9,000 of their colleagues across this State.  Let him ask them how they are getting on.<\/p><p>This motion is about these workers and those who rely on them; our families and our communities.  The focus of the motion can clearly be seen in the cry for justice that it represents.  These workers carry out vital work and provide key services in areas where the State has failed to provide.  This is not the first time that the plight of these workers has been raised.  I was completely despondent when last year the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, denied that these workers had their pay cut by the Government.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; sin f&iacute;or ar chor ar bith.  These workers did have their pay cut, and it was cut because it was judged that they would kick up the least fuss.  The Minister of State went on to claim that he did not know how the Government would even go about the business of restoring pay to the section 39 employees, the women and men who look after our most vulnerable family members and friends.  I have a simple message for Deputy McGrath tonight.  It is time to think harder.  If the Minister of State and his Government colleagues could spend months drawing up the Finance Bill, which includes a tax relief allowing multinational executives earning up to &euro;7 million a year to write off a third of their annual salary for income tax purposes, they can get their heads around restoring fairness and dignity to our friends across this land who provide these critical services.<\/p><p>That provision in the Finance Bill did not fall out of the sky.  The Minister of State and his Government colleagues thought it up.  I ask that he affords the workers who will be joining us this evening the same collective effort and think up a scheme to value their work in the same manner as all other public servants.  There should be no differential in pay and conditions between workers doing essentially the same work.  What is good for section 38 employees is good for section 39 employees, no ifs and no buts.  N&iacute;or th&aacute;inig me anseo chun leithsc&eacute;alta agus br&oacute;n a chloiste&aacute;il.  Mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute;, t&aacute; m&eacute; ag iarraidh cothrom na F&eacute;inne.<\/p><p>Some might think it a miracle that we still have so many workers in section 39 organisations.  I know from my work as a D&aacute;il Deputy and as vice-chairperson of the Oireachtas disability group that it is a sense of duty, genuine care and dedication that has sustained the overwhelming majority of these workers.  They had to watch as announcements were made to great fanfare that the harshest elements of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation were being reversed while they were left behind.  In previous commentary on efforts to address the plight of these workers, the Government has insinuated that the sector has recovered sufficiently and should address these financial shortcomings independently, without the need for restoration of grants.  This is a diversion and takes away from the lived reality facing these workers.<\/p><p>The scale of the work of section 39 organisations becomes clear when it is estimated that more than 1,700 separate organisations are affected by the lack of any movement, legislative or otherwise, on this issue.  They especially focus on the needs of people with physical, intellectual and learning difficulties and an ever-growing number of senior citizens.  They are people who face all the same demands and responsibilities in life as everyone else.  They are not different, and in a recovering economy they must not be left behind.<\/p> <p>The Minister has sought to put the blame on these some 1,700 organisations rather than address the issue head on, as he must.  The recently established forum under the chair of a senior Department of Health representative has yet to demonstrate its potential, never mind its capacity to effect real and substantive change in the relationship between section 39 organisations and the State.  If this is only a fig-leaf exercise it will not be long before it is fully exposed for what it is.  On the other hand, real intent backed up by a clear mission statement and a demonstration of Government commitment to address the under-resourcing of section 39 organisations could make it a groundbreaking initiative deserving of a welcome from all.<\/p> <p> What is clearly required is a compact agreement with the State that will govern what should be a vital future relationship and that should be completed within a three-year period.  While addressing the issue of finances this evening, let us not forget how careless and brazen this Government can be with taxpayers' money.  We are all acutely aware of the huge cost overrun in the building of the new national children's hospital.  This cost overrun will be required because of sheer mismanagement and shoddy tendering practices by the Government and the State agencies.  If only they were as careful and circumspect with spend on these projects as section 39 organisations have had to be with their services, but they were not.  The Government has squandered millions of euro of taxpayers' money and will make up the shortfall by targeting those who provide care, services and supports for those very same taxpayers who are least able to absorb the blow.<\/p> <p> I want to stress the importance of tonight's motion, if accepted by a vote of the House tomorrow.  If accepted, this motion will be the express will of Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la, the elected representatives of the people.  As Chair of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality I have stressed time after time that publishing reports and recommendations is not enough.  Action is what is needed.  If tonight's motion is accepted, the Government must immediately take steps to not only ameliorate the condition of those who work so hard on our behalf, and on the behalf of those dear to each and every one of us.  It must set in train the necessary steps to ensure full pay restoration to section 39 workers.  That is what they deserve.  Nothing less will suffice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700045#TT00200","speaker":"1269","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576616100,"counter":569,"content":"<p>Two things occurred to me before I came into the Chamber to speak tonight.  The first is the enormous footprint of section 39 organisations in Cork, for example, the Cork Association for Autism, Enable Ireland, the Cope Foundation and Marymount Hospice where my grandmother is currently and where she is receiving incredible care.  Every Christmas, Marymount Hospice is one of the favourite charities of Cork people.  It is an incredible place and it is extraordinary what it can do.  It is organisations like it that we are talking about when we discuss section 39 organisations.  People rely on their staff.  Such a topic can sound dry, abstract and artificial, but we are talking about key services such as those I have described.<\/p>  <p>  It also occurred to me that in most countries across Europe or other parts of the world these would be services provided by the state.  The State cannot abdicate responsibility for these services and their staff because they are not direct employees of the State.  They are there because the State failed to provide the necessary services over many years and allowed charitable, voluntary and religious organisations to provide them.  Whatever about the rights and wrongs of that, people are now relying on those organisations for essential services in the area of education, end-of-life support, disability services, therapies and other such services.  That is what this debate is about.  Section 39 organisations deserve parity and the respect to which all public servants should be entitled.  Every day of the year we hear stories of section 39 agencies limping from crisis to crisis, often because of funding issues but also issues concerning legislation.  The relationship between the State and not-for-profit organisations in the disability sector is just one example.  There is a complete lack of respect from successive Governments for the vital work they do.  Budgets are cut, skilled employees are treated as a low-pay workforce, and investment in beds and equipment is constantly put on the long finger.  Their work, however, cannot and must not be undervalued.  We must address the inequitable pay terms that exist between section 38 organisations and section 39 organisations.  That must end without delay.  Pay restoration must be delivered as a priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700046#UU00200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speech","time":1576616100,"counter":570,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, not just for tabling this Private Members' motion tonight and giving us the opportunity to discuss it, but also for the work he does day in, day out, hand in hand with these organisations.  One can hear the passion in his voice for the organisations, not just for the people who deliver the services but for those who are recipients of the services.  We all know the work that is done by these agencies.  The HSE most definitely knows because it is so heavily reliant on them.  In my constituency I am acutely aware of the work that is done by Prosper Fingal across north County Dublin.  I acknowledge its CEO, Pat Reen, whom I know is watching proceedings this evening.  It is true to say that like all of the other agencies, the very existence of Prosper Fingal is threatened.  That makes it a very worrying time for service users, their families and the staff.<\/p>  <p>  These organisations were established because there were no statutory services.  Very often they came into being because communities themselves organised and put services in place when they were let down by the State.  Funding cuts from the austerity years, which have never been restored, and inadequate budgets, have caused huge damage and have left service providers unable to meet service demands and that has put significant pressure on them because they want to be able to maintain a high level of service but they cannot do it in the face of continued cuts.  The pay cuts to section 39 workers during the austerity years and the imposition of a recruitment moratorium have had a long lasting and devastating impact on these services.  We know there is a recruitment and retention crisis right across the health service and it is being acutely felt in section 39 agencies because they are already in a position where they do not have comparable pension rates and now they do not have comparable pay rates to the rest of the public service.  It is not fair to say to them that they are regarded as public servants for the purposes of cutting their wages and cutting their funding but they are not regarded as public servants for the purposes of pay restoration.  I represented many workers at the time and I know the pay cuts were in or around 8%.  The workers themselves feel that they have been left high and dry.  They do not believe that the political will exists in order to be able to address the issue.  What is happening is that section 39 organisations are losing staff to the private sector because it is chasing after the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, money the Government is so anxious to pump into the private sector and away from the public service, or they are losing staff to the public service.  It is really not fair.  All that happens every time there is funding uncertainty is there is a threat to cut services and that sends a shock wave through communities and service users.  It is most unfair.  These staff undertake exactly the same work as directly-employed HSE staff but they do not have comparable pensions.  They have comparable qualifications but there is a significant difference in their pay packet.  We seek to have this addressed as a matter of urgency out of recognition for the fact that these organisations are providing vital, front-line health services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700046#UU00300","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1576616100,"counter":571,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Teachta &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in f&aacute; choinne an &aacute;bhar seo a ard&uacute; agus, go h&aacute;irithe, as ucht an r&uacute;n seo a chur os comhair na D&aacute;la.  This motion maps out the key elements of a long-term strategy for section 39 users based on equality, and for the protection of section 39 employees in this not-for-profit sector upon which so many citizens depend.<\/p> <p>The 1916 Proclamation states the Republic guarantees \"equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens, and declares its resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation\".  It does not, as the Minister of State knows, state: \"except for those who have a disability, those who need healthcare or those who suffer from mental health issues.\"  It does not state that bankers, landlords or insurance companies should have extra rights but, of course, we do not have a Republic based on the Proclamation.  In this State, citizens with a disability suffer from higher levels of poverty.  They have to fight for public services they should be entitled to.  They survive on the lowest annual average disposable income.  This situation has been made even worse by years of service cutbacks and a lack of service provision.<\/p> <p> Section 39 organisations provide essential services.  The WALK PEER programme in Louth, which enables young people with a disability to access opportunities in education, training and employment, has had to constantly fight for funding and resources.  Respite services for Louth have been a constant battleground.  In February 2013 the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government scrapped the mobility allowance scheme and the motorised transport grants.  That was almost seven years ago.  The grants have still not been replaced.  In September, the Government published its legislative programme for the autumn session.  Nowhere does it even reference the Health (Transport Support) Bill, which is supposed to plug the gap left by the 2013 decision.<\/p> <p> There are 643,000 citizens in this State with a disability.  That is 13.5% of the population.  Louth has a higher-than-average percentage of citizens with a disability, at almost 14%.  The section 39 public sector provides an indispensable service for these citizens as well as the elderly, the young, those suffering from substance abuse or those at risk of suicide, and it is the backbone of community development projects.  They include SOSAD Ireland, which deals with citizens at risk from suicide, Louth Age Friendly, Dundalk Parents and Friends of the Intellectually Disabled, and Louth Community Drug and Alcohol Team.  Without their dedication and commitment, many would fall through the cracks into even more dire circumstances.  This motion seeks to resolve effectively the many difficulties currently within the section 39 sector.<\/p> <p> This Government is in government just for the sake of it.  If tomorrow this motion is passed, as I hope will be the case, the Government will have to act on it.  There should be no more nonsense of supply and confidence from our friends in Fianna F&aacute;il, which is propping up the Government.  Let us deal with the needs of the citizens by making this motion a reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700046#UU00400","speaker":"1330","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576616700,"counter":573,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &quot;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&quot;

<br \/><br \/>notes that: <br \/><br \/>&mdash; over 2,000 voluntary organisations receive funding from the Health Service Executive (HSE), spanning almost all areas of health and social care, including acute hospitals, disability, mental health, older persons and hospice services; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; Sections 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004 legally underpin:  <blockquote> \t&mdash; the provision of services by non-statutory providers on behalf of the HSE (Section 38); and <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the provision of services similar or ancillary to a service that the HSE may provide (Section 39);  <\/blockquote>&mdash; the HSE fund Section 39 organisations to assist them in providing services to the population, and a majority of these agencies provide essential services to people with disabilities; <br \/><br \/>&mdash; the issue of pay restoration for Section 39 workers has been the subject of intense engagement between the parties under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC); <br \/><br \/>&mdash; an agreement reached in October 2018 in relation to pay restoration for employees of these organisations provided for pay restoration in relation to 50 'pilot organisations' in the first instance, including the larger organisations that are funded in the main by the HSE;<br \/><br \/>&mdash;

  <\/blockquote>  <p>I thank the Deputies for raising these important matters and allowing us time to discuss them here tonight.  Let me deal with some of the facts regarding this debate.  First, I did not cause the banking crisis and I did not cause austerity.  I went into government to support people with disabilities and also to support staff in section 39 organisations.  I will outline my strategy and response later.  <\/p><p>Voluntary organisations have long made a significant contribution to Irish society and in the past, offered care and support when the State did not.  However, I believe this country has moved on from that time and there is now a high level of mutual interdependence between the State and the voluntary sector.<\/p><p>While the Government fully agrees on the importance of ensuring support for the role of the voluntary sector, the approach proposed in the Sinn F&eacute;in motion does not have regard for the significant initiatives under way to put the relationship between the State and the voluntary sector on a firmer footing.  Therefore, the Government is opposing the motion this evening, for the reasons I will outline in the course of my address.<\/p><p>The importance of the community and voluntary sector is recognised in Sustainable, Inclusive and Empowered Communities, the Government's five-year strategy for community and voluntary sector development in Ireland.  I was asked about a strategy.  The strategy covers the period 2019 to 2024.  This strategy sets out a long-term vision for communities in Ireland and a general direction of travel for Government policy in regard to the community and voluntary sector for the coming years.  It also copper-fastens the renewed relationship and partnership between the Government and the community and voluntary sector that has developed over time.<\/p><p>Ireland's health and social care system is characterised by a mix of public, voluntary and private providers that has evolved over many years and is reflective of historical and societal developments.  More than 2,000 voluntary organisations receive funding from the HSE to provide health and social care services, including acute hospitals and disability, mental health, older persons and hospice services.<\/p><p>The House will recall that the Minister, Deputy Harris, announced the establishment of an independent review group to examine the role of voluntary organisations in publicly funded health and personal social services in July 2017.  The report recognised the continuing important contribution of the voluntary sector and recommended placing the relationship between the State and the voluntary sector on a new footing.<\/p><p>In response to the independent review group's report, the Minister for Health recently established a new dialogue forum, with the aim of building a stronger working relationship between the State and the voluntary sector based on trust and partnership and to facilitate regular dialogue with the voluntary sector on future policy and strategic developments.<\/p><p>The forum is being chaired by an independent chairman, Mr. Peter Cassells.  Forum membership includes the Department, HSE, HIQA, the Mental Health Commission and eight of the main representative bodies of voluntary providers of health and social care services.<\/p><p>At the first meeting of the dialogue forum on 2 December, it was agreed that change is needed on all sides to improve the relationship between voluntary organisations and the State.  The establishment of the forum is an important foundational step in this regard.  There is a deep commitment among voluntary sector representatives at the forum to build a strong, effective relationship with statutory partners so that we can collectively act in the best interest of service users.<\/p><p>As regards the suggestion that future Governments would give consideration to a junior ministerial portfolio for the community and voluntary sectors, it is worth noting that the Taoiseach has established a dedicated Department of Rural and Community Development, led by its Minister, Deputy Ring.  The brief of its Minister of State, Deputy Canney, includes community affairs.  In my case, as Minister of State responsible for disability issues, I also have a seat at the Cabinet table.  This reflects the level of the commitment of this Government to the community and voluntary sector.  I am keenly aware that the voluntary sector plays an integral role in the delivery of health and social care services and has made a valuable contribution to the development of services for people with disabilities in this country.<\/p><p>About one in seven people in Ireland, amounting to about 635,000, reported having a disability in the 2016 census.  In line with the mainstream-first approach of the Disability Act 2005, more than 90% of those with a disability are supported through general community health and social services, with about 9%, or about 56,000, receiving specialist community-based disability services.<\/p><p>Health and personal social services are, by their nature, varied and complex.  In some instances, the HSE delivers these services directly and in other circumstances it relies on funded providers to deliver these services on its behalf.  Sections 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004 legally underpin the provision of services by non-statutory providers on behalf of the HSE - section 38 - and the provision of services similar or ancillary to a service that the HSE may provide - section 39.  Among section 39 voluntary organisations are hospices, mental health providers, nursing home and homecare providers, small community-based groups and social care services.  The voluntary sector provides some two thirds of all disability services and 80% of residential services.<\/p> <p>A small number of national-level service providers receive significant levels of funding, in excess of &euro;30 million, but the majority receive much smaller amounts.<\/p> <p> I would like to turn to the issue of pay restoration for section 39 workers, which has been the subject of earlier debate in this House.  The people employed by these organisations are not public servants and are not subject to the terms of the public service stability agreements.  Having said that, it is important to note that a pay restoration process, where it is warranted, is already under way.  Some 43 organisations, totalling about 12,000 people, have been paid almost &euro;7 million.  This was part of the agreement reached in the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, in October 2018 on pay restoration for staff in 50 pilot organisations.<\/p> <p> The HSE conducted a data-gathering exercise regarding the 50 pilot organisations, which showed that in some places pay was cut, in others pay was not cut and, in a number of instances, pay had already been restored.  That is the actual research.  Following this significant and complex piece of work, pay restoration, where warranted, for these bodies commenced in April of this year, with further payments due in 2020 and 2021.  It should be noted that the sole objective of the WRC agreement is to ensure that staff in the 50 pilot organisations who received direct pay reductions over the period 2010 to 2013 are restored back to the pay levels they were on before the reductions.  I strongly support that.  It is not intended to encompass any future pay progression for employees of these bodies or to fund any pension costs.<\/p> <p> There are approximately 250 bodies that have not yet received pay restoration under this agreement.  The parties have agreed, and I support this point, that there will be a phase 2 of pay restoration to look at these bodies.  Management is willing to undertake the necessary preparatory work around this next group.  A dedicated resource in the HSE will be assigned to commence this work in January 2020.  The HSE will meet the unions to provide them with updates as this work progresses.  I meet them regularly.  In summary, the WRC agreement has resulted in significant progress and a continuing dialogue between all parties.  I ask the House to be cognisant of this ongoing process and let the WRC, which is the appropriate mechanism, continue its important work.<\/p> <p> Finally, I would like to emphasise that the State is committed to a whole-of-government approach to improving access to and quality of services for people with disabilities.  In recognition of the cross-departmental nature of the supports required by people with disabilities, the Department of Justice and Equality published the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021, which I chair.  Furthermore, in 2018 Ireland ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  In line with Time to Move on from Congregated Settings: A Strategy for Community Inclusion, 2011, almost two-thirds of the 8,300 people with disabilities who avail of residential care now live in ordinary houses or group homes in the community, rather than large-scale institutional settings.  I accept that work has to be done and we are moving in that direction.  This year we are spending more than &euro;2 billion on disability in the HSE service plan for 2020.  Even today, in the last couple of hours of the service plan, we managed to negotiate extra money for residential places and also new funding for personal assistance hours.  There are, therefore, changes and reforms going on and we intend to ensure that everybody is treated fairly in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700047#VV00200","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576617300,"counter":575,"content":"<p>What do section 39 organisations do?  They run about two thirds of the disability services in the country, as well as many of the hospices and much of the education services.  They work in our communities in every county and in every town with vulnerable people.  They probably work directly with hundreds of thousands of people.  Given the importance of section 39 organisations, the importance of hospices, the importance of supporting people with disabilities and the importance of supporting families battling with cancer, we would think that a single Fine Gael Teachta D&aacute;la would have come into the House to show a bit of support.  The Minister of State cuts a lonely figure on the Government benches this evening.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il will be supporting this motion.  It is a sensible motion and it is disappointing not only that the Government could not be bothered turning up, but that it felt the need to put down a countermotion.  I compliment the Deputy on what is a very sensible and non-political motion.  This is clearly just trying to help.  We have tabled a short amendment that brings some extra focus on the hospices, including those such as Marymount in Cork and we hope the House will support this amendment.  <\/p>  <p>  This Government is crippling our entire public healthcare system.  I will read one tweet from yesterday, from a father called Declan Ward.  It reads: \"Had a terrible day in @Temple_Street today.  Not enough ICU nurses for our son Eoin's scoliosis surgery.  Two years waiting.  Cancelled when prepped for theatre\".  So, we have an empty operating theatre and surgeons, but we did not have the ICU nurses afterwards.  Why?  A hiring embargo is in place which this Government pretends does not exist.  What happens?  What happens is that the section 39 organisations are put under increasing pressure.  They are meant to work complementing our public healthcare system, but when our public healthcare system has been vandalised by Government, the section 39 organisations have to take on more and more responsibilities.  They also have to take on increasing compliance and regulation, which is right and proper, but then they do not get the funding.  <\/p>  <p>  Not only does the Government refuse to reverse the pay cuts, the Taoiseach has repeatedly come in here and stated brazenly to this House that the pay cuts never happened and that they were nothing to do with the Government and the HSE, when there is documentary evidence showing that section 39 organisations had to impose financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI.  The Minister of State then comes in here and talks about pilot schemes nearly a decade after the FEMPI cuts were introduced.  In the meantime, our section 39 organisations struggle more and more.  They are not getting the support they need.  Purple House Cancer Support Centre in Bray had promises made to it about a new premises.  The promises do not seem to be kept.  <\/p>  <p>  We will be supporting this motion.  We have an amendment down which we hope is also supported.  This Government needs to take the section 39 organisations seriously and reverse the cuts that very much did happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700048#WW00200","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1576617300,"counter":576,"content":"<p>Section 39 health organisations provide vital health services to society and to local communities throughout the country.  We cannot underestimate the services they provide.  Those include hospices and disability organisations and other agencies, including rest homes.  Those are unique to the south east in Waterford and Kilkenny and provide low to medium and medium care levels.  There is one rest home in Lismore, St. Carthage's, and another in Waterford city, the Holy Ghost residential home.  Those rest homes provide low and medium care for our elderly people who can no longer live at home on their own.  They might be living in rural isolation, but they only need low to medium supports.  They have a hot meal every day, a warm bed every night and they also have their medication handed out to them.  It is a fantastic model.  Only for the section 39 health organisations and a voluntary board this would not happen.  The local communities also fundraise every year to support these activities.<\/p>  <p>  The independent review group established to examine the role of voluntary organisations in health and social services has found that two thirds of disability services are provided by the section 39 sector.  However, those organisations are enduring a funding crisis and there is concern about the viability of many organisations.  The lack of resources is a common thread running through these organisations as they try to deal with increased demand with limited resources.  Waiting lists for assessment and intervention have been allowed to spiral out of control under this Government and there are serious issues with staffing and access to residential care.  This combination is resulting in families waiting months and, in some cases, years for help.  We must realise that our health system would not be able to function without organisations such as the Pinegrove Day Care Centre in Waterford, which delivers much needed dementia specific, person-centred care to meet the needs of the person with dementia.   Outreach support services are also provided for those with dementia who are not in a position to attend the centre.<\/p> <p>I spoke recently with the service provider looking for supports for several constituents who had contacted me.  However, due to funding constraints, only those deemed to be in crisis would receive the supports.  There were many families in crisis but they did not meet the qualifying criteria.  We have an ageing population, meaning more supports are required every year.

This is all a significant challenge.<\/p>  <p>  We are all agreed that we want higher standards in the disability sector.  The Minister of State spoke about that.  There are many more people living a lot longer with more complex needs.  Accordingly, more money is needed to stand still.  While he claims he is giving more money, it still is not adequate for the services being provided.<\/p>  <p>  The Government's response to every issue is how can it get as many years out of inaction as possible but appearing to be busy.  Busy inaction I call it.  The Government set up the independent review group, which ran from July 2017 to 2019, buying it two years.  Having got that far, it then set up the dialogue forum.  We are now into December 2019.  The forum will not make any conclusions before late spring next year.  The Government will have, again, bought time to get over the line.<\/p>  <p>  I do not believe the people are fooled by this process of constant dialogue and no action.

It is another one of those issues that requires caring and progressive policies.  The Taoiseach is keen to tell us about the wonderful job he is doing restoring the country&rsquo;s economic success.  When one scratches the surface of the issues that are important, however, such as housing, health, education and disability, he and the Government are failing miserably.<\/p>  <p>  It is not a coincidence that these issues are those that affect the less well-off in our society the most.  There is a clear theme running through the work of the Government, particularly in the attitude of the Taoiseach.  This theme impacts the issues that require thoughtful policies and will provide empathy to people in our society who are challenged.  It is not a priority for the Government, however.  According to the Taoiseach, the homeless figures are not the worst when compared to other countries.  His solution for the provision of social and affordable housing is to invest hundreds of millions of euro in housing assistance payment, HAP.  The blame for the problems in our health system is landed at the doors of our doctors, consultants and nurses.  Despite our so-called economic prosperity, no progress has been made in education either.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding section 39 workers, the Taoiseach wants cash-starved disability organisations, hospices and other voluntary agencies to solve the problem for him.  Based on the evidence I have offered, it could be claimed that the Government just does not get it.  I argue, however, that it does get it.  It is just that it is stuck in a right-wing ideology time warp where ordinary people do not matter and all problems must be solved by market forces.<\/p>  <p>  We in Fianna F&aacute;il fundamentally disagree with this.  It is a key difference between our two parties.  When the people get their chance to make their decision on the Government in due course through the ballot box, these issues will influence their decision.<\/p>  <p>  Section 39 health organisations provide vital health services to society and local communities across the country.  Under the Health Act 2004, there are section 38 and section 39 organisations.  Employees of section 38 organisations are public sector workers and, therefore, will receive pay restoration.  Section 39 employees, however, are not technically public sector workers.  Traditionally, they have been paid the same as employees of section 38 organisations and the public sector.  The HSE communicated with section 39 organisations that a cut in funding was to be applied to each organisation's payroll.  While a process of pay restoration has commenced, many organisations remain on a financial cliff edge.  If we are to maintain an effective service for those with disabilities, those who work in section 39 organisations must be recognised and treated like all other HSE employees with their pay and conditions restored.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700049#XX00300","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1576617900,"counter":580,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and commend Sinn F&eacute;in on bringing forward this motion.<\/p>  <p>  I want to give an example of a facility in my constituency that shows the effects of the Government&rsquo;s inaction on section 39 workers.  I have been working closely with my colleague, Councillor Joe Flaherty, on highlighting the issues facing St. Christopher's Services in Longford.  It provides day services for 140 adults, full-time respite care for 37 adults, respite care for 36 adults and day and weekend respite for 15 children.  The Minister of State is aware of this service because he met me and its CEO earlier this year.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, while he gave us a listening ear on that occasion, nothing has happened since.  The biggest challenge facing an organisation such as St. Christopher's with a staff of 220 people is the variance in pay with the other HSE services, section 38 organisations and private providers.  I have been informed that, on average, there is a shortfall of &euro;6,500 per annum in the terms and conditions for the pay of the staff in St. Christopher's.  How does the Minister of State expect such services to be able to retain and attract staff?  I have outlined the number of service users who rely on theses services in Longford.  If it cannot retain existing staff or attract new staff, the organisation will not last into the future.  The Minister of State must examine this critically without any further delay.<\/p>  <p>  The other areas of challenge for this service are the lack of an appropriate multidisciplinary team, the lack of psychological supports and poor infrastructural investments.  When we met the Minister of State earlier this year, we gave two examples of where money could be saved.  It involved shared services with smaller section 39 organisations working together, reducing duplication, making savings and re-investing them into services.  We highlighted how St. Christopher's Services is covered under clinical medical negligence insurance but not covered for general indemnity insurance.  If it was covered for the latter, there would be savings of &euro;138,000, which could be put back into services.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State came out with good words.  He gave us a welcome ear.

Today, as previously raised in a Fianna Fail Private Members' motion in 2018, we are again highlighting the massive discrepancies in pay for section 39 health organisation and not-for-profit sector workers, many of whom work directly with those with special needs and disabilities.  This sector provides health and educational services across the country, including hospices, disability organisations and other advocacy groups.  Every Deputy is acutely aware of the pay disparity, in particular between sections 38 and 39 workers.  Every Deputy can also attest to the fact that both workers essentially provide the same level of service to their clients.<\/p>  <p>  Why do we then persist in penalising section 39 workers in respect of their rights to pay restoration?  We cannot continue to sit idly by while this pay inequality persists.  This is about fairness.  Why should two people who do exactly the same job, have the exact same responsibilities and perform the same tasks as one another be treated differently?  The fact is that they should not.<\/p>  <p>  Worse still than the lack of fairness in the sector in terms of pay inequality is the real challenge that the disparity poses for the voluntary sector in terms of sustainability.<\/p> <p>If the State continues to oversee a pay structure that directly undermines the magnificent work of those in the voluntary sector, I fear for the future of that sector in terms of its ability to attract and retain workers who carry out some of the most important work for the most vulnerable in our society.<\/p> <p> The independent review group, which was established to examine the role of organisations in this sector, concluded that disability services in particular are continually underfunded.  Many of these voluntary bodies are now under significant threat.  The fact that Mr. Se&aacute;n Abbott, CEO of the Cope Foundation in Cork, has said that the challenges facing the sector are the worst he has seen in his 38 years speaks volumes for where we are at.  Our health and education systems are reliant on organisations such as the Cope Foundation to provide early intervention supports, training supports for people who have left school, housing and alternative therapies for families, and to help people with special needs, including people on the autistic spectrum.<\/p> <p> We need to appreciate and cherish our voluntary sector.

I refer specifically to St. Joseph's in Charleville, which the Minister of State visited with me in January 2017.  One of the issues outlined at the time was the escalating cost of insurance, a matter I raised earlier on the Order of Business.  There were also concerns over respite and the shared care initiatives in St. Joseph's as well as the restoration of pay for the workers.<\/p>  <p>  These organisations have become reliant on agency workers.  They do Trojan work in looking after the most vulnerable in our society.  They are locked in a continual battle each year with the HSE over funding and different streams of funding.  There are long waiting lists for basic assessments for children.  We have heard all the fine talk.  When people look back at this period they will see how we neglected children with intellectual disabilities by not providing assessments in time.  There are no therapies available.  People need to wait two years for an assessment and another two years for therapies, which is simply not good enough.<\/p>  <p>  When I have raised this issue, the Minister of State has claimed that additional funding has been allocated for respite.  I know of families who are told they have two or three weekends a year of respite but not continuous respite.  It is a shameful indictment.

It is a fantastic organisation but the staff are at their wits' end over funding and particularly over the restoration of pay for their workers.  As previous speakers have said, it is a no-brainer.

Collectively this Parliament will morally have to deal with it in the near future.  I welcome the representatives of the various unions, including F&oacute;rsa and SIPTU, in the Gallery.  I particularly welcome my party colleague, Councillor Paul Bell, representing SIPTU.  I thank them for all the advocacy and work they have been doing on behalf of the workers.<\/p>  <p>  As many colleagues have said, there is an issue with the range of services being provided.  I could list many of them in Tipperary, but I will not do so.  The issue of pay needs to be dealt with, particularly in hospice services, education services and a whole range of services that we are so dependent on.<\/p>  <p>  I would like the Minister of State to put a figure on the funding that goes into section 39 organisations.  From the replies I have received to parliamentary questions, I know the HSE cannot put a figure on it.  How much funding goes to section 38 and section 39 organisations?  The Minister of State might ask the officials sitting beside him and at the end of the debate give us the exact figure for 2017, 2018 or any year.  I am not sure that they know; in the past, they have not known anyway.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the staff are being paid under the 2013 Department of Health consolidation pay scale rates rather than the 2019 rates.  It is becoming a significant issue, and has been borne out dramatically by the many the service providers that cannot employ people.  There is a high level of competition for very skilled workers.  Many of them are trying to move across into HSE roles or roles in other organisations that have better pay.  This is creating competitive issues among different organisations throughout the health service, which is not healthy.  They want to continue to work in the sector and, in many cases, in the organisation they are in.  Obviously for financial reasons - I cannot blame them - they have to move across.  This is not acceptable especially as these organisations are doing work that we collectively as a body politic should be ensuring the State is doing.<\/p>  <p>  The level of discrimination is resulting in major issues with recruitment and service provision.  The loss of staff is having major impact directly and it is scaring people.  I know families who are concerned about service provision across a range of areas because the staff in some cases are no longer there or will not be there in the future because of the issues relating to pay, which are having a dramatic knock-on effect down the line.<\/p>  <p>  We all know that many of the organisations are operating within a significant deficit and have to fundraise, which is a major issue.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue of staff, we need to collectively get on an even keel when it comes to section 38 and section 39, and HSE employees.  I re-emphasise the final paragraph in the motion, which states that the unequal pay terms between section 38 and section 39 organisations must end.  We can strengthen this.  This pay injustice should be discussed and resolved as part of any potential future public sector agreement.<\/p> <p>We need to link this into the future, because then all of us can have confidence that everybody will be treated on an equal footing.<\/p> <p> During my remaining minutes with the Minister of State, I know he would not want me to let him go without mentioning the following topics, which we have discussed previously during debates in the health committee and in this Chamber.  The topics are related.  How much is the total funding for the section 39 organisations?  How many of them are given loans every year and why?  What percentage of them are given loans?  Why are they asked to sign contracts that will take away 20% of their funding if they do not sign?  Is that morally right?  Of course it is not.  There is a range of organisations that get loans.  I have a serious concern, which I have raised on multiple occasions in this Chamber and at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health.  There are issues abounding here that the Department of Health - through the HSE - is actually pushing, and which may have impacts when it comes to how these organisations are trading and if they are adhering to company law.  I have never gotten answers.  I am aware that the HSE is running scared from this, and that the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, is running scared from it.  Basically, there has been a continuous push where the loans are increased and the volume of organisations is increasing.  The members of the health committee have been told this but every year they are chasing their tails.  This cannot continue.  These organisations cannot trade recklessly.  Some of them are being pushed into a situation where, I believe, it is becoming a real issue.<\/p> <p> On a related matter, I believe that full-time residential institutional care is the next big scandal in the health service.  I do not want another scandal but I have been trying and failing to get a number of people - young people especially - into full-time residential care.  They have complex needs.  I have told the story on the record of the House of a young man from Waterford.  They cannot handle him anymore.  I have tried everything and I have failed in trying to get a full-time residential package for him.  Why is this?  It is because the State is not providing enough packages and the State does not have enough residential facilities.  We are failing these people hugely.  The numbers are quite scary.  I have asked the Minister of State to look at this when I brought the case to his attention.  I brought the case anywhere I could within the HSE.  I accept that costs for residential care are quite high but we cannot abdicate the responsibility to protect these people and give them the best service possible.  They are being let down.  I have seen nothing changed since I first raised the subject some years ago, or since I raised it in the health committee, or since I raised it in the Chamber six months ago.  There has been no progress or change, just these people being abandoned.  This should not happen and it cannot continue to happen.  I ask the Minister of State to please do something before he leaves office that would change the direction of this issue.  I would really welcome it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700050#YY00900","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576619100,"counter":592,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling this motion under Private Members' business.  The issue needs to be dealt with.  I fully support elements of the motion, and especially that unequal pay and conditions between the workers of section 38 and section 39 organisations must be ended.  Full pay restoration for these workers must be delivered as a priority.<\/p>  <p>  In his contribution earlier the Minister of State said that the people who are employed by section 39 organisations are not public servants and not subject to the terms of the public service stability agreements.  They were, however, treated the same way as section 38 workers when their wages were cut and when funding was cut under FEMPI.  I reiterate that these workers should have their pay restored as a priority.<\/p>  <p>  I am not convinced that the level of outsourcing of essential public services - and healthcare in particular- to charities, voluntary hospitals, NGOs and religious bodies, is the best way to provide these essential services.  I believe we need to establish which public services are essential and must be provided by the State as a right.  The failure of the State to do this contrasts sharply with other European states, and especially in the post-war period, and it is a key factor as to why we have such poor public services generally in contrast to similar European states.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015 I fully supported the Sl&aacute;intecare all-party report, which has been quietly shelved by the Minister for Health and by the Government.  The failure to deal with the numbers of charities, religious bodies, NGOs and State agencies was a major weakness in that report.  As a member of the committee I tried to establish how many section 38 and 39 bodies were receiving funding from the HSE.  I have never received a clear answer from the Minister, the Department of Health or the HSE.  The HSE did provide a list of up to 550 to 560 agencies in receipt of more than &euro;100,000 in 2015.  Some digging around, however, shows that some 3,000 section 38 and section 39 agencies received some &euro;3 billion from the HSE in 2015.  This is almost one quarter of the overall HSE budget for that year.  The scale of this level of outsourcing is staggering and it is a fundamental problem in the provision of a proper health service, fit for purpose, where workers can work and deliver services properly, and the provision of good public services generally.  Until we confront the situation and introduce radical change in how we provide and fund front-line essential services we will not get the services we need for our elderly, our sick, our children, or for those with a disability or suffering from a mental health issue.<\/p>  <p>  This is not to say there is not a role for advocacy groups that are independent of the State, and grant aided by the State.  Advocacy groups have a key role in identifying problems and weaknesses in public services.  Rather than the forum as proposed in the motion I would support a forum for advocacy groups to develop a broad campaign to fight for public services as a right, and to break once and for all with the Victorian notions of the poorhouse and the deserving poor.  We need high quality, adequately funded public services that are fit for the 21st century, and fit for section 39 workers to work in and deliver services.<\/p>  <p>  I want to make it clear that there is no criticism in these remarks for the thousands of volunteers who give up their time freely to provide services that the State - in the main - should provide, or those workers who work full time in section 39 bodies.  I commend the motion and I will support it when we vote for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700051#ZZ00200","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1576619100,"counter":593,"content":"<p>I do not in any way doubt the Minister of State's sincerity in dealing with disability services.  I do, however, believe that the voices of section 39 organisations are not being properly heard by the Government.  We can see this problem across our health service.  Section 39 organisations are supplying services that would normally be delivered by the State.  These are front-line services that are very difficult to deliver.  Some 35% of the disability budget is spent by section 39 organisations but 2\/3 of disability services are delivered by section 39 organisations.  The State is heavily reliant on the sector and gets excellent value for the money it spends in the sector.  Unfortunately, the level of funding is the real problem.  A lack of funding leads to a struggle in delivering the range of services, in delivering the quality of services, and in the delivery of the absolutely essential governance that section 39 organisations require, and which is demanded of them.  Essentially, the lack of funding leads to difficulties in recruitment and retention of staff.  This is one of the huge problems facing section 39 organisations.  They recruit and train staff, who then are tempted to go to work with section 38 organisations or to the HSE, where conditions of service and pay are much better.  Non-delivery of section 39 services leads to huge unmet need.  This leads to additional costs down the road.<\/p>  <p>  Many, if not all, section 39 organisations are operating at a financial deficit.  They have to beg for proper funding, not only from the Government but also from the public.  They invariably provided services that are excellent value for money, with tight financial control underpinning elimination of any unnecessary costs.  They are dependent on fundraising and the kindness of strangers to meet their bills and to bridge the deficit in their funding.<\/p> <p>They are not funded at the real cost of providing these desperately-needed, essential services that are delivered to people who are most dependent and most vulnerable.<\/p> <p> Recently, I visited an acquired brain injury service in Clarecastle in County Clare.  It provides an excellent service to those who have suffered road traffic accident, strokes or serious assault.  Acquired Brain Injury Ireland is a section 39 organisation that is unable to provide occupational therapy services, speech and language services and physiotherapy services.  If it does have these essential components they are either half time or not sufficiently present to deliver a proper service.  However, this organisation takes people out of our acute hospitals and delivers them to community services, allowing them to live within their communities, either independently or supported.  This is an example of a section 39 organisation that is struggling to deliver excellent services and is underfunded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700051#ZZ00300","speaker":"1275","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576619700,"counter":595,"content":"<p>I am happy to speak on this motion.  As we all know, not-for-profit organisations provide vital services for all communities throughout Ireland.  They provide healthcare, social inclusion, community development and support services for people with disabilities, the youth and the elderly.  These groups took the lead when the Government did not.  I fully understand and see first-hand the good that section 39 funding has done for community and voluntary organisations.<\/p>  <p>  I am involved in a couple of these voluntary organisations.  They are the Goleen and District Community Council and Schull Community Care.  These organisations, as do many other community and voluntary organisations throughout the country, simply provide meals in the local community building and in the local social centre where people can come in a couple of times a week for a hot meal.  In my community between Goleen and Schull, thanks to section 39 we can provide a hot meal for people in the local community centre or meals on wheels to their door.  This in turn saves the State millions of euro as a hot meal for an elderly person seven days a week keeps that elderly person in his or her home and not in the local hospital.<\/p>  <p>  Do people realise that the local community and voluntary group run section 39 funds in many communities?  This creates a lot of headaches for volunteers sorting out payments for workers.  These workers, who diligently work long, hard hours, are poorly paid because the Government fails to realise their value.  This is because community and voluntary groups are at the bottom of the Government's list.  Most section 39 workers work for the community and voluntary sector.  All we have from the Government year after year is that it will be sorted out next year.  It will not sort itself out.  The reason the Government cannot sort it out is because it threw billions of euro into a pet project, a huge hole in the ground in the children's hospital in Dublin, which showed massive incompetence.  We have no home help service because of it.  We have no transport for children with disabilities over 18 years of age.  The Government has let people go blind begging for a cataract operation.  This weekend, the 50th bus will leave Cork for Belfast in a desperate attempt by people to save their eyesight.  It is a 15-minute procedure that the Government cannot fund.  It is no wonder that section 39 workers are poorly treated.

As have my colleagues, I have been raising this issue on behalf of HSE employed staff in my constituency for some time.  I am delighted to see Senator John Dolan, the CEO of the Disability Federation of Ireland in the Chamber.  I compliment him and his organisation on all of the work they do.<\/p>  <p>  I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health on the need to restore pay for staff in section 39 organisations.  I accept the view put forward in the motion that the independent, not-for-profit section 39 sector provides vital services for many thousands of people with disabilities throughout Ireland and that the section 39 sector also provides healthcare and services for the elderly and youth, substance abuse, suicide prevention, social inclusion, education and community development services, meals on wheels services as Deputy Collins mentioned, and many other services.  There can be no doubt that it is a sector that needs our support and our assistance.  The organisations cannot wait for it.<\/p>  <p>  More broadly speaking, I remain deeply concerned around the provision of funding, not just to the workers but to the services infrastructure, especially in the area of disabilities and mental health.  The voluntary sector and disability sector came before the Oireachtas health committee earlier this year.  The Chairman of that committee, Deputy Harty, is sitting behind me.  The witnesses described the service as a house that is falling down.  They said that while scaffolding is being provided, the house could still fall and this is entirely unacceptable.  The independent voluntary disability service providers said they operate in the absence of a Government strategy for their role and future, and also in the absence of adequate funding for services.  Their warning is that this will soon be unsustainable.  It is already unsustainable.  Those impacted because of this uncertain future are the people who rely on residential, respite and day services and who deserve to live full lives as citizens of this State with the support they need.<\/p>  <p>  I salute the many volunteers and board members of not-for-profit organisations who give gallant service and, along with the staff, keep those services going.  They have to beg and scrounge and do church gate collections and God knows what to try to top up the wages.  This is of the people by the people.  People leave those jobs and go into a HSE job because they are pensionable positions and everything else.  We are abandoning these people.  They are the most needy people of all.  As others have said, I am aware of countless cases where people cannot get a full residential place because of funding.  The lives of parents and others are in danger because of adult children with many emotional and mental difficulties.  The danger to people's health is another crisis.  I believe the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, has done his best.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is gone.  He is all promises and no action.  That is the problem.  When he was on this side of the House he was great but I am so disappointed with him during his term for paying lipservice to this area.  It needs to change.  We need to look after these people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700052#AAA00300","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1576619700,"counter":597,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important motion.  I congratulate my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, for bringing it forward.  I thank most of the House for their genuine support.  For the people outside who are wondering what we are debating I will put it in basic simple terms.  The heart of the motion is calling on the Department of the Taoiseach to intensively engage with the not-for-profit sector to develop a long-term vision that would allow the sector and future Governments to provide services in a more integrated approach, underpinned by any new legislative change required and with substantial levels of funding.  It also calls for future Governments to give due recognition to the not-for-profit sector by creating a portfolio for a Minister of State for the community, voluntary and not-for-profit sectors.<\/p>  <p>  Who are we letting down if we do not support the motion and try to push matters forward?  As has been mentioned so many times during the debate, we will leave down the very people who work with young people, the disabled, the elderly and people suffering from substance abuse and mental health issues.  The list goes on and on.  I can mention community and voluntary organisations in east Cork, from Cobh to Carrigtwohill, Connagh, Mallow, Fermoy, Mitchelstown and Midleton.  I could go on.  These services are vital.<\/p>  <p>  What is really worrying is what would happen if on 1 January 2020 all of the organisations decided not to do it any more.  Who would suffer?  Absolutely everyone.  This is about equality.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, mentioned the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in his speech.  We have not even driven it forward yet.  We are the last in Europe to do so.  We are lagging behind.  I cannot understand how many times I have come to the Chamber and said the two hardest things to do in this country are to tell the truth and help people.  I have found something else for the list, which is do the right thing.<\/p>  <p>  I also want to talk about invisible carers.  The latest data from the CSO frightened me, as it states that 44,227 hours of care per week are provided by children under 15.  That is 2.2 million hours of care provided by children under the age of 15 in one year.  It is absolutely frightening.<\/p>  <p>  My mother has been a carer for 30 years and she is very proud of what she does but it is stressful and there is a catch-22 situation.  She does not want to leave people down.  She has been a volunteer with the Irish Wheelchair Association since I could hardly walk.  My mother is now in her 70s but she will not give it up because she feels like she would be letting people down.<\/p>  <p>  The motion is about helping people and giving people the supports they need to live life in a manner where they can be satisfied that they have the best quality of life available to them.<\/p> <p>All of us here are very lucky in that tomorrow morning we will be able to get out of bed.  There are many people in this country who in the morning will be waiting for carers to come and help them out of bed.  If we lose these vital services we will be facing a tsunami.  As stated many times on the record, we have an ageing population.  If we do not support section 39 organisations in the same way as we support 38 organisations and recognise the work of these voluntary organisations, everybody in the country will suffer. <\/p> <p> This Private Members' motion is about delivering fairness for everyone.  I am glad that the majority of Members of the House will support it.  I call on the Government to withdraw its countermotion and to do the right thing before the new year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700052#AAA00400","speaker":"1279","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1576620300,"counter":599,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh na daoine sa Ghaileara&iacute; at&aacute; ag f&eacute;achaint ar na ruda&iacute; at&aacute; ar si&uacute;l anseo.

Section 39 workers have faced a huge injustice and a deplorable lack of understanding on the part of this Government, which cannot fathom that workers should be paid fairly and should, at the very least, receive pay increases on a par with others in the service.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 39 workers fulfil a vital role in the voluntary sector, providing a valuable service to many community groups and non-profit organisations.  For example, in Finglas, organisations which depend on section 39 workers include the Finglas Addiction Support Team, FAST, the Finglas Home Help Care Organisation Limited, and in Ballymun, the Ballymun Regional Youth Resource, BRYR, Ballymun Youth Action Project, The Star Project and the PoppinTree Youth Project.  These organisations provide crucial local services and they apply them with not just expert knowledge but great local knowledge.  Many employed in these organisations come directly from the local community and have the trust of the local community.  Employees in these organisations and groups suffered large cuts to their income when public sector pay was cut.  While those working alongside them, who are regarded as public servants, have had some restoration in terms of pay, the section 39 organisations have not had an increase in funding allocation that would allow for pay restoration similar to that given to public servants, who are benefitting from increases provided for in the public service stability agreement.<\/p>  <p>  Services in areas of my constituency of Dublin North-West have already been cut and remaining section 39 employees are being made redundant or are having their hours reduced.  These organisations need a certain level of staffing to provide their  much needed services.  It is not feasible for them to continue to provide activities and services without sufficient resources and staff.  The Ballymun Youth Action Project is a community-led response to drug and alcohol misuse.  It provides vital services for the communities and families suffering from the negative impacts of drugs and alcohol.  The Ballymun Regional Youth Resource, BRYR, project works with vulnerable young people from Ballymun by supporting them in their personal development and social education and providing a healthy and nurturing environment for them.  BRYR is a safe place for young people to interact and a place which promotes positive mental health and wellbeing for young people growing up, often in very stressful environments.  The Finglas Addiction Support Team, FAST, was set up by a group of volunteers from the Finglas community to provide services in the area for drug users and their family members, which at the time were not sufficiently available.  Finglas Home Help and Care Organisation helps elderly and infirm people in their homes.  <\/p>  <p>  If we lose these organisations or if they have to vastly reduce the services they offer, where will the communities they serve find alternatives?  They will not find them.  The groups I mentioned exist because services did not exist in the first instance or they were very limited.  These groups and workers serve a purpose.  Without them, our communities will be worse off and in greater despair.  We cannot afford to allow generations of young people to be lost and families to be devastated on an issue of funding.  We need these organisations and these workers and our communities need these services.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700053#BBB00200","speaker":"1303"},{"type":"speech","time":1576620300,"counter":600,"content":"<p>I thank all Deputies for their contributions to the debate on this very important matter that has been raised in the Private Members' motion this evening.  It is important when discussing this issue that we do not forget that the role of voluntary organisations play is an issue which extends beyond the health sector.  My colleagues in the Department of Rural and Community Development lead on the Government's five-year strategy for community and voluntary sector development in Ireland and conduct ongoing consultations and interactions which enhance the effectiveness and positive impacts of the voluntary sector.<\/p>  <p>  My colleagues in the Department of Justice and Equality lead on the national disability and inclusion strategy.  Along with the Department of Health, they are working across Government, in transport, housing, employment and social protection to maximise opportunities for children, young people and adults with a disability.  As outlined by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, in his address to the House earlier, the first meeting of the new dialogue forum established in response to the report of the independent review group took place recently.  I am sure that the House will agree that we need to continue this positive progress and to continue to build on the relationships between voluntary organisations and relevant Departments and officials.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding voluntary organisations providing health and social care services under section 39 of the Health Act 2004, it would be appropriate to set forth again the differences between section 38 and section 39 organisations.  Section 38 agencies are organisations that are funded under section 38 of the Health Act 2004 to provide a defined level of health and personal social services on behalf of the HSE.  Section 38 agencies include both acute and non-acute organisations.  The employees of bodies that are funded under section 38 are classified as public servants.  They are subject to the standard salary scales for the health sector and have access, in the main, to public service pension schemes.  The employees of section 38 agencies are included in public service employment numbers.<\/p>  <p>  Section 39 of the Health Act 2004 provides that the HSE may give assistance to any person or body that provides or proposes to provide a service similar or ancillary to a service that the HSE may provide.  The HSE provides a grant to a range of private sector service providers under section 39.  The HSE puts in place a service level agreement that sets out the level of service to be provided for the grant.  The employees of section 39 organisations are not HSE employees; they are not public servants; they are not encompassed by public service pay agreements; they are not subject to the FEMPI legislation; they are not members of public sector pension schemes; and, unlike their section 38 counterparts, they are not directly bound by the Department of Health consolidated pay scales.<\/p>  <p>  While it is understood that pay cuts were implemented in many section 39 organisations during the financial crisis, it is not clear if these cuts were applied in a universally consistent manner or if the cuts were to the same extent as those applied to public servants.  The Minister for Health is aware that some section 39 organisations have raised concerns about financial sustainability with the HSE, including a number of organisations in the disability sector.  The HSE has assured the Department of Health that it is committed to working intensively with such organisations to support them as appropriate to address such issues in the context of the service level agreement process.  Where it is identified that a genuine issue is arising that may impede the effective and efficient delivery of services by section 38 or 39 social care service providers, any remedial action will need to be considered by central Government as a resolution cannot be addressed within the current health Vote resources.<\/p>  <p>  The motion also raises the issue of forward planning.  This House has given its support to Sl&aacute;intecare, the ten-year cross-party plan to significantly improve and modernise the health service.  Sl&aacute;intecare will reform Ireland's health and social care service to create a modern, responsive service that offers the right care in the right place at the right time.  Earlier this year, the Minister, Deputy Harris, and Ministers of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, Deputy Byrne and I welcomed the publication of the Sl&aacute;intecare action plan and the announcement of the 122 successful applicants for the &euro;20 million Sl&aacute;intecare integration fund.  It is essential at this time that we continue to work collaboratively with voluntary organisations to deliver existing services and move forward together with Sl&aacute;intecare reforms.  The vision of Sl&aacute;intecare is central to the disability reform programme we are implementing under Transforming Lives.  As outlined earlier by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, the quality of life for service users is improving as a result of the implementation of person-centred policies, such as moving people from congregated to decongregated settings and developing more community-based, person-centred services.<\/p>  <p>  Since this Government came to office, it has focussed on restoring the budget for disability services, which will exceed &euro;2 billion for the first time ever in 2020.  We have also been successful in agreeing a pay restoration process for nearly 12,000 individuals employed at 50 pilot bodies to the value of &euro;7 million.  <\/p>  <p>  I want to highlight the valuable contribution that voluntary organisations make across Irish society.  Ireland continues to benefit from having a voluntary sector and we all agree on the need to ensure that it is preserved into the future.  I want to thank the House for the opportunity to address these issues this evening and for the valuable contributions to this very important debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019121700053#BBB00300","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1576620900,"counter":601,"content":"<p>I wish to address a few words to the representatives of the Disability Action Coalition, the member organisations of the Oireachtas disability group and others who are present in the Visitors Gallery.  I apologise that debate on the motion began far in advance of the time set by the Business Committee, with the result that many of them missed some of the earlier contributions.  I extend a sincere welcome to them all.  Their effort is greatly appreciated.<\/p><p>I note that amendment No. 1 refers to actions the Government claims to have already been taken in an effort to try to resolve the outstanding section 39 issues.  As I stated in my opening contribution, the recent establishment of the forum must not be used as a means to kick the issue down the road.  I sincerely hope that the forum will be a valuable means to collectively address all that needs to change.  Indeed, recommendation 8.4 of the report of the independent review group called for the establishment of a new forum.  The amendment also references the ratification by the State of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  In order for the convention to take effect, the optional protocol must be ratified.  We also need the Disabilities (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 to be progressed to Report and Final Stages.  One cannot happen without the other.  Committee Stage of the Bill has concluded and it is long past time it moved to Report and Final Stages.<\/p><p>The amendment refers to pay restoration as &quot;premature&quot;.  My goodness.  Given that many of these workers have spent nearly a decade seeking pay restoration, I find that claim by the Government hard to fathom.  One cannot in one breath recognise the fantastic work done by these workers and, in the next, state that they must wait until some arbitrary future date for that which is their due to be restored.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, boasted of a pilot approach to pay restoration involving 50 of the more than 1,700 section 39 organisations of which I am aware.  The amendment refers to more than 2,000 such organisations.  Clearly, the Minister of State is aware of more of them than I have been able to uncover in my research.  What of the rest of the organisations?  Even those on the list of so-called pilot organisations must keep waiting, hang in there and hope that the Government will get to them by 2021.<\/p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, stated that the people employed by these organisations are not public servants.  That statement was reflected in the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Daly.  Technically, the Ministers of State may be right but they are far off the reality of those persons' service and motivation.  How would those who depend on them view their contribution and worth?  How do the families of those who receive their care view them?  I know many of them well.  They are the epitome of public service at its best.  That is a universal view which has been echoed by Deputies from a variety of political outlooks who have spoken on this issue tonight.  Shame on any elected voice, or anyone else, who would seek to portray them as being less entitled than others.  That contention is at the core of the arguments put forward by the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, and, sadly, is reflected in the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Daly.  Those people are not less entitled than others.  They provide an equal service and are entitled to full pay restoration in recognition of their true worth. <\/p><p>I accept the Fianna F&aacute;il addendum to the motion.  It has accepted the motion and added to it, which I welcome.  I thank the members of Fianna F&aacute;il who spoke on the motion.  Their support for the Sinn F&eacute;in motion on this key issue is appreciated.  I also thank Deputy Kelly and the Labour Party for their support, as well as all Independent colleagues who spoke on the motion.<\/p><p>Until the arrival of the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, cut a very lonely figure in the Chamber for the greater part of the debate.  He was carrying the can for the Fine Gael-led coalition and its head-in-the-sand attitude on this issue.  The contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, could not cover for the shame of the Fine Gael Deputies who have stayed away from this debate.  The empty Fine Gael benches have spoken volumes.  The Deputies who spoke on the motion put the case well.  They had the opportunity to outline the key and important issues.<\/p><p>What are we demanding?  In summary, we are calling for the Department of the Taoiseach to intensively engage with the not-for-profit sector to develop a long-term vision.  We are calling for the establishment of a forum - which was initiated and met for the first time on 2 December - to develop a plan to provide enhanced services and agree to develop a compact agreement with the State.  We have yet to reach a stage whereby we could make a judgment on its potential and whether it will fulfil our hopes for it.  We are calling for future Governments to give due recognition to the section 39 sector and to create a junior ministerial portfolio with responsibility for its component parts.  We are calling for a complete review of current legislative provisions governing the relationship between the State and not-for-profit organisations.  Finally, we are loudly calling for the Government to agree that the unequal pay terms as between section 38 and section 39 organisations must end without delay and that full pay restoration must be delivered for these workers as a priority.<\/p><p>A statement was issued by the chair of the Disability Action Coalition, Rosemary Keogh, to mark the International Day of Persons with Disabilities a little over a week ago.  She stated: <\/p> <blockquote> \tThe funding crisis in the disability sector has become so critical that the future of services for up to 65,000 men, women and children are now at serious risk.  These are services which are critical to their day-to-day lives, critical to giving people the care they need to stay alive, a chance to live a life of their choosing, a voice. <\/blockquote>  <p>I absolutely endorse those remarks and am confident that they have the support of the overwhelming majority of Members of this House.  We are the voice to which Rosemary Keogh referred.  Tomorrow evening, we will exercise our right to vote on behalf of those affected by this issue.  The Government should withdraw its amendment.  It should support the motion, the section 39 organisations, their staff and those who depend on their services.
