The primary purpose of this legislation is to amend the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 to provide for the transposition of the EU whistleblowing directive.  The directive is a significant piece of EU legislation.  It is specific about how protected disclosures are supposed to be managed and, in many areas, member states transposing it have limited discretion.  Nevertheless, in the context of the discretion that is available and in considering how to transpose the directive, we have also taken the opportunity to reflect on how our domestic legislation has been operating and consider what can be done to improve it.<\/p> <p>  The 2014 Act was innovative legislation for its time.  It drew heavily from recommendations of the Council of Europe, the G20 and the OECD, among others, as regards best practice in legislating for the protection of whistleblowers.  At the time, Ireland was only the sixth country in the EU to enact a comprehensive whistleblower protection law and the Act continues to be ranked highly in international comparisons for the protections it offers.<\/p> <p>  Of course, what matters most is not necessarily what is written in the legislation, but how that legislation operates in practice.  In this regard, the approach we have taken to developing this Bill has been informed by the submissions that were made to the public consultation on the transposition; the Act's statutory review, which was published in 2018; and direct consultations we have had with a range of stakeholders, including public service managers responsible for handling protected disclosures in their organisations, prescribed persons, employers groups, academics and Transparency International Ireland, among others.<\/p><p>One of the principal issues with the 2014 Act is that it is largely silent about what is expected of employers, prescribed persons or other recipients with regard to what they are supposed to do when they receive a protected disclosure.  This new legislation imposes a strict obligation on recipients to acknowledge receipt of protected disclosures, to follow up on the information reported and to give feedback to the discloser within a specified timeframe.  This will go a long way to ensuing the disclosures are dealt with properly and promptly and that disclosers are reassured that their concerns are being dealt with seriously by being kept informed of what is happening.<\/p><p> We are proposing the establishment of a protected disclosures office in the Office of the Ombudsman.  This will make it easier for workers to report wrongdoing to prescribed persons.  With more than 100 prescribed persons, it is not always clear to workers which prescribed person they should report to.  The protected disclosures office will have a key role in directing reports to the right place.  The office will also cover any gaps in coverage by following up on disclosures directly if there are no appropriate prescribed persons to report to for a particular matter.  Prescribed persons will also be subject to the obligation to acknowledge, follow-up and give feedback in respect of all disclosures they receive.  The protected disclosures office will also provide expert support to Ministers in respect of any protected disclosures they receive.<\/p><p> The proposed legislation will further strengthen the position of whistleblowers who are penalised and have to resort to the WRC or the courts for redress in that the burden of proof will now lie with the employer to prove any alleged act of penalisation did not arise as a consequence of a protected disclosure.  We are also extending the provision of interim relief beyond dismissal to cover other acts of penalisation, so the courts will be able to intervene more quickly to protect whistleblowers from penalisation.<\/p><p> All of this will make the legislation stronger.  As I have said, it is the implementation of the legislation that matters and we recognise that we need to do more in this area.  We are taking steps in parallel with developing the legislation to drive better implementation of the Act.  We are undertaking a complete overhaul of the statutory guidance on the Act to take into account the changes the new legislation will bring, to incorporate lessons learned, and to provide better and more detailed advice on key areas of implementation that arise frequently.  We are also developing guidance to assist the private sector in meeting the new obligations for private employers with 50 or more employees to have formal whistleblowing channels.  This will be made available shortly after the Bill is published.  We will refresh the procurement framework for training services for public sector bodies to ensure that staff designated to receive and follow up on protected disclosures are professionally trained to better deal with whistleblowers in their organisation.  We also intend to further develop and enhance existing networks of protected disclosures managers across the public service to facilitate exchange of best practices and address common implementation issues as they arise.<\/p><p> Strong legislation is an important component in any ecosystem designed to support and protect whistleblowers.  It is also crucial to have the right organisational culture that will encourage workers to speak up without fear of reprisal as a number of other contributors to the committee&rsquo;s pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme have highlighted.<\/p><p> Whistleblowers play a vital role in bringing wrongdoing to light.  For example, the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners has found that 43% of workplace fraud is detected by way of tip-offs, mainly from employees, compared with just 15% by internal audit and 2% by law enforcement.  In Ireland, four out of every five workers who report wrongdoing suffer no retaliation as a consequence of doing so, based on research undertaken.  However, where retaliation occurs, as this committee has seen, it can have devastating consequences for whistleblowers and their families.  The case for strengthening the legal protections for whistleblowers is clear and this Bill represents a step in the right direction in this regard.  My colleagues and me are happy to answer any questions the committee has about the proposed legislation.  We welcome its contribution to the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021100600002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colin Menton","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633474800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Before we move to members, has Mr. Menton taken into consideration the latest committee meeting and the papers of the witnesses who attended?

At the heart of the EU directive is this concept of a stepped procedure and process.  We have tried to take that on board in the approach to the general scheme.  It is primarily intended to ensure that there is complete clarity with regard to how these matters are to be progressed and processed, who is to process them, and the timeframe within which they are to be processed.  The step process, as we have tried to set it out, enables us to bring complete clarity to it.

What we have learned in the negotiations on the directive with our colleagues in the EU is that those best placed to address a report in the first instance are usually the employers.  As my colleague, Mr. Menton, said in the opening statement, in many instances, the report is addressed, but sometimes it is not even recognised as a protected disclosure, the wrongdoing is addressed, and everybody moves on with no penalisation.<\/p><p>However, when it goes wrong it can go very wrong.  Then you have this stepped process.  You can make a report to your employer.  If they fail in their obligation to address that report then you have recourse to get what we call a prescribed person, which the EU refers to as a competent authority, which generally tends to be the regulator in that area.  In instances where that interaction fails, which should be very unusual, you then have recourse to move into a more public forum.  To be clear, that stepped process does not stop individuals and workers from going directly to the prescribed person.  That is always an option as well if it is his or her preference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021100600002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Ciara Morgan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633474800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Morgan.

There would obviously be concerns about that.  If somebody were working with me and we did not get on or whatever it may be, could it then be seen as an interpersonal grievance, if that person was trying to whistleblow on me, so to speak?  That is an area of concern.  How do the officials feel that would work?  In what ways would that actually hinder people?  We must look at it in that sense as well, if it does hinder people, and be straight up and honest about that.  Alternatively, how do the officials feel the Bill stops that from hindering people?  I would be interested in answers to those and then I have one more question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021100600002#E00200","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1633474800,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Menton want to reply?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021100600002#E00300","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633474800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I ask my colleague Mr. Keane to say a word on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021100600002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colin Menton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633474800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I will set out some of the thinking behind this.  The purpose of the Protected Disclosures Act, as it says in its Long Title, is to protect persons making \"certain disclosures in the public interest\".  Similarly, the directive states its purpose is to provide for:  \"... the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law ... [...] ... that are harmful to the public interest ...\".  While neither piece of legislation has a formal public interest test it is clear matters such as private interest, such as personal grievances, lie outside the scope of this legislation in general.  That is not to say personal grievances are not important but we must recognise such matters are to a large extent already protected by the very significant corpus of employment law, much of which existed for many decades before the Protected Disclosures Act.<\/p> <p>  It was never the intention of the Protected Disclosures Act that it should become an alternative avenue for the airing of personal grievances but in practice we have seen there have been some problems in this area.  There is a small but not insignificant number of cases that appear before the WRC that have tried to introduce protected disclosures into matters that are solely personal grievances.  Similarly, a small but not insignificant number of employers have raised concerns with us that some personal grievances that have already concluded formal internal grievance processes have been raised again by employees as protected disclosures.  In all these cases this has led to a certain amount of wasted time and effort on matters that should be outside of this legislation so we feel the legislation needs to make more clear this distinction between personal grievances and other forms of wrongdoing.  We noted a number of the other witnesses who appeared before the committee in earlier hearings have welcomed efforts in this area, although they did have a couple of notes of caution about it.  In that regard, we recognise there are situations where the line between a protected disclosure and a personal grievance can be blurred.  The wording of this provision is really important so it is not interpreted too widely.  In this regard, the wording we currently have is that matters \"... concerning interpersonal grievances exclusively affecting the reporting person ...\" will not be considered protected disclosures.  That would mean an isolated incident of bullying, perhaps, between a manager and an employee would be a private interest and would not be a protected disclosure.  It would be dealt with under employment law or under whatever internal grievance process exists within the organisation.  However, where there is a situation where there is a report or a series of reports that suggest a wider culture of workplace bullying, those certainly would be protected disclosures.<\/p> <p>  We recognise getting the wording of this right is going to be very important so we are open to suggestions from the committee and anybody else about wording that will ensure the correct application of this provision in practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021100600002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1633474800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I understand what Mr. Keane is saying and what he means in that sense.  However, what of the opposite situation, which he touched on at the end?  The whole concern about this is if somebody is whistleblowing or making a protected disclosure, that it could be dismissed as an interpersonal grievance when it is not one, if he knows what I mean.  I take his point that the Department is open to wording suggestions, etc., and I will follow up with the officials on that.  It will probably be after the budget, to be perfectly honest, but I will follow up on that.<\/p> <p>  My last question goes back to the impact this has.  These are very brave people and it takes a huge amount of courage and many other things to go forward and make a protected disclosure because it can and often does have a big impact on the person, his or her family and so on.  Do the officials think free access to psychological services would be worth having?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021100600002#E00600","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633474800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Absolutely.  Going back to the Chairman's initial question to us about the earlier contributions and the committee's earlier sessions, we were very taken with that issue and that dimension to this also, and we have been giving it some thought.  It may be of interest to be aware that Transparency International Ireland is planning a pilot service around this and we will be looking with great interest at that in terms of it maybe helping to inform us as to how we might plan some future initiatives in this area.<\/p> <p>  There are a couple of dimensions to this we must be a little bit careful about.  One is about ensuring the provision of services in and of itself, or an individual being seen to be availing of them, does not give rise to unintended consequences for that individual or cause him or her to be seen in a particular way that might be adverse to him or her.  I was quite struck by some of the contributions in the earlier sessions where witnesses talked about the personal impact on individuals when what they have done comes to light and what they have tried to bring to light.  We want to ensure whatever might be contemplated in this area does not somehow rebound on them in a bad way, even though our motives might be the right ones, if the Deputy understands me.

We look at European countries in particular and especially the Netherlands because it has taken the approach of establishing a dedicated whistleblowing agency so we certainly wanted to examine how that would work.  We also looked at Latvia, which is kind of similar in the way it is set up, especially in the way it organises its competent authorities, or prescribed persons as we have here.

They are very strong provisions and they should be very strong.  It is very important that they are.  This, however, can be the situation when a report comes in: people almost become paralysed in that they are afraid to move on it.  They are afraid that if they transmit this to another person who can take action on it, it might expose the identity of the person making the report.

Timelines have been very clearly set out whereby one must acknowledge a report within seven days, feedback must be given within three to six months, and be followed on by the report.

I believe this hopes to address that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021100600002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Ciara Morgan"},{"type":"speech","time":1633474800,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021100600002#F00800","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1633474800,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I will pick up on a few areas, one of which has been mentioned already.  I hear that the witnesses have heard there are concerns around the personal grievance space and interpersonal piece.  The concern is not just that somebody can still make a protected disclosure, but it is around how it might be interpreted.  It might be useful to have a clarification on this.  For example, somebody may have an interpersonal grievance, which may indeed be valid, and the person may be pursuing one channel on this, but that does not preclude the person from also making a protected disclosure in relation to a systemic issue or other wider issue.  It might be useful for this to be clear in the legislation.  Very often, people are used to a hierarchy of reporting or the hierarchy of engagement, whereby the issue is already being dealt with through one route, the person has chosen path A and, therefore, cannot choose path B.  It needs to be very clear to people that the other routes are open to them, including making a report to prescribed persons.  We cannot rely on those who become whistleblowers to know this.  They are not necessarily starting out as legal experts and it is a very frightening thing for somebody to make that decision.  They need to be confident in it, and such clarity would signal that.<\/p> <p>  As highlighted by some of the witnesses and identified here, there were issues in the past around the complaint or concern going back to those who were being complained about or being whistleblown about.  I understand there are some are some attempts to address this in the legislation but there is still a bit of vulnerability there in assessing the space around the validity of this as a protected disclosure.<\/p> <p>  I have another concern about accountability.  It is about the balance whereby we want to ensure that we can protect people, but we also want to make sure that we do not simply have this sitting in a separate space, and that there is a level of accountability, consequence and change within the organisation, the public body or the entity about whom the whistle is being blown.  This is particularly concerning with regard to the ministerial part.  There have been past concerns about ambiguity.  For example, if a person makes a protected disclosure to the Minister for Transport - to take one example, which is not the example I am thinking of - is the disclosure to the individual as a prescribed person or is it to the role of the Minister?  There has been an ambiguity around this in the past.  I am interested that this is phrased in the Bill as support to the Minister.  How do we ensure that such support does not end up effectively diminishing the political accountability piece of this or that Ministers end up getting cut out of the picture?<\/p><p>In the past, many issues and wrongdoings were framed as administrative errors or matters but there is a danger of the issue moving far away from persons who can be held accountable and being seen as separate to them.  That is also true of people who can execute cultural change.<br\/><br\/>I am also concerned about a more ambitious role for the office around protected disclosures.  It is very much framed as the data comes in and it is there to deal with individual wrongdoings but I am thinking of identifying patterns.  I am thinking of one submission, from <i>Raiseaconcern.com<\/i>.  One question that needs to be asked is why these issues were not identified previously.  If a similar type of financial abuse or other abuse occurred in three or four public bodies, they would be placed alongside each other.  One of the big failures of the previous legislation was reporting.  How can there be more robust reporting and how can the office playing a role in identifying the patterns from reporting?  It would be a case whereby the data would not be stored in an inappropriate way but that it would, at least, contribute to identifying patterns of bad practice or poor practice.  <br\/><br\/>I am using the word &quot;retrospective&quot; but I do not believe that it is retrospective; it is more accurately ongoing, that is, continuing cases.  There have been cases where people have made a protected disclosure, which may well predate this legislation, and a resolution has still not happened.  They may not have received communication on what the consequences of those actions were and, in most cases, they have not been able to access the compensation payment, sometimes because the paperwork for that compensation payment is going through the body that they are whistleblowing about or it gets tied up there.  For cases where the disclosure may be in the past but other parts of the process remain unresolved, will the whistleblowers be able to access the rights in terms of communication and compensation that are provided by this legislation?They should to build confidence in whistleblowing.  <br\/><br\/>On communication, I recognise there is the feedback after six months and then there is the final outcome, but there can be five years between those sometimes.  I believe this should be strengthened so that a person who has made a disclosure, who may be working in fear or concern, not knowing what those on whom they have blown the whistle know about them, may be able to get feedback or an update on where the process is at, so that there is an in-between right to communication and information. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021100600002#F00900","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633474800,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I will try to respond on a number of those points and my colleagues will also want to come in.  I agree on interpersonal grievances.  It is important, as earlier contributions highlighted.  The objective in the Bill is to try to be as clear as possible on that and what is intended to happen in specific instances.  The definition and language around that will be key.  As my colleague mentioned, we are open to suggestions and contributions from the committee on that.<\/p> <p>  The ministerial channel is a key issue and it was in our considerations.  I mentioned earlier that one issue that has beset the current arrangements is the confusion and multiplicity of potential channels operating side by side.  What we would like to do with the legislation that we are trying to develop here is to be clear as to what the processes are for individual reporters in given instances.  We are in no way trying to remove the Minister from that process but rather be clear that when a Minister receives something, there is an immediate pathway to moving it on and progressing it and that there is a centre of expertise and best practice to which that matter will be sent swiftly for urgent action and response.  That is where building in the protected disclosure commissioner and that office into this architecture is key to fixing elements of the current arrangements that probably have not operated to their potential or to extent that we would have liked.<\/p> <p>  I could not agree more on timing.  I am reminded of the earlier sessions the committee had and the contributions at those on the passage of time in some of those specific cases and the toll it takes on individuals.  We are clear that this legislation needs to have a firm set of timelines to minimise the burden and toll that such a process can hold for individuals.  The timeframe set out in the legislation will hopefully provide some comfort and reassurance around that.<\/p> <p>  My colleagues might answer on interim feedback.  It is something that could be looked at.

The Senator is correct.  There will be situations where investigations of some complexity will last for a long time.  It would be essential that people would receive more than just one feedback conversation beyond what is specified in the Act itself.  We think that is something that would have to be dealt with more through the statutory guidance than through the law.  One reason is the conditions that apply for making a public disclosure.  The person has to have a reasonable belief, having had their initial feedback conversation after the three months, that nothing is being done about the report that has been made.  If there is a provision in law whereby feedback conversation after feedback conversation can be rolled on, that makes it easier for the employer or person to string out the process and prevent the person from making a public disclosure.  We feel that putting it into the Bill itself could be legally tricky for that reason and maybe contrary to what is required by the directive.  It is something that could be elaborated on in guidance because we do agree with the principle.  It is possible that after three months, one might have only started on the process on something incredibly complicated that requires multiple witnesses to be interviewed and thousands or millions of documents to be examined.  Clearly there has to be a situation where the person is kept involved and informed along the way but it is in guidance rather than the law where that has to be provided for.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the point the Senator made on interpersonal grievances.  It is common with most protected disclosures that a person does not simply report one thing.  They report maybe five or six different things and they are often a mixture of personal grievances and protected disclosures.  It is incumbent on the recipients who basically go through these and break them down into individual sub-reports and say of the six things reported that they would consider two to be personal grievances, which can be dealt with through our grievance procedure.  The remaining four are purely protected disclosures and they would deal with them and those wrongdoings using the protected disclosures procedure.  Again, it is something that can be elaborated on in the guidance rather than in legislation for the purpose of allowing for the right level of flexibility for people to operate and implement the legislation.  We could also look at the wording of the definition of \"follow-up\" and what is meant in terms of what needs to be done in the initial assessment process when the disclosure is made.

We have ongoing engagement with the Office of the Ombudsman around the establishment of that office and it has been extremely helpful, given its broad experience in regard to complaints in general, in speccing out what that office could look at and how it could act.  We had not actually envisaged the idea of the data role sitting with that office, and that is something we had intended to hold within the Department from a policy perspective to be able to do that analysis, look at trends and so on.  I see the point about being able to leverage that expertise in the Office of the Ombudsman as the new protected disclosures commissioner office builds its expertise and best practice.  It is something we might keep an eye on and keep under review as we see how those things roll out and as they get established.  We certainly want to be sure that we are able to look at the landscape and the impacts of the legislation, and ensure it is operating as intended.  In that regard, the commission intends to review the impact of the whistleblowing directive a number of years afterwards, and that will probably trigger our own review at that stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021100600002#H00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Ciara Morgan"},{"type":"speech","time":1633474800,"counter":41,"content":"<p>The final piece was around ongoing cases and the access to compensation and communication.

I am a co-sponsor of legislation against the misuse of non-disclosure agreements, NDAs, with my colleague, Senator Lynn Ruane.  If somebody has previously signed a non-disclosure agreement or if they have signed a specific confidentiality clause in regard to trade secrets or being on a board, it would be very useful for them to have a signal that that does not preclude them.  While I know it does not preclude them, people might need to hear that it does not preclude them, because people are careful and they do not want to find themselves in a situation of wrongdoing.

In regard to the draft Bill and the European directive, can Mr. Menton point us to the sections of the Bill and the proposed changes where the experiences and issues raised by whistleblowers have been addressed in a way that might prevent the difficulties faced by whistleblowers happening again?  Whistleblowers complain, for example, that the issues have not been dealt with or addressed.  How is that dealt with in the Bill?  How is the fact that whistleblowers&rsquo; experiences to date have been such that it is the whistleblower who is the victim in all of these cases and it is the whistleblower who pays the price?  How is that addressed?<\/p> <p>  One whistleblower in the Prison Service, who was mentioned to us, received an award but that has not been paid to him yet.  How do we force agencies of the State or Departments to honour a decision made in the case of whistleblowers, such as Noel McGree, who was here publicly, so I can mention his name?  How does the legislation address, for example, the whistleblower from CIT, where the new president of the Munster university refused to meet to try to resolve those issues in terms of mediation?<\/p> <p>  In the context of the legal process itself, all whistleblowers are encouraged to go through mediation, which can often break down and can be stalled.  That can prevent a further court case and it means the conclusion to the particular whistleblower&rsquo;s case is prolonged.  Overall, the experience seems to have been that the legislation was never tested in court, particularly on the public side.  Only one private case was brought and that was settled with a confidentiality clause.  In the context of confidentiality clauses being applied, we found out at our last meeting that there is no information around that.  Surely the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform must know the number of cases that were taken against Departments that were resolved on the steps of the court.  If it asked each Secretary General, they could tell the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that they had a case.  They need not divulge any names or settlements, but they could say they had a case and they settled it on the steps of the court.  Surely, where whistleblowers&rsquo; cases are pending, all of those whistleblowers and the taxpayer are entitled to know what the Government agencies and the Departments are doing with their money.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the legacy issues that were brought before Departments and agencies under the current piece of legislation, what is to happen to the ones that are in a cul-de-sac, the ones that are forced to chase Departments, the ones that are treated badly by Departments and agencies?  What is to happen to those in the context of this legislation?  Will they be covered by any new sections that will give them a break?  Frankly, and I have said this time and again, I think the State has blackguarded whistleblowers in this country and it is shocking to watch the result of that blackguarding on the individual and their families, and there is also the disrespect and cynicism it creates in terms of the political and bureaucratic system in the State.  I ask Mr. Menton to comment on those few points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021100600002#H00500","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633474800,"counter":45,"content":"<p>On that last point, absolutely, that came through very strongly in the committee's earlier sessions, of that there is no question.  In terms of the Bill itself and looking to the future, we would point to the timelines, to the revised redress provisions within it and to the strengthened penalisation clauses.  I will ask Mr. Keane to articulate a couple of points on that in terms of providing the committee with reassurance around some of the issues the Chairman has pointed to in terms of how the current legislative framework will be changed by what is proposed in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021100600002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colin Menton"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633474800,"counter":46,"content":"<p>In terms of some of the main changes being put through under the heads of the Bill, one of them is the extension of the personal scope, whereby we are building beyond ordinary employees into other categories of people who also have a working relationship with an organisation, including volunteers, board members and trainees, for example.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the operation of the legislation itself, obviously, a clear change is the requirement on the private sector to have formal, published channels and procedures setting out how people can make reports and setting out what other channels of reporting are available to them if they are dissatisfied with how the internal process has gone.  Of course, as was said in earlier responses, those procedures will at a minimum require acknowledgement of the protected disclosure, diligent follow-up of the protected disclosure and that feedback be given to the person.<\/p><p>There is certainly a lot of reassurance there because one of the common complaints we get from whistleblowers is that they make their report and it disappears into a black hole.  This cannot happen.<\/p><p> The other factor, which is something we already have in legislation but which is worth reflecting on, because it is in the directive as well, is the stepped disclosure regime.  In other words, if you start out at one level, such as a report to your employer, and if he or she fails to co-operate, you have the option of then going to a prescribed person who is subject to the same requirements that I just set out as regards acknowledgement, follow-up and feedback.  If that fails, then there is the more significant option of going public and seeing how that works.  There are plenty of options if a failure in the process along the way occurs.  You would hope that in most cases everything would be dealt with at the first stage but the legislation anticipates what might happen when things go wrong and what the options are for people around that.<\/p><p> It is also worth reflecting on the fact that we are extending the interim relief provisions.  Currently, you have an entitlement to interim relief in the event of an unfair dismissal, but now it will apply to other forms of penalisation as well.  That is a significant strengthening because it means that when penalisation comes, you can go straight to a court and seek an injunction and you do not have to wait for the WRC or for the court to give you a hearing, which can be a lengthy process at times.  That is an important one.<\/p><p> Another one relates to the reversal of the burden of proof.  It is going to fall to the employer to prove that the person suffered a penalisation, and not because he or she made a protected disclosure.  It no longer means the employee has to prove that connection, and that is going to be a big factor in terms of cases, because that is often a determining factor in the way the WRC deals with those cases.<\/p><p> I would like to deal with another issue as we are talking about the WRC and the question of enforcement of awards made by it or by the Labour Court.  We obviously cannot talk about the specific case with regard to what appeared a fortnight ago but we should say that under current legislation, if an employer fails to carry out a decision of the WRC or the Labour Court, the worker affected or his or her trade union, if he or she is in one, can apply to the District Court for an order directing the employer or the respondent to comply with that decision.  This can be done 56 days after the WRC makes an adjudication, or 42 days after the Labour Court makes an adjudication.  In addition, a worker or his or her trade union can apply to the WRC for assistance in enforcement of decisions to the District Court.  If it accepts such a request, the WRC will make the application to the court on behalf of the complainant and will bear the legal costs involved, so if a person is in a position where he or she cannot hire a solicitor to enforce the WRC's decision, the WRC will actually act on his or her behalf.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021100600002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633474800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I want to address the point made by the Chair on whether the legislation is enough.

How do you support a cultural shift to recognise the value and the bravery of people who are reporting wrongdoing, often at significant cost to themselves?  This is an area where we want to do more.  We have plans to enact the legislation, but that is not enough.  To transpose the directive, implementation measures are required.  We have mentioned that we are going to be doing more comprehensive guidance to support public bodies in the first instance, and awareness-raising measures with business.  We have a good relationship with Transparency International Ireland and we keep in touch with and take input from it in regard to what might be needed.  It is about pushing that culture and tying into those wider reform measures in our Department on the public service reform side and the Civil Service renewal side to see how many angles can we come at this from.

We do not want what we so often had in Ireland where civil society organisations end up setting the good practice and doing the work.

We know that sometimes whistleblowers will work together.  Especially in the case of a large organisation, you may get a group.<\/p> <p>  There was a question of there being some difficulty, leaving aside the compensation case which really is that question the Chair put very strongly around the absolute failure to deliver compensation.  This is literally a very bare and nominal compensation for the harm suffered by whistleblowers.  It is also a question of supports for whistleblowers, including counselling supports and access to other supports.  There was a conversation, which I am sure the witnesses followed, in our other sessions around the difficulties even getting interim support, which is something people have sometimes had to access to and again that has been inadequate.

That was the question of the signal that making a protected disclosure is not constrained.  This actually related to another key issue that the Bar Council highlighted around the concern that people would not think that this applied to them.  I refer to the definition of the reporting person being a worker.  There has been a signal that there is a plan to interpret it in a certain way but one of the cohorts was board members, volunteers or applicants to an organisation, a school parents' association member or whoever it might be.  There was concern here, and the witnesses might comment on how they plan to address that definition of \"worker\" as the reporting person and the need to maybe expand that definition.  Linked to that was my point around the NDA piece or the confidentiality clause for a board member and so forth, and that people be very clearly assured in the law that they are in the right line on that.<\/p> <p>  The specific focus on the areas of discretion under the EU directive was mentioned.  I will not ask the witnesses to go through all of them but they could highlight some of the decisions made in respect of discretionary aspects of the EU directive, and maybe outline why they were made.

Section 14 provides immunity from civil liability for making a protected disclosure.  It is stronger than what is in the directive, under which there is not an absolute immunity from civil liability.  Rather, someone can merely offer the fact that he or she has made a permissible complaint as a defence in a court case.  The only exception we have relates to the Defamation Act, which I understand has to do with the constitutional right to a person's good name.  We also have protections to the effect that, where someone has made a protected disclosure, it does not constitute a criminal offence.  If I were to make a protected disclosure, I would not breach any of the legal obligations that I am subject to as a civil servant under the Official Secrets Act, for example.<br\/><br\/>We have strong protections in terms of NDAs.  They are in section 23 of the Protected Disclosures Act, under which it is clear that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tAny provision in an agreement is void in so far as it purports&mdash;  \t(a) to prohibit or restrict the making of protected disclosures,<br \/><br \/>(b) to exclude or limit the operation of any provision of this Act,<br \/><br \/>(c) to preclude a person from bringing any proceedings under or by virtue of this Act, or<br \/><br \/>(d) to preclude a person from bringing proceedings for breach of contract in respect of anything done in consequence of the making of a protected disclosure.  <\/blockquote> <p>This section effectively voids any NDA that a person is told to sign.  As such, this matter is covered.  Indeed, our provisions are stronger in some areas than what is required under the directive.<br\/><br\/>Regarding discretionary areas, I can go through a few points.  Along with the other documentation, we submitted to the committee a preliminary draft regulatory impact assessment.  It set out some of our thinking in this regard and probably contains a great deal more detail, if the Senator wishes to examine it.  However, I will go through a couple of aspects.<br\/><br\/>One of the areas where there is a certain amount of discretion is that of anonymous reporting, which is one of the more difficult areas we have had to handle.  It is probably fair to say that we got a great deal of feedback on this during the public consultation.  It was finely balanced between people who thought it was a great idea and people who thought it was not such a great idea.  It is difficult to judge which side of the fence to fall on.  In the end, we felt that one of the major challenges in handling an anonymous disclosure is that it can cause administrative difficulties.  For example, it is necessary under the directive that reports be made by a person who has a workplace relationship with the organisation.  If someone makes a disclosure anonymously, that relationship cannot be verified.  Therefore, it becomes a question of whether the rules on how reports must be treated in terms of acknowledgement, follow-up and feedback apply.  On the other hand, modern technology has made two-way communication with an anonymous person easier than in the past when a letter might have arrived in the post with no signature on it and there was no way of following up on it.  However, not knowing the identity of the reporting person can make it much more difficult to follow up on a matter, especially if there is no means of making further contact to, for example, get clarification or more information.<br\/><br\/>Another point is that a person might believe that he or she is safer when making an anonymous report, but protecting someone from harm can sometimes be difficult, for example, if the incidents described are specific enough that the accused person figures out who reported him or her and subjects that person to harassment.  The informer might not be aware of this and the situation could be made much worse.  There is also a small risk that allowing anonymous reporting can enable employees to harass colleagues by submitting untrue or defamatory reports.  Without knowing the identity of the person making the report, it is difficult to punish false reporting.<br\/><br\/>There are also a number of legal issues because Irish legislation in some places specifically prohibits some organisations from following up on anonymous disclosures.  This is mainly due to the fact that disclosures may be related to judicial matters, which require providing the right to a fair hearing where the identity of the discloser must be known.  Examples of that are the regulations we made under the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003 and the Standards in Public Office Act 2001.  The flip side to this is that there are also some laws that specifically permit anonymous disclosures, particularly in respect of financial services money laundering.<br\/><br\/>We acknowledge that a number of organisations find accepting anonymous reports to be beneficial.  Notwithstanding that, we have come to the view that a blanket requirement to follow up on all anonymous disclosures would be problematic for many organisations.  It appears to us that the best way to approach this is for anonymous disclosures to be taken on a case-by-case basis.  We are providing that it be at the discretion of each organisation to set a policy on anonymous reporting.  That is the route we will take with the Bill.<br\/><br\/>I will be brief in responding to some of the other questions that were asked.  We have been asked about the establishment of internal reporting channels and whether they should apply to some entities with fewer than 50 employees.  There are already certain exemptions in the directive around financial services, oil and gas safety, and aviation and other areas of transport safety.  We are of the view that this could be explored on a sector-by-sector basis.  We are providing in the Bill that the Minister can, subject to a risk assessment, make an order classifying a certain sector of the economy as having a lower threshold for having formal internal channels and procedures.  At the previous meeting, a couple of suggestions were made about accountancy bodies and some digital companies.  There could be merit in that and it is something that we could consider, but we believe that a blanket approach would be disproportionate.  It would probably represent a significant compliance burden for small organisations and would not suit small builders, for example, a builder and two mates in a van, the local sweet shop, etc.  A blanket obligation is probably not workable in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021100600002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1633474800,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I might make a quick follow-up point on that, as Senator Casey wishes to contribute.

Our solution to how a competent authority is designated is the protected disclosures office, given that we recognise that there are a few shortcomings in the way the prescribed person system operates.  We have more than 100 prescribed persons, so it can sometimes be confusing for workers to figure out to whom they are supposed to report.  This would also clear up a number of the gaps in the provision.  The protected disclosures office proposal deals with many of those issues.  As I said in reply to Deputy Durkan, this is an area where we examined what other countries did.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the discretion for prescribed persons to close reports that were minor or repetitive, we had almost universal agreement on that being included.<\/p><p>We have provided for that.

The Department deals with legislation, the law, how it should be framed, the context of the wording and so on.  I deal with practicalities for whistleblowers and their experiences.  In most cases, whistleblowers will say that if they had known this was going to happen to them, they would never have informed their boss or made a protected disclosure.  That in itself is shocking and needs to be corrected.  I will ask some questions and leave them with the witnesses.  These are names that are known publicly because they have been before the committee.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Keane answered about Noel McGree.  He said that the award was made.  It was never paid.  Reports that are outstanding in his case have never been concluded.  Only some were given to him before he last appeared before the committee.  There has been dragging of heels, at least, with regard to his case.  He told us that he lost his house and everything.  He blew the whistle and made a significant contribution in what he did and said.  The witnesses will understand why people would want to be able to make an anonymous protected disclosure.  A balance has to be struck between those that are nuisance, mischievous and all of that, and the ones that stand out.  I would like to see, where awards are made, that they are actually forced to honour those awards without the whistleblower having to pursue the matter further.  This comes after years and years of fighting with whatever organisation might be involved.  Noel McGree is out of his job.<\/p> <p>  In the case of the Grace report, the person who came before the Houses of the Oireachtas for assistance is no longer in her job.  Due to a confidentiality clause, we cannot find out any more about it.  The State did that, and did it to Noel McGree too.<\/p> <p>  I ask the witnesses to look at what happened to Maurice McCabe and John Wilson.  Within their stories and the experiences that they had are issues that should be corrected with legislation.  The witnesses are best positioned to look at those and devise some way or some wording that would correct the difficulties that they have in the course of bringing their case forward and making it easier for others to address such cases in the future.<\/p> <p>  Another name in public is Seanie O'Brien.  He made his protected disclosure to the Department of Justice and, more recently, to the Taoiseach's office.  It has never been dealt with.  He has never been communicated properly with about what he has to say.  There has not been closure to it.  I do not want the witnesses to comment on these cases.  I am simply highlighting them to determine if there is some way that they can be dealt with or if what happened can be dealt with in a different way through legislation.  There is a similar issue in the Committee of Public Accounts, where a whistleblower was outed in correspondence from a legal firm to the Committee of Public Accounts.  If the law was broken, why could the Houses of the Oireachtas not take them to task about it rather than leaving it to the whistleblower to raise whatever they wished to raise over being outed?  It is something that should not be done under the current legislation, yet it happened.  It happened in the place where the law was made.  I think the place where it happened did not act as it should have acted in the context of the outing of that person.<\/p> <p>  I have mentioned the John Wilson case.  What happens to these people is a tragedy.<\/p> <p>  The Women of Honour is another issue in the Army.  Individuals have come to me who have been sexually abused in the Army.  It took years to get that out.  It damaged many lives.  We have to find a way for the State to deal with those issues and make whoever is a line manager, or whoever it is reported to, deal with it.<\/p><p>This brings me to the point of the protected disclosures office.  It is fine to have proposed legislation, which states that we should have a protected disclosures office and that this is how it should function.  I would like to see examples, however, from other countries of how their protected disclosure offices function.  The details that Mr. Menton could provide to the committee include how many people are employed in those offices, the costs of running such offices and the overall general costs involved.  I ask that because if such an office were to be established by this proposed legislation, then a large number of people will come forward, at least in the beginning until those considering making protected disclosures figure out if the new office is worth its salt.  <\/p><p> On the private side of things, the cases we have had have included Allied Irish Banks, AIB, and the EBS tied agents.  Those tied agents are just worn out and some of them have died.  Private companies that are large and well capable financially of dealing with issues such as this can easily brush off even an organised group similar to the EBS tied agents or, indeed, individuals such as Tony Lawlor and Jonathan Sugarman, who also appeared before this committee.  It is an issue in respect of the Central Bank of Ireland and what it does following a protected disclosure.  It will say that it has dealt with the protected disclosure, but that it cannot reveal what it has done in that regard because that is a matter between the Central Bank and the regulated bank concerned.  Proposed legislation in this area should allow for the naming of a bank, an individual or whatever it might be to bring a conclusion to an issue.  Legislation regarding the Central Bank is involved in that area, but this proposed legislation should overlap with it.<\/p><p> Regarding local government and the case of Ms Julie Grace, a report was requested and she went through the various processes.  The case has gone on for years and years.  It is not an individual that is stopping progress being made, it is the State preventing the case from being resolved.  In that instance, as with all the others, Ms Grace has brought something positive and truthful to the attention of the State and yet it is people like this who get penalised.  I cannot figure out why that is.  Culture was mentioned by the witnesses and it takes a while to root out that culture, but if we do not start speaking openly, honestly and directly about those who are a part of that culture, then it will remain in place forever.  That is why I am relying heavily on this proposed legislation to change the course of all that.  I am not asking for answers to all of these.  I am just using those points to explain in layman's terms the experiences of those people who have come to me.  Those experiences have never been good.  They have always been terribly negative, divisive and destructive in respect of families and individuals.  That State does not speak for me.  That is not my State.  <\/p><p> On the political front, I hope that a whip will not be imposed during the passage of this proposed legislation.  I hope the Members of this D&aacute;il will be allowed to consider all amendments and any proposals from the Minister and the Department regarding this proposed legislation in a way that is constructive and without the divisiveness of a whip.  I will deal with that in the political arena.  I consider this legislation to be important for everyone who needs to come forward in respect of allowing them to obtain the requisite protection to enable them to tell their story.  I am sorry for having gone a bit, but I have just heard too much negativity around this matter.  I want to see this proposed legislation being right.  We are at the end of the meeting and any of the witnesses can comment if they wish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2021100600002#L01000","speaker":"1496","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633474800,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair for those thoughts.

I am joined by the Secretary General of the Department of Health, Mr. Robert Watt.<\/p> <p>  Members of the committee and others will have been concerned about the resignations of Ms Laura Magahy, as executive director, Professor Tom Keane and other members of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation advisory council.  I regret their resignations.  I pay tribute to their determination to implement the vision of a universal, single-tier health and social care system.<\/p> <p>  In the first instance, I would like to assure everyone, and those who may be watching today, of my absolute commitment and the commitment of the Government to universal healthcare.  That commitment is absolute and unwavering.<\/p> <p>  Universal healthcare has never been achieved in Ireland and we are still far from it today.  Changing that, making universal healthcare a reality, is one of the defining projects of our time.  Our goal is clear.  It is timely and affordable access to consistently high-quality care for everyone.  Sl&aacute;intecare matters because it provides a pathway for this.  Doing it requires very significant funding and we have made a very substantial investment.  Investment of more than &euro;1.2 billion in budget 2021 has allowed us to increase capacity, which is fundamental to improving access to care.<\/p> <p>  I pay tribute to my officials and those working in the HSE for the significant progress and reform that has been delivered in spite of the pandemic and cyberattack.  I will not be able to list all of those achievements today but the increase across various areas is substantial.<\/p> <p>  We have delivered record increases in hospital bed capacity.  We have already added around 850 permanent beds to the hospital system this year.  That is the equivalent of about two medium-sized hospitals and more will be added between now and the end of the year.  In fact, we will have added more permanent beds to the system this year than have been added in any single year in decades.<\/p> <p>  Some &euro;52 million was also provided this year to increase critical care capacity.  We have delivered a record increase in critical care beds.  We had 255 critical care beds at the beginning of last year.  We now have 296 critical care beds and more will be delivered in the coming months.  We plan to have 321 critical care beds in place by the end of this year or very early in 2022.  That represents an increase of 66 beds or 25% in total critical care capacity in just two years.  To put that in perspective, we delivered an average of six critical care beds per year between 2017 and 2019.  We will have gone from an average of six beds a year to 66 beds in just two years.  Our plans are ambitious and I have already brought a plan to Cabinet, which has been agreed by Cabinet, aimed at increasing critical care beds to 446 over time.  Critically, this will exceed the recommendation of the 2018 health service capacity review.<\/p> <p>  We have 6,000 more staff working in the health service than we did last summer.  That includes almost 1,400 more nurses and midwives, and 1,200 health and social care professionals.<\/p> <p>  I am bringing proposals to Cabinet in respect of three elective hospitals in Cork, Dublin and Galway.  Very significant work has been done on this by the Sl&aacute;intecare office.<\/p> <p>  I would like to talk about new patient pathways and care closer to the home.  Various initiatives and reforms are ensuring that people receive care closer to their home.  Some &euro;25 million was allocated to the GP access to diagnostics initiative this year.  It enables GPs to refer patients directly to access diagnostics, including X-rays, MRIs, computed tomography, CT, scans and many more.  These are in a community-based setting.  I am delighted to be able to share with the committee that we estimate that through this new initiative, which was a core recommendation in Sl&aacute;intecare, we estimate that about 140,000 additional scans will be carried out by the end of this year.  That is very positive.<\/p> <p>  There has been a dramatic reduction in waiting lists for funding approvals for home care.  Thanks to a large increase in funding there are no waiting lists at all for home care packages in some areas thus ensuring that we deliver on our objective to keep people well at home and out of hospital.<\/p><p>I am excited by what we are seeing in respect of the redesign of care pathways and the incredible impact that skilled advanced nurse practitioners are having.  Many patients who would otherwise have had to wait for traditional hospital appointments or to attend emergency departments can be treated in the community using these new pathways to care.  I will give an example. A pilot service to manage people living with heart failure, provided by specialist nurses in County Donegal, saw waiting times for new patient referrals drop from 18 months to between two and six weeks.  The current target, which is to have 2% of the nursing and midwifery workforce, approximately 800 people, working as advanced nurse practitioners or advanced midwifery practitioners, will be reached. I want that to be scaled up and have asked my Department to revert with a plan to that effect.  This area has great untapped potential for our healthcare system.  It fundamentally redesigns the model of care, bringing specialist care much closer to the patient and keeping it out of the hospital, wherever possible.<\/p><p> One aspect of universal healthcare that gets less attention than access is quality.  There is, understandably, a great deal of focus on access in our country because of the completely unacceptable waiting lists.  We will come to that but one of the core components of universal healthcare is a consistently high quality of care.  The reality in Ireland is that it can be hard to access parts of the public health system but, when one does, the quality of that care is often excellent.  That may not be the case in some cases.  There are also parts of the system where the care is good but needs to get better.  If we are serious about universal healthcare, we have to be serious about a consistently high quality of care.  One of the main routes to this is via our clinical strategies in maternity care, cancer care, trauma, mental health and many more.  This year, I allocated funding to ensure these strategies were, for the first time, fully funded.  I am delighted to be able to share with the committee that a lot of progress is being made on behalf of patients.  I encourage the committee to consider allocating some of its time to invite the clinical leads in these areas in to discuss this progress with them.  We have had some productive debates in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad on issue such as maternity care and cancer care.  Serious improvements and progress are being made now that the strategies are being funded.  It would be great to be able to hear from the clinical leads on that.<\/p><p> As the committee will be aware, the Government approved the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy and action plan for the period from 2021 to 2023.  The Sl&aacute;intecare programme implementation office prepared a report on progress in the first six months of the strategy.  That progress report indicated that, of the 112 deliverables, 109 were on track or on track with minor issues.  That means that, even while dealing with the worst public health crisis in 100 years, more than 97% of the Sl&aacute;intecare projects have been progressing well.  The report identified three of the 112 projects, specifically the waiting list, ehealth and regional health areas projects, as facing a significant challenge.  Action on these has undoubtedly been severely hampered by the pandemic and the cyberattack, as was clearly stated in the report produced by the Sl&aacute;intecare office. <\/p><p> Tackling waiting lists is my number one priority.  They were terrible before Covid and have worsened substantially since.  People are living in pain.  The long waits that many of our citizens face to access care are causing immense distress.  I am setting up a task force that will tackle waiting lists and funding it appropriately.  It will follow the vaccine task force model that has worked so well and will learn from it.<\/p><p> Substantial work has been undertaken over the past several months in progressing regional health areas.  Research into international best practice has been completed.  Policy options have been drafted.  Consultation with stakeholders including patients, clinicians, policymakers, hospital groups and officials in community healthcare organisations, CHOs, has taken place.  More is planned in the coming weeks.  I am establishing an advisory group on this.  We must ensure we arrive at a structure that is owned and respected by those working in our health service. <\/p><p> Our public health system is not where we need it to be when it comes to ehealth.  Our healthcare workers are often working on old, antiquated systems, but significant progress was made during the pandemic.  A great deal of additional work is required in this area. <\/p><p> In recent weeks, there has been debate about governance structures for Sl&aacute;intecare.  We are making some changes.  A new programme board co-chaired by my Secretary General and the chief executive of the HSE, and comprising other members of our senior teams, will be established.  This new board will ensure that the drive for universal healthcare is fully embedded in both the Department of Health and the HSE.  The board will report to me and the Cabinet committee on health will meet to discuss progress as appropriate. <\/p><p> It has been stated as part of the recent debate on Sl&aacute;intecare that change is impossible.  Not only is change possible, but it is happening at an unprecedented rate.  It is being led by people working across the healthcare family, women and men who are rightly proud of their efforts.  Many healthcare workers have been galvanised by what our health service has achieved during Covid, with one of the most successful vaccine roll-outs anywhere in the world.  There will always be people who will only focus on the negative and what they believe cannot be done.  Eight months ago, we were lambasted by some for saying we wanted at least 70% of our adult population to have been offered a vaccine by the end of September.  Our health service proved them wrong.  We are ambitious.  Change and reform is always challenging, but we are up for that challenge.  Access to high quality healthcare when it is needed cannot and must not be a privilege for those who can afford it.  It must be available to every girl and boy, every woman and man.  That is what universal healthcare means.  That is what must be delivered.  That is our absolute focus. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021100600002#A00300","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633474800,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister very much for his presentation.

There is a view that Ms Laura Magahy and Professor Tom Keane, although less so in respect of Professor Geraldine McCarthy who resigned as head of the group in Cork, were forced to resign because they felt that what they wanted to deliver in respect of Sl&aacute;intecare was not going to be delivered, that there was resistance in the Minister's Department to their planned approach to what was agreed on an all-party basis with regard to Sl&aacute;intecare and that sufficient progress was not being made.

If we are asking whether there was resistance to change, the question we must ask is whether change was and is happening.  The report I have from the executive director states that not only is change happening but, in the case of more than 97% of the projects, they are either on track or on track with minor issues.  The next question we must ask is how substantial the progress has been on the three remaining issues, because those issues matter a great deal.  What I see on e-health is that Ireland is a laggard, but substantial innovation happened during the Covid period.  We now have telemedicine and e-prescribing, which we were told could not be done.  We have unique patient identifiers for the first time because of the vaccine programme.

Now there is talk of its being a day care facility.  If it is a day-only hospital, it will not be able to carry out serious operations, such as hip or knee procedures.  This means that large numbers of people will be excluded from availing of that facility, including anyone with underlying conditions such as diabetes.  It is going to be a very restricted facility.  We are now four or five years on from when this hospital was originally proposed and a site for it has not even been identified.

Context is everything.  I have always tried to be non-partisan on this and I will continue in that vein.  In a non-partisan way, there are two or three issues that strike me about this.  First, the Minister is just a year and a half in the job, so much of the narrative around Sl&aacute;intecare would have preceded his time in office.  Second, Mr. Watt is barely a wet week in the job and the consequences have landed on his table.  Third, as Mr. Watt said, we are hopefully emerging from a global pandemic.  That is the context.  To be honest, and I do not mean to be trite about it, part of me wondered about what all this excitement is about Sl&aacute;intecare right now, given what we have been going through and given what the health system has had to cope with and deal with, and what all the HSE staff and healthcare workers have had to do.  That is my objective overview of it.<\/p> <p>  When a Minister says he is putting the chief executive of the HSE, who, for a period, nationalised a load of private hospitals to deal with the pandemic and, so, has just garnered a load of experience in the provision of universal public healthcare in a particular context, and then the Minister also says that, with the Secretary General of his Department, these two individuals are going to take charge of the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare under his political direction, that is about a big a statement as it gets in regard to the commitment of a Government to a particular policy initiative that emerged from an all-party Oireachtas report.  I imagine that a Government, regardless of what political hue it is in the future, would do well to follow that.<\/p> <p>  I have one caveat.  The Minister is bringing everything back to the centre, and I see the necessity for that in the circumstances.  How does he propose to withstand the accusation that the regional structure is the way to go when he is bringing everything back to the centre?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021100600002#E00600","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1633474800,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for genuinely acknowledging that the changes we are making are exactly to that end.  I am appointing the head of the Department and the head of the HSE to this role.  They report to me and I will report in to the Cabinet, so this is being managed at the most senior level, with clear lines of direction and accountability on that.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the regional health organisations, essentially, what we are talking about is merging community and acute care.  That was the point.  A lot of work was then done on how that might be achieved and the six regions were arrived at after a long consultation period.  Some people agree with those regions and some people do not agree with those regions, and that is quite normal.<\/p> <p>  A reorganisation of our healthcare system is probably the highest risk element of our reform programme.  Tackling the waiting lists, adding capacity, changing the models of care, and increasing advanced nursed practitioners and GP access to diagnostics are important but they do not pose a systemic risk, even if they do not work as well as one might want them to.  A reorganisation of a system as complex and critical as our healthcare system is a high-risk endeavour.  That is why the Sl&aacute;intecare report itself said it should be done with minimal change.<\/p> <p>  If we are going to embark on what I believe is the highest risk part of Sl&aacute;intecare - it is one of the enablers but it is high risk - it must have the oversight and the leadership from the Government, me, the Department, Mr. Watt and the HSE and Paul Reid.  However, if it is going to work, the change has to be owned by the people in the system itself.  A mistake would be for a group in the centre to come up with a detailed design and then announce it and say, &ldquo;This is the new change and this is what is going to happen&rdquo;.  International evidence shows that is resisted by the people who we need to be part of that change.  Therefore, while the policy direction will be owned at the most senior level at the centre, if we are going to get this right and do it successfully, it has to involve people right around the system, in the CHOs, hospital groups, hospitals and throughout the system.  Essentially, there will be wide consultation and involvement in this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021100600002#E00700","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1633474800,"counter":163,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Watt wish to add to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021100600002#E00800","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633474800,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

There is an interesting debate about what functions should remain at a central, national level, with national standards, policies, procurement policies, IT, HR and all of that, and what then should be delivered at a local level.  I am pretty convinced, having read a lot of the research on this internationally and in Ireland, that we need to align CHOs and hospital groups.  We need to integrate them to have organisations at a regional level that can deliver the integration of care that we talk about.<\/p> <p>  The demographic challenge the country faces, because of the number of people aged over 85 and the number of people over 60, is the wider context for this debate.  There is a massive increase in the demand for our services and it is only going to go one direction, thankfully, as our citizens are living longer.  As we know, as they live longer, they will have more conditions and they will rely more on the health system.  We cannot meet current needs, let alone future needs, with this structure, and we need to have much more of the service provided at primary level and community level.  The change that is proposed in regard to the regional health areas, RHAs, is critical to deliver that.<\/p> <p>  The final element, which is very important, is in terms of the allocation of budgets.  We allocate budgets based on \"acute\", \"primary\" and so on.  We need to start allocating budgets over time on the basis of the population needs of people in particular geographics, so that we look at what are the needs of a population - not what are the needs of the acute system or the community system, but the needs of the population - and allocate on that basis.<\/p> <p>  They are the critical elements.  We need to make decisions over the next few months and the Minister will have to decide, with his Government colleagues, exactly what implementation plan to embrace in regard to the RHAs.  We are committed to doing it and the HSE is committed to doing it, and we will push ahead strongly over the period ahead to do it.  It is a fundamental reform.  I agree, having read once again the implementation report on Sl&aacute;intecare, that this is a fundamental aspect we have to deliver to achieve the overall objectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021100600002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1633474800,"counter":165,"content":"<p>The implementation board will be co-chaired by Mr. Watt and the chief executive of the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021100600002#E01000","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633474800,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I do not wish to discuss in detail.

I am fully committed to doing that.  It is not as it has been characterised, that is, reform being suffocated.  The Department of Health wants to deliver this because the Department knows &ndash; colleagues say it to me every day &ndash; that the current system is not delivering for our citizens.  It is not a case of people being hostile to or suffocating reform; quite the opposite.  With the HSE, people in the Department are the ones who are driving the change and reform.  We are dissatisfied with ehealth and we want to do more, and we are dissatisfied with waiting lists and the changes in that regard.  The people in the Department are as dissatisfied as the Minister or anyone else.  The characterisation is not fair.  Officials in the Department are fully focused and driven.  That is why public servants want to work in the Department of Health.  That is what motivates them.  They are not just motivated to stay in the Department.

Ms Magahy is a serious person, Professor Keane is a serious person, and I take their resignations seriously.  The Deputy will have seen substantial new proposals from me, the Department and the HSE on the governance of Sl&aacute;intecare.  I am appointing the Secretary General of the Department and the chief executive of the HSE to its implementation.  That is the level of senior leadership that we will have.  That board will report directly to me and I will report directly to the Cabinet.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy rightly said that damage had been done.  That is true.<\/p><p>There is a perception among some that change is not happening.  We heard a member of the committee say already today that the Department and the HSE are incapable of change.  All I would say is that we, as parliamentarians, need to be very clear as to the evidence.  Is there resistance to change?  In my experience, people do not resist change; they resist loss.  People from any walk of life or in any organisation, be it the HSE, the Oireachtas, Microsoft or whatever, will resist perceived loss.  That is why we have to get the reorganisation right.  If it is perceived as something whereby people lose out, they will resist that change.  It is human nature.  We all resist loss.  It is why it is so important that the reorganisation is done right.<\/p><p> Doing a reorganisation of a healthcare system is a bit like trying to upgrade a Boeing 747 mid-flight.  We do not get to shut down the operating theatres and tell the doctors and nurses to go home for two weeks.  We do not get to shut the maternity hospitals.  Everything has to keep running.  All the patients have to be seen.  No machine gets turned off and nobody gets to go home.  While they are still doing their jobs under immense pressure, we have to rewire the system in an important way.  That only works when the men and women who work in the system are brought into the change.<\/p><p> This is the point I was trying to make earlier.  When any of us make statements saying there is no change or progress, and that these people - whoever they are - are incapable of reform, it is incumbent on us as parliamentarians to look at the evidence.  The evidence we have is unambiguous.  The Sl&aacute;intecare office handed me a progress report stating that 97% of our projects were on track or on track with minor issues.  Think about that - not 60% or 70% but 97%.  I do not understand how an organisation can be 97% on track and at the same time incapable of reform.  I think we would all agree with this.<\/p><p> I spend much time out in the healthcare system talking to our front-line workers.  I believe I speak for us all when I say that what they have done over the last 18 months is magnificent.  It is extraordinary.  They are exhausted.  Many of them are traumatised but they have lived change every single day.  They are passionate about change and about the people they serve.  When I talk to people right across our system, be it in the Department of Health, the HSE or our front-line workers, I see people who are passionate about universal healthcare and who have probably implemented more change over the last 18 months than any organisation any of us can see.  Is it perfect?  No.  Does everything work perfectly the way we want it to work?  No.  Will we get pockets of resistance to certain ideas?  Absolutely we will, as we will get anyway.  Ultimately, this is a system that wants to and is capable of reform.  We in government are deadly serious about reforming it to ensure 100% universal healthcare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021100600002#H01800","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633474800,"counter":303,"content":"<p>Given the Minister's statement today, I do not disbelieve there is change.

There a plans for a full move to Merlin Park, a partial one, and so on.  That has muddied the water to a degree.  I would rather there was a focus simply on healthcare in Galway and what is best, rather than have this competition, if you like, between certain elements in Saolta.<\/p> <p>  The Minister and his officials will be aware there was no mention of the ED on the list of projects on pages 141-142 of the NDP, much to my surprise and that of many people in the Saolta University Health Care Group.  I am not sure if that was an oversight or whatever else.  I put on record that I do not believe that means the project will not go ahead, or at least I hope it does not mean that, I should say.  Maybe Mr. Watt, from his experience at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, will be able to say whether that Department will argue that because the ED is not listed on pages 141 -142 of the NDP it therefore is not a priority.  That would be a concern.  It is three years since the Minister's predecessor came to UHG and was promised by the Saolta University Health Care Group that planning permission for a new ED would be lodged by Christmas of that year.

Former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, said, I would say back in 2015, that they were not fit for purpose back.  The Taoiseach, when leader of the Opposition putting questions to him agreed, following a visit, that they were not fit for purpose.  Everybody agrees they are not fit for purpose but there is such a delay on delivery.  There is a delay even on lodging the planning application.  We do not even know how that will go.  I presume it will be positive because it is so needed.  God behold anyone who objects to something as vital as that for Galway.  This is so needed.  Nurses are absolutely frustrated.

I have raised it before.  I am hearing dates and I have heard dates before.  I heard dates of February 2019, May 2019, then it was delayed for the options appraisal, then it was going to September 2020, and here we are in October 2021 and there is now talk of 2022.  I have not been given a specific month, nor would I believe one at this stage because I have heard so many different dates.  I ask the Minister to come back to me on that with urgency.  There is frustration, as I said, from the front-line workers in relation to a project everybody, including at the most senior level of the Taoiseach and former Taoiseach, and the Minister and his predecessors, accepts is absolutely required.  Ms Laura Magahy appeared before the committee at our last meeting.  She talked about a more ambitious plan locally in Galway.  This comes back to the whole argument over what is needed.  The Minister has pointed to the fact that more inpatient beds are needed.  I would welcome an update, following tomorrow's Cabinet meeting, for Galway elected representatives on what exactly is planned with respect to inpatient facilities and where they are going to be located, if they do happen and whether they would be provided in Merlin Park, as the Saolta University Health Care Group desires, or in UHG.  I look forward to such an update.  As a final point on that, the Minister mentioned in his opening statement that 850 permanent beds have been provided to the hospital system this year.  Will he supply details on the location of all those?  Is there a small number of them in every hospital or a large number in certain facilities?  He might be able to provide that detail to us if he does not have it now.<\/p> <p>  Turning to Mr. Watt, he will know the expression \"poacher turned gamekeeper\", although perhaps in his case it is gamekeeper turned poacher, because he is now fighting for extra resources whereas in his previous role he may have been pushing back against Departments being given extra resources.  That might be an unfair categorisation but he can respond.  Is his primary role about securing additional funding for healthcare in this budget and all budgets, or is it about reform, saving us from waste, although that might be unfair, and improving efficiency within the healthcare system?  How does Mr. Watt see his role?  I ask because we have seen increases in budget every year.  There have been many successes and where there is capital expenditure and increases in staff, these are obviously visible and have an important role.  At the same time, given Mr. Watt's previous experience where does he see his role as Secretary General now?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021100600002#K00400","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1633474800,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

We will send that on to him and he will see the details on that.<\/p> <p>  My job is to run the Department of Health and to deliver for the Minister and deliver the reforms for the Department and for the system.  That is my job.  Making the Department work as effectively as possible will enable us to deliver on the reform agenda, on the various policy initiatives and the legislative programme for the Minister.  My job is to manage the Department to deliver on the Minister's and the Government's agenda.  An aspect of that involves fighting with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform - and they are very reasonable people in that Department - about money.  Despite the general sense, officials in that Department want to have a well-funded, efficient health system that meets the needs of citizens.  People in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are also humans, despite what some people would suggest.  They are part of this community as well and they rely on the public health system in the same way as anybody else.  There is always a bit of adversarial cut and thrust around budgets but, ultimately, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Micheal McGrath, and the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, have the same objective in mind, that is, to fund the health system to meet the needs of citizens of Ireland, so that is what we are about.

In my experience Ministers prefer to announce the budget themselves, which makes sense.  Next Tuesday, the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, will be announcing plans for 2022.  It is not agreed yet of course but I am hopeful there will be another significant investment in the health system.<\/p> <p>  On top of the initial resources we have spoken about, which are absolutely critical, we must reform the structures and the system to get more out of those resources, and everybody accepts that.  We must ensure more of our citizens are treated closer to home in the community by community teams and GP teams.  We need to keep people out of hospital and when people get into hospital we must get them out quickly.  More and more treatment must take place outside the acute system.  That is not only better for patients but it is also a more efficient way of providing that care.  A key part of our role is not only to argue for and get more resources but to drive efficiency and change across the system.<\/p> <p>  There are many issues here with the drugs budget, for example.  We are negotiating with the pharmaceutical companies in the context of the drugs budget as we need to get savings on drugs.  It is very expensive and going up all the time.  We cannot meet the need that is out there.  There is the use of existing facilities.  Can we get more out of the diagnostic machines we have?  Can we get more out of the operating theatres?  Can we look at changes in work practices to drive efficiencies?  Thus there is a whole agenda which we are committed to, as is the HSE.  We are committed to it because no matter how successful the Minister is at extracting money from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, those resources are finite and are never going to meet the needs we identified, so we must ensure we are maxing out all the time.  That is an ongoing challenge for us.  It is the challenge we face in the Department but it is a challenge every healthcare system in the developed world is now facing.  We have a demographic change which is absolutely profound and is going to have profound implications for our society.  It would be useful, Chairman, to talk about that at some future date when we can get into the detail of it.  Respectfully, it is a much more important issue than people resigning from councils or whatever.  How are we going to deal with the enormous changes that are going to be brought about by the fact that, thankfully, our citizens are living longer?  The number of people now over 85 years of age and indeed over 65 years of age will have a profound effect on the health system.<\/p><p>Those are the big challenges we face and that is what we are focusing on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021100600002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633474800,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, the Department and the HSE for all their work in the very difficult year and a half that we have all had.

I just want to go back a little bit to the cross-party Oireachtas committee on Sl&aacute;intecare.  One of the top priorities of that committee, and many of the witnesses who came in, was reform of the HSE and the devolution of power.  Do the Minister or Mr. Watt think that there may be a conflict of interest with the Department and the HSE stepping into that role?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021100600002#L00200","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speech","time":1633474800,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I understand the premise of the Senator's question and it is a very fair one.  We are tasking the centre with reducing its authority or its executive bandwidth, so whether that is a direct conflict is a very reasonable question.  Regardless of whether there is a conflict, when embarking on a programme of reform and organisational redesign of this scale the only people who can lead it are the senior leadership teams in the organisations.  They are the only people who can lead.  No one else can do that job other than the senior teams in those organisations themselves.  If you give it to somebody else it will fail because the organisations will not own it.  They will not have created it and they will resist it.  There is consistent evidence of that in large-scale change all over the world.  It has to be led at the most senior levels politically, which is me reporting to the Cabinet, as well as at an official level, which is Mr. Watt, and at an operational level, which is Mr. Reid.  That is the leadership team.  Mr. Reid and Mr. Watt are going to co-chair a very senior group of people who will report to me and then I am accountable to the Oireachtas, to this committee and to Cabinet.  The first thing needed for success is absolute commitment at the most senior level.  Given that, the Senator's question, which is how we ensure that happens, very much comes into play.  Part of what we have to do is tap into the fact that everyone involved is dedicating every minute of every day to universal healthcare.  Everybody has bought into that.  All of us have bought into that.  If people have bought into this, the argument has to make sense.  If it makes sense, and if people can see that this is better for patients, clinicians and workers, then it will happen.<\/p> <p>  The concept in management terms is subsidiarity, that is, pushing out decision-making as far from the centre as possible.  We have just seen an incredibly successful model of that with the vaccine programme.  Right at the centre we had a task force that reported to me, we had very senior leadership from the Department and the HSE and we had a very clear goal, which is critical for these programmes as well.  You have to be absolutely clear about where you are going and what it is you are trying to achieve and then the operational model is to push out the local solutions locally.  For example, I was in vaccine centres in universities, in GAA clubs, in hotels and in all sorts of facilities.  Every single person running those vaccine centres had to optimise locally but with all the support they needed from the centre.  Another area that gets less attention but which was even more random is testing and tracing.  I went to a testing and tracing centre in an old fire station.  We had testing and tracing on the site of a county GAA stadium and in all sorts of different places.  Again, that worked because our front-line workers were trusted to do the job that they know how to do and they got the support they needed from the centre.  That is essentially the philosophy.  I have bought into that, the Department has bought into it and the HSE has bought into it.  The Senator's question, which is really important and is one we are going to have to keep asking ourselves repeatedly, is whether we, the HSE or the Department are resisting this concept of subsidiarity.  We need to make sure we are not.  The way to deal with that is through a very clear goal and everyone passionately wanting to get there.  I am also establishing an advisory group specifically on this area so we will have a group of people who are outside of the direct implementation who will be able to feed back into the Department and to me as to whether they think we are getting that right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021100600002#L00300","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1633474800,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I have no doubt about the commitment and dedication of the Department and the HSE to everything they do, as well as the experience they have.

In terms of operational principles for regionalisation, it is exactly what we need to do.  I passionately believe that the only way we will get the level of performance and change we need, on behalf of patients, is to empower our front-line workers to do the job they know how to do.  I will give a very quick example of where it goes wrong and what we need to change.  I was talking to an emergency medicine consultant before I was in office who told me that they were trying to set up a triage room in their emergency department, which is an absolutely basic operational procedure for emergency medicine.  She told me that it took five years to get it in place.  At the time her colleagues told her she was wasting her time and that she would be exhausted by the end of it.  They got it after five years but she said to me it was the last time they were going to embark on that kind of local reform programme.  That is a case of the system being stuck and buried in red tape and failing on behalf of patients.  What we have to do is trust our front-line staff, our clinicians and our front-line management teams as well.  In fairness, there are many parts of the system that are already doing this.  We have to trust them to do the right thing in their local environment.<\/p> <p>  However, the flip side to that is that we need to know how it is going.  One of the big problems we have in the system right now is that we do not know.  We do not know, for example, how many procedures are being run per operating theatre in each hospital.  We do not know how many scans are being run per diagnostic suite.  We are not able to compare and contrast one hospital with another and say that it looks like hospital A is getting an awful lot more for the capacity it has than hospital B, for example.<\/p> <p>  There is wonderful change happening.  I will give an example just from last week.  I was in one of our model 4 hospitals and they brought me to the ophthalmology suite where they do cataracts.  They have basically applied engineering principles and lean process design to get the patients moving through quicker.  Believe it or not, they are going from an average of four and a half cataract procedures per session to 15.  No one in the centre, be it politically, in the Department or in Dr. Steevens' Hospital can solve those local problems and spot those local opportunities.  The only people who can do that are the people working in the community or in acute settings.  We have to make sure they are free to do it but at the same time we need to be able to hold them to account and make sure that reform, change and improvement are happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021100600002#L00500","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1633474800,"counter":323,"content":"<p>The Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry has concerns over the ehealth agenda and its progress under Sl&aacute;intecare.

It caused absolute chaos in the system.  The very people - and they are excellent - who were going to be pushing on the ehealth agenda ended up having to respond to the cyberattack.  Therefore, I think we are behind.<\/p> <p>  However, a digital transformation team within the HSE is examining innovation.  We must also recognise that, during the pandemic, important changes were made.  We were told that telemedicine could not be done; now it is being done right across the system.  It is being embraced within the system and by patients.  For years, we were told that technically, it was not possible to move to eprescribing.  I am told that it was done in approximately three weeks under the intense pressure of the pandemic.  Through the vaccine programme we now have unique patient identifiers, something we have never had before.  There are exciting pilots going on in terms of diagnostics and sensors being used in people's homes to monitor chronic diseases they may have.  They are being monitored in the community by public health nurses or specialists.

That is part of the issue.  We launched an ambitious winter plan last year.  There was only around a 12% reduction in attendances, but there was a 60% reduction in the number of those on trolleys.  The trolley numbers were the lowest since the records were first collected, I believe, in 2013.  Therefore, it worked well.  There were some things going in our favour, such as the absence of seasonal flu, but we had other things going against us such as the global pandemic.<\/p> <p>  The reason it worked was we implemented solutions for the whole patient flow.  First, we kept people out of the emergency department wherever possible.  Second, if they did need to come to emergency departments, they were streamed into minor injuries, medical assessment or surgical assessment units or what we would all understand as the normal emergency department.  Third, if they could be discharged quickly and supported at home, we did that; and, fourth, if they did need to be admitted, for example, to be stabilised for 24 hours, we ensured a home care package was available to get them out of the hospital and supported at home as quickly as possible.  This approach worked.  We are looking at a similar approach this year.<\/p> <p>  The good news is that last year's plan was a &euro;600 million winter plan and we locked the vast majority money into the base.

The sole focus of this Government, the Department of Health and the HSE in healthcare is universal healthcare.  That is it.  There are three elements to universal healthcare.  One is affordability, and we are moving on that.  We are also moving on access and clinical quality.  That is what defines universal healthcare.  If we were meeting now and half of the Sl&aacute;intecare projects were not being implemented, if beds were not being added to the system, if GP diagnostics was not being rolled out, if advanced nurse practitioners were not being ramped up and if real activity was not happening, I would absolutely say this committee should be pushing and saying that it needs a commitment that things are going to get better.  I am saying there is an absolute commitment.  As I said previously, I believe this is the single most important project for our country.  I am totally committed to it, and I am in charge politically of its implementation.  We have a 97% rate of implementation from the Sl&aacute;intecare office.

Whatever resistance there may be, it typically would not be aired in front a Minister.  Let us be clear about that.  Would there have been and is there resistance within the system to large-scale programmes of reform, including this?  Of course, there will be.  If we were engaged in large-scale reform in the Oireachtas, there would be resistance.  There also would be resistance in companies.  People resist loss or perceived loss.  When the ambition for reform is as big as ours is for the healthcare system, of course there will be people worried, scared or threatened by that and who do not agree with it.  I want to be clear.  I am not suggesting for a moment that every single person across the health system is lined up, shoulder to shoulder, reading through the committee report and saying, \"This is how I am going to do it\".  That is not how it works.  Of course, there will be resistance.  Do the Sl&aacute;intecare team and the director, Mr. Patterson, encounter resistance to change within the system?  I bet they do.  Of course, they do.  Anybody who is trying to drive large systemic change comes up against resistance.<\/p> <p>  We can take that as a given in any ambitious programme of reform.  The question that is most important for me is: is whatever resistance may be there slowing us down and is it making us fail on behalf of men, women and children in this country?.  To answer that question, I have to return to the Sl&aacute;intecare progress report I get.  It says 97% were on track or on track with minor issues.<\/p><p>That was in the report I got.  When I ask that question, of course there will be resistance.  However, is the change happening because ultimately that is all that matters?  The answer l have is the score of 97%.  If any of us, in any aspect of life, was handed a progress report with a 97% figure, we would be able to see a lot of change happening.  There are areas where more needs to be done.  We have talked about ehealth, for example.  We are laggards in ehealth and have to do more on that.  We have talked about regionalisation at length here.  My view is that it was paused for the right reasons, and we are now moving on that again.  The third project in the report was waiting lists.  We have an ambitious plan of work on waiting lists.  That is what is happening.<\/p><p> As I said to Deputy Durkan earlier, if I had come here today to account to the Oireachtas, with Mr. Watt, as the Accounting Officer, and the Oireachtas said to us that it had allocated us &euro;1.2 billion, but we had not added the beds, the people, or the diagnostics, we would be having a different conversation.  However, that is not the case.  As Deputy Cullinane pointed out, the money has not all been spent, and we all understand why that is.<\/p><p> I was handed a report from my project team giving a 97% score.  At the same time, the HSE has reported back to me about record numbers on beds, staff, diagnostics, and on all of these areas.  Therefore, while we can all say this bit or that bit has not been done, I think in the round, we have to accept the overwhelming evidence that not only is change happening and progress is being made, it is being made at measurable record levels.  That is my sense, although I do not want to give the impression that I have come in to say that there is no resistance anywhere.  Of course, there will be resistance, as there is always resistance to big, ambitious change.  However, it is not slowing us down.  I would argue that we are going faster than ever.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021100600002#P01100","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1633474800,"counter":422,"content":"<p>Is the Minister is saying today that the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Advisory Council, SIAC, has run its course?

We are talking about 900,000 people on a waiting list.  Part of the difficulty in dealing with that will be that Minister will have to buy in private elements.  Sl&aacute;intecare was supposed to be moving towards a one-tier rather than a two-tier system.  The difficulty is that most people who are looking for medical supports or to get into the system see that if they try to get an MRI, for instance, there is a long waiting list.  Their only other option, then, would be to go the private route for their MRI.  We are still at that level.<\/p> <p>  We will be bringing in BreastCheck shortly given the month that is in it and so on.  At one time, if a woman had her breast removed, she could have reconstructive surgery within six months.  Now there is a waiting list of two years.  The delays are occurring right across the health service.  A lot of that is down to Covid-19 and I accept all that.<\/p> <p>  The implementation committee said it had to resign because of resistance and so on.  People are not seeing the roll-out of services.<\/p> <p>  The Minister said that Ireland is a laggard in relation to the ehealth and that we have old and antiquated systems.  Is there any movement on the individual health identifiers, IHI?  I imagine that should be standard practice across the service, if we are talking about tackling lists.  It is all the more challenging if we have multiple people on them.  How many of the individual systems are still running on the operating system, OS, which is out of support and is vulnerable to cyberattack?  The Minister might come back to the committee another day in relation to that, as part of this report.<\/p> <p>  The biggest challenge we face are waiting lists which are getting longer.  The Minister started off this morning by saying that he is being ambitious, and he mentioned the increase in number of ICU beds.  Yet, a report from the HSE, going back to 2009, talked about a goal of 579 ICU beds.  There are currently only 321 beds.  We were talking about that years ago.  Covid-19 has shown the weaknesses in our system.  Clearly, one of those weaknesses is the number of ICU beds.  The additional numbers of beds are, of course, welcome.<\/p> <p>  While I will not speak on the behalf of other members of the committee, we are all concerned about why there have been so many resignations from the high-level advisory committee, because the members feel as though there is a resistance to change.  I do not get a sense from the questions that were posed to the Minister this morning, or from the answers that we received, that we are any nearer to finding out who those resistors are, what they are resisting, and what is the reason for the pushback.<\/p> <p>  I wish the Minister well with his new implementation committee.

We started the meeting by trying to get answers as to why these people resigned, because these are key people.  Second, we wanted to get answers as to whether we are on the right track in relation to healthcare reform.  Testy exchanges and differences opinion we might have in the committee aside, many people looking in at this committee, or even people who are not looking in because they are working in healthcare, or are one of the 900,000 people who are on a waiting list, might see the healthcare service as not working for them.  They feel that the healthcare service does not work for them and that their experience with it is not a good one.  If they get into the health system, it is a great experience, but it is getting in that is the problem.  They are concerned about what we are going to do, what our next steps will be, and what big changes we will see in healthcare.  That is the starting point for me.  Far too many people do not see the public health service working for them.  This is why the Oireachtas made a commitment to create a single-tier health service for universal healthcare.  One of the first things the Minister said in his opening remarks was that we are a long way away from universal healthcare, which we are.<\/p> <p>  My commitment is to work with everybody, including those Government and people in the system, to make universal healthcare happen.  However, when people resign from the programme that is designed to bring those changes on the scale that they have been resigning, and when these people are in senior positions, it calls into question in public's mind, at least, whether or not there is something more fundamentally wrong.

Yet what we are hearing from the Minister and from Mr. Watt, and I said this earlier, is that there is nothing to see here in respect of the fundamental concerns expressed by the people to whom I have referred.<\/p> <p>  I turn to one element of the reforms, universal GP care.  This will be relevant to Mr. Watt as well because I am sure that he oversees the responses to parliamentary questions.  I submitted a parliamentary question seeking information on the cost of this reform and how it will be done.  The response stated: \"Such a calculation would require a complex and detailed modelling exercise to account for a range of demographic changes, future projections of service demands and variation in the number of GPs and allowances that could be paid\".  It was also stated that \"It is not possible to give an estimate of the cost of extending GP care\".  I will put myself in the Minister's position and ask how anyone can reasonably provide answers here if that modelling has not been done.   How can the Minister give us any confidence that we are going to deliver universal GP care in the timeframe that was agreed?  How can the delivery of universal GP access be guaranteed if the Department has not done the modelling in respect of demographic changes, the increase in demand which might arise as a consequence and the additional number of GPs that will be needed?  How is that telling me that the Department and the HSE are serious about the provision of universal GP care?  I ask that question in the context of being the leading Opposition spokesperson on health and not even being able to get a cost and an estimated timeframe concerning how long it would take to do that because, as the answer to my parliamentary question stated, the requisite modelling has not been done.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021100600002#R01800","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1633474800,"counter":447,"content":"<p>All I can tell the Deputy is that I am going to proceed with increasing universal access to GP care.

That is the core of this issue for me.  We need a centralised referral system and an integrated waiting list management system.
