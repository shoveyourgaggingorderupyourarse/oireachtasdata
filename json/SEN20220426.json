My Commencement matter relates to the rural community development scheme in terms of supports for town and village renewal.  I note at the outset that it was a highly successful scheme, particularly around Covid-19 and post Covid, in terms of the challenges for rural communities and bringing them on.  Supports for the town and village renewal schemes were very welcome indeed.  The town and village renewal scheme was funded by the Department of Rural and Community Development as part of a package of the Government's national and local support measures to rejuvenate towns and villages.<\/p> <p>As I said at the outset, it has been a very successful scheme.  While I acknowledge the Government would like to give more money, it is not always possible.  In recent times, however, the scheme has placed great emphasis on projects that support and encourage remote working and enhance town living.  That is a really important part of all of that.<\/p> <p>When we look back at the funding over the past two years, I am quite impressed by the fact that it links into Ireland's policy document, Our Rural Future: Rural Development Policy 2021-2025, which is also critically important.  That is Government policy and I wish to acknowledge that it is really progressive Government policy.  It is about the sustainable development of our communities and supporting our community stakeholders in enhancing their rural and urban communities.  The maximum grants were increased to &euro;500,000 to allow for bigger projects, as well as early buy-in for those projects.<\/p> <p>This is the real key issue I will ask the Minister of State about today.  This scheme is advertised on the Department's website, which suggests that it will be open for submissions at the end of April - this is timely because we are now heading towards the end of April - and that the scheme will close June.  While that may have changed since, that is what was on the website in the last few minutes before I came into the Chamber.  It is timely that I should ask the Minister of State about the Government's intentions for the scheme and how we can engage and encourage people.  I do not think we need to encourage too many people.  We know many people in the communities want to avail of this scheme.  We know the importance of people needing the support to stay and work in their own communities.  We have seen the enormous benefit, particularly post Covid, for people who want to co-work or work part-time in their offices.  We have seen the benefits of community hubs and there need to be more of them.  People do not want to work in isolation; they want to work with some support and with some connectivity but they also want to be involved in meaningful childcare and community participation.<\/p> <p>This scheme, therefore, has many benefits but particularly in terms of urban rejuvenation and the structures within communities.  I would be very interested if the Minister of State could provide a rough outline of the vision and plan for the scheme going forward this year and of the timelines for the opening for applications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042600002#B00400","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1650979800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Boyhan for his remarks and for raising this issue.  I also congratulate Senator Clonan on his recent election to this House.  I wish him well.<\/p> <p>On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, I thank the Senator for raising the matter.  The town and village renewal scheme aims to assist with the rejuvenation of rural towns and villages throughout Ireland, making them more attractive places to live, work and visit.  It is one of a range of schemes implemented by the Minister for Rural and Community Development as part of her Department's rural development investment programme in line with the commitment contained in the Government's five-year rural development policy, Our Rural Future: Rural Development Policy 2021-2025.  The 2021 town and village renewal scheme was refocused with provision for the purchase of vacant properties.  Priority was given to projects that bring vacant and derelict buildings and sites back to use as multipurpose spaces or remote working hubs or for residential occupancy or both.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Niall Collins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2205\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2205&amp;amp;pid=NiallCollins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The Minister recently announced funding of almost &euro;18.5 million for 99 projects under the 2021 scheme.  This includes 28 remote working projects, the majority of which seek to bring vacant and derelict buildings and sites back into use.  For the 2021 scheme, the Minister also announced an additional measure, namely, the project development measure, which provides funding of up to &euro;50,000 to local authorities to assist them by contributing to a pipeline of significant, well-developed projects that might progress to construction stage, subject to the availability of further funding.  The Minister also increased the scale of projects eligible under the 2021 scheme, with funding of up to &euro;500,000 made available.  I am happy to confirm she has secured increased funding for a range of rural development schemes implemented by her Department in 2022, including an additional &euro;2 million for the town and village renewal scheme.  Officials are working to finalise the town and village renewal scheme for 2022.  While the details are still being finalised, there is no doubt that the scheme will again prioritise projects that bring vacant and derelict buildings back into use and promote residential occupancy in town centres.  The Minister will announce details of the 2022 scheme shortly, with a view to announcing successful applications by the end of the year.<\/p><p>In addition to these developments regarding the town and village renewal scheme, the town centre first policy framework was launched by the Minister and the Ministers of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputies Peter Burke and Noonan, earlier this year.  This policy is a major new cross-governmental strategy that aims to breathe new life into towns and villages and make them better places to live, work and raise a family.  It contains a range of targeted actions and is underpinned by a number of funding schemes such as the town and village renewal scheme to ensure it will help deliver on the Government's future vision for rural Ireland, as outlined in Our Rural Future.  I am confident the forthcoming opening of the 2022 town and village renewal scheme will continue its track record of delivering benefits in towns and villages throughout Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042600002#B00500","speaker":"1493","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1650979800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response, which was hunky-dory and nice, but I reiterate the departmental website today indicates this scheme is to be launched at the end of April, so he might ask the relevant Minister or officials to change that.

We are coming up to the seventh anniversary of the publication of the Cassells report, which outlined the crisis facing higher education funding at that time.  A number of options were presented in that report.  Three options were presented very clearly to the Government, namely, that there be a dramatic increase in public funding, that the fee model be retained, or that we look at the model of income-contingent loans.  It is fair to say the Government continued to kick the can down the road, referring the report to an Oireachtas committee and then to the European Commission for its observations.  Commitments were given that the European Commission report would be published by now but that has not happened.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, committed that 2021 would be the year higher education funding would finally be resolved.  Clearly, that has not happened.  This Government realises the potential of higher education.  That is why a new Department was created.  It must be acknowledged that some additional funding, on both the capital and current side, has been put into higher education.  However, these are sticking plaster solutions.  The system is in crisis.  Time and again we have heard from the universities and the new technological universities - the former institutes of technology - about the problems they are facing and the impact these things can have on the quality of teaching and research and, in particular, support services for students.  There has been a continuous and rapid expansion in higher education over the last number of years.  That is the right thing to do because this country's future will be based on talent and investing in talent.  We are short-changing the higher education system because we are failing to address the funding issue.<\/p> <p>I note with concern that the Minister has been talking about cutting student fees.  In an ideal world we would all like student fees to be cut, but my worry is that the commensurate amount of money that will be necessary as a result of the cut to student fees will not be made available to the higher education institutions.  Whenever any of the representative groups come before the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, I ask them where priority funding should be invested.  They talk about investment in core funding and the SUSI grant scheme, as well as radical reform of the SUSI grant scheme.<\/p> <p>We cannot wait any longer.  This can has been continually kicked down the road.   This country's reputation is now at stake.  In fact, Tony Donohoe of IBEC told the education committee that we have already gone beyond the tipping point.  I do not necessarily expect the report from the European Commission on the recommendations of the Cassells report to tell us much more than we already know.  We know higher education is in a state of crisis.  We know there has been an expectation on the institutions to continue to do more without the necessary additional resources.  Respectfully, I am worried the Government does not appreciate the full scale of the crisis.  I ask for clear dates for the publication of the European Commission's report and an answer with regard to the Government's strategy for the future funding of higher education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042600002#D00200","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1650979800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>We should thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  The 2016 expert group report, Investing in National Ambition: A Strategy for Funding Higher Education, confirmed that higher education made a significant positive contribution to the development of individuals, employers, society and the State.  It concluded that the approach to funding at the time was unsustainable and that substantial increases in investment in higher education needed to be made to ensure that the sector could remain viable and provide capacity to meet the major increase in student demand that was projected up to 2030.<\/p> <p>Since 2015, my Department has been working hard to deliver a significant programme of reinvestment in higher education.  In that period, current public expenditure allocated to the higher education sector has increased by more than &euro;500 million, or almost 40%.  In 2022, this allocation will be in excess of &euro;2 billion, including capital investment in the order of &euro;2.4 billion.  Funding and policy developments in recent budgets have taken significant steps to address the funding needs of the sector.  Most notably, and in line with a recommendation of the Cassells report, a new stream of employer funding was introduced upon review of the National Training Fund.  This level of investment responded to demographic pressures and underpinned a range of initiatives in the sector, including a substantial investment in the evolution of technological universities and significant skill-enhancing opportunities for individuals, sectors and regions.  My Department is also continuing to address the demographic pressures on the sector through the provision of additional places in further and higher education, and in budget 2022, we secured additional funding for sectoral pensions.  This significant allocation of public resources is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to meeting the funding needs of the higher education sector in order to realise more fully its potential to contribute to economy and societal priorities that are central to the country's long-term sustainability.<\/p> <p>Regarding the ongoing work on implementing the recommendation of the Cassells report, the development of a sustainable funding model for higher education is essential, in light of the credibility of higher education and of our progress as a country.  My Department's statement of strategy, published in March 2021, contained a commitment to putting in place a sustainable funding model for higher education.  In this context, I was encouraged by the completion of a comprehensive economic evaluation of the funding options presented in the report of the Expert Group on Future Funding of Higher Education, as supported under the European Commission's Directorate-General for Structural Reform Support, DG REFORM, programme.  The aim of this review was to investigate methods of increasing the sustainability of higher and further education provision, including an examination on the funding options.<\/p> <p>On 9 December, a Cabinet committee on economic recovery approved sending the Commission's review to the Cabinet and recommended that the Government note: the contents of the comprehensive independent economic evaluation of the funding options originally presented in the 2016 report and now detailed in a report on increasing the sustainability of higher and further education provision in Ireland, which was funded through the DG REFORM programme; the confirmation by the detailed analysis undertaken in the report of the existence of a significant shortfall in funding for higher education necessary for a high-performing, high-quality higher education system to underpin the achievement of Ireland's economic and social objectives and ambition; and the key recommendations contained in the evaluation report, including that a sustainable model of financing for the higher education system should be prioritised to support the future development of the higher education and further education and training systems in meeting the economy's human capital and skills needs.  There were a number of other points to note but since I am running out of time, I will skip them.<\/p> <p>I am pleased to inform the Senator that the Cabinet is today considering both the DG REFORM review and my Department's response to it.

This is an important issue and the fact that the Minister of State is here is evidence of that.  This matter arose on foot of the publication of a directive from the European Commission on mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence.  Most people across Europe would welcome that document but there is one aspect of it that is of concern, namely, the absence of a specific clause on the protection and empowerment of human rights defenders.  The reason that is surprising and alarming is because, on the basis of Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union, support for human rights defenders is an EU priority.  When a mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence directive is put forward and there is a priority for human rights defenders in an EU treaty, one would think that would be included in it.<\/p> <p>I met Mary Lawlor, the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders.  We had an interesting meeting and she had a number of concerns that she wanted to get across.  She believes that Ireland can play a key role in the following ways.  First, the Commission should include a specific obligation on companies to take steps to prevent retaliation against human rights defenders across the world because they are subject to serious acts of retaliation when raising concerns.  In 2020, there were just in excess of 600 attacks on human rights defenders in countries in South America, Africa and Asia and this happens with European companies.  Some of those acts of violence resulted in the killing of individuals who have spoken up.  All EU member states will be obliged to introduce some form of human rights and environmental due diligence for businesses as a result of this EU directive on corporate sustainable government.  The protection of human rights defenders is a key priority in the context of our foreign policy, and we can lead on a number of human rights defender initiatives at the UN.  Environmental and indigenous people's rights defenders face particular risks, often for raising human rights violations in the context of business practices.<\/p> <p>The recommendations contained in the implementation review of the first national action plan on business and human rights stated that Ireland should be a global leader in this policy area and that it should consider moving ahead of the EU in the context of legislation.  Could the Government commit to ensuring that human rights defenders will be named as stakeholders in our human rights and environmental due diligence legislation when we publish it?  Can they further ensure that companies will be required to publish zero-tolerance policies regarding attacks on human rights defenders?  We have a great record as a country in defending free speech, human rights and whistleblowers, and we can play a leading role from a European perspective in defending those rights across the world.  These situations have happened with big European companies, particularly in South America.  Unless we put this legislation in place, we will not fully protect those individuals.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042600002#J00400","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1650979800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I apologise to the House.

The proposal aims to address the adverse environmental and human rights impacts arising from the operations of companies and those of their subsidiaries and value chains.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Robert Troy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2305\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2305&amp;amp;pid=RobertTroy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Such companies will be required to conduct human rights and environmental due diligence to identify actual or potential adverse impacts and prevent, mitigate or minimise the extent of such impacts within their own operations, their subsidiaries and their value chains.  The effectiveness of the due diligence measures must be assessed at least annually.  Company directors will be required to take into account the consequences of their decisions in areas such as human rights, climate change and environmental impacts.<\/p><p>Companies will be required to establish procedures to handle complaints from those adversely affected by company operations and from other key stakeholders.  The proposal also provides for the designation of supervisory authorities at national level and a civil liability regime in terms of companies who fail to meet their obligations.<\/p><p>The proposal contains a definition for \"stakeholder\" which is broadly defined and encompasses a company&rsquo;s employees, the employees of its subsidiaries, and other individuals, groups, communities or entities whose rights or interests are, or could be, affected by the products, services and operations of the company, its subsidiaries or its business relationships.  I remain committed to ensuring that the interests and rights of all stakeholders are appropriately protected under the proposal and, should it be warranted, consider whether it is necessary for specific stakeholders to be defined under the directive.<\/p><p>I want to reassure the Senator that the proposal is at a very early stage and is ongoing across EU member states.  My Department is engaging at EU working party level to clarify the practical implications of what has been proposed.  Given the complexity of the issues being addressed, negotiations at EU level may well continue through the remainder of this year and, in fact, go into 2023.  Decisions on how the proposal will be legislated for in an Irish context will be taken once the directive has been finalised.<\/p><p>Recognising the importance of this directive, my Department has begun a process of engagement with key stakeholders and intends conducting a public consultation on the proposal in the next number of months to help inform the Government's position.  Ultimately, in informing the Government's position, it can ensure that we have our ethical values and, indeed, as mentioned by the Senator, our strong track record on human rights enshrined in this directive when it is published later this year or early next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042600002#J00500","speaker":"1596","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1650979800,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his detailed response.

Mr. Noel Murphy is going to take on the responsibilities as superintendent.  He is well-known to us all and very well liked.

He was a native of Tipperary and a Nenagh boy at heart.  He excelled as a student, winning prodigious scholarships before qualifying as a barrister.  He joined Fianna F&aacute;il in 1957 and won a seat in Seanad &Eacute;ireann in 1965.  During his term, he was chosen as a member of the Committee on the Constitution, a special all-party review group on the Constitution.  Following his first term in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, Michael won a seat in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 1969 where he would go on to represent his beloved Tipperary for more than 30 years.  He held six different ministerial posts and was hailed for his work in diverse areas, including foreign affairs and economic planning.  Michael campaigned for Ireland's membership of the European Union and held a strong belief in a confident and outward-looking Ireland that embraced the ideas of European co-operation.  He served as a European Commissioner in the early 1980s.  Michael has left an extraordinary legacy, spanning almost 40 years of political service.  At this sad time, our thoughts are with his family and on behalf of the House, I convey my sincere sympathies to his wife, Breda, and his children, Brian, Orla and Mary.

The Senator knows we are the most welcoming county in the country.<\/p> <p>I also welcome the recent announcement of the Brexit adjustment local authority fund, where we had approval for seven projects throughout the county, including Ballina Quay, Rosmoney Pier and Killala Harbour to name but a few.  We are a large coastal county so money like this is very important.  We are trying at present to update our marine strategy and our marine policy, and encourage local fishing communities to survive and thrive in what is a very important part of our local economy.  I wish those projects well.<\/p> <p>I would like to raise an issue which, I suggest, we might put on the agenda at some point for discussion in the Chamber, namely, the ongoing cost of childcare and access to childcare places.  My little boy started in cr&egrave;che yesterday.  Thankfully, we were very lucky to get a place in a brilliant local facility.  I feel fortunate to have that place for him but many families are struggling to get childcare places and when they do, not so much in rural areas but particularly in our cities and other urban areas, the cost is astronomical.  A show on RT&Eacute; last night highlighted how much this cost is crippling families and, in particular, how it is making it more difficult for women to return to the workplace.  That is half our population and if we do not allow women to return to work when and if they want to, we are doing our country a disservice.<\/p> <p>The cost of childcare is something we should debate more openly in this House.  We have a new programme or policy in place with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, whereby there will be core funding specifically for childcare facilities.  The Minister has yet to publish guidelines as to how this money will be allocated so I would welcome a debate with him.  It is my view that we should ultimately move to a public system of childcare, publicly funded and publicly run, to complement the private sector that is there.  Currently, all we have are private facilities.  As a country, we need to acknowledge that we have the third most expensive childcare in Europe with no sign whatsoever of those costs reducing.  It is an important issue for a significant cohort of the population.<\/p> <p>I will draw attention and invite all Members to the women's health policy conference I am hosting in Smock Alley Theatre.  It is taking place this Thursday, kicking off at 9.50 a.m. and running until 2.30 p.m.  We will cover issues such as menopause, menstrual health, fertility - including IVF and surrogacy - mental health and eating disorders, in addition to a look to the future of healthcare in Ireland.  Everybody is most welcome to attend.  It is a very good and positive event because it will be a full day dedicated to addressing the deficiencies in women's healthcare as well as a positive outlook on what we can do to fill those gaps in service and provision of care to women in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042600002#P00500","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1650979800,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I draw the Leader's attention to the fact that today is the 36th anniversary of the explosion at Chernobyl.  It was the darkest day in the history of humanity because of its everlasting consequences.  In 2016, Ms Adi Roche was invited to speak before the UN General Assembly on the fact that we need a day of remembrance, that Chernobyl is something which can never be consigned to history and that it is very important we remember the ongoing suffering from generation to generation.  I had the honour of chairing the press conference held by Adi Roche this morning to mark the 36th anniversary.  Ms Raisa Miknovitch Carolan spoke during it.  She is a now a fine young woman with a master's degree in criminology, but she spoke of her experience in an orphanage with the disabilities that flowed from being a child living with the consequences of Chernobyl.  She spoke very nobly about how she has overcome that.  She was one of the Chernobyl children who visited Ireland and was eventually adopted by her Irish family.  She gave strong testimony of her current support of children with disabilities in Ukraine, of their experiences in Ukraine and of supporting them in coming to Ireland.  As the Leader knows, I have been involved with organisations in Ireland in supporting them to bring children with disabilities here.<\/p> <p>This morning, Adi Roche spoke with the passion with which she inspires me about up-to-date reports from the Chernobyl exclusion zone and the additional harm done there by the Russian takeover of the plant.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They have now left but while there, they set fires, dug up areas and exposed the area again to radiation.  Five coachloads of Russian soldiers were taken away very ill as a consequence of radiation poisoning.  The people in the community are again being harmed.  This morning's press conference highlighted the ongoing threat from the Russians around Chernobyl who are weaponising it against the global community.  There are also 15 other nuclear facilities in Ukraine and the potential threat of them to be used as a weapon of war.  The call this morning was for the UN to come out and state that these are no-war zones and that they cannot possibly become a threat and be weaponised in the manner implicit in some of the statements from the Russian leadership.  I wanted to put this on the record here and to recognise that we will never forget the people of Chernobyl and the generations that continue to be impacted by it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042600002#P00600","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1650979800,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I find myself wanting to agree with most of what Senator Chambers just said.  We need a debate here on childcare.  There is not a family, particularly in cities, which is not finding it extremely difficult.  I compliment her on the conference on women's health.  Maybe some of my younger male colleagues might do something similar for men.  I am a bit over the hill myself.  The bit about Mayo I can just about stomach but we will get over that.<\/p> <p>We are coming to a time when the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, will have to deal with public service pay.  My former colleagues in the Defence Forces in PDFORRA and the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, have both balloted their members and both want to be allowed to affiliate with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It is imperative that the Minister for Defence engages with both organisations immediately.  Let us put this thing to bed for once and for all.  It has been going on for far too long.  <\/p> <p>There are a couple of issues that need to be addressed urgently in respect of refugees arriving from Ukraine.  The initial support for refugees coming from Ukraine is beginning to find cracks coming into the system.  While the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is doing a tremendous job and all the other Cabinet members are rolling in behind that to get the job done, there is resentment building up in respect of two areas on which I am being contacted.  One concerns those coming from other countries where there is war such as Afghanistan, Yemen and Syria, who are not being treated in the same way.  It has been suggested to me that there is a form of racism now finding its way into our system.  This is something of which we must be very careful.  The other is the young people in Ireland who cannot get into housing.  They are now beginning to ask why this can happen for those people but not for themselves?  We need much more explanation and people need to be made aware of what exactly is going on.  Sympathy wanes very quickly in this world.  We all know that.  I have been on the border there and my colleague, Senator Dooley, has been there.  By God, if you have been out there the sympathy would not wane but that is not the point.  <\/p> <p>Today, I also heard that we are bringing military barracks back into service.  I do not know how many of them we have left.  I think we flogged off most of them and the ones that we did not flog off we let go to rack and ruin.  Mullingar is a prime example of a place that is available and should be used.  I do not know what the situation is in Castlebar barracks.  I do not know if it is gone but it was in poor repair anyway.  I believe the barracks in Longford belonged to Longford County Council.  We need to explain to people and we need to prepare any barracks we have around the country.  Sadly, there is a lesson we can never forget, which is that we need to rethink the selling off of assets that we may need in the future.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042600002#Q00200","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1650979800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Green Party-Comhaontas Glas, I note we would like to associate ourselves closely with the thoughtful remarks of condolence to the family and friends of the late Michael O'Kennedy, SC.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Vincent P.

He was such a reserved gentleman and a committed European.<\/p><p>I remember once we had a VIP visitor in Col&aacute;iste na Rinne i gcontae Phort L&aacute;irge.  I assume the best china was put out for Michael O'Kennedy, whose son was in the Gaeltacht.  He was so accessible to young children.  It was at a time when we only had a few channels on television and it was a real red-letter day to have of senior politician visit the college.<\/p><p>I would also like to make a suggestion, if it is appropriate, although maybe it is for another day.  We can table a separate motion.  Another former Member of the Seanad has passed from this mortal coil and that is the late Jimmy Leonard.  Although he had short service in the Seanad, he was a former county councillor and Deputy.  The late Jimmy Leonard was a man of deep principle and conviction, and I know that is probably a phrase that has become so well-worn that it loses its effect.  We do not see as many conviction politicians as perhaps we did in yesteryear.<\/p><p>I think history will be very kind to him on his stance in leadership battles within his party, which were democratic and fair, and on the Anglo-Irish Agreement, when there was resistance from within his party when it was in opposition.  I would like to sympathise with that family.  Indeed, his daughter, Ann Leonard, went on to become a Member of this House.  His stay in this House was short-lived.  Members may recall it was at the time of the election of two people who supported the hunger strikes.  I refer to the tragic loss of Kieran Doherty in Cavan-Monaghan and Paddy Agnew, which may have cost Charles Haughey a term in government.  Jimmy Leonard was resilient, however.  He got back up on the horse and won the next time.  From my recollection, Fine Gael had the privilege to appoint the Ceann Comhairle, which reduced that constituency from five to four seats.  This would make it much more difficult for Fianna F&aacute;il to hold on but it won three out of four.  That was due in no small measure to Jimmy Leonard, although he could not withstand pressure from the republican movement when a hunger striker was elected.  He became unstuck on that occasion.  He was resilient and an utter gentleman to his fingertips, like Michael O'Kennedy, SC.  I would like to convey our sympathies to the families of both of those wonderful people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042600002#Q00300","speaker":"1667","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1650979800,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I join with my colleague, Senator Craughwell, in the call for the Minister for Defence to come before us once again and to allow both PDFORRA and the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, to affiliate with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.

Enterprise has not been located in the Athy municipal district to provide much-needed employment, so the municipal district's removal is worrying, to say the least.  We have seen progress on the new road in Athy and a number of other tourism-related projects, making Athy an attractive place to move to and raise a family.  What we need now is enterprise to provide employment.  The Athy municipal district, including the towns of Athy and Castledermot and the wonderful villages of Nurney, Ballitore, Calverstown, Narraghmore and Kilberry, needs an additional stimulus to attract enterprise and employment, and its removal from the regional aid maps needs to be explained by the Minister, who might come before the House.  I have written to him today seeking an explanation as to why the Athy municipal district has been removed from the regional aid maps.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042600002#R00200","speaker":"1684","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1650979800,"counter":52,"content":"<p>While many homeowners and electricity consumers will receive the &euro;200 discount as compensation towards the spiralling cost of energy over the coming days, a number of others, unfortunately, will not.

I appreciate it.  The Irish citizen has no say in the governance of the WHO and so any handing over of power and responsibility to this body by our own directly-elected representatives must be thoroughly scrutinised.  The treaty is built on the premise that while the technical expertise on how to govern and end a pandemic exists, the political will to do so is missing.  Once again an incorrect assertion is being made that the science is settled and that it must be enforced absolutely.

One such area of concern is that of finance, because an increase in compulsory funding of the WHO by member states would naturally follow in order to allow for the administration of the scheme.  Financing resources could be used to encourage compliance with a pandemic treaty.  An unknown amount of taxpayers' money could be funnelled into a pooled insurance mechanism, only for Ireland to be cut off from access to such funds if it does not follow the WHO's plan to the letter, making future governments of Ireland and future generations of Irish people further beholden to unelected bureaucrats.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sharon Keogan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Any such sacrifice of sovereignty must be in accordance with the wishes of the people.

It set out the challenges that the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte, was facing in trying to meet nine disability service managers around the country, with the HSE refusing to facilitate the meetings.  There should be no reason for the HSE not to want to engage fully with the Minister of State to ensure she is aware of the serious challenges facing many families of people with disabilities.  She came to Crumlin last week and listened for hours to parents and grandparents about the pain and hardship with which their families were struggling.  They are not getting therapies or services.  We listened to some parents of children now in their 30s and 40s who have never received any intervention from the HSE.  Other parents looked on, thinking that that would be them in 30 years' time.  Their children might be two years of age now and need occupational therapy and speech and language therapy, but they might be in the exact same position as those other parents in 30 years' time, with their children having no services.  Some of the parents said that they were 70, their child was 35 and they were his best friends.  He had no friends and never received services.  They were still waiting for occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and physiotherapy.<\/p><p>That is what the Minister of State listened to.  She understands the families' plight, but for some reason, the HSE is working against her.  The refusal by the HSE to attend the meetings with the Minister of State is another blow to families.  They cannot understand why the HSE is not attending the meetings when the Minister of State is.  This comes at the same time as the High Court has struck down the assessment of needs, AON, process over its incompatibility with the Disability Act.  Now, the HSE has to deal with 10,000 AONs properly.  This is just taking away more therapy hours from children.  I want to know why the HSE is not working with the Minister of State.  Please, something needs to be done to help these families.  The Minister of State is doing her best but she seems to be up against it.<\/p><p>The comments on childcare by Fianna F&aacute;il's leader in the Seanad were important.  As all of us have stated, this House needs to be pushing for public childcare because it is not working in the private system.  In this context, we must not forget children with disabilities.  There are no proper early intervention programmes for preschool children with disabilities.  This matter needs to be pushed with the same gravity as we are pushing for childcare for children who do not have disabilities.<\/p><p>We are seeking an update on the summer provision programme.

These increased acts of violence against LGBTQIA people have not happened in a vacuum.  Homophobia, transphobia and biphobia are scourges.  Some things the Government can do now to improve LGBTQIA people's lives are to ban conversion therapy, fund trans healthcare, establish legal recognition for non-binary people, support LGBTQIA NGOs and initiate inclusive sex education in schools.

Higher education institutions are sending out their schedules for the 2022-23 academic year at the moment.  It is noticeable to see a plan to return to the ableist attendance policies over ensuring full accessibility.  Nobody is claiming that recorded lecturers are replacing the quality of in-person teaching.  Rather, recorded lectures and other such things are a tool in the education institutions' arsenal for improving accessibility.  Recording attendance at lectures for all lectures is just a lazy way of ticking boxes for key performance indicators, KPIs, and is not a metric that accounts for any quality in learning.  By returning to fully in-person learning with no options for access outside of just literally showing up, institutions are ignoring the voices of disabled students, students with long-term or chronic illnesses, parents, carers, students for whom English is not their first language and neurodivergent students in order to maintain the <i>status quo<\/i>, which is silly because we know we can do better.

It is a totally new entity that we do and do not know much about.  I would like to hear what the Government has to say using the best knowledge, the best science and best data that is available to the top health professionals in this country on what type of a strategy it should implement and what our views around long Covid are.  It is difficult to define it and I am not asking for that.  However, I would like to know what we are putting in place to deal with cases of long Covid.  I know we can all come in here and give anecdotal evidence and different bits and pieces, but I would love to know the actual data in the HSE and our hospital systems in terms of long Covid, as well as what plans and what we are trying to put in place as a Government and as a country to deal with long Covid as it continues on.

I use the term \"refugee crisis\" rather than \"migrants\".  There is a very clear difference between a refugee and a migrant.  That is clearly understood by many in terms of international best practice and the work of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and other organisations that work in this area.<\/p> <p>We had a briefing today at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage by the Minister&rsquo;s officials who set out very clearly his desire to do something.  I think everyone across these Houses is fully committed to it.  The Minister's officials emphasised the importance that any response regarding the refugee crisis was over and above the expectations in terms of Rebuilding Ireland, which is important.  It is also important that we state that many people coming from Ukraine will wish to stay here, which is great.  Not all, but many of them will want to stay in our communities.  Therefore, it is important that we start integration and communications policies.  We need to address their critical and acute needs.  These people have suffered terrible trauma.  We recognise their desire to continue to learn their native language.  We should put in place the supports around their education, psychological welfare and health welfare.  There are many facets to this very difficult and complex issue.  <\/p> <p>I fully welcome the idea that they are coming here.  I support the Taoiseach and the Government in their unequivocal support for bringing people here.  As the Taoiseach said, their home is our home.  I actually believe that, and there are great opportunities.  In any crisis, and I do not like using the word in this particular situation, but there are always opportunities.  There are new people, new ideas, new ways of doing business, different cultures and different traditions.  Let us welcome them.  <\/p> <p>However, we need to put in place policies.  I caution one thing.  Let us be very careful about how we protect young people and families that are vulnerable.  We should have learned that many years ago.  This will happen if we do not carefully monitor and support them and recognise that vulnerable people get taken advantage of.  We, as policymakers, must put in place the necessary policies to protect these vulnerable people.

The club organised an event in conjunction with the Louth-Meath branch of Down Syndrome Ireland.  We had a \"come try\" athletics day and children from all around the country attended the club in the Cooley Peninsula.  They used our track to try out athletics and many volunteers were involved.  The children in our club attended.  One member of our club with Down's syndrome, Mr. David O'Hare, has represented Ireland on an international level.  We are proud of him.  We wanted to open up our club to everybody and to become more inclusive.  The children involved tried the long jump, sprints and javelin.  It was a powerful and empowering day.  My children got a lot out of it.  They told me that the other children were very supportive of one another while still being competitive.  I highlight that as an initiative other athletics clubs can copy.  The event benefited everybody in our community.<\/p><p>I request that the Leader arranges for the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to attend the House, engage in a debate and talk about how we are going to make all our sports mainstream and inclusive.

Since that decision was made a number of years ago, nothing has happened.  I understand the building is now in the ownership of the Department of Education but nothing has happened to progress the siting of the school at that location to the enormous frustration of the people involved in the school community and the people who live in the area and are looking at this de facto derelict building.  I gather the roof is full of pigeons.  It is not doing the building any good as time goes on.  It is enormously frustrating when these decisions are made, flagged and progressed up to a point but no further action appears to take place.  The council cannot help with the issue because it no longer owns the building and the Department seems either unwilling or unable to act and progress the project.  This is repeated in many other places.  We should be examining these issues in the Chamber and making sure that when such commitments are made, there is a way in which we can ensure action is taken and communities are not left standing around and waiting for what they know is going to happen to actually happen.

There is a drop-in centre at Gorey Youth Needs Group where people come to provide information.  Active groups have sprung up around the county, including in Riverchapel and Kilmuckridge, where Councillor Mary Farrell is actively involved.  Support groups have also sprung up in Rosslare and in communities around the country.  While others have spoken about this issue, we must acknowledge all the voluntary groups who are opening their doors and hearts to try to provide support.  Many of the Ukrainian families arriving here have questions they need answered and it is important that we put structures in place to do that.  One of those questions is around Ukrainian teachers and whether their teaching qualifications will be recognised.

It offers people the opportunity to work with animals.  We saw many of the prisoners there go on a course over a number of months and they come out with qualifications and have the opportunity to work in these roles once they leave Castlerea.

I want to acknowledge Senator Dolan's mention of the official launch by the Minister for Justice of Horses for Hope in Roscommon last week.  It is part of a wider initiative and conversation we need to have in how we rehabilitate people who are unfortunate enough to find themselves in prison, which Senator Ruane often talks about here.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As part of a wider conversation, we need to discuss how we rehabilitate people who are unfortunate enough to find themselves in prison because there is somewhat of a view that they should nearly be put into a black hole and left there as punishment.  The whole purpose of the judicial system is to rehabilitate people and make them function in order that they can return to society and behave in a manner that is fruitful for themselves.<\/p><p>A lovely man called Mr. Paddy Richardson runs an organisation called the Irish Association for Social Inclusion Opportunities, IASIO.  To my mind, the organisation does not get a fraction of the money that it should get from both the Department of Justice and the Department of Social Protection.  IASIO takes people who have come out of prison and make sure that they do not repeat the cycles of the past because, unfortunately, 70% of the people who leave prison find themselves back inside within 12 months.  Therefore, we should do anything that we can to prevent that situation.  The Horses for Hope programme is a shining example of thinking outside of the box and what we should do to help ex-prisoners.   <\/p><p>In response to Senator Ahearn, although I am not in a position to support the appeal application, I will find out from the Minister when it is expected that the appeal will be adjudicated upon in order that the people who are waiting to get their hands on the &euro;6 million, as the other 1,000-plus clubs did, will have a timeline.  <\/p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne talked about the visit yesterday by the Ukrainian ambassador to Ireland to Gorey, as did Senator Dolan.  We are absolutely steeped in Ireland that we have such a large heart for people who are in crisis and need our help.  The Irish Red Cross has managed to raise &euro;30 million due to the generosity of Irish people.  That is pure cash and does not include all of the reception centres and the giving that people have done locally, which we are all well aware of and been to see them.  Long may that generosity continue because this particular refugee crisis, as Senator Boyhan mentioned, will not be over in a short time and I think that it will be with us for much longer.<\/p><p>There are some idiosyncrasies in the system that people now appreciate.  Last week, the Minister was kind enough to sort out the driving licence issue.  However, in terms of access to community employment schemes and access to social welfare while working, the reason we have speedily taken in refugees and have treated them as though they equate to European citizens is because we relied on the legislation that was enabled in every single European Union member state.  Those conditions are the same for every Irish person as they are for every European person who comes here.  To make special conditions would require every European state to do the same thing.  It is certainly not something that is beyond us, particularly if our new Irish citizens, albeit that they hope to only be here temporarily, can work if they so wish.  I will convey messages to the Minister today and I reassure Senator Boyhan that I will organise a debate in the next couple of weeks.<\/p><p>Senators Hoey and Malcolm Byrne referred to the week of the tragic murders of Aidan Moffitt and Michael Snee, as well as the assaults on Evan Somers and another young gentleman, whose name is not in the public domain, from Sligo.  I thought that there would have been a much bigger outcry than there was.  I came into town on the Friday evening to attend the vigil outside those premises and it was one of the most moving, poignant and sad events that I have ever attended.  The choir that evening sang so beautifully and the event was striking.  I remembered that people on that day asked why our reaction was not the same as when young Ashling Murphy was horribly murdered in January.  I believe it is because every single person in Ireland could either relate to her or knew that she could be your sister, daughter, mother or friend.  I do not think that people feel or think the same way about the LGBT community as we did about Ashling, which I think is wrong.  Every single one of us could have a brother, sister, friend or relative in exactly the same way but I do not think that we think about it in the same way.  I believe that we think about the LGBT community as being something separate and distinctly different as opposed to being part of all of us and it is part of all of us.  On the night of the last vigil, I was minded that everybody should be an LGBT ally and be proud to say it and talk about it all of the time, as opposed to just when we see tragedies, disenfranchisement or discrimination.  I now realise that something as shocking as happened that week happens week in and week out, but we just do not get told about it and the victims of random discrimination, right up to horrific violence, just suck it up and accept that it is part of what their life is like and that is not acceptable by any one of us or any member of society.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We need to start a national campaign of being LGBT allies to make sure that everybody recognises that they are all of us and we are all of them and that we are one community.

I am not sure what to say to him other than maybe we will organise a meeting for his committee with the forward planning team to try to find out its status.  The frustration that he described exists in every county.  They do not have the reputation of being as progressive as we would like them to be.  I can certainly organise a meeting and try to get people sitting around the same table so at least they can get an update.<\/p><p>Senator McGreehan spoke with such passion.  She must really have had a good day, as did everybody else who joined Glenmore Athletic Club that day.  She made a valid point that we need to have more inclusivity in sport and I will try to arrange a debate with the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.<\/p><p>Senator Boyhan asked for a debate on Ukrainian refugees on an ongoing basis.  We have one with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and I will try to tackle all aspects of what is required for the integration of the people who will be with us for weeks and months, or maybe as the Senator suggested, we might be lucky enough that some of them might stay.  A welcome development this week was the establishment of a Cabinet subcommittee to make sure that we have co-ordination across all of our services to look after new people and new residents.<\/p><p>Senator McGahon is looking for a debate on long Covid and our strategy and plans.  I can certainly organise that.<\/p><p>Senator Casey talked about the idiosyncrasies with community employment.  As he probably knows, people on community employment schemes cannot go from the live register immediately to community employment because we want to try to get them back to work before we put them into retraining.  We will raise it with the Minister and I will come back to the Senator about it.<\/p><p>Senator Maria Byrne talked about utilising our regional airports.  In recent weeks, we have all witnessed the horrific stories of people having to wait for hours in Dublin Airport.  I was in and out of Dublin Airport on Monday and Friday in the week before last.  It did a super job, so it is a case of horses for courses.  We certainly should use our regional airports, and not only Shannon, but also Cork and the other regional airports.<\/p><p>Senator Ardagh spoke about the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, as did another Senator.  Bravo to Deputy Rabbitte.  She is getting close to the rub of the issue, which is why she is being pushed back against.  Senator Ardagh knows her much better than I do but if I know anything about her, it is that she will not be stopped.  A democratically elected Minister of State is being held back by an arrogant cabal of people who do nothing but breach the rights of children and adults who have disabilities and need access to services.  What they would be far more mindful in doing would be having a quarterly audit of all the provisions of speech, language, physiotherapy, psychology and occupational therapy services in order that we could see the massive deficits in respect of all the people who do not get what they are supposed to be getting.  That is one thing that we do not have at the moment.  While we have anecdotal and emotive evidence when we have meetings or large-scale organised events to get parents around the table to support one another, we do not have a list of the people who are waiting or how long they are waiting for.  It is not good enough.  Bravo to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  We should make sure she continues to get our support to push back.  Being barred from meeting people who are at the coalface is just beyond belief.<\/p><p>Senator Keogan shared her opinions on the World Health Organization convention on dealing with future pandemics.  I contend that there is much more debate to be had before the final details are ratified.  The Senator is right that we should have input into it and that it should not be decided for us by other people.<\/p><p>Senator Buttimer sought a debate on LGBTQ rights and I will certainly look at that.  He also referred to the debate that we need with the Minister, Deputy Harris, on developing our technological universities.  I will organise that as soon as I can.<\/p><p>Senator Dooley raised the single meter point reference number, where there would be multiple family homes or dwellings in a single block.  I will raise that with the Minister.<\/p><p>Senators Wall and Craughwell raised the public service pay agreements and the wish of PDFORRA and RACO to affiliate with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions before any negotiations start.<\/p><p>Senator Seery Kearney talked about how we would require a day of remembrance on the 36th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster.<\/p><p>Senator Chambers opened proceedings by asking for a debate on the cost of childcare, which I will certainly organise.  She welcomed the Brexit adjustment funds that were announced this week for our marine, ports and harbour development.  She talked about the annual Mayo Day, which is next week and which I am sure Senators will all support, both online and in person.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Regina Doherty:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=26\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Most importantly, I pay tribute to the Senator for the amount of work she and her team have put into the women's health conference she has organised for next Thursday.

This would require amending the Bill in 529 instances so, for today's purposes, we have included a simple amendment to section 2 definitions.<\/p><p>The role of the proposed Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n in the governance and regulation of media cannot be underestimated in terms of its importance for the future of the Irish language.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes this ought to be reflected in the Bill through a reinforced Gaelic identity for the body.  While it is welcome that the State body is given an Irish language name in legislation as &quot;Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n&quot;, it is subsequently referred to exclusively throughout the Bill as the Commission, whose members are only to be known as commissioners.  In popular discourse and debate, the agency is already being referred to as the media commission before it is even established.  We know from an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s um Ard-Oideachas, which refers to itself almost exclusively in all branding as the Higher Education Authority and the HEA, despite having only an Irish name in law, that State agencies will revert to self-anglicising if provided with any opportunity to do so and this further detaches the organisation from its responsibilities to the Irish language.<\/p><p>The recently passed Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 sets out in section 9D that the names of new State agencies should be in Irish only and branding should put Irish to the fore.  It is, therefore, perplexing and disappointing that perhaps the first new State agency created by the same Department that gave us the official languages Act chooses to emphasise English language titles and descriptions since its enactment.  Consistency would require the coimisi&uacute;n to be called just that throughout and that its membership would referred to as coimisin&eacute;ir&iacute;.  By reinforcing the Gaelic identify of the body in this way, not only are we adhering to the commitments of a State whose first official language is Irish, and increasing the visibility and helping to normalise Irish in public life, both of which are positives in and of themselves, we are also reinforcing the fact that at its core this commission will ultimately be responsible for monitoring, adherence and implementing language conditions on broadcasters and service providers, in addition to answering complaints and demands from the Irish-speaking community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042600002#DD00500","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1650979800,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for tabling the amendments.  In respect of amendment No. 1, section 9D(1) of the Official Languages Act 2003 as amended provides that the name of a statutory body established on and from the commencement of section 4 of the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 shall be in the Irish language.  In advance of the commencement in section 4 of the 2021 Act, I decided that what was previously to be known as the media commission should be known as Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n.  This is given effect in section 6(1) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 as amended by section 7 of this Bill and reflects Government policy regarding the title of new statutory bodies.  That section of the Act also provides that throughout the Act coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n is referred to as \"the Commission\".

That is obviously not ideal but I understand the pressure the Seanad Office was under to be able to come back to us with those groupings.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister's officials for meeting us last week to discuss a number of these amendments.  We have an issue with the Bill being taken before the Digital Services Act, DSA, even if we know there is compatibility between the two but also the fact the expert group has not come back on the complaints mechanism.  As such, there are many reasons we should have stalled this Bill but all we can do at this stage is try to amend it.<\/p><p>The amendment proposes to add in a definition of &quot;political &quot;purposes within the legislation.  Under section 9, the principal Act is bring amended.  Section 46M(2)(a) provides that a broadcaster or relevant media service shall not broadcast an advertisement that &quot;is directed towards a political end ...&quot;.  First, I am curious about the term &quot;political end&quot;.  I am not sure I have seen it in legislation before, nor is its meaning defined in the definitions section.  I ask that the Minister speak to that specifically.  What constitutes a &quot;political end&quot; is unclear as no definition is provided.  The term is very vague and risks preventing a broadcaster or digital service provider from sharing information through advertisements in the public interest.  If we think about issues like climate change, sexual consent and LGBT matters, there are loads of different things that could be construed as a &quot;political end&quot; yet there is no definition of what that is.  While existing legislation curtails political advertising, the provision in this Bill could be misinterpreted to such an extent that important political issues such as the ones I have outlined are conflated with the content of political advertisements.  This amendment provides a definition of &quot;political purposes&quot; and complements a separate, later amendment, namely No. 101, that seeks to replace the term &quot;political end&quot; with &quot;political purposes&quot;.<\/p><p>The Bill provides that a broadcaster or relevant media service shall not broadcast an advertisement which: &quot;is directed towards a political end ...&quot;.  What constitutes a &quot;political end&quot; is unclear as no definition is provided, as I said.  It is vague and risks preventing a broadcaster or digital service provider from sharing information through advertisements.  This amendment is closely related to the first amendment and seeks to clarify what is meant by &quot;political end&quot; and insert a useful definition of what &quot;political purposes&quot; are so we are clear about what that means in the context of advertising and broadcasting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022042600002#EE00500","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speech","time":1650979800,"counter":122,"content":"<p>We have tabled amendment No. 100 on a related issue.
