Ninety of these communities were coastal communities.<\/p>  <p>  The OPW has undertaken detailed analysis of the 300 communities including the preparation of flood maps and plans to determine their vulnerability to the potential impacts of climate change. The OPW&rsquo;s appraisal of flood risk and the choice of future measures took into account the assessment of risk for two potential future scenarios, the: Mid-Range Future Scenario - increase in rainfall of twenty percent and sea level rise of 500mm (20 inches); and, High-End Future Scenario - increase in rainfall of thirty percent and sea level rise of 1,000mm (40 inches). <\/p>  <p>  These maps and assessments provide valuable information for the OPW, local authorities and other sectors in planning for adaptation against increasing flood risks due to climate change.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister of State for Flood Relief, I secured &euro;1bn for a ten year programme of investment in flood relief schemes\u00a0that will protect ninety five percent of properties at assessed risk of flooding. <\/p>  <p>  The detailed design of the flood relief schemes set out in the Flood Risk Management Plans, published in 2018, will include the comprehensive analysis and assessment of adaptation strategies to ensure that the schemes will protect against, or can be adapted to, potential future increases in flood flows and\/or flood levels due to climate change.<\/p>  <p>  The OPW will shortly be publishing, for public consultation, a revised Climate Change Sectoral Adaptation Plan for Flood Risk Management. This is being prepared in line with the requirements of the National Adaptation Framework published in January 2018. <\/p>  <p>  Adaptation planning is a cyclical process, with the National Adaptation Framework and the sectoral plans prepared under it being reviewed at least once every five years in line with the Climate Act. This will ensure that we adopt a dynamic approach to adaptation planning which is informed by the latest scientific evidence thus enabling Government Departments, Agencies and Local Authorities to modify or escalate adaptation actions, as appropriate.

The transitional military council has said it will govern Sudan for a two-year transitional period after which it promises presidential elections. Sudan's constitution has been suspended, its parliament has been dissolved, and a three-month state of emergency has been declared.<\/p>  <p>  Despite al-Bashir's removal, the Sudanese Professionals' Association, which is one of the main organisers of the protests, has called for a continued sit-in outside the Defence Ministry. This is to demand a return\u00a0to constitutional and civilian\u00a0government. In an attempt to placate the protestors, the initial appointment of the\u00a0Minister of Defence as head of the transitional military council was swiftly withdrawn , to be replaced by another senior military figure. Negotiations between protestors and the military are continuing and the situation on the ground remains\u00a0dynamic. <\/p>  <p>  The recent political changes follow five months of demonstrations, triggered initially by spiralling costs of living. These protests took on renewed emphasis earlier this month, coinciding\u00a0with the 34th anniversary of a bloodless coup against a former president, Jaafar Nimeiri. <\/p>  <p>  In attempts over the past months to suppress and disperse protests, Sudanese security forces have used tear gas, stun grenades and live bullets. The use of\u00a0violence against demonstrators has been widely condemned. <\/p>  <p>  On 11 April,\u00a0EU High\u00a0Representative Mogherini issued a statement complementing a statement by the\u00a0Chairperson of the African Union Commission which highlighted that a military council does not provide the answers and breached the principles of the African Union Charter. High\u00a0Representative Mogherini said that only a credible and inclusive political process can meet\u00a0the aspirations of the Sudanese people and lead to the political and economic\u00a0reforms Sudan needs. That can\u00a0only be achieved through a swift handover to a civilian transitional government. In that process, she called on all concerned to exercise calm and utmost restraint. I fully\u00a0endorse the High Representative's statement. <\/p>  <p>  On 15 April, the Peace and Security Council of the African Union\u00a0issued a communiqu&eacute; strongly condemning and rejecting the seizure of power by the Sudanese military and calling on\u00a0the military to transfer power to a civilian led political authority\u00a0within 15 days or face suspension from the Union.<\/p>  <p>  Events continue to evolve and my officials are monitoring developments, through the Embassy of Ireland in Nairobi, which\u00a0has responsibility for Sudan, and through our membership of the European Union, including through cooperation with the European Union delegation in Khartoum. Senior officials from my Department also met with the Sudanese Ambassador to Ireland earlier this year to discuss the situation in Sudan. <\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department visited Sudan earlier this month on a UN organised visit, a key element of Ireland's chairing of the donor group supporting the Office of the\u00a0UN Humanitarian Coordinator.\u00a0 During this visit, my officials took the opportunity to raise concerns about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the country and the need for timely delivery of principled humanitarian assistance and protection.

Of course, the UK retains the right to revoke its Article 50 notification at any time. <\/p>  <p>  The European Council made clear again that the Withdrawal Agreement, including the backstop, cannot be re-negotiated, and that any unilateral commitments by the UK Government should be compatible with the letter and the spirit of the Withdrawal Agreement. We welcome these important assertions.<\/p>  <p>  The European Council also made clear that this time cannot be used to begin negotiations on the future relationship, which will begin once the withdrawal has taken place. Hoevever, importantly, should the position of the UK evolve, then the EU would be prepared to reconsider the Political Declaration on the future relationship. <\/p>  <p>  Throughout the duration of the extension, the UK will remain a full member of the EU. We welcome the UK&rsquo;s commitment to act in a responsible and constructive way during the extension. This commitment is important as we must safeguard the effective functioning of the EU. The EU27 can therefore discuss matters related to long term decisions without the UK.<\/p>  <p>  Responsibility for avoiding a no deal Brexit now firmly lies with the UK . We hope that the ongoing process between the UK Government and the main opposition, the Labour Party, will lead to a positive outcome and an orderly withdrawal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041800053#WRB07100","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":120,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041800053#WRB07200"},{"type":"question","counter":121,"qnumday":54,"qnumall":"[18293\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041800053#WRB07300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on the rights of LGBTQ+ persons in Kenya; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1434","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":122,"content":"<p>Kenyan law criminalises\u00a0 male homosexual relations.\u00a0 However, some interpretations suggest that it also prohibits female same sex relations.\u00a0 Consequently both men and women in same sex relationships in Kenya fear the possibility of legal persecution. <\/p>  <p>  A petition seeking to decriminalise same sex relations is currently before the High Court of Kenya, arguing that two sections of the relevant legislation contravene the articles of the 2010 Kenyan Constitution guaranteeing equality, dignity and privacy for all citizens.

Irish REITs are collective investment vehicles which invest in Irish property. As such, their income and gains from Irish property are not taxed within the REIT but are instead taxed in the hands of the investor when distributed. REITs must distribute at least 85% of their property profits and gains to their shareholders each year. A REIT is subject to corporation tax on any income or gains arising from any other, i.e. non-property, business it carries on.<\/p><p>The function of the REIT framework is not to provide an overall tax exemption, but rather to facilitate collective investment in rental property by providing the same after-tax returns to investors as direct investment in rental property and removing a double layer of taxation at corporate and shareholder level which would otherwise apply. <\/p><p>Dividend Withholding Tax (DWT) at 20% must be applied to all distributions from REITs, other than distributions to certain limited classes of investors such as pensions and charities as they are more generally exempt from tax. I am advised by Revenue that the available information is the net DWT collected in respect of dividends paid by REITs for 2015 onwards, as shown in the table. <table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Amount   of DWT Collected<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>&euro;4.0m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>&euro;7.8m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>&euro;11.8m<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2018<\/td><td>&euro;12.4m<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that, due to the obligation to maintain taxpayer confidentiality, it does not disclose information in circumstances where the number of cases is so small that it might facilitate identification of the taxpayers involved.

A key responsibility of each Minister and Department is delivering public services efficiently and effectively within their budgetary allocations. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is in regular contact with all other Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed in line with not only Departmental allocations but also within the overall fiscal parameters. Each month, the drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is reported on against published expenditure profiles in the Fiscal Monitor, published by the Department of Finance. <\/p>  <p>  As set out in the most recent Fiscal Monitor, published by the Department of Finance, total gross voted expenditure at end-March 2019 was &euro;15,039 million. This is &euro;343 million, or 2.2% below profile. Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;14,167 million, is &euro;245 million, or 1.7% below profile. Of the 17 Ministerial Vote groups, 14 are below profile on current expenditure for end-March. Gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;872 million, is &euro;98 million, or 10.1% below profile.  <\/p>  <p>  Given the scale of Government expenditure, &euro;66.6 billion in aggregate for gross voted expenditure in the Revised Estimates Volume (REV) 2019,  and the cash basis of Government accounting, the need for Supplementary Estimates can arise for a number of reasons, including policy decisions, timing issues, and overspends. At this early stage of the year, the key requirement for all Departments is to have credible plans to manage within the allocations voted by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann last week.<\/p>  <p>  To assist in this process, a range of reforms have been put in place over the last number of years with the aim of focusing attention on achieving value for money. For example, the Performance Budgeting initiative seeks to shift focus away from simply looking at the quantum of spend towards examining what is being delivered through public expenditure. As part of this initiative, the third Public Service Performance Report will be published in the coming weeks and will provide outturn performance information for 2018 as well as trend data for the previous two years. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is also currently in year three of the Spending Review process. The Spending Review aims to place evidence at the centre of policy development, through the examination of existing policies and programmes to assess their efficiency and effectiveness. This systematic examination of existing expenditure can support the re-allocation of funding to meet expenditure priorities.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041800057#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Expenditure Data","counter":242,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041800057#WRF00800"},{"type":"question","counter":243,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[18268\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041800057#WRF00900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number and location of overspends in various Departments which has been brought to his attention in the past two years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":244,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[18272\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041800057#WRF01000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the extent to which Departments or their subordinate bodies have disregarded public expenditure requirements over the past three years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":245,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 and 99 together.<\/p><p>Due to the scale of Government expenditure and the cash basis of Government accounting, the need for Supplementary Estimates can arise for a number of reasons, including policy decisions, timing issues and overspends.

significant challenge for businesses in Ireland, which cannot be underestimated. That&rsquo;s why my Department started developing supports for businesses from the time when Brexit first became a possibility. Government&rsquo;s priority is to ensure that businesses around the country can manage risks and avail of any opportunities. This has informed the range of advisory and financial supports that are in place. <\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s total exchequer allocation increased by 9.1% year on year, up from &euro;871m to &euro;950.2m. This is made up of a record &euro;620m in capital and &euro;330.2m in current funding, which includes an increase of &euro;65m in capital &ndash; up 11.7% on last year&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;555m; and, an increase of &euro;14.2m in current &ndash; almost 4.5% more than our 2018 allocation of &euro;316m.<\/p><p>I allocated an extra &euro;5m to the 31 Local Enterprise Offices [LEOs], up 22% on 2018, which have a presence in every county, to support start-ups and growth and, in particular, to support businesses to prepare for Brexit. The LEOs will work with the broad range of small and micro indigenous enterprises across sectors to ensure that they are informed and have plans in place to manage the new trading relationships on the island and with the UK more generally. This includes a new customs training programme for all businesses, exporters and importers, rolled out in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland.<\/p><p>I was also pleased to announce an additional capital allocation of\u00a0&euro;2.75m to Enterprise Ireland to start developing regional innovation and technology clusters with Institutes of Technology right across the country, positioning them as drivers of world-class start-ups and growth enterprises and helping businesses adjust to market changes, including Brexit.<\/p><p>Through Enterprise Ireland, I also doubled funding for the Online Retail Pilot Scheme to &euro;1.25m in 2019, which will support SMEs in the retail sector to have a stronger online presence and find new markets. This new Scheme follows through on my commitment to increase the scale and internationalisation of indigenous enterprise; increase productivity in high-employment sectors; and encourage Brexit readiness. I announced the first 11 successful applicants on Friday 01 March last and there will be a further call for proposals this year. In addition, Enterprise Ireland invested &euro;74 million in Brexit impacted businesses in 2018. <\/p><p>Funding to InterTradeIreland has been increased by 18% and they, along with the LEOs, are offering a range of Brexit-focused supports to companies, including those engaged in cross-border trade with Northern Ireland. <\/p><p>The Brexit Loan Scheme, using a combination of Irish Exchequer and EU guarantees, leveraged up to &euro;300 million of lending at a maximum interest rate 4% at a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;23 million - &euro;14 million provided by my Department and &euro;9 million provided by Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p><p>The Future Growth Loan Scheme was announced in Budget 2019. The scheme\u00a0opened for eligibility applications on Wednesday 17 April\u00a0and it will provide a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates. This scheme is jointly funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (&euro;37.2 million) and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (&euro;24.8 million) at a total cost to the Exchequer of &euro;62 million.<\/p><p>The first\u00a0table attached sets out the respective exchequer increases in allocations to ITI, EI, IDA and the LEOs between 2018 and 2019 and the cost\/expenditure of the supports available. Whilst these increases are not all due to Brexit, they are\u00a0mainly provided to assist the enterprise agencies in their responses to the challenges posed by Brexit.<\/p><p>The second table attached sets out the uptake of\u00a0the different Brexit-related supports available through the\u00a0Department and its agencies as at 08 April 2019. <\/p><p>Finally, while we have had great success through the Action Plan for Jobs in reducing unemployment from 16% to 5.6% today, in the context of Brexit and other global challenges, it is important that we move our focus beyond numbers of jobs created to quality and sustainable jobs. <\/p><p>Future Jobs Ireland is our plan to meet all these challenges. Launched on 10 March 2019, it includes ambitious targets and actions to drive this transformation of our economy. These includes funds, policies and initiatives that; enhance productivity, especially among SMEs; promote indigenous entrepreneurship, especially in the regions; encourage clustering and stronger links between domestic and foreign owned firms; and assist businesses to move up the value chain, to protect jobs and to build resilience for the future.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Scheme<\/th><th>Uptake (8 April 2019)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Brexit Loan Scheme<\/td><td>567 applications received, 511 approved by SBCI, 105 Loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;23.691 million.<br \/><br \/>(Uptake as of 8 April 2019)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit Scorecard - online platform for Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit <\/td><td>5,113 Brexit Scorecards have been completed. 992 LEO clients have completed the scorecard.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Be Prepared Grant<\/td><td>182 Be Prepared Grants have been approved<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Market Discovery Fund - A support to EI clients to research new  markets<\/td><td>140 projects have been approved under this initiative<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Prepare to Export Scorecard<\/td><td>2,988 Prepare to Export Scorecards have been completed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Customs Insights Online Course<\/td><td>1,178 Customs Insights Course participants<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Agile Innovation Fund - Gives rapid fast-track access to innovation funding<\/td><td>47 Agile Innovation projects have been approved<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit Advisory Clinics<\/td><td>16 Brexit Advisory Clinics have been run with over 1,200 in attendance<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Brexit &ldquo;Act On Programme&rdquo; &ndash; A support funding the engagement of a consultant to devise report with recommendations to help clients address weaknesses and improve resilience<\/td><td>210 &ldquo;Act on&rdquo; Plans have been completed<br \/><br \/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Enterprise Ireland Strategic Consultancy Grant &ndash; A grant to assist EI clients to hire a strategic consultant for a set period<\/td><td>1,062 Strategic Consultancy Grants have been approved<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office Technical Assistance Grant   for Micro Export - an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities<\/td><td>518 clients were approved assistance under the Technical Assistance Grant (end March 2019)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office LEAN for Micro - The LEO Lean4Micro offer was developed in collaboration between the EI Lean department and the LEOs to tailor the EI Lean offer for LEO micro enterprise clients<\/td><td>247 LEO clients have participated in the programme (end March 2019) <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office Mentoring<\/td><td>562 mentoring participants solely focused on Brexit (end March 2019) <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Local Enterprise Office Brexit Seminars\/Events <\/td><td>4,213 Participants at the Brexit Information events (end March 2019) <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>InterTradeIreland Brexit Advisory Service<\/td><td>2,419 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service in 2019.This is in addition to the 4,175 engagements in 2018.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>InterTradeIreland Brexit Start to Plan Vouchers<\/td><td>There have been 1,401 applications, with 1,214 approved and 31 still pending assessment. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Pilot Online Retail Scheme administered by Enterprise Ireland<\/td><td>11 retailers were awarded funding in February 2019.

Indeed it must be emphasised that every sector of our society has a role in reducing the burden of obesity and the OPAP clearly acknowledges this.<\/p><p>The OPAP policy prescribed 'Ten Steps Forward' that would be taken to prevent overweight and obesity. A new Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group was established in October 2017 and a progress report on each recommendation in the OPAP is currently being finalised under the aegis of the Oversight Group. <\/p><p>The HSE is responsible for the implementation of  a number of actions in the OPAP, including actions relating to the prevention and management of overweight and obesity in both children and adults.<\/p><p>Funding for actions led by the HSE is dealt with as part of the annual estimates and service planning process.<\/p><p>The recommendation referred to by the Deputy calling for obesity impact assessments for new planning developments that impact on children and their families is aligned by the Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group with Step 2 of the Obesity Policy Action Plan 'Regulate for a healthier environment'. One of the Actions under this Step is to &quot;Develop guidelines and support material for those working in developing the built environment for urban development and planning in relation to reducing the obesogenic environment&quot;. The OPAP recognised that changing the obesogenic environment is a critical factor underpinning the success of maintaining the population at a healthy weight. The prevention approach aims to gradually change Ireland's food environment to one that facilitates consumption of healthier food and drinks and fosters active lifestyles. The OPAP acknowledged that food and retail outlets are more widely available now than ever before and that this becomes important as children have discretionary income and may not follow the healthy eating guidelines. It therefore declared that it is important that the health input into the local area planning process is consistent and evidence based. <\/p><p>This area is being progressed through engagement with other Government Departments to support the work of stakeholders involved in planning and developing the built environment.<\/p><p>In line with Actions 31 of the National Physical Activity Plan and 2.1 of the OPAP, which commit to developing guidelines and support materials for those working in developing the built environment in order to promote the importance of physical activity and reduce the obesogenic environment, a Stakeholder Forum was held on 21 November last. <\/p><p>The event was planned in partnership, with substantial input from three Government Departments, (Health; Transport, Tourism and Sport; and Housing, Planning and Local Government). Following on from this Forum, a working group made up of representatives of all three departments was convened to consider the outputs of the stakeholder forum and related recommendations, including the ones aligned with the recommendation referred to by the Deputy.<\/p><p>Finally, the question of legislation around planning matters for the issue is ultimately a matter for my colleague the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and I understand that he has addressed the position on this in his reply to Parliamentary Question 34831\/17.

something found in other countries - is very tightly drawn and its criteria for when a consent declaration can be given is directed not only at GDPR considerations but also at the Common Law, Constitution and ECHR.\u00a0 That was done to ensure that all relevant factors must be addressed both in the application for a consent declaration and in the consideration of that declaration.\u00a0 It is the same reasoning that means that a declaration when granted can only ever extend to obtaining and using personal data required for the research or part of the research but such data cannot then be disclosed to anyone else without the consent of the data subject or a legal obligation to do so.\u00a0 It is also important to emphasise that a consent declaration cannot be given where a data subject has refused his or her consent to the use of his or her personal information for the research involved. <\/p>  <p>  Everything that is provided for in the Health Research Regulations was subject to a series of discussions with the Data Protection Commission.\u00a0 The rigorous nature of that consultation process provided a very useful stress test.\u00a0 In particular, the Department and the Commission had careful regard to the issue of genetic data against the backdrop both of scientific developments in the genomics area and the GDPR requirement that genetic data, as a special category of sensitive personal data, is subject to strong safeguards. <\/p>  <p>  Health research is indisputably important to better patient care and the development of innovative and life-saving therapies.\u00a0 As Minister, I want to support health research and I believe most people do.\u00a0 I believe that the best way to do so is to promote and sustain greater public confidence in research through enhanced openness, transparency and patient empowerment so that no individual is surprised by who has access to his or her personal data and the research uses to which it is put.\u00a0 Without that confidence, the necessary support for health research that has the potential to bring considerable benefits, especially in evolving areas like genetics and genomics, will not be forthcoming.\u00a0 For that reason, it is in the interests of all those involved in health research to work with us in building that confidence.<\/p>  <p>  One final point, the Minister for Health does not have the power to\u00a0give anyone permission to collect DNA from Irish hospitals, GP practices or health centres.\u00a0 Those samples, where collected, must be collected on the basis of informed consent and that informed consent determines who has access to the samples\u00a0and what the samples and any related personal data can be used for.\u00a0 Responsibility for proper governance in relation to those samples and the associated genetic data lies firmly with the institutions that collect and hold them.\u00a0 Failure to adhere to proper governance may have significant consequences under law for the institutions and any employees or agents involved. \u00a0There will also be serious reputational damage affecting health research in Ireland generally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041800061#WRK03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":421,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041800061#WRK03900"},{"type":"question","counter":422,"qnumday":158,"qnumall":"[18082\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041800061#WRK04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of an operation for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":423,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

Healthy Ireland is based on evidence and experience from around the world which clearly shows that to create positive changes in health and well-being takes the involvement of the whole of Government and all of society working in unison.  There are a number of Health Promotion policies and programmes that fall under the scope of the Healthy Ireland Framework that are being implemented in the Health Services and across several Government Departments, Agencies and settings.  A central aim of Healthy Ireland is to &lsquo;create an environment where every individual and sector of society can play their part in achieving a healthy Ireland&rdquo;.  It is therefore extremely difficult to classify and specifically quantify the funding that is being earmarked for each programme and to give an indication if an evaluation has taken place for each over the previous five years.<\/p>  <p>  However, I can give the Deputy information relating to Funds expended by the Department of Health on health promotion programmes.  In July 2016, the Government approved the creation of a Healthy Ireland Fund and subsequently provided an initial allocation of &euro;5 million in Budget 2017 to kick-start the establishment of the Fund.  The Fund has distributed &euro;10mil from my Department in 2017 and 2018 to all Local Community Development Committees, Children and Young Persons Services Committees and several national statutory organisations for the promotion of health and well-being activity.  A further &euro;5mil will be distributed in 2019.  The aim of the Healthy Ireland Fund is to stimulate and support innovative, cross-sectoral, evidence-based projects, programmes and initiatives that support the implementation of the key national policies in areas such as Obesity, Smoking, Alcohol, Physical Activity, Healthy Eating and Sexual Health at a local level.   In 2017, the results of the first year of the Healthy Ireland Fund have been very encouraging, especially in relation to the targeting of socially disadvantaged communities.  Of the 382 actions delivered under strand 1, 2,456 organisations were reported to be involved in the implementation of local priority actions and an estimated 770,000 people were reported to have benefitted.

On the one hand, the EU has created the appropriate legal framework in a no-deal Brexit situation\u00a0to allow UK vessels reciprocal access to EU waters throughout 2019, if the UK grants such access to EU vessels in its waters. On the other hand, the EU has also adjusted the eligibility criteria of the Fisheries and Maritime Fund, to ensure that fishermen who have to cease their activities &ndash; in case the UK does not grant continued access to its waters &ndash; can receive compensation. In such a case, it would be essential that Member States adopt a coordinated approach to ensure a level-playing field between EU fishermen in different Member States and to protect marine resources. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The Communication sets down the preparations in the EU, agreed with the eight Member States directly impacted, in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\u00a0 It identifies the need for mitigation measures and in particular compensation for temporary tie up of fishing vessels.\u00a0 It gives the EU Commission a strong co-ordination role.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0This communication reflects the high level of planning by Ireland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden working closely with DG Mare.\u00a0 When I met Commissioner Vella last February, I emphasised the real risks of a concentration of fishing into\u00a0 Ireland&rsquo;s 200 miles fishing zone by EU fleets if they\u00a0 are excluded from UK waters. I pointed out that inevitably this would lead to displacement of our own fleet and depletion of fish stocks if no action is taken.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0I stressed to the Commissioner the need for a European approach to addressing this issue and agreed with him that the key Member States and DG Mare needed to put in place a contingency plan.\u00a0 I have been working intensively over recent weeks, and have kept the fishing industry informed of the work to ensure that we are ready for this worst case situation, while always hoping that we will never need to call upon these plans.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0We now have identified and agreed, co-ordinated and fully prepared measures that will be immediately available to address\u00a0a no-deal Brexit situation, if the UK were to decide to deny EU vessels access to UK waters.\u00a0 I am seeking additional EU funds to support this mitigation measure if they become necessary. If we need to call on these arrangements, it will be essential, as we have now agreed at EU level, that all involved EU\u00a0fleets must co-operate under these structured arrangements to manage the situation. These arrangements facilitate a European response to the situation with the objective that the\u00a0Irish\u00a0 fleet\u00a0would not be disproportionately impacted ensuring that each Member State impacted would take a fair share of the pain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041800066#WRP03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":616,"content":"<p>Question No. 224 answered with Question No. 215.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Identification Schemes","counter":617,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041800067#WRQ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":618,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[18289\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041800067#WRQ00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on a proposal (details supplied)","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":619,"content":"<p>The farmer data accessible to Food Business Operators (FBO) from my\u00a0 Department's Animal Identification Movement System (AIM) is limited to what is required under Council Regulation (EC) No 1760\/2000 to ensure traceability. \u00a0Traceability details of these animals, all of which are also available on the unique bovine passport that accompanies each\u00a0animal,\u00a0include the date of birth, breed, gender, and disease history.<\/p><p>Historical aggregated data on the bovine herd population is published in my Department&rsquo;s annual AIM reports across a range of metrics:<\/p><p><i><font color=\"#0000FF\"><\/font><\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041800067#WRQ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Carcase Disposal","counter":620,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041800067#WRQ00800"},{"type":"question","counter":621,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[18290\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041800067#WRQ00900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason farmers are not paid for the fifth quarter, that is, the remaining pieces of an animal carcase that are not used for meat production and which processors use for export business.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":622,"content":"<p>I\u00a0am very conscious of the role played by livestock farming in sustaining the rural economy and rural communities across Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the current challenges facing beef farmers in particular, with a sustained period of low prices, following on from additional costs last year arising from the unprecedented weather events, and with significant Brexit uncertainty still overhanging the sector.<\/p>  <p>  However, as Minister,\u00a0I cannot intervene directly in any commodity price, including in relation to meat offals.

to provide affordable, flexible financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or who will be in the future - at least 40% of which will be available to agrifood and seafood businesses.<\/p>  <p>  Our enterprise agencies are continuing to work with seafood companies to help them to deal with Brexit through making them more competitive, diversifying market exposure, and up-skilling teams.<\/p>  <p>  My priority has been, and remains, to maintain existing levels of access to waters and resources.\u00a0 However, in a worst case scenario of a disorderly departure we can expect that those reciprocal arrangements\u00a0will \u00a0be impacted, at least in the very short term.<\/p>  <p>  In recent months, I have continued to have\u00a0regular meetings with my European colleagues, especially those from the group of 8 Coastal Member States whose fisheries are potentially most impacted by the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU, as well as the European Commission.\u00a0 I am also working closely with key stakeholders in the Irish fishing industry and am pleased at the level of unity on these key issues.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The EU has\u00a0adopted two contingency measures in the area of fisheries to cover all scenarios under a no-deal Brexit. On the one hand, the EU has created the appropriate legal framework in a no-Deal Brexit situation\u00a0to allow UK vessels reciprocal access to EU waters throughout 2019, if the UK grants such access to EU vessels in its waters. On the other hand, the EU has also adjusted the eligibility criteria of the Fisheries and Maritime Fund, to ensure that fishermen who have to cease their activities &ndash; in case the UK does not grant continued access to its waters &ndash; can receive compensation. In such a case, it would be essential that Member States adopt a coordinated approach to ensure a level-playing field between EU fishermen in different Member States and to protect marine resources.<\/p>  <p>  The EU Commission last week issued a Brexit Contingency Plan, agreed with Ireland and seven other impacted Member States, which sets out how fisheries would be managed in a no-deal Brexit.\u00a0\u00a0It identifies the need for mitigation measures and, in particular, compensation for temporary tie up of fishing vessels.\u00a0 It gives the EU Commission a strong co-ordination role.<\/p>  <p>  This communication reflects the high level of planning by Ireland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden working closely with DG Mare.\u00a0 When I met Commissioner Vella last February, I emphasised the real risks of a concentration of fishing into\u00a0 Ireland&rsquo;s 200 miles fishing zone by EU fleets if they\u00a0are excluded from UK waters.\u00a0 I pointed out that inevitably this would lead to displacement of our own fleet and depletion of fish stocks if no action is taken.<\/p>  <p>  I stressed to the Commissioner the need for a European approach to addressing this issue and agreed with him that the key Member States and DG Mare needed to put in place a contingency plan.\u00a0 I have been working intensively over recent weeks, and have kept the fishing industry informed of the work to ensure that we are ready for this worst case situation, while always hoping that we will never need to call upon these plans.<\/p>  <p>  We now have identified and agreed, co-ordinated and fully prepared measures that will be immediately available to address\u00a0a no-deal Brexit situation, if the UK were to decide to deny EU vessels access to UK waters.\u00a0 I am seeking additional EU funds to support this mitigation measure if they become necessary. If we need to call on these arrangements, it will be essential, as we have now agreed at EU level, that all involved EU\u00a0fleets must co-operate under these structured arrangements to manage the situation. We have now agreed that the\u00a0Irish\u00a0fleet\u00a0would\u00a0not be disproportionately impacted and have ensured that each Member State impacted would take a fair share of the pain.<\/p>  <p>  However, we remain firmly of the view that the best way to ensure an orderly withdrawal and fully protect the Good Friday Agreement, is to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement.\u00a0\u00a0A disorderly departure, that included a loss of access to UK waters, would have very serious consequence for our seafood industry.\u00a0 I am satisfied that, in cooperation with our stakeholders and EU partners, we are doing all that we can to plan to mitigate the potential impacts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041800067#WRQ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Eligibility","counter":629,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041800067#WRQ01700"},{"type":"question","counter":630,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[18326\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041800067#WRQ01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if farmers whose agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, contracts have expired will be enabled to participate in GLAS; if the scheme will be reopened for such applicants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":631,"content":"<p>The Green Low-Carbon Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS) opened in three tranches commencing in 2015 following the closure of the Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS).\u00a0 All AEOS participants were given the\u00a0option of joining the GLAS scheme should they have wished to do so.\u00a0 The GLAS scheme is now fully subscribed with GLAS 3 participants in their third year of participation in the five year GLAS scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Agri-environment policy is included in the\u00a0CAP reform negotiations\u00a0currently under way and any future schemes will be dependent on the outcome of these negotiations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041800067#WRQ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agrifood Sector","counter":632,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041800067#WRQ02000"},{"type":"question","counter":633,"qnumday":230,"qnumall":"[18327\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041800067#WRQ02100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the outcome of the most recent discussions he has had at EU level on the need to relax state aid rules and have adequate measures in place to assist the agrifood sector in the event of severe market disturbance arising from Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":634,"content":"<p>I have recently\u00a0held bilateral discussions with Commissioner Hogan on the economic impact of Brexit, including on the margins of the\u00a0Council of Agriculture Ministers\u00a0in Brussels on 18 March. I have stressed the need to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the impact on the sector, including through traditional\u00a0EU market supports and exceptional aid provisions under the CAP's Single Common Market Organisation regulation, as well as through increased flexibility under State Aid regulations.\u00a0 Commissioner Hogan has confirmed\u00a0that the EU is ready to respond positively, and my officials remain\u00a0in regular contact with Commission officials in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting on 18 March was an important opportunity to highlight to the Council, the Commission and to my fellow Ministers, the impacts of a no-deal Brexit on the agrifood sector in Ireland and the\u00a0potential knock-on effects across the EU market as a whole.\u00a0 During the discussion on the meat market, I outlined the exposure of the Irish beef sector in particular and called for the full suite of measures available under the Common Market Organisation, including targeted support for farmers, to be deployed rapidly in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\u00a0 I also referred to the need to protect the EU beef sector in trade discussions with Mercosur, against the background of the significant uncertainty arising from Brexit.\u00a0 In addition, I\u00a0highlighted the exposure of the Irish fisheries sector, and the need for careful joint EU management of fisheries resources, as well as financial supports for fishermen and their communities.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this week, at the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Luxembourg, I followed up these efforts with a further call for acknowledgment of the impact of Brexit\u00a0on the beef sector through the making available of exceptional aid for the sector, despite the avoidance of a hard Brexit on 12 April.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to State Aid, I welcome the recent announcement by the European Commission, with effect from 14 March 2019, that the maximum threshold limits under the agriculture de minimis regulation will increase.\u00a0\u00a0Under the revised rules, aid of up to &euro;20,000 can be paid to a beneficiary on a rolling three year basis i.e. the current fiscal year and the two previous fiscal years.\u00a0 Once a beneficiary has reached this limit they may not receive any further aid in excess of this limit under de minimis rules within the rolling time period.<\/p>  <p>  In order to avoid any potential distortion of competition, each EU Member State has a maximum national limit, which they cannot exceed. \u00a0Under the revised rules, Member States' national ceiling is increased to 1.25% of their annual agricultural output over the same three-year period.\u00a0 This represents a 25% increase in the national ceiling.<\/p>  <p>  The revised rules permit a Member State to increase the individual de minimis aid limit up to &euro;25,000, once the Member State does not spend more than 50% of its total national aid envelope on one particular agricultural sector.\u00a0 In these circumstances, the national limit is increased to 1.5% of the annual output.\u00a0 This represents a 66% increase in the ceiling per farmer and a 50% increase in the national ceiling.<\/p>  <p>  This increase in threshold of de minimis aid will allow for greater flexibility and efficiency, notably in times of crisis and situations demanding a swift response by the public authorities.<\/p>  <p>  I have said that the State will not be found wanting when it comes to supporting the Irish agrifood sector and farmers to\u00a0deal with the impact of\u00a0Brexit.\u00a0 The increase in the agriculture de minimis limits is a very important first step in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department, working in close co-operation with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Enterprise Ireland, has received approval from the EU Commission for an Irish state aid application, allowing an Irish company to receive state aid funding for the diversification of its activities.

This has included the significant development and growth of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). The response team within the NCSC gained international accreditation in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSC works with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces and other Departments and State Agencies in relation to the security of IT infrastructure and critical national infrastructure. The operational details of these activities are not made public for security reasons<\/p>  <p>  Moreover, since the transposition of the EU Network and Information Security Directive last year, the NCSC has a series of formal powers around the security of a range of critical national infrastructure, including a set of binding security requirements and an incident reporting requirement. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is leading in the development of a new National Cyber Security Strategy and chairs a Steering Group with representation across a number of Government Departments. A public consultation on the Strategy was launched on 19 March 2019 and will remain open until 1 May. This public consultation poses a series of questions around how we might better (1) protect critical national Infrastructure and services from Cyber Security related risks, (2) develop our skills base and industrial capacity in this field, and (3) engage nationally and internationally on cyber security matters, both to build awareness and to ensure that our international policy position takes cognisance of developments in cyber security. My Department has also established 5 expert stakeholder groups to comment on the various aspects of cyber security policy to ensure that the Strategy process is fully informed by a mix of public, private sector and academic expertise. These groups have already met once, and will meet again after the public consultation phase is completed. The new strategy will be in place mid-year.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041800067#WRQ04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies Data","counter":656,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041800068#WRR00200"},{"type":"question","counter":657,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[18227\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019041800068#WRR00300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the State agencies and bodies under the remit of his Department; the location of each such body by county; and the number of full and part-time persons employed in each such body.","asker":"1335","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":658,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following table.

Local authorities may facilitate the phased payment of contributions, such as when units are completed or when a stage is reached in the development. <\/p><p>In order to avoid inconsistencies in recognising income and the raising of invoices that would be unlikely to be collected in the near future, a pragmatic approach to accounting for income has been adopted. When a commencement notice is received, contributions collectable within the next 12 months are usually treated as income and a short-term debtor is raised. Those contributions not deemed collectable in the next 12 months are treated as deferred income, with potential debtors not collectable in the next 12 months being treated as long-term debtors. Deferred income is treated as a long-term creditor and is matched against Long-term development contribution debtors in the Annual Financial Statement (AFS).\u00a0 This accounting treatment acknowledges that long-term debtors are not income in the current period, and they may or may not become due depending on the progress of the development and are thus deferred to future periods. <\/p><p>Local Authorities operate on an accrual accounting basis and recognise income and expenditure as incurred, regardless of the cash transactions.

The AFS does not separately report long-term debtors and deferred income but effectively nets these off. The rationale for this change was to address the misinterpretation of the data.
